	Change for the best                  
	Sir  The editorial, Change to nowhere (Jan 2), has aptly summed up the interview of Amartya Sen on Christmas Day (At 10, into the twenties, Jan 1). I fully agree with Sens view that unless the people of West Bengal decide what form of change they want, the state will remain as it is, despite a change of guard. The two most important aspects of a meaningful transformation would be a modification of the present method of land acquisition for industrial development, and the tackling and curbing of Maoist activity.          
	Sen has posed two very important questions to the people of Bengal  where do they want to go from here, and what type of change do they want? It is obvious that the people are wary of the ruling government and want to do away with it. The reasons behind this are simple. The government has been in a moribund state for a long time, and has nothing new to offer to the people. West Bengal has fallen behind in education, land reforms, industrial development, disaster management and so on. Separatist movements have gained momentum in the state, and the overall scenario does appear very encouraging.          
	The Opposition is gaining ground by offering the hope of change. But it has not elaborated on the blueprint of the change it hopes to bring about. The people have the right to know how they are going to benefit from the alterations. Unless the Opposition has a concrete plan of action to improve things in future, the run-up to the assembly elections may prove to be turbulent for the Trinamul Congress.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Prabhakar Bhattacharya, 
Ichapore, North 24 Parganas      
	Sir  Amartya Sens interview was enlightening. His opinions on global warming and international politics were balanced, honest and enriching. But with regard to West Bengal, he seemed to be partial towards the ruling Left Front government. When the people of West Bengal seem to have decided to vote a political party other than the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to power in the forthcoming assembly elections, Sen suggests that the voters first analyse that partys capability in all matters of governance. Why did he not give this essential advice when the Left Front got elected to power year after year in West Bengal despite non-performance and indiscipline? The voters of Bengal seem to have decided to reject the Left Front after three long decades. They want a different party to come to power now. Once it is elected, it will be up to the new government to prove its mettle.          
	If Sen is indeed a supporter of liberty and democracy, why does he not have any confidence in the choice of the voters of Bengal? Even if a new government fails in its efforts, at least the ruling government would be removed. The process might even help the state get back a better Left Front government, purged of its present defects.          
	Sens effort to project the protests in Singur as anti-industry is also not justified. It was actually a movement against the unquestioning submission to the ruling party. All these years, the CPI(M) has had supreme control over the government of West Bengal. It has the final say in all matters of governance. The Singur movement was the peoples reaction against the all-pervading control of the CPI(M).                    
	Yours faithfully,      
D.P. Ghatak, 
  Durgapur
                  
	Sir  Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, the winner of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2009, said at the annual convocation ceremony of the University of Madras: Just because you are a Nobel winner, people expect words of wisdom from you, not realising that you are an expert only in a small, focused area of science (Laureates can walk too, Dec 23). Such modesty is exceptional. One wishes that the Nobel laureate from Bengal, Amartya Sen, held similar beliefs.           
	In his interview, Sen seems to be trying to defend the West Bengal governments efforts to acquire land in Singur. He wondered if a mere change in the political party in power would ensure the return of law and order in the state. If a change in political power means nothing, is holding elections a waste of public money? There is no reason to assume that the voters are not mature enough to decide whom they want to vote for.          
	Sen has encouraged the government to take good decisions, even if they turn out to be unpleasant ones for certain sections of society. But who should decide what is good? The Singur project did not fail because of the peoples aversion to industrialization. There was a marked lack of transparency in the dealings of the ruling government, and this made people suspicious. In a democracy, ambiguities in public dealings cannot be tolerated.          
	Yours faithfully,

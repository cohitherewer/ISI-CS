The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Reflections on an unnatural death
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        REFLECTIONS ON AN UNNATURAL DEATH                              By declaring multiculturalism dead, the German Chancellor has admitted to a political and social failure, writes Elisa T.

	Having explained to a friend from Calcutta, in Berlin, the meaning of the acronym CDU  Christian Democratic Union, the party currently ruling Germany in a coalition with the neo-liberal Free Democratic Party  I was embarrassed by his reaction of surprise. Its strange that a major party in a country like Germany still carries this legacy, dont you think? he commented, while we were walking amidst trees in their autumnal colours. As an Italian, I know too well how clear the line of demarcation between religion and democracy could be. My thoughts run to the Sundays in my hometown, when the squares bustle with elderly men talking about politics, the days newspaper under their arms, animated by the priests more-or-less explicit electoral advice. Yet, not only in Italy, but also in Germany, the State is deeply intertwined with the Church and its principles, whose validity in producing the basic values of society is nowadays being endorsed doggedly. This translates, among others things, into the obligation, for each baptized citizen (whether Catholic or Protestant), to devolve a part of his or her income to the Church.         
	Early this year, the election of a Muslim woman with a Turkish background as minister for social affairs in one of Germanys most populous and prosperous federal states provoked pathetic discussions on the basic values of German society. Pathetic, because centred on religious identity, which, vis--vis the pretension of secularism, cannot but sound paradoxical, if not embarrassing. After the candidate minister, herself a member of the CDU, referred to the necessity to foster equal treatment of religions in Germanys public sphere, she was faced with a monition by her party colleagues and forced to apologize publicly for her declarations. On the day of her nomination, Aygl zkan swore her fidelity to the State by appealing for gods help, although for Muslim citizens entering a public role with a vow in the name of the Quran is normally accepted.         
	The struggle with multiculturalism  which I treat as inclusive of multi-religiosity  can also be sensed outside the Christian Democratic Union. Thilo Sarrazin, a prominent member of the Opposition socialist party SPD, recently made waves with a book in which he literally declared war not only against immigration, but also against immigrants. The latter are accused of bringing about the degeneration of Germanys intellectual and biological heritage, and a deep hatred is reserved for immigrants of the Muslim faith. Against the background of this nervous atmosphere, the recent declaration by Angela Merkel, leader of the CDU and German chancellor, that multiculturalism has failed in Germany is far more than the stubborn pronouncement of a conservative statesperson lacking the capacity to confront ongoing social transformations (and blatantly lying when declaring that Germany was no land for immigration). It is an admission of political and social failure revealing that the difficulty of what was at stake had been underestimated for too long.        
	For around fifty years  that is, from the beginning of the flow of immigrants to West Germany in the 1950s and 60s following the economic boom  Germany ignored its status of being a country that attracted, and needed, immigration. Unawareness of the long-term implications of the immigration of labourers from countries like Italy, Greece and Turkey may have been justified in those days, considering the novelty of the phenomenon. The workers, employed by contract via bilateral agreements, were initially expected to stay for limited periods and were accordingly called Gastarbeiter or guest workers. However, in the course of the years, the spread of wealth kept the guests within Germany, and new immigrants started arriving from more distant countries, without bilateral contracts and often fleeing from poverty or war.         
	Over the 1970s and the 80s, while the term, Gastarbeiter, progressively took on a negative connotation  reflecting a basic and mutual unpreparedness to encounter the foreign that, at times, took the form of violent racist outbursts  the necessity to tackle the challenge represented by a pluralizing society was largely ignored by politicians of all groups. Indeed, since the 1970s, civil societys claims for the acknowledgement of individual diversity and freedom, and for a multikulti or multicultural society, ensured a comparatively open and tolerant socio-political understanding. Yet, nobody touched upon the central issue of identity  too dangerous for its alleged vicinity to nationalist rhetoric, too complex and potentially fracturing for political movements, which are knowingly dependent on the production of one collective identity. There were no debates on identity to highlight that each social agent can have various identities within various communities and situations, while contributing to a common society. So publicly talking about the slow but steady demographic changes at the silent roots of that society remained a taboo.        
	It was not before the mid-1990s that the enduring gap between German and immigrant groups within society, together with the latters disadvantaged situation in terms of access to information, education and employment (in spite of obtaining German citizenship), attracted political attention. Under the slogan of integration, later substituted by the postmodern term diversity, the idea of multicultural coexistence in a secular society began to be created. Yet, both the delay of action on the political side and the lack of trust and will on the part of the target groups are making this endeavour a very hard task. Angela Merkel, in her typical uninspiring, sterile pragmatism, may have just realized and expressed this fact.               
	Multikulti did not contemplate superior tolerance as a means to such a goal, nor the politicians notion of integration as flattening individuality and diversity, nor the ignorance supported by segregation with which a country like India manages its own multiculturalism, nor global values spreading via corporate advertisement, MTV and Facebook. Rather, Multikulti consisted in a call for liberated and liberal ways of life in a society based on reciprocal acceptance and shared by cosmopolitan citizens. Its strength has been diluted by subsequent efforts to define the cultures and fix the rules for their coexistence. Answering Merkel, in Germany as elsewhere in the world (and here India does not seem to constitute an exception), Multikulti did not fail because of its own inherent deficiencies. And  bad news for Chancellor Merkel  a willingness to rethink predetermined social and cultural models, and a steady refusal to assume that the status quo cannot be changed, could revive it still.

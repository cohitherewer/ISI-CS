	Saying no to the government is part of an Oppositions game everywhere. But it becomes a completely different game if the Opposition does only that. Mamata Banerjee obviously believes that it is not enough to be utterly uncompromising and even combative while dealing with the Left Front government in West Bengal. She would simply not engage with the government on anything. The way she snubbed and abused Gautam Deb, the housing minister, who invited her to a government function, marks a new low in the states political culture. She and her party, the Trinamul Congress, have been practically boycotting the government wherever possible. Ms Banerjee is not only the leader of the main Opposition party in the state, but she is also an important minister in the Union government. She has made the railway ministrys activities and functions in West Bengal out of bounds for the ministers and leaders of the ruling Front. This is political intolerance at its worst. Yet, Ms Banerjee has always accused the leftists of stifling the Oppositions voice during their long reign. There is a lot of truth in her complaint, but that is precisely the reason why she should tread a different path.        
	This is not simply a matter of political decorum. At stake is the larger question of the future of democratic rule and of political freedom. In West Bengals sharply polarized political culture, this open exhibition of intolerance and belligerence by leaders can be used as an excuse for violence and lawlessness. The murderous clashes between the Marxists and TMC supporters in the districts show how dangerous the situation already is. Ms Banerjee has a real reason for crying halt to this culture of intolerance. She stands a realistic chance of becoming the next chief minister if her party and its ally, the Congress, live up to their recent electoral promises. What she now hopes to gain by such obstructionist politics could boomerang on her if she assumes power. It is possible that the leftists, even out of power, will have enough strength to make trouble. More important, such a scenario can further darken the states economic horizon. Investors cannot be expected to flock to West Bengal if violence and ugly political confrontations continue even after a change of government. Ms Banerjees ways suggest that the regime may change in West Bengal, but not the political culture.

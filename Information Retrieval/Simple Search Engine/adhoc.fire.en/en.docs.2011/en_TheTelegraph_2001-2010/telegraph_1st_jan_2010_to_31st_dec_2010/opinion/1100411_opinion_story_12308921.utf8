	Left in the dark                  
	Sir  The West Bengal government claims that the state has made significant progress in electricity generation, but the ground reality is very different. Most areas in North Bengal are reeling under power cuts and things have got worse with the rise in temperatures. One wonders whether villages and cities in the state will ever enjoy an uninterrupted power supply. It seems that West Bengal is too big to be run by one government. Is this why there are now frequent demands to carve out new states from Bengal?           
	Yours faithfully,        Abhisek Narjinary, Jalpaiguri
                  
	Failed plans          
	Sir  Farmers woes (April 5), by S.L. Rao, reveals that no concrete plan exists in India for the betterment of the agricultural sector. Rao has shown how the failure of the States policies has created a void in Indian agriculture. The only remedy is to let farmers explore local resources and empower themselves directly in the free market. The State should restrict its subsidies to building infrastructure for the impoverished farmers. Rich farmers have taken undue advantage of the subsidies provided by the State. It seems that the government does not have the will to stop this misuse.          
	The State must take proper care of the poor farmers. For this, it needs to have a policy in place to decide what kind of farmers should be given priority regarding subsidies. It also needs to identify those farmers who live below subsistence level. Subsidies will remain an essential factor for Indian agriculture. But while providing them, the State must choose wisely to assist farmers so that the system of granting subsidies can be done away with completely at some point in the future. Farmers will then be able to compete in the international market on their own.          
	Yours faithfully,        R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly            
	Sir  The most promising sector of the Indian economy is agriculture. Unfortunately, it suffers a lot owing to the lack of foresight on the part of policymakers and the dearth of education among farmers. People who are not equipped with modern technology are engaged in agriculture in this country. Being financially backward, they fail to purchase the necessary equipment. Institutions that provide training and technology are based in urban areas, making it difficult for farmers to acquire proper guidance. Farmers get limited assistance from the government, such as soil-testing facilities, fertilizers, subsidized seeds and so on.          
	Agriculture, which employs millions, is run in a primitive manner. Cultivation remains vulnerable to natures vagaries. Moreover, agro-industries and agricultural products do not receive proper encouragement from the government. India does not have a long-term agricultural policy. The government seems to be content with providing subsidies to farmers. It also does not have a substantive plan to bring more tracts under the irrigation system. Good seeds are unavailable, and farmers have to buy seeds at high prices. Indian agriculture should be turned into a robust industry. Only then will farmers lead a decent life.          
	Yours faithfully.         Subrata Pal, Karimpur, Nadia

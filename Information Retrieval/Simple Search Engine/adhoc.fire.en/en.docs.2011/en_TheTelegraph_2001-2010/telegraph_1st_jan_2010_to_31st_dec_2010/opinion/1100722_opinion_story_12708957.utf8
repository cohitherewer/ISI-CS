The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | No time to ignore the writing on the wall
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO TIME TO IGNORE THE WRITING ON THE WALL                              If the ruling Left Front government is forced to sit in the Opposition after the 2011 assembly polls, it might get a chance to forge newer and stronger bonds with the people, writes Shyamal Datta                                                
	In a marked departure from the past, the 33rd anniversary of the Left Front government in West Bengal, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), was observed in a low key. The giant shadow of three successive electoral defeats since 2008 loomed large to make the celebrations, organized at the Netaji Indoor Stadium in Calcutta on June 21, lacklustre.        
	Earlier, newspapers nationwide used to carry a full page write-up on that day, highlighting the achievements of the Left Front government. This practice was rightly described as a unique feat in a multi-party democracy. Such beating of ones own drum looked rather audacious, especially at a time when there is a chorus of strident criticism all around.        
	At the latest meeting, the chief minister used his oratorial skills to convince his party leaders that all was not lost yet. There was still a year to regain lost ground and retain power in the 2011 assembly elections. He exhorted that the mistakes, which alienated sections of the poor, underprivileged and minorities from the party, should be rectified with all humility, speed and sincerity in order to woo these supporters back into the partys fold. The CPI(M) state secretary sounded hollow when he navely attributed the electoral reverses to the money and muscle power of the adversaries. He failed to realize that by saying so, he only showed disrespect to those people who, in their wisdom, had chosen to vote against the Left.        
	The mind cloistered in dogma was in full view when the chief minister ridiculed the Oppositions slogan of change. In a boastful manner, he averred that the CPI(M)-led Left Front powered the vehicle of change in the fields of agriculture, land reform, local self-governance, investment, industrialization, and so on. Therefore, the change that was being trumpeted by the Opposition undermined the changes already effected on the ground and extended an invitation to anarchy. He cautioned leaders of the Left Front, asking them to go all out warning the people of the sinister designs of the Opposition to create panic, terror and chaos in West Bengal.              
	Implicit in the warning was a disguised threat of the revival of the lawless days of yesteryear in the state in the event of the exit of the Left Front government from office. For a mind cast in the Stalinist mould, and for a political formation that has ruled for over 33 years without any break, the prospect of sitting in the Opposition has become unbearable. It has made the battle in 2011 a do-or-die for the party. The CPI(M) refuses to believe that the people who have reposed their faith in its government for seven consecutive terms  a unique feat in the history of parliamentary democracy  have now made up their mind for a change in a year from now.        
	The long years in power have made the Marxists complacent and overlook the inner contradictions that came up on account of a serious mismatch between the ideology of a highly-regimented, cadre-based party and the tenets of a multi-party democracy. They denied space to the voices of dissent. Everything was viewed through the coloured prism of the party. Consequently, an insolent mindset has set in the party hierarchy, showing utter disdain for the idea of change as a prelude to adapting to the fast-changing socio-political and economic dynamics of the state. The party failed to appreciate that change is a sign of life, a catalyst to progress, that it cannot be monopolized by any individual, group or party.        
	It is time that the Marxists exorcised the ghost of Stalin from their minds and accepted, without any reservations, that they have incurred a huge trust deficit with the people. Over the years, an overwhelming section of the population has come to view the party as over-politicized, highhanded and partisan.The big-brotherly attitude of the party, exacerbated by the misrule of the government, has made the Left Front vulnerable. People resent the politicization of every walk of life. The brazen manner in which party satraps dominate the lives of the common people and dictate the instruments of governance at different levels has shaken peoples faith in the neutrality of the administration. No wonder, the government has come to be known as of the party, for the party and by the party. This has become unbearable for the saner sections of people in the state.              
	The CPI(M) suffers from a serious problem of perception. A sizeable section of the people, as revealed by the recent elections, has got disenchanted with the party and the government for a host of reasons. These people feel that the party has lost confidence to continue in office. It must, therefore, quit with grace and dignity. The management of adverse perception is not easy. It requires specialized knowledge and expertise to deal with its varied nuances, tangible and intangible. What has made the management of the popular perception of the CPI(M)s image complex is the fact that people have known the party and seen its functionaries at different levels from close quarters for far too long. It is because of this that the promise of better conduct by the party appears less credible. In sharp contrast, the unknown, waiting in the wings to wear the mantle of power for the first time, has given rise to hopes of a better tomorrow. This is a dream that is selling better than memories that have turned sour.              
	The task of bridging the deficit gap is time consuming. The year that is left before the elections is woefully inadequate to make any meaningful change to a situation that has gone from bad to worse, bringing down the morale of the party activists to its lowest. The CPI(M)-led Left Front needs to embark on confidence-building measures, focus less on politics and ideology, and more on welfare, growth, development and security with a human face. It has to shift gear from party first to people first in order to make society more inclusive. The platform that the role of the Opposition provides allows space, time and opportunity to re-engage with the people and forge new bonds of togetherness above party lines. Any attempt to destabilize the government that the peoples mandate might bring to power after 34 long years in 2011 could prove to be suicidal. Political wisdom lies in sustained action, based on lessons drawn from the mistakes of the past, and in performing the role of the Opposition in a constructive and responsible manner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Indias Untold stories
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        INDIAS UNTOLD STORIES                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	To turn away from the horror stories that we see on television, I decided to watch a six-hour documentary film made by a perceptive Englishman, Michael Wood, on our great and ancient civilization. The shameful truth is that we never release enough funds for Indian documentary filmmakers to research in the great libraries of the world, travel extensively, and create fine films about our past and present. New generations have no reference points about the nuanced complexities of our history. We do not have a National Library in Delhi, nor any museum or archive that does justice to our extraordinary heritage. It required BBC to initiate a great film that tells the amazing story of India, one that will make every Indian proud.        
	In the end, it is pride that mobilizes a people, a nation, to overcome the many odds and hurdles, to make correctives, lay new fundamentals, adjust the existing structures to prosper and move on by discarding all the demeaning baggage, which, like fungus, tends to cling onto the body politic, spreading its poison. Why are governments, both state and Central, so careless about our cultural institutions? Why have we become enemies of our legacy? Maybe the rabble-rousing, intolerant and polarized nationalism that we encounter when our art galleries, movie theatres and other public spaces are attacked for exposing that which the political dispensations have a quarrel with, has come of age because the diverse national cultural space has been allowed to wither away. We need to address this very basic problem.        
	The entire spectrum of Indians, in their plural splendour of different faiths, speaking different languages, from different strata and communities, need to feel rooted and secure in their collective space. Intrinsically, Indians do feel they belong but successive governments have paid scant attention to all the aspects of this civilization that make it strong and tolerant.                
	Gross neglect        
	Instead of ensuring economic security and conserving the treasure of diversity, the State, and its functionaries destroyed all that they were incapable of comprehending and asserted a suffocating stranglehold on India. Today, we have come to the edge of that scary path and a free-fall from the precipice could do irreparable damage.        
	I recall a time when secretaries of the government of India, educated in the liberal arts, with wide-ranging interests and knowledge, intervened to break through unnecessary red tape to get things done. Their political masters too were of similar ilk. Despite the usual attacks, the Festivals of India overseas, orchestrated by Pupul Jayakar with the full support of the then prime minister, represented the best of India on the world stage at a point in our history when we were seen as a third world nation. The festivals revived much that was lying dormant, gave dignity to skill and tested traditions, and generated pride regardless of our economic status. Those days have drifted into oblivion.        
	Governments must renew the pride we once had in 1947. They must cease to find excuses for not being able to deliver structural changes. This business of always waiting to sign protocols, passing endless files from one department to the other as legitimate procrastination, keeping civil society and experts out because of their various specializations, always having a negative answer that is bound to frustrate, has debilitated what could have been manifestations of Indias strength  its legacy industries, its philosophies and sciences that the world of today is looking to use. Lack of pride has made us desperate to ape the worst of the richer nations, ignoring our own cultural strengths which, when the markets are down, keep India afloat.

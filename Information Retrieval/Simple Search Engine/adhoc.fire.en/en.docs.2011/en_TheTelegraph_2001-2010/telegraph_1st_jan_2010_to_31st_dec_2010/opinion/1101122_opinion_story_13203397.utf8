	The finance minister of West Bengal has lately begun to behave strangely. A brilliant economist before his political graduation, he brought a revolutionary innovation to public finance: he abolished the distinction between revenue and capital budget. Money is there to be spent; it matters not how it was raised. If taxation is theft, so is borrowing; it does not matter how the undeserving are fleeced. With this innovation, balancing the budget became childs play; as long as the finance minister could find some idiot who was prepared to lend to him, he could go on spending. And as long as the borrowings covered the excess of expenditure over revenue, his budget was in surplus  by his own definition, anyway. It was seldom in surplus even by his definition, but that is nitpicking.        
	Thus in 2008-09, the state government under his guidance spent Rs 702 billion. It received Rs 678 billion, of which tax revenue paid for only Rs 257 billion. So-called non-tax revenue  irrigation charges, rent paid by the central government for godowns and so on  came to another Rs 50 billion. More than half the governments expenditure was uncovered by income of any sort. Where then did the finance minister find the money? He borrowed Rs 248 billion from sources unspecified; probably the Reserve Bank forced banks to give loans to the state. He made the West Bengal electricity board borrow another Rs 50 billion for power stations, and appropriated it for his budget. The remaining Rs 73 billion came from here and there. These were his figures; when the comptroller-general of accounts from the Central government audited his accounts, he found tax revenue of only Rs 144 billion. He also found that the state received Rs 113 billion as a share of Central excise duties, which Asim Dasgupta had forgotten to show in his budget papers. The accounts for the subsequent years are just as convoluted and meant to confound; but each year the state spent far more than it earned, and filled the gap from here and there without counting what it owed.        
	This progressive finance minister, who never cared where the money came from, is now seeking to raise revenue. On November 12 he raised value-added tax on what he called luxuries; three days later he raised liquor duties. Why this sudden change of tactic? Why can he not continue to send the bills to Delhi? The only possible answer is that the Centre has chosen to dishonour his IOUs. His hopes are not entirely dashed. The Union finance minister has a heart of gold. He has been at the receiving end of his West Bengal counterparts cris de coeur; they may even melt his heart. But it would be a mistake for Mr Dasgupta to go back to his old spendthrift ways. It is time for him to learn the difference between revenue and capital.

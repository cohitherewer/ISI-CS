                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MYSTERIOUS WAYS                                                                  
	The river is a strong brown god, wrote T.S. Eliot in The Dry Salvages of Four Quartets, sullen, untamed and intractable. If Sudipto Dey had read Eliot, he would have agreed with the poet. Dey and his father, Dwarik,a wizened old man, run the ferry service at the Uttarpara kheyaghat. Each day, the bhutbhutis  mechanized boats that can carry 80-100 passengers  ferry men, women and children across the one-mile stretch from Uttarpara to Ariadaha. The journey across the sullen, brown waters takes not more than seven minutes and each passenger is charged two rupees for the ride. At the end of a good day  that stretches from sunrise to 10.30 at night, with a break for lunch in the afternoon  father and son take home a little over thousand rupees.        
	Like the gods, the river is a giver of life. (Dwarik and his young son cannot conceive of a life without it.) But, occasionally, it brings with it death and destruction. More than 20 years ago, a boat had capsized on the Hooghly near Rishra, killing 12 people. Such accidents are not infrequent by any means. Recently, in Kolaghat, lives were lost when an overcrowded boat capsized on the mighty Rupnarayan.        
	The human agency behind such fatalities is undeniable. Boats sink because boatmen are often allowed (or coerced, as was the case in Kolaghat) to take on passengers beyond the vessels capacity. But the untamed waters are deceptive as well, and they often speak a language that cannot be comprehended by even experienced boatmen.        
	The strength of the water rises and falls with the tides. During the bhora kotal  when the currents are the strongest and the most dangerous  fishermen whisper silent prayers before they set sail on the waters touched by the silver light of the moon. If a mishap were to take place then, even a skilled swimmer would find it difficult to survive the currents. Wild waves and winds strike and drown boats during storms. Then there are the lurking sandbars. There have been incidents in which country boats and dinghies have drowned after hitting one of these sandy stretches. But equally treacherous is the mist that hangs like a cloak in the cold season. The fog on a river is a few times denser than the one on land, and can be as fatal as the tides and the storms. Collisions between boats are not unheard of at this time of the year.        
	But can the brown god be tamed so as to lower the number of accidents? Dwarik feels that little can be done apart from ensuring that the standard safety procedures are being implemented at the ghats. The municipality can also take greater care to ease the rivers burden: dredging the accumulated silt, opening the clogged hydrants and minimizing pollution in the water can perhaps appease the temperamental deity.        
	But even then, a good boatman will always need to scan the seemingly calm surface. For the river god moves in mysterious ways.

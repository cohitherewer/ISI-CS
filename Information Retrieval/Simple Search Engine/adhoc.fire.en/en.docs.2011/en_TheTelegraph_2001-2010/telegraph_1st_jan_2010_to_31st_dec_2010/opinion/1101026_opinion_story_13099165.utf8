	Political leaders, once cast in stone, become terribly vulnerable creatures. They are supposed to absorb the first shock of any political challenge that is mounted. It is doubtful if the attack on Rajiv Gandhis statue in Chennai will signal the beginnings of a political tussle, but there can be little doubt that it is the result of a political game which is yet to grow into a public spectacle. The alleged perpetrators of the mischief are the supporters of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, a party that has steadfastly batted for the cause of the Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka, but has never been able to acquire the political weightage necessary for its voice to be heard. Minor parties in Tamil Nadu have always used their caste following to wrest their share of the political pie. The VCK, in that sense, has not done badly since it has managed, with one member of parliament, to gain a seat at the high table  that is, the Centre. But like all other minor parties, the VCK also has to worry about its local image, which quite certainly has not been helped by its friendship with either the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam or the Congress. The forthcoming assembly elections next year has naturally made it restive. What is peculiar about the VCKs apparent rebellion against the Congress is its attempt to play up one state ally against the other. The VCK leader, Thol Thirumavalavan, is said to have instigated the DMK to break its alliance with the Congress, which, he alleges, is more dependent on the DMK than the DMK is on the Congress.         
	It is unlikely Mr Thirumavalavan would have risked his position in the United Progressive Alliance had there been no bigger incentive prompting him to do so at the state level. It could have been provided to him either by the DMK or the All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which has promised a dream alliance for 2011. It may well be the case that the DMK, as before, is using a smaller party to get back at the Congress, which seems to be turning its back on the ruling party in Tamil Nadu in the hope of getting a share of power in the next government. But the VCK may also be playing its own game of either massaging the DMKs hurt ego or giving out the right feelers to the AIADMK, in case it burns its bridges with the other biggies.

	It is perhaps in the essence of a creative mind to explore, innovate and expand its arena of pursuit. This creative urge does not allow an artist to feel comfortable and satisfied in a fixed format of expression. This restlessness to find her own expression based on her long-nurtured idiom and experience led Swagatalaxmi Dasgupta, a versatile singer, on to a new approach  her latest dance production, Chitrangada. Dasguptas love for experimentation has given us Ramayana, based on Tagore songs, in the past. However, this time, it was a more challenging attempt to stage Tagores Chitrangada by non-dancers (barring Anurekha Ghosh as Surupa Chitrangada, while Kurupa Chitrangada was portrayed by Swagatalaxmi herself).        
	Chosen from her Ekla Gitabitan, where she was the sole singer, Ashokerenu presented Chitrangada at Rabindra Sadan on July 7 to mark its 12th annual day. Dasgupta has every right and liberty to conceive, choreograph and compose her production in her own way, and innovation is always welcome. But one should also know the art of camouflaging the limitations and shortcomings of the participants by using interesting props, dramatic set and innovative costumes, specially when most of the performers were non-dancers.        
	Light design plays a pivotal part in any dance presentation. Through the illusion and dramatization of light, even a straight and prosaic walk can be transformed into graceful and lyrical movements. An artist like Dasgupta, who does not hesitate to experiment, could have done away with Arjun and Madan in her choreography. Was it necessary to bring forth these two characters on stage? Like her Ekla Gitabitan, this dance production could have been her solo presentation with minimum help from the group members.        
	However, the strong backbone of the entire production was Dasguptas immaculate singing. Starting from the inaugural song, Mohini maya elo, to Ami Chitrangada, she managed to charm the audience with her soulful singing. In her most notable renditions, her vocal skills were exquisite. Her narration and recitation were as good as her singing. Anurekha Ghosh, a Kathak dancer, as Surupa Chitrangada, did justice to her role with spontaneous movements and mature expressions. The limitations of the production could be overlooked because of the soul-stirring rendition of Bina saje saji dekha dibe tumi kobe.        
	Spread over three segments, the last part of the evening featured Dasguptas solo rendition of her own compositions based on traditional bandishes along with Tagore songs. Inspired by a live concert of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, where he played Raga Kirwani, Dasgupta composed Tomari bani sure bhara raat. She embellished this number, based on Raga Kirwani, with melodic motifs, and rendered it with powerful clarity. Tomari modhuro rupe touched the heart.

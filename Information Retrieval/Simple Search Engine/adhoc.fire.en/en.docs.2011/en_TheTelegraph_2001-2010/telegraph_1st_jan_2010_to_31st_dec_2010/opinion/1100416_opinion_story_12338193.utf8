	Solar																														 By Ian McEwan,   Jonathan Cape, Rs 550
    
	Ian McEwan seems to have little faith in his readers intelligence. Lest they fail to get it, he spends the first part of his novel, Solar, clarifying in great detail how obnoxious his leading character, Michael Beard, is. A Nobel laureate in physics, Beard is bald, short, fat, clever. He has a strange lifelong habit of marriage (in 2000, as the novel opens, Beards fifth marriage is in its last throes). He is a man of narrowed mental condition, anhedonic, monothematic, stricken, and compulsively unfaithful, changing lovers as one does clothes. He is also self-destructively addicted to salt-and-vinegar flavoured crisps in spite of severe obesity, and has no qualms about stealing the work of a post-doc student to make a pretty pile for himself.  
	What good can possibly come of such a character? Nothing, of course. On the contrary, things can get pretty ugly if such a self-centred monster is given the charge of saving the planet from the effects of climate change. But just in case you miss the point, McEwan keeps squeezing in a sentence or two, sometimes even a good few pages, to make sure that you understand the enormity of the situation. For instance, in parts two and three, set in 2005 and 2009 respectively, he charts, with a kind of mind-numbing doggedness, the gradual disintegration of Beard into a bumbling fool with an insatiable appetite, both carnal and gastronomical. Beard is a textbook case for a psychiatrist. It seems as though his various vices, emanating from a conveniently sorry youth, have been dreamt up by an adolescent suffering from an overdose of Freud. One wonders if Beards refusal to suck on the nicotine-filled death-stick is related to some vague psychosexual trauma.        
	Beard is a scarily voracious consumer. He gobbles down an astonishing amount of food in an amazingly short time. He gorges on nine sandwiches stuffed with smoked salmon at high tea after a gargantuan lunch in Berlin, followed by a wholesome snack on his flight into Heathrow on the same day. He then goes on to deliver a public lecture, where he speaks inane platitudes for what seems like hours (McEwan makes you suffer the entire speech), and is finally quietly sick at the end of it. Beard also takes to alcohol like fish to water, although his tolerance level, in this case, is impressively higher. As he mutates, quite literally, into a round character (with due apologies to E.M. Forster), Beard starts looking like the object he has taken upon himself to save. Rotund like the earth and riddled with the seven deadly sins (McEwan covers the full range), Beard is the cardboard villain in this cardboard novel laced with cardboard sarcasm.        
	Being a frequent flyer, Beards carbon footprint is hopelessly embarrassing. He is habitually untidy and lives in a perpetually squalid bedsit. After being cuckolded by his sexy fifth wife, Patrice, 20 years his junior (who looks like Marilyn Monroe from certain angles and in a certain light), Beard is blessed with Melissa. A loud, big-hearted lover of the back-clawing school, Melissa happens to be as much of an expert in the kitchen as in the bedroom. Too good to be true for a paunchy middle-aged glutton. But of course, the serial fornicator that he is, Beard must also have the sensual Darlene, a luscious American waitress who fulfilled [his] old fantasy of the grand lowlife. With all the Churchillian triple chins, mounds of flab and sagging body parts, the vision of Beard and his ladies going at it should put the models of Lucian Freud to shame.        
	But there is no reason to believe that Beard is the only bad man around. As far as climate change is concerned, the whole world is rotten, and McEwan makes sure that we dont forget this. As he sends off his monomaniac hero on a trip to the North Pole, along with artists, activists and writers who are deeply worried about the future of humanity in an age of melting glaciers and rising sea levels, McEwan spares none. His caricature of the artist is exactly as one expects it to be  a dotty fellow carving penguins out of ice. The other travellers are sloppy windbags: public awareness of global warming could not have been entrusted on a less aware lot. The ironies are laid on with a trowel: no one manages to keep something as simple as their snow gear in order. But then, McEwan cannot afford to leave it at that; he must have the readers appreciate his cleverness at being able to conjure up such a marvellous idea. So he makes a pathologically disorganized man like Beard feel exasperated by other peoples clumsiness  How were they to save the earth when it was so much larger than the boot room?        
	It is not often that such insights occur to Beard. But as soon as he lands on British soil, he experiences the familiar mental narrowing of homecoming, which inevitably sends his mind spinning towards the two activities he is obsessed with: eating and sleeping around. For a renowned physicist, whose research was once hailed as magic by Richard Feynman at the 1972 Solvay Conference, Beard spends all his time thinking of the next snack or woman that would come his way. Now and then, we are lectured on the earth-shattering consequences of the Beard-Einstein Conflation, which won Beard the Nobel, and, as far as McEwans vagueness would allow us, revealed something revolutionary about light and matter (which led Beard to photovoltaics and to solar energy, the source of the title). So that we do not forget that this is the story of a scientist, we hear Beards asides on electrons as he is about to get punched by his fifth wifes thuggish lover. And in case you imagine that Beards creator, like him, is out of tune with current affairs, there is a potted history of world politics circa 2000  the first stirrings of al Qaida, the verbal scuffle between Bush and Gore over the formers election, the Blair governments silly-sounding wind turbine project called WUDU, and so on.        
	The fund scrounging and petty politics are viciously funny at times. So are Beards misadventures: his terror of losing his precious manhood to hypothermia after peeing in public in sub-zero Arctic temperatures, or his glee at hitting a lady with a rotten tomato she intended for him. But to get to the end of it, you must yawn through 283 pages of self-consciously perfect prose and relentless condescension at the post-modern, politically-correct brigade. In the end, the deadly sins reap deadly consequences, and the good times come to an end. But we all know that anyway, dont we?

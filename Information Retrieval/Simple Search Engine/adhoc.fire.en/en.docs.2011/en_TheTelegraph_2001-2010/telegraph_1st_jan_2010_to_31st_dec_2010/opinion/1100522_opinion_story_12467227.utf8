The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Searching for the golden stag
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SEARCHING FOR THE GOLDEN STAG                                  THIS ABOVE ALL: Khushwant Singh                          Memorable lines                                        
	There was a time when I believed that Rabindranath Tagore is the greatest writer in the world. At school, we recited his Where the mind is without fear as a part of our morning prayer. I mugged up the poem Ekla chalo  walk alone  and was able to recite it in Bengali. I spent three months in Santiniketan and read whatever I could find of his works translated into English, including Gitanjali, which I loved. We were allowed to have his darshan once a week and saw him seated like a monarch on his throne in the huge garden of his mansion, Uttarayana. He was awe-inspiring  over six feet tall, with long hair curling down to his shoulders and a flowing white beard. He was known as the santhal raja because the region round Bolpur was predominantly populated by Santhal tribesmen.        
	Later, I read the works of other Bengali short-story writers, novelists and playwrights. I concluded that some of them were better craftsmen than my icon, Gurudev. He was still the best as far as use of bejewelled words were concerned, and a great writer of songs. Once I was bold enough to say so at a meeting and narrowly escaped being roughed up at the Calcutta airport. Most Bengalis worship him as a deity and cannot take a word spoken in criticism.        
	On the 150th anniversary of his birth, I turned over the pages of my personal notebook, in which I put down memorable quotations. I spotted two right at the beginning. I reproduce them for my readers benefit:        
	I hunt the golden stag
  You may smile, my friends, but I
  pursue that vision that eludes me;
  I cross hills and dales. I wander
   through nameless lands
  Because I am hunting the   goldenstag.        
	You come and buy in the market and
  go back to your homes laden with merchandise
  But the spell of homeless winds has
  touched me,
  I know not when and where.
  I have no care in my heart, all my 
  belongings
  I have left far behind me
  I cross the hills and dales, I wonder through
   nameless lands
  Because I am hunting the
  golden stag.  
	And: India has two aspects  in one she is the householder, in the other a wandering ascetic. The former refuses to budge from the cosy nook, the latter has no home at all. I find both these within me. I want to roam about and see all the wide world, yet I also yearn for a little sheltered nook, like a bird with its tiny nest for a dwelling and the vast sky for flight.                
	Night thoughts        
	Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib had four obsessions: love for liquor, love for women, concern over loss of youth, and dying. In one of his couplets he admits:                
	Maut ka ek din muayyen hai
  Neend raat bhar kyon nahi
  aatee        
	When there is a date fixed
  for my death
  Why do I keep awake at night
  thinking about it?                
	I also often think of death and try to solve its mystery. No one has yet come out with a plausible answer. But I have never, ever lost sleep over it. What bothers me is not dying but the increasing dependence on other people, pain and humiliation that usually precede death. Consequently, when a few years ago, His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, sent me a red string to tie round my wrist with the blessings that I have a peaceful exit, I was overjoyed. Although I do not believe in mystic powers of talismans, I did tie that string round my wrist for a day and still keep it in my drawer. For some reason, I find comfort in reading poetry on the subject. A poem by Tennyson that I have committed to memory is:                
	Sunset and evening star,
  And one clear call for me!
  May there be no moaning of the bar,
  When I put out to sea,
  But such a tide as moving seems
  asleep,
  Too full for sound and foam,
  When that which drew from out the
  boundless deep
  Turns again home.        
	Twilight and the evening bell,
  And after that the dark!
  May there be no sadness of farewell,
  When I embark...          
	The most recent pronouncement on the subject I came across was in Haruki Murakamis first novel, Norwegian Wood. Most of his characters are college students who spend a lot of their time boozing and fornicating. A few end up taking their own lives, including two of the narrators closest friends. He writes: Death exists, not as the opposite but as a part of life to learn. What I learnt from Naokis death was that a truth can cure the sadness we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness can cure that sorrow. All one can do is to see that sadness to the end and learn something from it. But what we learn will be of no help in facing the next sadness that comes to us without warning. Sounds profound but I am not sure what it means.              
	Real India                
	Do not worry about those who have
  come in boats...
  Our forces can easily defeat them.
  Worry about those who have come
  through votes...
  Those are our real enemies.

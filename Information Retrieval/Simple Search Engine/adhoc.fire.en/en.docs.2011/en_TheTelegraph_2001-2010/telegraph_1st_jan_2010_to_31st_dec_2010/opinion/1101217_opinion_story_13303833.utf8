The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | ugly habits die hard
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UGLY HABITS DIE HARD                                  BONAFIDE: Malvika Singh                              
	When the prime minister and other ministers in the Central cabinet go out on a limb to assuage the fresh insecurities that have begun to envelop the corporate tsars of India, the rest of us entrepreneurial Indians feel let down and neglected. Our professional lives are being constantly manipulated by a careless and pompous babudom that adheres to no commitment, no civilized response time, no operating within the laws, no definite answers, no nothing, till either a phone call from the top pushes the agenda without a cash payment or, alas, till someone is paid off to complete the legitimate job at hand. The correction must start from the bottom up because it is the tops of both the government  and that includes the babu and the politician  and the big business houses of India that have manipulated the system for personal gain instead of streamlining the cumbersome, corrupt machinery for all those who are in the business of generating wealth.        
	These large corporate houses need no help whatsoever and, most certainly, no apologies at all, particularly from the prime minister himself. They have, over the decades, been aided and abetted to move forward even where the laws were restrictive. Their coffers have filled, often illegally. In other words, there were constant deviations from the law of the land that the authorities conveniently overlooked.         
	Corruption grew and, in percentage terms, overtook the much-touted rate of growth, and no one stopped the monster in its tracks. It became the easy, albeit irresponsible, way forward. All were forced to indulge in tactics that went against their inherent good sense because that was the only way to do business.         
	Therefore, when the Vedantas of the world began projects well before all mandatory permissions and clearances were in place, they never suspected that the ongoing work would be halted. Money always bought deviations from the law. These large businesses feel affronted that they are asked to comply, to fall in line with the norms, be scrutinized or compelled to abide by the law. Why are they running to the government for cover?                
	Reform to survive        
	If this government truly wants the entrepreneurial sector, in all its diversity, to grow rapidly and with integrity, it will have to do a radical restructuring and simplification of the rules that regulate active growth in all sectors. The endless paperwork, interpretation of existing laws and addenda to those laws that leave space for corruption will have to be rewritten from the scratch using hardcore common sense. The babu will have to be rigorously re-trained in order to adjust to honest practices and the rule of law for all, with no discrimination whatsoever. Only then will confidence dominate to generate a substantial spurt in the real rate of growth across the board  a growth that we as Indians can be proud of. Today, many Indians are ashamed of those who lead big business enterprises in India as they watch them bribe and armtwist the government to meet their inappropriate demands.        
	With raids taking place around us linked to the spectrum scam, will those in power consciously begin a genuine reform of the mechanisms that govern our professional and private lives? Will they accept the fact that corruption, with all the accompanying filth and horror, is all-pervasive? Or will the powers that be continue lecturing us on honesty and integrity and do nothing about it themselves?        
	Why is the United Progressive Alliance, and the Congress Party in particular, allowing itself to be disrobed in this fashion? Why does the party not use this moment to restore its dignity? Why does it not admit the truth, proactively lead the radical cleansing, and move towards a great victory?

	Regular writers will know that publishing a book requires a set of skills entirely different from that of writing one. Authors have to keep the business side in mind as they work. For writers who have been in the industry for some time, emphasizing this fact would be stating the obvious. However, businesses keep changing all the time  the key decision-makers now are no longer just the editors, but marketing executives and accountants who decide whether a particular piece would interest the potential reader, and if so, how many words should be allotted to it. Plus, there are debates on whether the space ought to be used for publishing an advertisement or a piece of gossip that would attract a wider readership.        
	Of course, the quality of writing is still an important factor that decides the amount of space the work gets. But articles now are ruthlessly cut. Writers have often had to learn, at some expense, about subjects that would interest a publisher and also about the number of words in which to wrap up an article. When writing books, the topicality of the subject has to be borne in mind, as also the fact that a finished book must not exceed 200 pages or 80,000 words. Anything more would be cut out because, according to the prevailing publishing wisdom, readers cannot cope with more than that. Besides, bigger books cost more to produce and, hence, fetch lower returns. Therefore, the current business philosophy seems to be small is beautiful.        
	The rules are pretty simple: stick to the specified number of words, and keep the language simple so that the ordinary reader has no difficulty in understanding  and, most important, deliver the manuscript as per schedule. But, in reality, what makes these guidelines difficult to follow is the spate of mergers and acquisitions that takes place, where small and medium-sized firms get swallowed by big conglomerates whose futures are equally uncertain  they could be taken over by the communication giants who control not just book publishing houses but also newspapers, TV stations and so on.        
	So, how does an author who had signed a contract with a publisher, now taken over by a much bigger one, handle the situation? Often, the editor with whom the author had initially entered into an agreement has also moved on. Hence, while dealing with big publishing houses, it is best to consult a literary agent who knows how to make sure that the royalties due to a writer are not reduced as a consequence of such changes. There are many clauses in the contract in small print that cut authors royalties  only an agent can take care of such subtle detail.        
	However, if the writer wants to handle his case alone, he should consult The Writers Handbook 2011. Without this guide, he could easily be taken for a ride and lose out on legitimate earnings. After all, the business of writing is a two-way street, where authors should learn to look after their own interests.

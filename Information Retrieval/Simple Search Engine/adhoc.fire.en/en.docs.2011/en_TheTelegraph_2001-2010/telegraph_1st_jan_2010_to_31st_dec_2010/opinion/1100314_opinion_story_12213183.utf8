	 The sight of parliamentarians being bodily removed from the upper House may sit heavy on the image of Indian democracy. But there were many lighter moments too in the ordeal that was the passage of the womens reservation bill. Take, for instance, the purge itself. The dissenters did not leave the house in silence. This bit was known. What was not known, however, was that they did not leave the House empty-handed. Just before the crucial vote was to take place, the floor managers discovered that the key to the electronic machine was missing. But unlike them, many others had long known the need for caution. Arun Jaitley, the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, came armed with three copies of his speech on the bill. One of these he left with a trusted party colleague seated at the rear, just in case the ones with him were snatched away. Despite his flair for words, Jaitley could not afford to fumble on a matter as crucial as womens reservation.          
	 The other day, when the customary group photograph of members of the Rajya Sabha was to be taken before the biennial retirement of one-third of members, the civil aviation minister, Praful Patel, came dapperly dressed in suit and tie. Photo-session over, Patel went inside the House without his coat to field questions on his ministry. Noticing him without a coat, Arun Jaitley slipped him a note asking why he was dressed like a medical representative, to which Patel replied, After yesterdays events, I may have to look for an alternative profession. Incidentally, the House had passed the womens bill the day before.                            
	 The Bharatiya Janata Party spokesman, Prakash Javadekar, found himself on slippery ground when he predicted the fall of the government over womens reservation. To substantiate his argument, Javadekar recalled how HD Deve Gowda, IK Gujral and AB Vajpayee had suffered in trying to pass this piece of legislation. At this point, a Left leader quipped, So now we understand why the BJP goaded the Congress into bringing this bill.                             
	 After much deliberation, LK Advani has finally been given the room in Parliament, which was earmarked for AB Vajpayee as chairman of the National Democratic Alliance. To accommodate Advani in that room, he has been made the working chairman of the NDA, besides being chairman of the parliamentary party. The room was under lock-and-key for many years as Vajpayee couldnt come to the Parliament. But now that Advani has shifted there, he is quite certain that he cannot work in it, at least not in the present state it is in. Advani wants to have the room redone after the budget session is over. Not only is it smaller than his earlier office, but it also has a half-partition that prevents any confidential discussion from taking place. Advanis desperation to have the room renovated proves that he expects to hold such secret parleys quite frequently.                            
	 One BJP member who was conspicuous by his absence despite the whip to be present during the voting on the womens reservation bill was Arun Shourie. The former editor had excused himself through a prior intimation simply addressed to the leader of the Opposition. The letter, inter alia, said that he was unable to attend the House and that he was dictating the letter to his PA who, incidentally, had put his signature on it. Ever since Arun Jaitley was appointed the leader of the Opposition, Shourie has hardly been seen in Parliament. His term is to end in a couple of months, and it is unlikely that the BJP will be keen to favour him with another stint in Parliament.                            
	 Last week, Shah Rukh Khan and Karan Johar called on Sonia Gandhi, apparently to thank the United Progressive Alliance chairperson for her unflinching support during the release of My Name is Khan. Sonia reportedly told the duo that her partys response had been guided by the larger national good. Incidentally, neither Rahul Gandhi, who is supposed to be a friend of Johar, or Priyanka Gandhi and her children, fans of the Shah Rukh, were present at 10 Janpath during the time.      
	Was this deliberately done to make sure that expectations did not get too high or to send a discreet message that the Nehru-Gandhis no longer believe in mixing friendship and politics?                      
	 Barack Obama does not like mincing his words. Consider his recent admission that nearly half of the 40,000 letters he gets at the White House each day brand him as an idiot. The president also revealed that his staff did not spare him the wrath of the correspondents when they selected 10 letters for him to read when he returned to his White House residence at night. Closer home, the Rashtrapati Bhavan, too, does its bit to gauge the public mood from a healthy flow of letters. While it is not clear how many letters the president gets to read, it is certain that letter-writers are getting more and more ambitious. A disgruntled youth from Shimla recently requested to be made prime minister for a day to set things right. The letter was forwarded to the Himachal Pradesh government for necessary action.

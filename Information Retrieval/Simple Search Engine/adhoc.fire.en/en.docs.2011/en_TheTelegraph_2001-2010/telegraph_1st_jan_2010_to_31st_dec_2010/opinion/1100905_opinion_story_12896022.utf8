	Sushma Swaraj is proving to be a leader of the Opposition with a difference. Some days back, she was seen engrossed in a conversation with Sonia Gandhi. Apparently, during the tte-a-tte, Swaraj, who had threatened to shave her head and sleep on the ground if Sonia went on to become the prime minister in 2004, enquired about Sonias ailing mother and her two sisters. But then six years is a long time, especially in politics where there are no permanent friends or foes. Not just Congress leaders, but even members of the Bharatiya Janata Party have had a taste of Swarajs unique style of functioning. During the sessions in Parliament, Swaraj is in the habit of selecting themes and then dividing her party MPs into different groups to facilitate fruitful discussions among them. The other day, she divided her MPs according to their age and then organized a state-wise talent hunt. Expectedly, everyone wanted to see how the mercurial leaders from Uttar Pradesh  Murli Manohar Joshi, Rajnath Singh and Varun Gandhi  would fare in the contest. But everyone, including Swaraj, was in for a nasty surprise when none of the leaders turned up for the performance on the given day. Even Jaswant Singh, the sole representative from the East, opted out by saying that he prefers not to stay outdoors after six in the evening. Now when did our ostentatious netas start suffering from stage fright?                          
	While many parts of India are praying for rain, the Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit, is busy asking the gods for a bit of sunshine. Delhi is reeling under heavy rains that have adversely affected the preparations for the Commonwealth Games. A worried Dikshit has apparently turned to Indra to stop the incessant rains. But it seems that Dikshits prayers have fallen on deaf ears, prompting her opponents to quip whether the CM should use a portion of her huge cash chest to organize a yajna for a dry spell.                        
	 Atal Bihari Vajpayee is being sorely missed in some sections of the Congress party! After Manmohan Singhs insipid address failed to have much of an impact on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, some Congress leaders were left wondering whether Vajpayee would have succeeded where Singh had failed. The reference to Vajpayee was made in the context of his ability to deliver rousing speeches, which had considerable mass appeal.While some Congressmen feel that Vajpayees speeches raised Indias credibility in the international community, others acknowledge that they also played a critical role in helping the Indo-Pak dialogue scale greater heights. With the situation on the ground remaining far from satisfactory in the troubled state of Jammu and Kashmir, some party members are secretly hoping that Singhs future addresses will not lack the famed Vajpayee touch.                             
	 A tussle of sorts has broken out between Rahul Gandhi and Amit Jogi, the son of the former CM of Chhattisgarh, Ajit Jogi. Jogi Jr has filed his nomination for the post of state Youth Congress president. But soon, he was brought under pressure to withdraw his nomination. To Amits utter horror, he received a call from Kunwar Jitendra Singh, the AICC secretary attached to Rahul, who said that Rahul wanted his nomination withdrawn. Although Singh refused to cite any particular reason, the grapevine has it that Rahul is not too pleased with Amits failure to maintain a squeaky clean image. So, despite adding 4 lakh new members to the Youth Congress, Amit does not quite make the cut in Rahuls eyes. Now it remains to be seen whether Amit, who professes to be a loyal soldier of the party, ultimately bows out of the contest by obeying the orders from the prince.                            
	 Speaking to a BBC journalist, Yash Chopra, who directed Silsila, admitted that the sparks between Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha had been lit even before work started on his film. One cannot blame Chopra for his fears of a cat fight breaking out on the sets as Amitabhs wife, Jaya, too featured in the film. But, in the end, Chopra said he was a relieved man. Not only was the film a hit, but Amitabh and his leading ladies had also behaved impeccably. So far, Amitabh, who blogs regularly, has chosen to remain silent about Chopra spilling the beans.                      
	Javed Akhtar, who is known to harbour views that are different from those of the saffron brigade, has followed the best parliamentary traditions and forged warm ties with some of its leaders. An excellent raconteur, he treated Ravi Shankar Prasad and a few journos to some delectable shero-shairi at the Central Hall of Parliament the other day. Prasad, whose knowledge of Urdu poetry is considerable, was also celebrating his birthday that very day and he could not have asked for a better present. In fact, Prasad was so impressed with Akhtars performance that he promised to meet the lyricist soon for an extended shairi session. Cynical journalists could not help but comment that Akhtar and his wife, Shabana Azmi, were like chalk and cheese. Azmi, who had also been a Rajya Sabha member, could never mix with everyone as easily.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        REAL CHARGE                                                    
	If people can be convicted of sedition for having sympathies, can George Orwells 1984 be far behind? The sentence of life imprisonment passed on the doctor and activist, Binayak Sen, by a court in Chhattisgarh is so wildly improbable that it reduces all response to absurdity. The doctor has been accused of sympathy for the Maoists, which, in his case, is just a feeling  if the prosecution is to be taken seriously  because he has not gone around blowing up bridges and murdering people. If feelings and opinions are to be brought to the dock in a declared democracy then India should own up to being a very different kind of State than it pretends to be. Some of the evidence of Mr Sens feelings comprise journals, letters and compact discs allegedly found in his house. India is in a sorry muddle if it finds sedition lurking in journals that are not banned, newspaper cuttings referring to Naxalite activity, or CDs recording investigations by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties, of which Mr Sen is an office-bearer. The court  and the police  have focused on three letters that the doctor had allegedly passed on to Piyush Guha from the jailed Naxalite leader, Narayan Sanyal. Mr Sen had visited him under strict supervision to treat him. So, to take the prosecution seriously, the doctor could be guilty of being a courier.        
	As if condemning a man for Maoist sympathies that he might be carrying in his heart were not enough, it can also be asked whether couriers are given life sentences in this country. Precedents, which Indians so look up to, say exactly the opposite: a year at most, perhaps. And sedition is usually judged by its effects: even triumphal slogans about Khalistan did not merit imprisonment after Indira Gandhis assassination because no one responded to them. But with Binayak Sen it is urgent to stifle the defence: that the doctor has publicly declared his lack of sympathy for killers and asked both the State and the extremists to come to a political solution, or that the police are making a sorry mess of proving that they have not planted evidence on either Mr Sen or Mr Guha, that a passer-by is being produced as star witness, that Mr Sen met Mr Sanyal only under supervision in prison. Is the real charge against the doctor that he helped expose fake encounters and abuses by the Salwa Judum and continues to fight against such injustice? It now seems possible that the State views this as sedition. If so, to what extent is the court the arm of the State?

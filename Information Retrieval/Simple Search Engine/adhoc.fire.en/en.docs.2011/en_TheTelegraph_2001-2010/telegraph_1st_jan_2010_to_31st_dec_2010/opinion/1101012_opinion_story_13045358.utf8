                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DAMAGING ROLE                                                    
	The B.S. Yeddyurappa government ultimately won the trust vote in the Karnataka assembly, but its feat plunged the state into a deeper political crisis. In fact, the proceedings in the House raised serious constitutional questions which resonated beyond the confines of the Vidhan Soudha. The first, of course, dealt with the validity of the action of the Speaker, whose controversial use of the anti-defection law kept out as many as 16 of the dissenting members of the legislative assembly during the trust motion. The disqualification of the MLAs, hours before the voice vote and in apparent contravention of the basic guidelines of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution  which allows the use of the law only against MLAs who resign from the party or who disregard the party whip during a confidence vote  threw the entire procedure under a pale of doubt. Mr Yeddyurappa, naturally, cannot completely escape the charge of using undemocratic means to hold on to power that was levelled against him by the Opposition. The disqualified MLAs have challenged the Speakers move in court and the Opposition approached the governor, who has recommended Presidents Rule for the state.        
	The other serious constitutional question that has been raised by the crisis is about the role of the governor. In Karnataka, a proactive gubernatorial office has often complicated the political situation. The governor of the state has spoken out more often than expected  on corrupt ministers, on the justifiability of the cow slaughter legislation, and now on the validity of the use of the anti-defection law. The office of the governor is apolitical and cannot be seen, under any circumstances, to be playing a political role. The Karnataka governor, H.R. Bhardwaj, could have reserved his opinion on the impending complications that the perceived misuse of anti-defection law would lead to till the time he was actually approached by the elected representatives of the people. They have done so now, and Mr Bhardwaj has acted as required by his constitutional position. But by acting out of cue, the governor did harm the image of impartiality that his office is supposed to bear. In the end, however, none of the actors in the ongoing drama in Karnataka may be said to have played the roles the Constitution and the people want them to. Shameless politicking has undermined the electoral verdict in the state.

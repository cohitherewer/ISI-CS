	How low can the euro go? Thats the question that everyone seems to be grappling with, from bond investors through currency traders and government officials within the euro area to central banks. The answer  or answers, depending on who is asking  will determine a number of fates, many of which may be linked only peripherally to the currency. To start with global growth prospects, expressed in nominal gross domestic product terms, the euro area accounts for roughly 30 per cent of global GDP, which, in 2009, was $57 trillion, according to the International Monetary Fund. Analysts point out that some countries  accounting for 10-11 per cent of global GDP  explicitly or implicitly link their currency to the euro. The average value of the currency in 2010 is expected to be 75 per cent of its 2009 value in dollar terms. So if growth is going to be flat, at say 0.2 per cent, the fall in nominal GDP globally would be eight per cent. Thats a scary number, even if it is not real GDP. Next, it is necessary to look at the impact in countries whose populations are justifiably aggrieved that they are paying the price for Greeces fiscal profligacy and lying.        
	On May 18, Greece received 14.5 billion euro that would allow it to pay the debt that fell due the next day. It is also clear that of the 15 other countries that share the common currency, only 10 actually put up the money, including Spain, Italy and Portugal, widely believed to be the next dominoes to fall if the crisis got out of hand (they still could): Ireland, Belgium, Finland, Slovenia and Slovakia did not participate. That points to the fissures within the European Union, and brings to the fore another obvious question: could this be the end of the euro? Germany is the critical factor that will determine if that will happen. The anger of the German population was seen in the recent provincial elections, where Angela Merkels party got drubbed. If there were a referendum in Germany today about leaving the euro, there is little doubt about the outcome: once the largest economy within that currency leaves it (and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, made similar noises in recent weeks), it is time to perform the last rites. But it would also be disingenuous to think that the weakness of the euro implies dollar strength. The price of gold in both currencies has been rising; it has been rising faster in euros than it has been in dollars. The euros status as a global reserve currency may be coming to an end.

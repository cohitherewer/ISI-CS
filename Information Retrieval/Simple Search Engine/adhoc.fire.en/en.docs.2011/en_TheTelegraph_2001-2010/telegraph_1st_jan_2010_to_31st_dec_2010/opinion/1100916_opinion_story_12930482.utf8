	In a fix                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitras article, That prescient old fox (Sept 10), was interesting. The issue of outsourcing is a serious one as it involves the future of many young Americans and Indians. The government of the United States of America is facing a strange dilemma. It is obliged to maintain its reputation as a capitalist economy. Outsourcing is a vital element of such an economy since it enables companies to achieve higher margins of profit. But then again, the problem of unemployment is looming large over the US that is not helped at all by outsourcing.          
	On the other hand, for a country like India, outsourcing is a huge source of employment. Doing away with it will definitely create a slump in the job market here. However, Americas reluctance to outsource jobs is understandable. The job crunch plaguing the country at the moment has made its people less tolerant about the idea of offering existing vacancies to outsiders. One hopes that Barack Obama will adopt a balanced approach towards this issue as it is a sensitive one for Americans as well as for Indo-US strategic ties.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  As usual, Ashok Mitra has made repeated efforts in his article to point out the pitfalls of capitalism. He concludes by suggesting that outsourcing, despite being the preferred tool of capitalist economies, may not be favoured by the common people both in India and in the US. But Mitras contention is far from being valid. People with leftist ideologies may prefer to hate outsourcing and the capitalist system, but the world is yet to find a viable alternative to capitalism.          
	The example of the information technology sector in India would be enough to establish this fact. The IT sector generates a huge number of jobs through outsourcing and so provides employment to numerous Indians. The importance of its place in the Indian economy cannot be ignored.          
	Yours faithfully,         Harshamoy Mukherjee, Ranchi               
	Unfair means          
	Sir  I fully agree with the views expressed in the editorial, Wrong lead (Sept 13), on the recent gherao of some members of the executive council of Jadavpur University. They were detained for 52 hours by the students. It is baffling that the reason behind this outrageous act is the decision of the council to install closed-circuit television in the campus to ensure the safety of the students and the institution. It is also ironic that these students, who aspire for lucrative positions in world-class establishments, behaved in such an uncivilized manner.          
	For quite some time, a group of students in JU has been vitiating the educational environment by their arrogant display of power. They tend to make an issue out of every step taken by the university authorities. The situation has worsened owing to the reluctance of the authorities to deal firmly with these unruly pupils. The latter had previously challenged a number of proposed administrative measures, which were ultimately shelved. Such dithering has inflated the ego of these students.          
	It is time for the JU management to shake off its indecisiveness for the sake of students who have a genuine desire to study, and who are being coerced into obeying the diktats of students unions. The disruptive students should be warned, and if they fail to mend their ways, they should be expelled. However, there should be room for discussion and debate. A real effort should be made to sort out the differences between the students and the authorities.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Srikanta Bhattacharjee, Calcutta              
	Sir  At a time when security should be the foremost concern of authorities in charge of government institutions, public places and institutes of learning, it is paradoxical that the students of an elite university resorted to an ugly gherao of their teachers because the university management had thought of installing CCTV in the campus. The students behaviour is all the more bewildering given that they belong to a privileged class, and they will jostle for a place in corporate houses when the campus recruitments begin. Who is to be blamed for this lamentable deterioration in the attitude of a talented lot? It seems that the political degeneration in West Bengal has weighed down upon the students psyche. The vice-chancellor of JU needs the firm support of professors and students to quell such indiscipline.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Gautam Mookerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I wholeheartedly support the JU authorities decision not to give in to the students illogical demands. The university has taken the correct stand by not compromising on its resolution to install CCTV on campus and in the students hostel. After so many incidents of ragging and eve-teasing in the campus, such a move should be welcomed. One wonders why the students are against it. Their negative approach will stand in the way of the institutions future development. It is hoped that good sense will prevail among the students soon and they will stop their agitations for the sake of their institutions welfare.          
	Yours faithfully,

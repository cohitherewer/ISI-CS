The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Spring arrives in the wilderness
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPRING ARRIVES IN THE WILDERNESS                                  This Above All - Khushwant Singh                          Colourful life				                                       
	I have always had a soft spot for George Fernandes. I have known him for almost 40 years in his many incarnations. He has everything I do not have. When I first saw him, he was a handsome, well-built young man with zest for life that attracted the most beautiful of women. I was a flabby, paunchy sardar, more seeking than sought after. I recall my first sight of him on a hot summer afternoon on a small platform in Kala Ghoda Chowk in the midst of hundreds of Bombays cab drivers, exhorting them to fight for their rights. Later, on the same evening, I met him at a cocktail party reception given by Mota Chudasama. He was the centre of attention among all the bejewelled glitterati of Bombays elite society. He was just at ease chatting with them as he was talking to sweaty taxi drivers. The one thing we have in common is our disdain for all religions. George was born Catholic but was totally non-conformist.        
	I lost track of him for a while after he married Humayun Kabirs daughter, Leila, a Bengali Muslim. Though she bore him a son, the marriage did not work. George was never a one-woman man. I heard of many women who befriended him, including a starlet in Bangalore.        
	George was openly critical of Indira Gandhi. When she imposed the Emergency, the police went looking for him. He went underground. He grew a beard, learnt to tie a turban and passed off as a Sikh. When he travelled around the country by air, he booked himself under my name  for no better reason than he could not think of another Sikh name. When I questioned him later and said, But you cant even speak Punjabi and here many people know me, he smiled and replied, I said I was born and brought up in Canada. And no one ever asked me: are you Khushwant Singh? However, the police got him. He was given the third-degree and even taken out to be shot in an encounter.        
	After the anti-Sikh riots of November 1984, following the assassination of Indira Gandhi, I saw more of him. He set up a relief organization to rehabilitate families of the victims. I received a lot of donation from Sikhs living abroad. I passed them on to Georges organization for disbursement. I saw a great deal of his new companion, Jaya Jaitley. I had known her as a schoolgirl, as June Chettur. The family lived in the neighbouring block. She was the heart-throb of all the boys who went with her in school and college, including my son, Rahul.        
	Then I saw George as the defence minister. There was not the slightest change in his behaviour  no red light on his car, no sirens blowing, no escort. He walked in without any fuss, chatted as casually as before. More women came his way. One I knew well was the dusky, curvaceous beauty, Olga Tellis.         
	Who else but George, a South Indian, could win elections from Bihar? Who else but George could charm anyone he met? It is a thousand pities that he has been stricken with Alzheimers disease. I know how dreadful it is because my wife suffered from it for five years before she died. Your memory goes, and you gradually sink into oblivion. Leila Kabir and her son have taken over the task of looking after George. Jaitley, who was his closest companion for 25 years, has been declared persona non grata. Fortunately, George Fernandes is blissfully unaware of what is going on around him.                
	Rebirth of Urdu                
	One evening, I was holding forth in my evening mehfil reciting passages from Ghalibs poetry I know by heart. After receiving the customary acclaims of Wah! Wah! Irshaad! Mukarrar!, I said, Isnt it a great tragedy that this language is dying out in the very country in which it was born?        
	Professor Mushirul Hassan contradicted me Languages never die out; they change with the time but never become extinct. In India it is not Urdu which is dying but the Arabic script in which it was usually written. It is now re-appearing in other Indian scripts.        
	He is right. In the last few years, we have seen more books published on Urdu poetry in northern Indian languages than during the British raj. I am only aware of what has appeared in Punjabi, Hindi and English. The names uppermost in my mind are T.N. Raz of Panchkula, and Kuldip Salil, retired professor of English in Hansraj College, Delhi. I have gone through Razs Selections of Ghalib in Gurmukhi script at least 100 times. Last month, he came out with two more collections of Urdu poetry: Hindustan tay Pakistan dee Behtereen Urdu Haas Viyang Shairee (The best of Indo-Pak light verse) and Parveen Shakir dee Chunnee Shairee (Selected verses of Parveen Shakir).        
	I respect Kuldip Salil as a teacher and use his verses in my columns. He has also come out with translations of Allama Iqbal in Devanagari and English, and of Faiz Ahmed Faiz. Having translated some of both poets, I was interested in seeing how Salils rendering differed from mine. He knows the original languages much better than I do. I give one example from Faiz which is my favourite:         
	Raat you dil mein teyree khoee huee yaad aaiyee        
	Jaisey veeraney mein chupkey say bahaar a jaaye         
	Jaisey veeraaney mein bauley say chaley baad-e-naseem        
	Jaisey beemaar ko beyvajah garaar aa jaaye                
	Salil translates it as follows:        
	Like the arrival of spring suddenly in desolate country        
	Like the morning breeze blowing quietly through the desert land        
	Like a patient unexpectedly feeling all right         
	Your memory crossed my mind last night.        
	I have rendered the same lines as follows:        
	At night your lost memory stole into my mind        
	As spring silently appears in the wilderness;        
	As in desert wastes morning breeze begins to blow        
	As in one sick beyond hope, hope begins to grow.

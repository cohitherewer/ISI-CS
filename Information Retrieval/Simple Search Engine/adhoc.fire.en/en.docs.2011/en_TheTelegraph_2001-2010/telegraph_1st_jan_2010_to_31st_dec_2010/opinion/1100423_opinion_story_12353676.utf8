	Labour trouble                  
	Sir It was shocking to read that Microsoft has allegedly been using slave labour in one of its factories in China (Microsoft using teens as labour, April 17). It is surprising that the American business giant has been able to do so without the knowledge of the Chinese authorities. On its home ground, the United States of America, Microsoft would never have dared to violate human rights in such a manner, given the strict labour laws prevailing there. The incident makes a mockery of Chinas labour laws and its claims to protect workers interests.          
	Had such a thing happened in India or in any other country, there would have been a furore over the issue. Since China bans its local media from reporting on a large number of critical issues, the matter has only come to light through a report filed by the National Labour Committee, a US advocacy group. Not long ago, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, also based in the US, alleged violation of human rights in China, including forced overtime hours, wages that were inadequate even to provide basic food requirements, abysmal living conditions and arbitrary dismissal of workers. Chinas success story is well known. The darker side to it is kept out of view. Even when the Chinese media is not allowed to report on the collapse of school buildings in earthquakes, people sing paeans of praise to the country.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir There is nothing surprising in Microsofts use of slave labour at 37 pence per hour in China. The countrys labour laws seem to favour manufacturers and there is little organized labour union. So it is to be expected that large business concerns are attracted to China. According to reports, a worker in China can be hired and fired at will and be paid very low wages. Much of Chinas development has been at the cost of a humanitarian image. It is hard to believe that the Chinese authorities did not know of Microsofts practices. If the State is indeed unaware of the ground realities then that is inexcusable as well. Why is it that the countrys workers are not agitating against the system?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Friends and foes          
	Sir In recent times, the US has been snubbed by Israel, and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan railed against the foreign presence in his country. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to provoke the US by entertaining Chinese help in the field of nuclear energy and signing a deal with Iran on sourcing a gas pipeline from that country. These initiatives have drawn disapproval from the US but Pakistan seems to care little for Hillary Clintons admonitions.          
	In contrast, India religiously toes US guidelines, be it on the question of nuclear liabilities or on supporting American interests in Afghanistan (A different vision, April 17). Moreover, it has ended up watching from the sidelines as Pakistan tries to wring a civil nuclear deal out of the US. The Indian government is even prepared to believe that the arms supplied to Pakistan by the US will be used for the war on terror and not against India.          
	The latest in a series of insults came with Hillary Clinton equating Indian nuclear security with that of Pakistan. The two countries, Clinton has said, have shattered the balance of nuclear deterrence as they possess nuclear devices that they are not able to protect. Pakistans nuclear arsenal may be at peril but India is perfectly well able to protect its weapons. When it comes to the US, India seems to lack the courage to stand up for itself. It seems ready to go the extra mile to placate its powerful ally, even when it is not required.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently met the US president, Barack Obama, for the Global Nuclear Security Summit in Washington (PM advances US trip to iron out wrinkles, April 9). On every visit, President Obama seems sympathetic to India but he is always careful to look after Pakistans interests.          
	Undoubtedly, the US is a dangerous friend to have. Pakistan, for one, seems to be surviving mainly on aid from the US. Americas primary focus is the war on terror. Relations between India and America are largely centred on the issues of terrorism and Indias relations with Pakistan. These questions come up no matter what the occasion of the visit. India seems to have forgotten its national pride and sold itself out to the US, even though it does not need to. A thriving India, with its pool of young talent, is a match for any superpower.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayesh Shrikant Rane, Mumbai

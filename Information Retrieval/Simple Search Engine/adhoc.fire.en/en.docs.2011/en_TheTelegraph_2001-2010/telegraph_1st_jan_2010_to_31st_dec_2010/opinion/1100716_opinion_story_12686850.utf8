	It is not common for Indian politicians to own up to failures. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, seems to believe, however, that an honest admission of failure is the first step towards a course correction. What he has said about the States failure in Maoist-affected areas is far removed from the average politicians familiar rhetoric. His remarks at his meeting with the chief ministers of four Maoist-hit states give the battle against the rebels a very necessary human face. For many years now, several governments at the Centre and the states have routinely talked of a two-pronged strategy of development and counter-insurgency offensives to fight the Maoists. Politicians across India have always known how the State and governments have failed the tribal people. But few have admitted the States failures in such candid terms as Mr Singh has done. Who does not know that the tribal people have always seen the administration in the form of a rapacious forest guard, a brutal policeman, a greedy patwari? But not many politicians have had the courage to admit their own responsibilities for this state of affairs in the countrys tribal heartland. It is an important perspective that is often lost in drawing up battle strategies.        
	Nobody denies, however, that there is a battle to be fought. Given the lack of co-ordination among different police and paramilitary forces and agencies, unified commands in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and West Bengal should improve the efficiency of the counter-insurgency offensives. Such commands have been in place in some of the north-eastern states and in Jammu and Kashmir. The proposal to set up 400 new police stations in the Maoist-affected districts can make a difference only if it is implemented within a time frame. The police forces are not usually trained or properly equipped to fight Maoist guerrillas. But the fact that there are some 70,000 vacancies in these forces is an indication of the general administrative ineptitude. Even if the logistics improve with the unified commands and additional forces, the battle could still be hard and long. That is why the prime ministers ideas are particularly relevant. Maoists may want to seize State power with the help of guns. But the tribal people need food, shelter and their rights to livelihoods. Mr Singh could not be more right  it is time the State reached out to Indias heart of darkness.

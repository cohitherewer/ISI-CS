                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ALL IN A DAYS WORK                                                      The Vidhan Soudha                            
	Since the India Corruption Study of 2005 done by Transparency International and the Centre for Media Studies, Karnataka has steadfastly held on to its position as the fourth most corrupt state in the country. Although it is still unofficial, the state might have already beaten others to the top. A survey done earlier this year showed that Bangaloreans are more willing to pay bribe to get their job done than the residents of either Mumbai or Delhi. Another CMS study after the 2008 assembly elections showed that more than 40 per cent of the voters had received money for their votes, mostly a day before the polls. The Election Commission had seized Rs 40 crore before it was transported for distribution among voters, but could prosecute nobody. The nonchalance with which legislator-purchase policies like Operation Lotus has been resorted to repeatedly shows that Karnataka has set its own standards of institutionalized corruption.         
	Karnataka is a politically backward place, said Gopinath Parakuni, the general secretary of Bangalores Cividep-India, a workers rights organization, it is always a little late in understanding what is going on. Remember Karnataka had elected a Congress government just after Emergency. Unlike the peasant and Dalit movements, or the civil rights and environmental awareness that Karnataka can boast of, the civic rights movement and anti-corruption drive have been more bureaucratic, restricted to small groups with no real public participation. Samuel Paul, the chairman of Bangalores Public Affairs Centre, perhaps would not disagree. However, his organization has done its bit to propagate civic and electoral awareness. Under his leadership, the PAC prepared the first report card on municipal services from civil society to address issues of service quality and accountability, with the power of information. Since 1999, the PAC has also been trying to ensure that voters voices are heard during elections. It has helped the EC revise electoral rolls, motivated voters in neighbouring districts, and tried to keep voters informed about the candidates antecedents, encouraging voters to collect information from the candidates themselves.         
	There are other NGOs and individuals in Karnataka trying to build up a public voice against poor administration and corruption. There has been a steep rise in the number of applicants for the use of the Right to Information Act and of membership in anti-corruption groups. The anti-corruption blog of J.N. Jayashree, who has resorted to this novel way of protecting her bureaucrat husband (who is also a frequent whistle-blower), has registered 13 new readers since September 2010. The leading light of civic and anti-corruption awareness in the state is the lokayukta, N. Santosh Hegde, who carries on the legacy of his predecessor, N. Venkatachala. Hegde has put in a lot of effort to gain the confidence of a usually reticent people to protest against institutional corruption. His office, close to the Vidhan Soudha in Bangalore, is guarded by a posse of policemen, but anyone can walk in and meet the lokayukta himself. During my brief visit to his office, I saw that a dictionary-seller had as much access to the man, surrounded by liveried state personnel, as a top lawyer, and he dealt with each of them with equal attention and patience.         
	Hegde personally takes in 35 to 40 complaints every day, mostly against corrupt civil servants. Few politicians, if ever, are the target of the raids and traps that the lokayukta police undertake. Although politicians, too, are public servants under the jurisdiction of the lokayukta, Hegde finds his hands tied by the law. He does not have the suo motu power to file a case against them on the basis of his personal investigation. He can initiate action only if there is a complaint backed by an affidavit. Given the fear a politician inspires, there are hardly any complaints. Fortunately, one or two have allowed him the opportunity to go hammer and tongs against the mining lobby as illegal dealers in land.        
	The role that Hegde plays is mainly advisory. It is for the government to take action against the guilty, and here the lacunae are immense. As the recent turn of events has shown, most of the corrupt pinned down by Hegde are what he calls powerful people, a euphemism for ministers and chairpersons of government corporations protected by the establishment itself. Without sanction from the government, Hegde cannot prosecute them under the Prevention of Corruption Act, and this sanction is never forthcoming.         
	This is probably why Hegde feels that his second report  on illegal mining exports  will be as futile as the first, which was on illegal mining in the state. Even then, Hegde says that he will not resort to the threat of resignation, for he believes that would discourage the people. His term ends in September 2011. The report on illegal mining will be finished by then, but certainly not his work against the corrupt.

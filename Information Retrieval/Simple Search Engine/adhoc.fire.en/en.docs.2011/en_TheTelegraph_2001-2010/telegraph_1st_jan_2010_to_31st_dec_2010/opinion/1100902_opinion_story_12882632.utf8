	There is at least one category of Indians among whom the sex ratio is biased in favour of the female. Apparently, the Indian elephant has a sex ratio of one male to 120 females in some parts of the country. But more females than males cannot automatically make things right; rather, this particular topsy-turvy ratio just shows that male elephants are still being selectively and intensively hunted for their tusks.         
	Paradoxically, government figures show that the elephant population is increasing. Such optimism is an official habit; Indians still do not know how many tigers are really around. The government estimate of the elephant population is undermined by the experience of increasing elephant-human conflict all over the country. Elephants cannot come out unscathed from such encounters, particularly as the shrinking of their habitat forces them to enter the same areas of human habitation repeatedly and be chased or beaten out. Trains speeding along tracks across elephant corridors have long been killing the beasts on a regular basis, although there has been a drop in frequency recently. A government task force looking into the actual condition of Indias elephants has recommended the formation of a national elephant conservation authority and funds for elephant conservation to the tune of Rs 600 crore in the 12th plan. It may come as a relief that elephants are at least visible, unlike the elusive tiger. There are real animals to look after. If the elephant landscapes recommended by the task force in five main elephant habitats do become a reality, the animals should flourish. Protecting their habitat and travel corridors would also mean protection for human beings. So far, these are just possibilities. Although hope springs eternal, penalties for encroachment into elephant corridors, for trade in elephants, or even for inadequate care in captivity, however promising they sound, may remain as ineffectual as have been the penalties for poaching.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The decline of morality
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE DECLINE OF MORALITY                          - Liberalization and globalization have increased greed        Commentarao   S.L. Rao                                                              
	A recent issue of a popular news magazine carried a cover story on the lifestyles of many well-to-do urban young people. It described a hedonistic life of late nights, intimacy between the sexes, expensive meals and other entertainment. These are the young people whose misguided parents give them a lot of spending money or some who hold highly paid jobs during the day and play hard afterwards. The National Council of Applied Economic Research publications show a decline in the numbers of the very poor and a rise in the numbers of the better-off. Inequalities in India are fewer than in China and other countries. However, the mental conditioning of avoidance of ostentatious consumption that prevailed till the early 1980s has gone. It is good that there is no longer a sense of guilt for spending on oneself but the ostentation it has brought to many is undesirable.        
	The opening of the economy from the time Rajiv Gandhi was prime minister to the wider opening under P.V. Narasimha Rao has made it possible to buy almost anything made elsewhere, at prices comparable to other countries. Consumption has become a mantra, especially for many young people. The credit-card culture that has easy credit for immediate consumption of almost any good or service led to the recent decline of the American economy, which got used to living on debt, both at individual and country levels. In a country with so many poor people, this creates enormous disparities in society. The influence of the media, especially the soaps on television, and the lifestyles depicted in the cinema, have all played a major role. The other strong influence, especially on the young, has been the globalization of information and ideas that the internet and cheap travel have made possible. Change is inevitable, but not if it also leads to a loss of compassion and to hedonism.              
	The counterpart of the allures of consumption is the desire for more money and more goods. Some have tried to get it the easy way through theft, swindling, and so on. Politicians and bureaucrats have used other underhand ways. When they are in government, they use the government machinery to determine policies and their interpretation of them to earn the highest underhand incomes. Businessmen help themselves by feeding these desires of those in government to get contracts and other favours which are worth a great deal.        
	As the second half approaches in the life of the present government in India, it has been repeatedly said that this one is the most corrupt government that India has ever had. This was said about the Indira governments, about H.D. Deve Gowda, Narasimha Rao, Rajiv Gandhi, A.B. Vajpayee and the United Progressive Alliance. Indira Gandhi is recognized as having institutionalized corruption. She did this by centralizing all major appointments in the government, the public sector and the academia. Her office had to be part of every major purchase decision by the government. Successor governments have built on her legacy. The National Democratic Alliance government took longer to learn the process, since many in it were new to power and to the mechanics of earning financial returns from power. But they learnt their lessons, although participation rates and earnings may have been lower than their predecessors.        
	Many of us expected that a diminished role for the government in economic decisions after economic liberalization would reduce the illegal opportunities for making money. Indeed, this happened in some instances, as in the lobbying for and auctioning of licences and permits which ceased after the abolition of licence-permit raj. When information technology made it possible to almost eliminate human interventions in many actions of government officials, we navely thought that would be the end of corruption. Certainly, railway ticket issues are more transparent as are airline tickets. In states like Karnataka, land records are less likely to be fudged. With competition in telecommunications, one no longer pays extra to get a telephone or a linesman to attend to a fault. Perhaps even traffic policemen will, over time, as use of information technology develops, not take a bribe in lieu of a large fine because a rider on a two-wheeler is not wearing a helmet, a driver or passenger in the front seat is not wearing a seat belt, a car jumps a red light, and so on.        
	But there are much larger sums to be made. For a few years the chairman of the National Highway Authority of India was changed almost every year. The reason was that all road contracts had then to go to the minister for approval. Similarly with environmental clearances: the minister some years ago took all the final decisions. Or take the sad story of our national carriers, which have in a short span lost their entire lustre. They are heavily in debt, losing vast sums, and are known to have lazy, indifferent and indisciplined employees. Yet the top management slot is always with a joint secretary. The fact that even when the airlines were haemorrhaging money through losses, valuable routes were surrendered to private airlines, and many brand new aircraft were ordered when other airlines were cutting orders, might be explained, since bureaucrats are more accustomed to bowing to the wishes of ministers. Defence contracts, project execution contracts and large purchases by public sector enterprises, city improvement programmes  there is much money to be made by the government decision-maker. Rarely does he and his political boss not make money.              
	A semi-literate chief minister of Jharkhand is said to have made thousands of crores and sent much of it abroad. So did a racehorse owner. Similarly, a small-town crook involved many politicians and bureaucrats in selling fake stamp papers for many years, milking governments of substantial revenues. Matters have reached such a stage that last years food inflation is suspected to have benefited associated ministers and bureaucrats at the cost of the health and nutrition of millions of people. The former held back the stocks with the government so that prices could keep going up. When they are to import wheat or sugar, they invariably inform the world so that international traders are able to rig prices.        
	Corruption in the government is all-pervasive and has affected eminent professionals as well. Chairmen of the two top regulatory bodies for medical and technical education have been charged with taking decisions regarding the recognition of substandard institutions  allegedly with money. The University Grants Commission is said to have given permission to many deemed universities, though they were not qualified. Hospitals, nursing homes, chemists, all are part of this suspected nexus with government regulatory and other officials, which allows the former to make extra money at the cost of patients.        
	This loss of moral values has accompanied economic liberalization and globalization. Neither can it be blamed for it has enabled India to become an economic powerhouse in the eyes of the world. But it is sapping the moral fabric of the country. Ostentatious consumption cannot be controlled by fiat unless we reverse to a licence-permit raj, with corruption but no economic growth. It needs a fiscal system that provides disincentives, a control on personal debt by regulators, and most importantly, the example set by leaders. Sadly we have none.

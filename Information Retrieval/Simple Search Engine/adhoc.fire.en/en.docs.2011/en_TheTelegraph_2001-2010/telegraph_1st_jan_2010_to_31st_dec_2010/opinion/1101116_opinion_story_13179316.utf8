                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPECTRUM EDGE                                                    
	The whole point about a tide, even in the affairs of men, is that it ebbs. The recently resigned Union telecommunications minister, A. Raja, evidently had not realized till the last minute that he had been caught in the ebb. The charge of corruption against him, relating to the allocation of 2G spectrum licences, has been around for quite a while. But firmly and vocally backed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief, M. Karunanidhi, and comfortable in the knowledge that the Congress would hesitate to upset the DMK, a substantial partner in the United Progressive Alliance, Mr Raja continued with his aggressive defence of honesty in spite of the comptroller and auditor generals damning report and the Supreme Courts displeasure with the Central Bureau of Investigation for dragging its feet.        
	The prime minister, however, was obviously determined to carry on with the clean-up operation the UPA has started. Reportedly concerned about the Congresss image that was lending substance to the continuous Opposition protests and consequently becoming the cause of disruptions of Parliament, Manmohan Singhs hand was strengthened by the offer of unconditional support from J. Jayalalithaa. The All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief offered 18 members of parliament in support of the UPA (the AIADMK has nine, the others she would persuade) should the DMK leave the coalition in the wake of Mr Rajas dismissal. That is, an implacable rivalry in state politics provided a crucial twist to politics at the Centre. Besides, the Supreme Courts displeasure lowered in the background. This convergence of circumstances helped, but Mr Singhs firmness also suggests that the momentum he has given to anti-corruption moves, as a leader should, has gathered steam. While the AIADMKs offer may have made some Congress leaders stop dithering, it was politely refused. By claiming the DMK as an old ally, who would surely understand the pressing need for Mr Rajas exit, the Congress was able to keep it on its side. The DMK has its own compulsions, anxious as it is about the forthcoming assembly elections. It would rather that the Raja scandal was put well behind it and that the AIADMK did not gain an upper hand with the UPA. Whatever Mr Raja might have been able to achieve when he caught the tide at its full, the sudden ebb runs deep.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STORM CENTRE                                                    
	The recent siege of a hotel in downtown Srinagar was intended to revive an image of the valley that is slowly fading out from public memory. With a 25 per cent drop in militancy-related violence since 2008, two successful elections on its slate, a popular government in place, a steady withdrawal of armed forces and a revival of tourism, Jammu and Kashmir is beginning to resemble any other state in India. That this has caused enough worry to interested parties across Indias borders is evident. Infiltration has increased alarmingly over the past year and a half, and violations across the line of control have been stepped up with impunity, as if to keep pace. The storming of the hotel in Srinagar  conducted in a style that has become familiar post-Mumbai  is a part of this pattern of cross-border activity targeted to hinder the return of normalcy. Undoubtedly, the projection of Kashmir as a war zone has innumerable benefits. Apart from undermining the political process set afoot by the Indian government, it could also get the international community to believe that it needs to refocus attention on Kashmir to solve the riddle in Afghanistan. Little wonder that intelligence intercepts along the border have picked up indications of serial infiltrations being planned.         
	Given the designs, the government of India should have its task cut out. It will be foolhardy to assume that the situation calls for troop redeployment in the state. The Omar Abdullah administration has stressed the need for an increased role of the police in the maintenance of law and order in the state. If the operation against the militants in the Srinagar hotel is any indication, the state police seem to be doing a laudable job. The return to normalcy also calls for a look at the Special Armed Forces Act and an acceleration of the all-inclusive political process, which India has initiated. The success of a dialogue, of course, is incumbent on the sincerity of the parties involved in the process. India cannot make any headway without the sincere participation of all parties in Kashmir, particularly the Hurriyat, which is already showing signs of fatigue. Perhaps it is also time to reopen the dialogue with Pakistan. Indias intractability, so far, has been unable to reform Pakistans habits and has given its neighbour an obvious advantage over it in the international arena.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PARTY FORCE                                                    
	A half-veiled senior policeman sitting at his desk and complaining to the press that a junior officer did not listen to him regarding as critical a matter as the risks facing the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp in Shilda is an unprecedented and ridiculous phenomenon. But with its backdrop of hideous tragedy, the police officers act is singularly lacking in humour. There is no doubt that the behaviour of the special inspector-general (EFR), Benoy Chakraborty, violated every rule of professional correctness. Mr Chakraborty must have known that what he was doing would lay him open to any action the authorities thought fit. And also that covering his face would make him laughable. A police force cannot allow this kind of public breach of discipline among its senior officers. But, while measures against the special IG need to be undertaken, it also has to be asked why he decided to act so outlandishly.        
	Yet the government of West Bengal is no longer talking about show-causes and suspensions, but merely asking Mr Chakraborty for a few explanations. Ironically, it is precisely this kind of administrative spinelessness that emphasizes the lack of professional accountability Mr Chakraborty is complaining about. That the EFR camp in Shilda was retained in its vulnerable position in spite of various warnings allegedly to protect a group of Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders is a blatant illustration of the way the party has been using the police force as an extension of itself and in protecting its own interests. The truth of such allegations, or that of Mr Chakrabortys complaints that officers turned a deaf ear to his requests and instructions, is of less importance than the widespread perception of the partys dominance and the polices compliance. Even the self-absorbed state government cannot have missed the peoples anger. Especially since it is growing a distinct political edge. Yet the home minister of the state has not managed to visit the site of one of the most brutal Maoist killings of uniformed men, or talk to the bereaved. It so happens that he is also chief minister. The pusillanimous leadership exhibits a matchless combination of fear for partymen and apathy for others, an attitude Mr Chakraborty has underlined by covering his face. He needs to protect himself. So does everyone else perhaps, in a state where the police move only at the bidding of the dominant party.

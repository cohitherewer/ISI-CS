	Manjari Chakravartis exhibition of drawings, paintings and installations at Akar Prakar (Ecriture III... and a few other things, till November 30) captivates the viewer at the outset, even though Chakravartis motifs, symbols and metaphors are drawn from fairly conventional iconographic traditions. There is a surreal allure to her work, which uses highly sexualized imagery: phallic cacti, bloodied petals, vagina dentata, floating spermatozoa, ovarian clusters. We move through a visceral wonderland of sorts, with the solitary figure of a woman, like a dystopian Alice, trailing us. Interspersed with the finely cross-hatched colours are words and phrases, enclosed within thought-bubbles, as if mumbled in a dream: phallus, bogus, priapus, fungus, octopus... the thread trails off into ennui, but not before leaving behind the resonance of two unspoken syllables: callous. Born, exclaims another drawing; we are tempted to fill in: forlorn. Between the artist and the viewer, a playful bond is created, as deadpan banter and prurient humour come together to form a secret code that runs through this show.        
	In her paintings, Chakravarti is more unabashedly intense, as she sheds the vestiges of frivolity to hit out with maximum effect. Shorn of the jokey interface, art and life merge into one little mass of fears, doubts and confusions. Look not into the abyss or else the abyss will look into you, warns a pen-and-ink drawing, showing a lonesome girl peering into the void from the top of a cliff. The same composition is also realized in acrylic, where the insistent warning, repeated like an incantation on the drawing, is replaced by a fierce medley of black and white strokes. In Earth, a minuscule human form, alone under a sky streaked with blue and red, heightens the barrenness of the surroundings (picture). At the still centre of Chakravartis work is this bleak solitariness, a vision of life in which the individual must reject the comfort of daily consolations, immerse herself in a ritual of relentless self-scrutiny, and tie up the odds and ends of collective life to the deepest structures of her thought. Art is cerebral, believes Chakravarti, there are no two ways about it.        
	In the final body of work, where found objects are assembled within wooden boxes, the artist gives shape to the fancies that cling on to real memories. Fragments from the ongoing life of reading, thinking, speaking, making, breaking, loving and hating are gathered into these exquisite cabinets of curiosities, just as facts, fictions and fantasies get tucked away into the nooks and crannies of our heads.

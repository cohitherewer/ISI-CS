Nayar                        Pleasant exchange				                                             
	India has set the bar high at the United Nations. Last Friday, when Hardeep Singh Puri, Indias permanent representative to the UN, hosted a reception in honour of the external affairs minister, S.M. Krishna, the British foreign secretary, William Hague, was the first guest to arrive at the Indian mission in New York. The previous day, Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, had sought out Krishna in the UN general assembly and regretted that he could not attend the reception since he would be returning to Moscow the following morning.        
	In all, nearly 40 foreign ministers attended Puris reception in honour of Krishna. That was more than three times their number at a similar reception at Indias permanent mission to the UN last year. The last two weeks of September make up a fortnight during which the diplomatic scene in the Big Apple is at the height of its activity. In the opening days of the general debate of the annual UN general assembly, when New York draws anything between 100 to 150 kings, presidents and prime ministers, there are some 40 to 50 receptions every evening in the Turtle Bay area near Manhattans East River.         
	Since the guest list is more or less the same for all these galas, the standing of each country is measured in proportion to the visiting dignitaries each can draw to its receptions. Going by this yardstick, which is often an indicator of the influence a country has on the global agenda, and which determines access for its diplomats, Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs decision to skip the UN general assembly two years in a row and let Krishna take his place has been a wise one.              
	When the prime minister is on American soil  even if it is solely for multilateral diplomacy at the UN  the Indian ambassador in Washington feels compelled to host a huge reception for him in New York. No Indian American community leader can remember a prime ministerial visit to New York when such a dinner reception for 600 to 700 people was not held. In recent years, they have come to be held in one of the grand ballrooms of the opulent Waldorf Astoria hotel on the east side of Manhattan. This figure of 600 to 700 guests is at least six times the number of people who are normally invited by the president of the United States of America for a White House dinner in honour of a visiting head of state or government. But if the ambassador did not organize such a reception, there would be complaints from Indian Americans  who travel from coast to coast in the US for this dinner  that the prime minister was being kept in seclusion from his people.        
	Actually, these receptions by the ambassador in honour of the prime minister have been a complete waste of time, money and effort. Because the invitees are so many, there are the inevitable hassles of what amounts to crowd management. Nobody really gets to meet the prime minister except for a few seconds as the guests are taken in procession to shake hands with him. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who revelled in being with crowds, regaled these large Indian American audiences with his wit and his oratory in poetic Hindi. But no other prime minister in recent years has appeared to enjoy such receptions, often on an evening when the jet lag from the long flight from India is at its peak. Besides, for a prime minister who is in New York primarily for UN work at a time when diplomatic activity is at its peak, the reception held by the ambassador, to which only Indian Americans are invited, constitutes a complete waste of a precious evening which should be devoted to social interaction with leaders of other countries who are in New York for the general assembly.        
	By nominating the external affairs minister to take his place, the prime minister has ensured that the purpose for which the leader of the Indian delegation to the general assembly spends about a week in New York brings maximum returns for the countrys diplomacy. This year, Krishna has been the second most sought after foreign minister at the general assembly after Hillary Clinton of the US. The Indian mission to the UN has had requests from nearly 60 countries for bilateral meetings with Krishna.        
	Naturally, it has been humanly impossible for Indian diplomats to accommodate anywhere near that many requests, especially with 15 multilateral meetings on the ministers itinerary, some of them taking up almost three hours each day last week. And some of these meetings, such as the one of non-aligned foreign ministers or that of Commonwealth foreign ministers  with the controversial Commonwealth Games just round the corner  are so sacrosanct that India cannot give them a miss.        
	Last week, this columnist witnessed a rare experience for India as Krishna was shuttling from one bilateral meeting to another. He was accosted by the foreign minister of one country who pleaded with the external affairs minister to meet his prime minister, who was outside the elevator, for only two minutes. Krishna was already behind schedule, so Indian diplomats at the UN assured the interloper that he would, indeed, meet the head of government in question in a day or two. And they did arrange such a meeting in 48 hours.        
	The huge number of requests for sit-downs with Krishna is only partly explained by the reality that the external affairs minister can devote his entire time in New York for activities related exclusively to foreign policy. Apart from the ambassadors reception, successive prime ministers have been obliged to be at events such as a lunch at the New York Stock Exchange or meetings with businessmen.              
	The avalanche of requests for bilateral meetings is partly because Krishna is in New York this year as the head of delegation of a country which will take its seat in the UN security council for a two-year term from January 1, 2011. Indians have forgotten what it is like to be at the UNs high table: it has been nearly two decades since they experienced that heady feeling when they were consulted on every major global issue and wooed by every country which had something at stake in the security council. Instead, for 19 years New Delhis diplomats in New York have been running after their counterparts in security council member-states for protection for Indian interests on many issues. That is now set to change.        
	In fact, during this general assembly, India is being treated as if it is already in the security council. Last Friday, Krishna was among the foreign ministers who were specially invited by UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, to mobilize international support for a comprehensive peace agreement in Sudan, including a referendum and steps to end the catastrophic events in Darfur. Sure enough, Krishna went for the high-level meeting, in part, because India has over two billion dollars in investment at stake in the Sudan.        
	Among those who were at the Indian mission to honour Krishna on Friday was Pakistans permanent representative to the UN, Abdullah Hussain Haroon, who created ripples along with his Indian counterpart in the Big Apples diplomatic scene recently when they appeared together at the US Open to cheer the so-called Indo-Pak Express of tennis players  Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi.        
	In the earlier years, Pakistan sent middle-level diplomats from its mission for the Indian reception, not even its deputy permanent representative. Haroons was not a token appearance at the reception. He not only stayed almost till the end, but liberally gave interviews to every Indian television channel which sought his views.

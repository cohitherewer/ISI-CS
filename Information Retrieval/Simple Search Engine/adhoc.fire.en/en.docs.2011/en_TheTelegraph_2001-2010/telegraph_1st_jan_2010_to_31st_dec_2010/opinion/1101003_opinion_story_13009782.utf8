The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | verdict of the people
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        VERDICT OF THE PEOPLE                                                          
	The wisdom of the people is not derived from books. It is based part on emotion, part on experience and part on sound practical and common sense. It would be wholly erroneous to dismiss this wisdom as irrational. It may not be grounded in cold and clinical logic but it has its own reasoning which can be ignored only at ones own peril. This point is critical in a democracy, especially in a democracy like India where conventional education is not widespread, because the real basis of democracy is the wisdom of the people. The sagacity of the people of India has been evident since the announcement of the court verdict on the Ayodhya dispute. Among the people, there have been no murmurings of disapproval and discontent. A handful of graceless upholders of Hindutva have been trumpeting their triumph and an equally small number of self-styled defenders of secularism are bemoaning the passing of the secular fabric of India. The people of India have refused to be disturbed by either of those blank cannonades.        
	It would be simplistic to attribute this acceptance of the verdict by the people of India to what is often called Indian fatalism. On the contrary, the Indian people have chosen to accept the judgment. They have done so for three reasons. One is that with their common sense, they have realized that this is probably the best and viable solution to a problem that had for such a long time seemed without a resolution. The second is that their experience tells them that any verdict that was one-sided would carry with it the threat of violence and bloodshed. This is the last thing the Indian people want. They have been many times bitten and once shy. And the third reason is based on their emotions which inform them about Indias tradition of religious toleration and religious co-existence. The judgment has a fit with the Indian peoples common sense, experience and emotion. The courts order reflects and reinforces the wisdom of the people of India.        
	There is another broader context of change that should not be neglected in any discussion of the Indian peoples response to the Ayodhya verdict. An entirely new generation of Indian men and women for whom the masjid-mandir controversy and religious fanaticism have no relevance is part of Indias public opinion. This new generation is more conscious of the choices before it and how present choices will determine its future. It is eager to rid itself of past baggage, which was what the Ayodhya dispute represented for it. Its indifference to the verdict is eloquent. The judiciary, in trying to find a solution, has, perhaps unwittingly, touched a chord in the heart of this generation. The judgment heralds a new kind of India. This is why the people of India have accepted the verdict. In their acceptance lies the verdicts validation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A Pakistan tragedy
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A PAKISTAN TRAGEDY                          - Both in life and sport there are two contrasting universes        ASHOK MITRA                                                  
	If I make more money than the runs I score, I wont be able to sleep at night, quote, unquote: thus has spoken the worlds indisputably highest-earning cricketer of all times. Without question he has made the statement with the utmost sincerity. The problem, however, is with the unit of currency in which he has got accustomed to count his money. It is most probably a lakh of rupees. Even the idea of belonging to a world where this is the denominator used to measure income or expenditure is something beyond the wildest dream of the overwhelming mass of people in this country. A bifurcation of culture is the inevitable consequence. The milieu of those who think in terms of earning a crore or a lakh of rupees a day is legions apart from that of those compelled to count their income or outlay with a measly rupee as denominator.        
	Liberalization has, in the course of the past couple of decades, further widened the economic distance between these two milieus. It may be roughly the same neighbourhood, but some of those living in the area have grabbed the opportunities globalization has thrown open and prospered hugely, their income and assets have soared and soared. Dwellers of the jhoparpatty next door have missed the bus of liberalization and are stuck with a quantum of gross earnings which force them to be careful how they spend every 50-paise bit.        
	Two vastly separate universes, but they exist side by side. The inhabitants of one, busy piling money and even more money, do not have either the time or the inclination to cast their sight at the direction of the other universe situated right next to them; they, at best, nurture a feeling of absent-minded pity regarding their lesser neighbours. This indifference is, however, not reciprocated by the inmates of that other universe. Information technology in particular has breached the erstwhile communications barrier between diverse human settlements. Those living in the poor, desolate milieu watch with wonder and bafflement the jazzy mode of living of their fabulously rich neighbours. They have no part in the luxuries and indulgences that are integral to the lifestyle prevailing in the other universe abutting theirs. Mostly by the grace of the electronic media, the jhoparpatty residents, however, get to know everything about the mind-boggling goings-on in that other universe embodied in the catch-all expression, conspicuous consumption. Wonder invades the mind: why must such conspicuous consumption be the prerogative of only that small bunch of lucky people?        
	The query is easily answered: conspicuous consumption is a function of conspicuous earnings, earnings the size of which makes the eyes of the ordinary householders pop out. It is a closed circuit. Income of fabulous proportions paves the way for splashing money wildly and indiscriminately over a long, large range of luxury goods and services. At the same time, income generated through, for instance, endorsement of such goods and services adds to the flow of conspicuous income of those who do the endorsements. In a seemingly unending chain of two-way relationships, those who grow richer by this process spend yet more money on durable and non-durable luxury goods and services, thereby ensuring yet another round of extra earnings for the select few.        
	Till as long as those outside this charmed circle accept their own humble circumstances as an immutable datum  linked to their kismet  nobody need lose any sleep. Trouble arises only when the ones left out of the circuit are stirred into thinking about the state of affairs. Thinking leads to sulking: why should the opportunities to become fat cats and command enough purchasing power to buy those luscious goods and services advertised on the television screen not come to them? Some of the discontented form groups and begin to agitate, demanding higher wages from their employers who are distinguished members of the universe that defines arcadia. Economic liberalization has, however, effectively taken care of this nuisance of collective bargaining. The agitators are thrown out of their jobs and substituted by computers. The recalcitrants, instead of improving their lot, join the great reserve army of the unemployed.        
	The story could end here, but often does not. Some of those unable to reconcile themselves to the reality of two vastly different universes existing next to each other and badly wanting to disturb the status quo drift towards the direction of this or that genre of revolutionary praxis. A few amongst them disappear in the forests and the hills from where they venture out in sporadic offensives against the solidly entrenched concordat of the rich. Sometimes they are apprehended and charged with sedition.        
	There is another group of discontents taking the lawless road who make no pretence of being enamoured of a societal vision. This lot initially tries to beg, borrow or steal for acquiring the wherewithal that will enable them to have a whiff of the good life lived by the filthy rich. Some of them graduate from petty thievery to grand larceny. A handful even stray into forging documents, or floating bogus finance companies to collect some quick money. That is to say, they engage in criminal activities that invite severe punishment. Once caught and sentenced, they disappear behind prison walls; the good things in life remain beyond their reach.        
	These are things and events happening every day, in all societies where the distribution of income and assets is horribly askew. Attempts to rationalize the existence of two universes in the same society in terms of disparateness in such attributes as talent, faulty application and perseverance have usually few takers among the left-out multitudes.        
	The spin-off of the dichotomy in economic conditions often spills beyond national borders. Cricketers in Pakistan earn only piffle compared to the gross takings of the average run of Indian cricketers. With the Taliban threat looming large, foreign teams have stopped visiting the country and no international fixtures take place on Pakistans soil. The luxury consumer market, while flourishing, is limited in scale; the opportunity is therefore missed to develop a domestic circuit of conspicuous consumption leading to conspicuous earnings and conspicuous earnings in their turn leading to further conspicuous consumption. On select occasions, Pakistani players visit other countries and participate in Tests, ODIs and T20 matches. Their earnings, however, stay within modest contours. They play the same game of cricket as Indians do. Some of them display skill and proficiency matching those of the average Indian cricketer. And yet, relatively speaking, they remain a poor bunch. Suddenly a bookie arrives on the scene, he promises them astronomical sums of money in case the players agree to enter the esoteric world of match fixing and spot fixing; it is still possible to reach legendary levels of living and accumulate wealth of huge magnitude only if they condescend to go into the bookies parlour. One or two of the players cannot resist the temptation. The next stop is disaster.              
	The Pakistan cricket team has this summer played a four-match test series against England. It was comprehensively beaten in three of them and squeaked through to a victory in the other one. Nonetheless, it was no England player but an 18-year old brat from Pakistan who was adjudged the man of the series. This youngster, of the humblest background, possesses extraordinary natural talent, his swing bowling is out of this world. On the threshold of cricketing glory, he could have gone very far, winning laurels after laurels. He could have, in due course, come into pots and pots of money too. But the bookies captured him before he could get his breaks. The tragedy of Mohammad Amir in a way depicts the darkest side of globalization, and has cast a shadow on all lands and peoples with the philosophy of no-holds-barred instant money-making, never mind the modality.

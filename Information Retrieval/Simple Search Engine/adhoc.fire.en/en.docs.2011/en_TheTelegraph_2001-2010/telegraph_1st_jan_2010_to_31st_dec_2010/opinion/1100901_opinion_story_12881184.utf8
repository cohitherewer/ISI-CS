	Q:My husband and I jointly owned a flat which we later sold. My husband handed over the sale proceeds to me and I deposited it in a bank in my daughters and my names. I pay income tax on that deposit. Now he is demanding the money. Can he do that? Further, can either holder of a joint bank account remove the name of the other at will?        
	Name withheld                
	A: The facts stated by you reveal that your husband had voluntarily given the money to you. Since that money is now in the joint account held by you and your daughter, with you paying tax on it, your husband is not justified in claiming it.        
	Your bank will be able to guide you better regarding your second question since the answer would depend on banking rules and regulations.              
	Q:After an interview, my sister was told over the phone to join as a teacher in a government-aided higher secondary school on a temporary basis. But ever since she has joined, she has not been allowed to sign the attendance register meant for teaching and non-teaching staff. She has been assigned a separate register. Is this justified? The school authorities have also refused to issue any appointment letter. Can they do this?        
	Sobhan Roy, Calcutta                
	A: In the absence of any previous written contract or agreement, issuing an appointment letter is at the discretion of an organisation. Since your sister has joined on a temporary basis, the school in justified in withholding the appointment letter till it finally decides to make her permanent.               
	Q:I am 75 years old and a co-owner of our ancestral property. I am being harassed by my relatives and their children to give up my share. Am I entitled to the protection of life and property? What is the appropriate authority that I should approach in this regard?        
	Pankaj Ranjan Chowdhury, Calcutta                
	A: You could file a suit for declaration and injunction against your relatives before a civil court with the appropriate jurisdiction and obtain an order restraining them from committing any wrongful acts. A complaint to the police station is also advisable. You could also institute a criminal case against your relatives under Section 144 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code before the executive magistrate.

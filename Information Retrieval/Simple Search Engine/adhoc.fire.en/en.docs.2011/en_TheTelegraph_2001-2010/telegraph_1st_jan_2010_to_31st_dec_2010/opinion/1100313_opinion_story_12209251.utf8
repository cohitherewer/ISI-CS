	The deed is about to be done. Reserved seats for women have climbed from buses up to the Rajya Sabha; time will show whether they will spread further. There may be differences between buses and the Parliament, but the reservation of 33 per cent of seats for women in legislative bodies is fascinating enough by itself. Just the arithmetic, for instance. In ardent political speeches, the ignorant public is repeatedly told that women are half the sky. So the logic behind the one-third quota remains quite impenetrable. The nation has also been told that the quota is to encourage more women to join politics and induce them into positions of decision-making. Certainly the Parliament could do with more of a feminine touch. But who decided that one-third is the perfect fraction to modulate the virility in parliamentary policy-making  that flawless seasoning, that nonpareil icing? Puzzling this one out may be as intricate as working out why women have to be encouraged to join politics with a one-third reward. Are they two-thirds less able than men?        
	The way anti-reservation arguments are countered is delightfully self-contradictory. One-third of seats have been reserved for women in local bodies for years now, and many women are doing excellently. So why stick to one-third? If reservation is the States gift, what keeps it so stingy? Only some women are used as fronts by the politically minded males in their households. Naturally. Women are not a homogeneous lump, any more than minority communities are. Some can fight their circumstances, some cannot. The difference only proves that empowerment cannot be rammed down anyones throat; it needs laying the ground through education and exposure, through social opportunities often cut short by minor marriage, labour, psychologically crippling violence both physical and mental, and an ambience of devaluation sometimes crowned with the killing of unborn daughters. But the States conscience is clear: there are laws against all these horrors, just as there may soon be reserved seats for women in legislative bodies. Two and two make empowerment, surely?        
	But only for one-third. This 14-year-long drama has merely acted out Indias basic inability to see women as equal. Now the greatest mischief is about to happen  making inequality official. Yet no woman, given the same opportunities as men, will ever need a quota to get where she wants. That is also cause for insecurity. If the number of seats for women is not limited to one-third, maybe they will take over Parliament one day. A woman sitting in a general seat in a bus is told, directly or indirectly, to go to the seat reserved for her. What more can she want than this unfair gender privilege? Will the same thing happen in legislative bodies? More sinister, female foeticide and neglect of the female child have already skewed the sex ratio in the country. Perhaps these will now be legitimized to make sure that the one-third reservation becomes practically and arithmetically rational.

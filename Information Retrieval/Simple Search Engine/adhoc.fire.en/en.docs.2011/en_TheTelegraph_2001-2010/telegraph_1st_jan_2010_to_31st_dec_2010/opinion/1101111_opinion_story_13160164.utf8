	The most amazing development is taking place here. The former Red Guards of the Cultural Revolution are now apologizing to their teachers for having insulted them then.        
	When Mao launched his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in 1966, he encouraged the Red Guards, groups of students who swore allegiance to his ideology, to be at the forefront of this movement aimed at breaking with Chinas feudal past. The symbol of the Cultural Revolution was the Red Guard with red armband and military cap, holding Maos Little Red Book, the Communist Party flag in the background. These youngsters marched through the country deciding who was deviating from the correct revolutionary line. Even people who had fought for liberation along with the Red Army were not spared. With a board saying capitalist roader hung around their necks, these reactionaries were made to kneel in front of people shouting curses at them, beg forgiveness, spat upon and assaulted. They would then be sent off to the countryside to be reformed through labour.        
	A few weeks ago, this part of the Cultural Revolution was reversed in Beijing. The Red Guards, now in their 60s, publicly apologized to the teachers they had insulted then. The occasion was the 50th anniversary celebrations of a famous, old school. According to one newspaper report, it had earlier been decided that a minutes silence would be observed in memory of the teachers who had died during the Cultural Revolution. But so pleasant was the mood as former students and teachers met that the minutes silence was replaced with the compre regretting that the principal could not attend. Beaten up in 1966, the principal had committed suicide in 1968.        
	It was at students reunions over the years that these former Red Guards would discuss their past conduct. Some had gone on to become teachers themselves. Most felt that only a face-to-face apology would atone for what they had done. Over the last year, some wrote out these apologies and presented them to their teachers, bowing low for forgiveness.                
	Human again        
	Two such letters were put up on the alumni website of a school, setting off similar responses from ex-Red Guards. The 86-year-old teacher wrote back, saying that the students had been victims too, confused, afraid and under pressure. At the anniversary function, this teacher, who recalled having been prevented from shouting Long live Chairman Mao because she was considered a capitalist roader, wrote in the guest book, I love this school. It gave me wonderful memories.        
	However, for another teacher, the memories of those days come back as nightmares. Diagnosed with depression ten years ago, and now with dementia, the 79-year-old sometimes imagines someone coming through the window to conduct a criticism session against her, and cries out at night, Dont beat me. As her student knelt before her, she sat vacant-eyed. But for her husband, the apology meant a lot. For her student, too, the apology was a catharsis. For the first time, he spoke of what he had done then, describing to a reporter the details of his teachers humiliation: her head had been shaved and she had been dragged out of her house to kneel on a tiny stool, then beaten. Ironically, in 1974, after the tumult of the Cultural Revolution had died down, this teacher had been able to tease this student about his daring conduct. The real effect of this conduct became evident only years later.         
	We were all participants of history who didnt know the truth. How much historical responsibility should each one of us individually bear? asked one former Red Guard, and answered herself: I used to be a slave, but now I want to be a human.

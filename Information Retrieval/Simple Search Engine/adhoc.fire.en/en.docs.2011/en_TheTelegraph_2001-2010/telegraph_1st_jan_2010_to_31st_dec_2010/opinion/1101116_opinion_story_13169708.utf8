                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	When heads roll                  
	Sir  Soon after President Barack Obama left India, two Congress members were ousted from the party, presumably on orders from Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh (Also gone: Ashok and Suresh, Nov 10). The chief minister of Maharashtra, Ashok Chavan, handed in his resignation, and Suresh Kalmadi, head of the organizing committee for the recently-concluded Commonwealth Games, was asked to step down.          
	This latest development may have derailed the Oppositions strategy, but it also indicates how corrupt the countrys political class has become. The decline of ethics and moral probity is a continuing narrative in India, which is believed to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Members of the party in power think nothing of diverting public funds into private accounts. The people of India deserve better. A certain amount of integrity must be restored in public life.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  The chief minister of Maharashtra, Ashok Chavan, resigned from his post after details of the Adarsh Housing Society scam became known to the public. The whole incident reflects the rot that has set in the ranks of the Congress and the government of Maharashtra. The state administration is in a shambles and its infrastructure is extremely weak.           
	The chief ministers resignation was ordered to save the Congresss honour. But Chavans departure will only lead to another, equally corrupt, politician taking his place. It is imperative that the Congress takes measures to weed out corruption from the party. By failing to bring about positive changes in the state, the party has eroded the goodwill of the people of Maharashtra.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

      
	Sir  Ashok Chavan has, quite rightly, been made to resign because of his involvement in the Adarsh property scam. However, the comptroller and auditor general of India has also spoken out strongly against the former Union telecom minister, A. Raja, who was one of the chief perpetrators of the 2G spectrum scam. This scam cost the country a stupendous Rs 1.76 lakh crore. It was on a much larger scale than the Adarsh property scam, which cost Chavan his post.          
	Yet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his party president, Sonia Gandhi, were hesitant about removing Raja from power since, at the moment, the Congress needs the support of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to retain its majority in the coalition government. Nevertheless, upholding the rule of law and protecting the countrys interests should be top priorities. The Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been clamouring for Rajas removal, will surely welcome the news of his resignation.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K. Venkataraman, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  In recent times, major controversies have been unearthed to show the United Progressive Alliance government in a poor light. These include the 2G spectrum and the Adarsh Housing Society scams as well as allegations that funds allocated for the Commonwealth Games were appropriated by those in power. Corruption in the corridors of power, among politicians, bureaucrats, the judiciary and the military, has become rampant. Removing Ashok Chavan and Suresh Kalmadi from their posts appears to be an attempt by the Congress to save its face.          
	Even if cases are filed, it is unusual for political leaders to be punished for corruption. Most of the cases are manipulated by the political party in power and the inquiry reports on corruption are not made public. Moreover, the legal processes in the country are painfully slow. Those accused of corruption should be brought to book by fast-track courts and punished severely. That is the only way corruption can be eradicated from this country.           
	In many instances, black money is invested in real estate or stored in foreign banks. The government should monitor such investments and recover funds from the foreign banks. The powerful and corrupt have been getting richer by the day. It is commendable that the government has finally taken measures to investigate corrupt practices and put an end to them. Perhaps this will ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth in this country in future.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh must be congratulated for sacking Ashok Chavan and Suresh Kalmadi so promptly after Barack Obamas departure. Unfortunately, the Congress does not have a clean image at present. The party president and the prime minister should take bold steps to address this problem. Not only should all the corrupt members be removed, but thorough investigations should also be made into the charges of corruption.           
	The countrys domestic organizations, like the the Central Bureau of Investigation and the income tax department, should be involved in this. If needed, foreign organization could also be roped in, since thousands of crores have been siphoned off and deposited in various banks outside India.                     
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNNATURAL LAW                                                          
	Incredible as it may sound, Pope Benedict XVI, best known for his distaste for unnatural practices like homosexuality and abortion, has found himself in the same league as British liberals. More baffling is the common ground between these arch-enemies  the equality bill, framed by Harriet Harman, a Labour politician, and denounced by the pope as running against natural law. In its attempt to consolidate 116 acts, regulations and codes of practice under a single enactment, the bill smacks of a nave idealism. Fortified with surreal economic policies and draconian measures, it sets to iron out the rough edges of society in one drastic sweep. Under the bills levelling gaze, Britain is expected to regain that lost paradise  a perfectly just society  where the rich and poor, men and women, straight and gay people, will live happily ever after.        
	There is indeed an Orwellian quality to Ms Harmans zealous enterprise. Apart from its grand plans to redraw the economic map, the bill denies religious organizations the right to discriminate against job seekers on grounds of sexual orientation, gender or marital status. The Catholic Church and its adoption agencies, which routinely refuse homosexuals employment or the right to adopt, have been infuriated by this proposal and condemned it as an immoderate expression of State control. While the removal of prejudices is laudable, a modern democracy has to also grapple with the delicate issue of the freedom of choice. The pope has invoked this fundamental liberty, arguing that the bill violates the natural law upon which the equality of all human beings is grounded. Typically, it has not occurred to him that the discriminations abetted by the church defy these very ideals of universal brotherhood that he rests his faith on. The church has the authority to use its discretion on a case-by-case basis while accepting someone into its fold or giving away a child for adoption, but to put a blanket ban on select communities or to refuse to clarify the grounds of its rejection is to demand immunity from the juridico-political framework that governs a modern society. If the church decides not to hire a non-Catholic cleaner, it must be able to prove convincingly, if challenged in a court of law, that the candidate was disqualified on no other ground than his abilities.        
	The equality bill sets out to do the right thing but hits against its own self-righteousness early on. Instead of imposing strictures on the Catholic Church, it should have kept the possibility of debate and dissent alive. Modern-day Britain is irredeemably multicultural. Hasty attempts to straighten out its plural character would only result in outrage and a deepening of differences. In any event, if the equality bill really follows its ambitious design to its logical conclusion, then its desire to control religious bodies should not stop with the Catholic Church. In its quest to restore equal dignity to all human beings, will it ever try to force mosques to hire openly gay imams?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | saying sorry
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SAYING SORRY                                                    
	It is not every day that the prime minister of a nation personally apologizes to a supporter of his party for making an indiscreet remark. Although democracy  being a government for the people by the people of the people  makes room for such exceptional gestures, one rarely hears of a head of State driving over to the home of a potential voter, and spending close to an hour with her saying sorry for a comment that became publicly audible by sheer fluke. Gordon Brown, the incumbent British prime minister, met a 65-year-old pensioner, Gillian Duffy, while campaigning for the general elections scheduled this week. Ms Duffy, a lifelong Labour supporter, cornered the not-so-loquacious Mr Brown and hurled at him a barrage of questions and comments on a range of issues, including illegal immigration into Britain from eastern Europe. The prime minister, who is neither a charming man of the people nor known to be a skilful campaigner, heard her out before getting into his car. Once safely inside, he let himself go, calling Ms Duffy a bigoted woman, forgetting that a microphone was still attached to his body. As his remark was broadcast, Mr Brown, whose own views on immigration are rather ambiguous, to say the least, faced an outraged nation, which forced an abject apology from him. As he sought forgiveness from Ms Duffy, Mr Brown described himself as a penitent sinner.        
	Exceptional circumstances demand exceptional responses. Mr Brown quickly realized the dangerous potential of his gaffe and went on an all-out damage control spree. However, instead of good intentions and the triumph of democracy, one tends to read into his self-flagellating response a tone of pathetic desperation. With David Cameron and the Tories back in full swing, and the looming threat imposed by the young and charismatic Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, chances of a resurgent Labour are already flickering. Mr Browns apology, in this context, looks more like a last-ditch effort of a man trying to clutch at any available straw to save himself and his party from being completely washed away. There is, however, a lesson of sorts in this episode for India, where the majority of political workers, let alone high-ranking officials or ministers, find it unthinkable to humiliate themselves in such a way before the people they serve.

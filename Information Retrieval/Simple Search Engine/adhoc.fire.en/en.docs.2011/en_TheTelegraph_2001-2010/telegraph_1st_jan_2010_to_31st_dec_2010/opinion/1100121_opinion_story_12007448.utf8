The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | State of fear
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STATE OF FEAR                                                    
	A failed State is not all about wrong policies or bad administration, it is a condition in which the people lose faith in the States ability to secure their lives and property. That, precisely, is the situation in which both the rich and the poor live in Jharkhand. It has been so for many areas in large parts of the state. Now, even Jamshedpur, the richest  and once the safest  city in Jharkhand, faces the same trauma. Last years official crime statistics of the city are enough to strike terror in the hearts of the most fearless  102 murders, 21 dacoities, 624 robberies and about 3,200 other incidents of a criminal nature. The fact that the criminals are rarely arrested emboldens them as much as it deepens the peoples fear. The worst fear for the people in Jamshedpur and elsewhere in the state is that the administration has lost both the will and the power to control crime. Repeated appeals by professionals, businessmen and other sections of the people to the administration have made no difference to the crime scene and the fear psychosis. The economic impact of all this in a mineral-rich but poverty-stricken state is already proving to be catastrophic. Big investors whose plans promised to give Jharkhand a new beginning are as caught in the web of fear as the ordinary people.        
	Two factors are usually cited to explain Jharkhands chilling crime scene  the Maoist violence and the political vacuum. Both these have wreaked havoc on peace and the rule of law in the state for several years. But a more important factor is not adequately stressed  the police and other sections of the administration have nearly given up the fight against lawlessness. The political vacuum has been filled, at least for now, by a new, popularly-elected government under Shibu Soren. But unstable coalitions and their self-seeking partners have caused more problems for the state than they have tried to tackle. The police and the civil servants owe it to the taxpayer to do their duty irrespective of the politicians games. It is not just a question of public morality; they have a constitutional and legal obligation to uphold the rule of law. New Delhi too cannot let Jharkhand continue in its dangerous drift. The Constitution lists law and order as a state subject, but its collapse in one state can have dangerous consequences for other parts of the country, especially those that face the worst Maoist threat.

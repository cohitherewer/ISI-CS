The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Quiet confrontation
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        QUIET CONFRONTATION                                  VISUAL ARTS: Rita Datta                                                  
	If computer software like Photoshop and CorelDraw continues to win over new converts among young artists, no obituary needs to be posted yet of the traditional printmaking methods: lithography, woodcuts, etching, and so on. Because, as is seen in Studio 21s current show, on till May 29, the new and the old coexist in the works of the seven artists presented, six of them around 30.        
	The first one you must take note of is Dhrupadi Ghosh, who gets herself photographed in performance cameos and doctors the prints digitally. Which, of course, means that her work involves a two-step process. Interestingly, the series presented here, called Pardon Silence (left), declares a debt to the Iranian photographer, filmmaker and video artist, Shirin Neshat. Ghoshs liberal use of script  Roman letters but written like Devnagri  her preference for black and white, the reference to silence, all indicate the Iranians presence. Indeed, one of the prints comes across as a tribute, composed in a way that recalls Neshats stunning Rebellious Silence. But its stifling intensity  a result of the exiles dichotomous involvement with a troubled land and its culture  is, understandably, missing.        
	Rebellious postures, possibly with feminist undertones, seem to be at the core of Ghoshs art, however. That, and a combative socio-political conciousness, seen in a series of cards pasted on the walls of, ahem, the toilet: there has to be a little of neo-Dada in most young artists these days, hasnt there?        
	As promising is Sujay Mukherjee, a conceptual artist, who offers a kind of institutional critique by calling attention to an outside area behind three gallery walls. It cuts off exhibition space and separates one room from another, but is blocked from view and, of course, from use, for its the staircase landing. This unspoken restriction underlines how the order of architectural space, as a given, conflicts with the art space. It prompts from him a gesture of intervention: punching holes  virtual ones, that is  into the two facing walls of the two gallery rooms to forge an invisible link. This he does through a pair of prints pasted on the opposite walls to reconstruct for the viewer what he would see from each room if he were to look through an actual hole.        
	Gullivers Travels, his 18-second animation hinting at flights of fantasy and the negative instinct of aggrandizement, is amusing in its tone of wry self-deprecation. As a Lilliputian girl dances about on a table and then on the artists palm, her hair whipped by the wind, the soundtrack goes from James Bond beats of suspense to Rabindrasangeet.        
	Riddhi Narayan Nandys computer graphics are striking in their optical dynamics and strident colours. Horizontal seams of bright tones, like geological layers, sear across fields of flat colours, or run in waves and whirls. One, with intersecting eddies of colour bands, suggests the wobbly images of trick mirrors, while another has cunningly arranged vertical stripes imitating the soft folds of cloth.                  
	Now for the traditional prints. Woodcuts dont come this size: 54 x 48 and 66 x 48. But Srikanta Paul seems to have relished the challenge. More catchy is his wall installation, Shekarer Katha (About Roots), bearing inevitable echoes of Nam June Paik. Made of numerous small, rectangular cubes, it portrays visual experience as fleeting, fractured, fragmentary. The cubes, lit up from behind, fade in and out to show a montage of tiny pictures: eyes and the artists yawning mouth, the Altamira bison, Aztec sculpture, faces, and so on, evoking a minefield of references relevant to his search for roots.        
	Annabel Schenck, from Paris, and Jaysree Basak are both inspired by Nature, but in different ways. A sawed-off section of a tree trunk, its middle gouged out, is hung up by Schenck, inviting viewers to peer through the hole at a backdrop of a twilight zone. But its Natures fine inscription on the surface of the slab  replicated in her prints  and the seductive tactility of the parent tree that prove engaging. Basaks poetic imagination combines leaves  dried to their gossamer webbing  and stylized curlicues to summon the wonder of the wilds.        
	Inviting in its basic geometry, rich in its layered connotations, the chair as art subject and design object has quite a lineage. And the theme of Santanu Chakrabortys lithos is the chair, although a tree also features in two prints, its bleeding roots trying to hold on to the ground, like talons (right). The stark contrasts of the palette  red, white, black  and the terse compositions conspire to recreate the chair into arresting, quietly confrontational visuals.

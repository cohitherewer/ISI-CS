	There are revealing contrasts in perceptions on both sides of the border of the Shoaib-Sania marriage and of Jaswant Singhs book on Jinnah. Equally a sign of the times, at the Indian briefing in Washington on the recent Manmohan Singh-Barack Obama meeting, there were as many as 30 direct or indirect references to Pakistan, and 11 out of 13 questions from the media related to Pakistan. If the spokesperson had rejected questions on Pakistan because the actual subject of the press conference was the crucially important question of nuclear disarmament, that would have left only her opening statement and two questions: one about Obamas visit to India and the other on sanctions against Iran. Despite its plausible claim to be a major regional and budding global power, India and its media have unwittingly contrived to buttress Pakistans claims to parity and special status by making it the core issue in foreign policy.        
	India has multiple grave concerns regarding Pakistan, including its blatant complicity in terrorism, its nuclear threats, its assertion of primacy in Afghanistan, and the absence of the monitoring of military assistance to Pakistan. Nevertheless, over the decades, Indian leaders have consistently spoken of friendship with Pakistan. We want Pakistan to live in peace... and to have the closest ties with us, said Nehru in 1948. A stable, secure and prosperous Pakistan is in Indias interest; India sincerely wishes Pakistan well, declared the former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in 1999. I have stated it several times, declared Manmohan Singh last year, that the dialogue with Pakistan is a necessity. We are neighbours and we cant choose our neighbours. I sincerely believe it is in our vital interest therefore to try again to make peace with Pakistan... if leaders of Pakistan have the courage, the determination and the statesmanship to take this road to peace, I wish to assure them that we will meet them more than half way.              
	These gestures of Indian statesmen across the political spectrum are matched by efforts of well-meaning individuals and organizations for bilateral rapprochement. There have been innumerable sponsored people-to-people contacts, Track 2, back-channels both officially arranged and unofficial, the never-ending Neemrana process, and events facilitated and paid for by benefactors from the West. Pakistani diplomats in the capital are socially feted and cultural and sporting visitors from Pakistan are uncritically applauded, apparently because they have honoured us with their presence. But the cruel fact is that all these connections have not improved our bilateral ties one whit. There are, doubtless, some elements of Pakistani society that desire better relations with India; their dulcet words appear on our television screens and in newsprint. But they do not count for anything; Pakistans civil society is solidly behind the army.        
	An analysis of four India-Pakistan crises which led to war or near-war situations between 1986 and 2002 concluded that for the most part, neither side had a sure grasp of each others fears and hopes... they are still on a learning curve. Attempts to resolve or manage differences between India and Pakistan have foundered on mutual suspicion, and the same will apply to agreements reached through any back-channel. Commitments are not deliverable; words are not matched by deeds; the public in neither country has been sensitized to the need for concessions. India considers process to be a substitute for progress, while Pakistan has engaged in double-dealing. Each setback is followed by recrimination and a repetition of painful history. Despite this, Indian leaders persist in professing that, with our shared history and culture and through living in such close proximity, each side understands the other very well. Although Nehru stated that we have known each other too long to be indifferent neighbours, there is enough evidence to suggest that this assumption is a profound misjudgment that has led to dangerous consequences. The long stand-offs in North and South Korea and Greek and Turkish Cyprus reveal that common culture and history open no doors to common understanding.        
	Pakistans foreign policy is dictated by issues of national identity, in compensation for the lack of a history and a clearly defined sense of nationhood. Central to its identity is confrontation with India. Having been conceived not in any anti-colonial struggle but in opposition to the Indian nationalist movement, Pakistan tries to overcome this negative legacy of identity. Based on Jinnahs insistence on the equality of the nations of Hindus and Muslims, Pakistan seeks to assert itself not merely as not India but also as a country on par with India, seeking military parity, nuclear weapons, and equality in every bilateral issue, especially Kashmir. This primordial rivalry, defying the asymmetry with a neighbour more powerful in every respect, impels it to seek succour from big powers and display its need for external validation and recognition of special status. Determined to free itself from a Muslim minority narrative in contrast to a Hindu majority, the desire to emulate Indian nationhood and play a role disproportionate to its actual power is fundamental to Pakistans self-perception. It apes Indias claim to regional status, especially in relation to Afghanistan, and presses its claim as a first among equals in the Muslim world  a pretence that caused King Farouk of Egypt to sniff sardonically that Pakistan would have us believe it invented Islam in 1947.        
	Pakistan is predicated on the contrast between Indian secularism and a Muslim nation shaped by the rhetoric of Partition that contracted out of the Indian Union. Pakistans most facile option of emphasizing its identity is to oppose Indias historical precedence and Hindu identity, with Jinnah setting the tone by referring not to India, but to Hindustan. The fact that Pakistans boundaries with Afghanistan and India are in dispute adds to the discomfiture of its sovereign identity. Conflict with India is an existential issue, and the definition of Pakistans Muslim identity is most emphasized under military dictatorships. Pakistanis claim there exists a national consensus on Kashmir because its Muslim identity acquires meaning only in opposition to India. Jinnah visited Kashmir but once and underestimated the role that it was to play in Pakistans search for national identity. As long as Kashmir remains excluded, the communal project that defined Pakistan remains incomplete, though the secession of Bangladesh in 1971 forced a rethink and Kashmir was thenceforward portrayed as a sacred Muslim homeland awaiting liberation through jihad. To divert attention from shortages rooted in gross internal mismanagement of water resources, Pakistani extremists lately have added a water jihad to the hate chorus against India.        
	Despite wars and military stand-offs, dialogue has been kept precariously alive, and some major agreements have resulted. Yet, for Pakistan, opposition to India is intrinsic to what it means to be Pakistani, since identity is dependent on the obsession with, and challenge to, Hindu India; the fiction that Indian Muslims, the paramount power in the region over six centuries, had achieved parity with Hindus; and the creation of two equal states in 1947 validated this contention. A further fiction is that India at worst rejects the rationale of a Pakistani State and at best grudgingly accepts its reality. Nuclear weapons have given Pakistan more confidence to pursue support for terrorists, Indian dissidents and the proxy war with greater impunity. In a demented bid for parity, Pakistan deludes itself that India is so fragile and rife with internal differences that it will break apart and its economic progress be halted under the onslaught of terrorism. Nonetheless, there is never likely to be a P in BRIC, IBSA, BASIC or G-20.              
	Curiously, the only Pakistani leader in history who has reciprocated his Indian counterparts appeal for peace and cooperation has been the much-derided Asif Ali Zardari. In 2008, in three interviews with the TV journalist, Karan Thapar, he declared readiness to commit to no-first-use of nuclear weapons. He called for Kashmir to be put on the back-burner, like the Sino-Indian border, till the time was ripe for its settlement, and for increased trade which would develop more interaction and thus greater trust. He thought every Pakistani had something of India in him and every Indian something of Pakistan, and declared, after 26/11, that all Pakistanis are Mumbaikars. Zardari broke the mould at considerable risk to himself: now his power has diminished to vanishing point and he has never again given an interview to the Indian media.        
	In dealing with the Pakistan incubus, India must navigate strategically between pragmatism and wishful thinking. It is well to have no permanent friends nor permanent enemies, but permanent interests demand that a country recognizes and understands the inalienable characteristics that determine the perspectives, prejudices and policies of both allies and adversaries.

	Brave bride                  
	Sir  The bold step taken by the 20-year-old bride in Durgapur to protest against dowry deserves accolades (Rubbing off sindoor, girl revolts against dowry, March 12). She is an inspiration for us all. It is amazing that a young girl who is just a Madhyamik graduate had the guts to walk out of her marriage venue because the grooms family was demanding a huge dowry. However, it would have been better if she had contacted some womens organization or the local committee right at the beginning of the dowry negotiations between her father and the grooms family. The dowry had been fixed at Rs 2 lakh, of which Rs 1.85 lakh had already been paid at the time of the marriage ceremony.           
	The family of the groom, Sanjoy Bagdi, threatened a walkout when the father of the girl failed to raise the remaining Rs 15,000. This shows that the give-and-take of dowry had been accepted as a matter of course by the families of both the bride and the groom. There would probably have been no protest had the brides father not failed to arrange for the outstanding amount. Hence there is no reason to conclude from the incident that peoples mindset is changing radically.           
	For all the media hype they get, such stray occasions are the exception rather than the rule. It is very difficult to eradicate the ancient practice of dowry from society, especially from the minds of the middle, poor and backward classes. But then, even the high and mighty often consider dowry to be a prestige tag. What is encouraging about the present incident is the fact that neighbours stood by the brides family when Bagdis father created a commotion. The villagers were furious with the Bagdis, and even went to the extent of imprisoning the groom. If they have really been impressed by the girls courage, they should say no to dowry hereafter.          
	In the recent past, three minor girls from Purulia had defied their families attempt to marry them off. The Indian president appreciated their act of bravery, and awarded them Rs 10,000 each. These girls can become role models in campaigns against child marriage. The girl from Burdwan should be congratulated in a similar way by the president so that she can fulfil her dream of an independent life.          
	Children should be warned against social evils such as early marriage or dowry in schools. Political leaders cutting across party lines should bring their heads together in eliminating the malpractice. It is because of dowry that parents feel disappointed when daughters are born, and this, in turn, leads to female foeticide. Thousands of girls are silenced in the their mothers wombs, resulting in a skewed sex ratio. When we have succeeded in abolishing the custom of sati, we should not hesitate to get rid of dowry.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

                
	Over and above          
	Sir  I am not his relative, I am not a follower of his ideology, I never took his interview, and I do not even rate him as the best in his field. In spite of all this, from the day he lost his protracted battle against death, I have been struggling to get used to an India without Jyoti Basu.          
	I was a school student when Basu came to power in 1977. Eleven years later, I got a chance to visit his residence. My father, at that time, used to travel to Delhi frequently as a representative of West Bengal in Centre-state meetings. He stayed at Banga Bhavan, where he once met a lady who introduced herself as the wife of the first secretary of the Indian embassy in a Far East country.   
	The lady said that whenever she came to India with her husband, she tried to visit her native city, Calcutta, to meet her near-and-dear ones, particularly her maternal uncle, the then chief minister of West Bengal, Jyoti Basu. That year, however, she told my father, she could not make the trip. So she asked my father whether he would take a small packet to the chief ministers residence on her behalf. My father brought home the packet, which contained a few items of French and American cosmetics of no great value.          
	My father decided to go to Basus house to deliver the packet himself, and I accompanied him. Jyotibabu, in those days, was staying in a bungalow within Raj Bhavan. The invincible Z-plus protection was not yet in vogue. An inspector of police and a couple of armed constables were standing in attendance near the entrance. The inspector told us that the chief minister was not present at the time being, but we could talk to his wife. We were ushered into the drawing room.          
	Kamal Basu entered exactly after five minutes, and greeted us with an unassuming smile. My father introduced himself as an officer of the state government, without mentioning his department and rank. She was quite happy on hearing the background story, and repeatedly said that she was grateful to my father for bringing the packet all the way from Delhi. She served us cold drinks, and kept on talking like an ordinary housewife. Referring to Jyotibabus niece  the lady who had sent the gifts  Kamal Basu said that she was a wonderful girl and it was because of her that she and the chief minister had fallen into the bad habit of using foreign soaps and cosmetics.          
	We stayed there for nearly half an hour and left with a content mind. Next day, my father came to know that Jyotibabu, after reaching Writers Buildings in the morning, had asked his office to find out who amongst the officials was so kind as to carry a packet for him from Delhi. At that time, Basu was already one of the seniormost leaders of the country, and arguably the most well-known chief minister of an Indian state.          
	Nowadays I hear people say many things about Basu and his family, about their influence, wealth and conceit. All those may or may not be true. I only go by what I saw.          
	Yours faithfully,

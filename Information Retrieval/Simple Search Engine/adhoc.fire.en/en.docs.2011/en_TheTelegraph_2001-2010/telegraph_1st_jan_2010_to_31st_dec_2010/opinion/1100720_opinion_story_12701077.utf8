                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ERR TOO OFTEN                                                    
	To err is human. And yet, human error often leads to inhuman tragedies. In the aftermath of the shocking accident at Sainthia station, officials have, as usual, invoked human error as one of the possible causes behind the tragedy. In India, this well-worn phrase  one is indeed tempted to call it a clich  serves a viciously dual purpose. Delivered in a solemn tone, this official euphemism attempts to rationalize entirely avoidable mishaps. At the same time, it also acts as a screen between the very important persons responsible for running the Indian Railways and those lesser mortals who must ensure that trains run safely and on time. Human error instantly pits the former against the latter. And it is usually the errant driver or the incompetent pointsman or some other person belonging to the lower rungs of the pecking order who is made a scapegoat. After making sorry noises and tall promises, the ministers conveniently slip away. How else does one explain six major accidents in the course of one year?        
	Ever since she presented her railway budget last year, Mamata Banerjee has allowed her ministry to go down the drain. Even the prime minister felt the need to forward her a note, based on the findings of the Planning Commission, suggesting possible ways of improving the Indian Railways. But Ms Banerjee has spent increasingly less time on the job entrusted to her. Other than presenting a people-friendly budget that did not bring in revenue and made the Indian Railways look like a charitable organization, Ms Banerjee has expended most of her energies getting embroiled in the political upheavals of her home state. Driven solely by populist concerns, her priorities have been totally self-serving. So much so, she did not spend a thought on issues of safety and maintenance in her budget speech. As a result, the Indian Railways remain trapped in a curious time warp  while acknowledging the urgent need for an advanced signalling system, regular surveillance of tracks and automated safety controls, successive ministers do precious little to achieve any of these aims. Seasoned politicians like Ms Banerjee are destined never to become efficient administrators. On the disaster in Sainthia, the great crusader for Ma, mati, manush has only this to say, Human life is very important. Thats quite right. But then, where does she go from here?

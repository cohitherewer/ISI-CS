	Important lessons                  
	Sir  Barack Obamas address in Parliament on November 8 was fascinating (Play it again, Nov 10). In his 45-minute-long speech, the president of the United States of America displayed commendable rhetorical skill. The speech contained important lessons for Indian leaders. Despite being impeccably diplomatic, Obamas words resonated with sincerity. His expressions of real concern for India moved many. He took care to mention and praise eminent Indians like M.K. Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Vivekananda and Ambedkar in a genuine effort to touch our hearts. He directly addressed the common people of India which was, again, rather stirring. However, Obama also managed to maintain balance in his speech by subtly asserting his position as the president of a superpower, and by reminding India that it has to duly recognize its international obligations by supporting the reinstatement of democracy in Myanmar. But Obama assertively promised that the US would continue to push Pakistan to punish the 26/11 attackers, and called for stern action against terrorism. Obamas speech has been a significant step towards the further strengthening of Indo-US ties.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Swapan Kumar Raha, Calcutta              
	Sir  India needs to be more imaginative in handling its ties with other countries. Barack Obama had a lot of political stake in making his trip to India a success. India actually had less compulsion to please him. Yet we decided not to look beyond Pakistan in our interactions with the president. The Indian prime minister hardly mentioned Russia and China to Obama. But Manmohan Singh should have created the opportunity to discuss Indo-China relations with Obama, keeping in mind the strong significance China has for the US.          
	On the other hand, Obama managed to bring in Iran and Myanmar as he signalled his readiness to propel India into the United Nations security council. As a nation that has gained considerable clout on the world stage, India should have grabbed this chance to make a reference to the need for lasting peace in the Middle East. This would not only have underscored our support to the Muslim world but could also have been a step towards ensuring national security.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                
	Sir  The visit of the US president was less fruitful for India than expected. Barack Obama seemed to have been here to protect the USs interests, rather than to concentrate on lasting friendship with India. America will continue to be intimidated by Chinas economic and military might and will also be blackmailed by Pakistans capacity to nurture terrorism. Therefore, India may not gain much from the US unless it grows economically stronger, and self-reliant in terms of its military power. The anomalies in Indias foreign policy have earned it a number of hostile neighbours while the country continues to be riddled with corruption and internal security threats. In terms of national stability, India is far behind not just China but also some of its smaller neighbours.          
	It is a pity that Obama has not quite succeeded in taking the war on terror to its logical conclusion. He also not has been able to do much to make China and the Middle East a little more sensitive to human rights. The US needs a good friend in India to be able to achieve these goals. A meaningful alliance between the worlds most powerful democracy and the worlds largest democracy is essential for peace and progress.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Barack Obamas visit to India has undoubtedly been a success. He has maintained the dignity of his august office while showing utmost sincerity towards India. He was honest in his tribute to the 26/11 victims. And his interaction with the students of St Xaviers was spontaneous. Indians will remember the US presidents visit for a long time. They had a lot of expectations from the president. It was obviously not possible for Obama to fulfil all of them. But he tried his best to touch upon the topics that are important for India. This must be appreciated.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  President Barack Obama said that instability in Pakistan is bad for India, while if the former is stable, it would be good for the latter. But Pakistans attitude towards India has not been friendly. It has tried to destabilize India and disrupt its progress by covertly sponsoring terrorism. The US supplies weapons and aid to Pakistan to help it thrash out terrorism from its soil. The US needs to see to the way this aid is utilized.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Erratum          
	Preliminary and interim reports of the comptroller and auditor general are actually placed before Parliament and not leaked to the media, as suggested in the editorial, Full report only (Nov 17). The error is regretted.           
	 The Editor

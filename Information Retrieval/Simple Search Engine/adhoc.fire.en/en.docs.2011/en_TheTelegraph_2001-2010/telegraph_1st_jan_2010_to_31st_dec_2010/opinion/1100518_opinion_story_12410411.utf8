	Another twist                  
	Sir  The colour-changing capability of the former mayor, Subrata Mukherjee, will put a chameleon to shame (CPM B-team now Mamatas, May 6). His recent switch to the Trinamul Congress from the Congress is also a comment on the politics-without-principle as practised by the TMC chief, Mamata Banerjee. It was amazing to watch her address a press conference with Mukherjee  whom she used to call a watermelon or an agent of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)  on one side and Somen Mitra, whom she had accused of rigging the polls to prevent her from becoming the state Congress president in 1991, on the other. The significance of this image will definitely not be missed by the public going to the polls in a few days time.          
	Banerjee seems to have become too big for her shoes. She needed a shock treatment, which the Congress has provided by deciding to contest the polls on its own. She cannot possibly treat a national party with a glorious history as shabbily as she has. After all, the Congress has a pan-Indian presence with 206 seats in Parliament, and Banerjees 13-year-old party is a mere regional outfit (although it ambitiously calls itself the All India Trinamul Congress). Banerjees 19 seats in Parliament are simply due to the TMCs alliance with the Congress. They are not a reflection of the TMCs strength alone. It will be good for all those who want to see the CPI(M)s misrule end in West Bengal if Banerjee learns a lesson from the municipal poll experience and forms a firm alliance with the Congress for the 2011 assembly elections. Otherwise, her wish of becoming the chief minister of West Bengal will remain a mere dream and the public will be burdened once again with the Left-Front regime.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  By joining the TMC, Subrata Mukherjee has proved that a good party can have no substitute. Mukherjee may be a maverick politician, but he is always associated with quality. Mamata Banerjee should be congratulated for bringing in a good manager at the right time to help her run the party. The TMC has been grabbing many zilla parishads, panchayat samitis, gram panchayats and municipalities since 2008, but has been unable to send the right message to the people in terms of governance. It was felt that the TMC lacked a good wordsmith, a negotiator, and an economist. Now that the watermelon is in the party, these lacunae will be addressed.          
	After winning 19 Lok Sabha seats in the general elections last year, the TMC is now in disarray. It is telling that Banerjee could not project a mayoral candidate from her own party even at a time when the TMC is supposedly in good form. The lack of good leaders within the TMC is all-too-evident. To defeat its principal Opposition, the CPI(M), the TMC should take stock of the situation. Why did Mukherjee desert the party earlier? Was it because of groupism inside the TMC? However, now that Mukherjee has joined, if he displays sincerity towards the party in the coming days, then anything is possible.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah, Hooghly 

      
	Sir  Subrata Mukherjee has done the yo-yo act again. He asserts that his moves are not opportunistic, but the facts point to the contrary. This time, he said that he deserted the Congress because he thinks that the Congress is not really anti-CPI(M). Mukherjee needs to know that public memory is not as short as he thinks. We remember that the leader of the party he has joined now had dubbed him, not so long ago, a tarmuj (watermelon), which is green on the outside but red inside. Anyway, it seems that the TMC supremo will not mind having this watermelon on a platter, particularly in this torrid summer.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Gone awry          
	Sir  I am a resident of Bakultala Lane in Kasba. Just before my house, there is a big pond that had once been very clean but today has turned into a rubbish dump. People of the locality dump waste in it. The pond is also choked with rubble from construction sites. In the rainy season, it is a terrible experience to leave the house because one is immediately surrounded by mosquitoes, flies and roaches from the pond. About three years ago, on December 31, 2007, our councillor along with the mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, visited our locality and assured that measures would be taken to clear the pond. The notice from the corporation was published in local newspapers and aired on television. Since then, matters have remained the same.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Prasanta Kumar Dutta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Telgraphs efforts to educate citizens about the misdeeds of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation are laudable. The media reports have proved that it is money power that determines everything. It can buy the rights to do wrong. The apartment where I live has a meter-room or a watchmans room, which is planned differently in CMC-approved buildings. The promoter of the building had all along occupied that room. Now he has sold the room to a cable operator. We are now sitting on a landmine, as it were, as the small room is poorly ventilated, has equipment that run 24x7, and is criss-crossed by a mesh of wires. It is not known how the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation could provide a separate meter and a connection to this businessman. There are no fire-fighting equipment in the building. Most frighteningly, we do not even know whether the cable operator has set up his business in accordance with the norms of the fire department. But he seems to be running a flourishing agency with active cooperation from our law-enforcing agencies.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Amit Mazumder, Calcutta

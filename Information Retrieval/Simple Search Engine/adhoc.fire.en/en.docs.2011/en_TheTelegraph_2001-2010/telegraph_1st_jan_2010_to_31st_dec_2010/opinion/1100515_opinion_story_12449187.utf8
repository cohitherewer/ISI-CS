	The Empire striking back has been the story in many areas for many years now. But the manner in which Britains first coalition government since 1945 has come into being has some useful lessons for a former colony like India. The new British prime minister, David Cameron, did not exactly say anything new when he talked of the country entering the era of new politics, in which the national interest would be more important than party interest. It is not uncommon for newly elected leaders to begin with such platitudes. The remarkable thing about the coalition-building exercise in Britain was the solemn pledge of responsibility to the common purpose of serving the country and the people. And this did not come merely through speeches or other ceremonial business. It came in the form of a seven-page draft power-sharing document between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. It makes no attempt at papering over basic differences between the two parties, which had been bitter rivals during the poll campaign but have now pledged themselves to steering Britain through a time of economic and other uncertainties. The deal reserves each partys right to differ with the other over key issues such as deficit reduction, taxes, banking and political reforms, immigration and Britains relations with the European Union.        
	It is a political contract that goes well with the social contract that is supposed to exist between a people and their government. Irrespective of what eventually happens to such a mission statement, it sets the stage for a transparent, responsible government and gives the people the open book by which to judge it. Contrast all this with the murky and largely immoral closet politics that is the hallmark of coalition-building in India. Indian politicians could be wondering how and why a hung parliament in Britain did not inevitably involve cash transactions or what is known to them as horse-trading. The way the Liberal Democrats speedily decided to join the government despite their sharp differences with the Tories on many issues could teach Indias dogmatic Leftists a thing or two about coalition politics. Obviously, the junior partner in the British coalition did not think,  la the Communist Party of India (Marxist), that supporting the government from outside could be a better idea. The Lib Dems clear, bold thinking is a contrast with the Indian Marxists opportunistic strategy of enjoying the fruits of power without daring to share the responsibility. The pledge of shared responsibility between Mr Cameron and Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, is also a far cry from the endless games of blackmail in Indias coalition politics.        
	It is tempting to attribute the contrasts to cultural differences. But what matters, though, is the lesson that democracy is all about openness and the ability to work with dissenters. Coalition politics needs more  and not less  of such values.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Calcutta calling                  
	Sir  Bombay may be Indias arch-metropolis, as Mukul Kesavan says in his article, A sense of place (May 27), but Calcutta also has a strong claim upon this epithet. Pan-Indian dreams can be dreamt as much, if not more, in Calcutta as in Bombay. Right from the days of the British raj till the present communist era, Calcutta has attracted outsiders. Thus, far from being densely Bengali, as Kesavan says, Calcutta has a fairly mixed population, a large percentage of which is non-Bengali. Had Kesavan visited the city at a time prior to the municipal elections, he would have seen that setting aside a few fringe areas like Shyambazar or Jadavpur, most of the city is dominated by election banners and posters in Hindi, Urdu and English. Even the language of the election campaigns is mostly Hindi.           
	This change in the citys linguistic make-up was inevitable, given the large influx of non-Bengalis into Calcutta in recent years. Parts of Calcutta that were Bengali-dominated even a couple of years ago have been transformed into miniature Rajasthan, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala or Andhra Pradesh almost overnight. The reason behind this change is not hard to find. Not just food but also education, health and transport are cheaper in Calcutta than in the other metropolitan cities of India. Besides, Calcutta is perhaps the only Indian city where non-indigenous people are made to feel at home. Unlike in Bombay, no Shiv Sena-like regional outfit has ever gained ground in Calcutta. So people from all over India flock to Calcutta in search of fortune. Yet, people of the progressive states will continue to call Calcutta backward.           
	If absence of provincialism is the hallmark of a cosmopolitan city, then Calcutta would rank far ahead of Bombay. Although Marathis are just a part of the population of Bombay, as Bengalis are of Calcutta, yet Maharashtra state authorities have seen to it that knowledge of Marathi remains compulsory for getting jobs in the government or in the education sector in Bombay. No inhabitant of Bombay can dream of passing his board examinations or getting a job in the state government without being familiar with Marathi. In contrast, in Calcutta, people can enjoy all amenities and services without the slightest acquaintance with the language of the city. Rather, a Bengali would completely be at sea in Calcutta if he does not know Hindi or English. In fact, Bengalis consciously avoid using their mother tongue in public and start conversing in Hindi or English at the slightest pretext. Thus Calcutta, dominated by non-Bengalis  numerically, culturally as well as economically  is the numero uno cosmopolitan Indian city, having no distinct identity of its own.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Promised one          
	Sir  The report, 80 killed after armed Taliban terrorists storm minority sects mosques in Lahore (May 29), says of the sect of Ahmadis that they are followers of Ghulam Ahmad, who they believe was the prophet. This is untrue. Being an Ahmadi Muslim myself, I can state that Ahmadis firmly believe that Prophet Mohammad is the last prophet. The Promised Messiah, Hadharat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, declared that he is a servant of Prophet Mohammad, and that he has come to revive the teachings of the prophet that todays Muslims have totally forgotten.          
	The biggest religion of the world is humanity. It is atrocious that the terrorist attack took place on a group of people who had merely gathered to offer their Friday prayers. The incident would have been as unacceptable if it had taken place in any other place of worship.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sana Iqbal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The report on the Lahore terrorist attack described the Ahmadis inappropriately. It is unfortunate that The Telegraph, which is a leading newspaper, printed something incorrectly, without proper investigation into the matter. This has hurt our religious sentiments severely. We, the Ahmadis, belong to the Ahmadiyya Muslim community, founded by Hadharat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Hadharat Ahmad is the Promised One of all religions. He is the Promised Imam of the Time and the Messiah of Mohammad. Hadharat Ahmad was the servant of Allah and the true lover of Prophet Mohammad. The Ahmadis, like any other Muslim, believe that Mohammad was our final sharia (law-bearing) prophet. But we also believe that according to the prophecies of Prophet Mohammad, Hadharat Ahmad was the reformer of the age, sent by God. And it was according to these prophecies and revelations from God that Hadharat Ahmad proclaimed himself the Promised Messiah.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sharp decline          
	Sir  I have been travelling frequently across the country by the Indian Railways for the last 12 years. Ever since Mamata Banerjee took over as the railways minister, there has been a sharp decline in the services of the railways, be it in terms of punctuality, quality of the food served, behaviour of the railways staff or of passengers security. It seems that Banerjee is more interested in the chair of West Bengals chief minister than in her duties as the railways minister. Perhaps the people of West Bengal were mistaken in reposing their faith in her leadership in the Lok Sabha elections. If Banerjee is so concerned about chief ministership now, one wonders what will become of West Bengal if and when she becomes its head. She might get more interested in the prime ministers post then. Populist slogans are not enough to restore peoples faith in her. She must improve the condition of the Indian Railways rather than just announcing trains every alternate days.          
	Yours faithfully,

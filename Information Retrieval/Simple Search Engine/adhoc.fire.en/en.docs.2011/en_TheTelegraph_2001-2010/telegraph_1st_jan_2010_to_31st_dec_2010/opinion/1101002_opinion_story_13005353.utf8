                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TRIUMPH OF INSTITUTIONS                                                          
	Institutions make or break a democracy. The judiciary  or, to be exact, the section of the judiciary that gave the judgment on the Ayodhya dispute  demonstrated the simple but much-neglected importance of institutions in a functioning democracy. The point needs to be made because public institutions in India, including the judiciary, come in for a fair amount of criticism, some deserved and some not. The applause for institutional good deeds is often not that forthcoming. Thus the three judges who delivered the judgment on Thursday should be congratulated for their hard work and for the service they have done to the Indian nation. The matter they had to decide was extraordinarily complex. Not only had the cases been with the court for an inordinately long time, they also involved sifting through masses of evidence. It also meant that the three judges had to delve into areas like history, mythology, architecture and so on, which do not normally fall within the purview of a trained legal mind. The issues and their complexities must have been exasperating, but the three judges succeeded in coming out with a pronouncement, which, shorn of the unavoidable legalese, was clear and comprehensive.        
	The very fact that the judges carried out the onerous task that had been placed before them is clear proof that institutions in India, when they are allowed to function and when individuals within the institutions have the will to function, can resolve matters, take decisions and make them public. The judges were aware that the matter before them was controversial and potent. Embedded in the legal case was an enormous amount of primordial emotion. This put on them an extra responsibility. But as their order shows, they were not influenced by any fear of prejudice. There is one more aspect which is of interest. There are actually three separate judgments with shades of difference among them. The existence of these differences perhaps added to the complexity that the judges had to face. This is also evidence of the level of understanding and co-operation that exists among those who work in Indias public institutions.        
	Various hindrances, the complexity of the matter, the public attention that the matter attracted and the nuanced difference of opinion  all these were overcome to make way for a judgment that could well serve as a watershed in the resolution of the Ayodhya dispute and in the history of the Indian judiciary. The latter point needs reiteration because the judges have not only offered a solution but have also drawn the attention of the contending parties and of the public at large to Indias tradition of religious co-existence and cultural pluralism. The judges have thus set a benchmark for society. The verdict is open to be appealed against in a higher court, but this cannot take away from the example the judges have set by upholding the highest standards of the legal system and the judiciary.

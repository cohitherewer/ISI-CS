The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The bitter truth
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE BITTER TRUTH                                  GREY AREAS      Several questions about the Mumbai attack remain unanswered                                                  
	Ajmal Kasab has been sentenced to death. Does that mark the end of the 26/11 story? Not for Kavita Karkare, and not for Mumbais citizens, who might well echo her plaint: I have received only 50 per cent justice. She still doesnt know who killed her husband, Hemant Karkare. In his verdict, the additional sessions judge, M.L. Tahilyani, admitted that he could not come to any conclusion regarding who shot Karkare and inspector Vijay Salaskar. Reportedly, the bullets that had exited their bodies have not been sent to the ballistic experts. Why? No one has the answer. Worse, no ones asking.        
	The value of Kasabs trial wasnt only in embodying the basic principle of justice  every accused person must get a fair trial. For many Mumbaikars, this trial was the only way to understand the discrepancies between what had originally been reported about the attack and the official version that came later. When Tahilyani was appointed to preside over the trial, and he, in turn, appointed the criminal lawyer, Abbas Kazmi, to defend Kasab, it was anticipated that the truth will be out.        
	What Kazmi could do was puncture the prosecutions story and discredit its witnesses. He got little help from his client, whom he could meet only in court. But despite this, little-known facts began tumbling out. A horrified public heard how rifle after rifle had jammed at the CST, where 109 policemen, 30 of them armed, were not able to stop two armed men who were newcomers to the city. More shocks were in store. The Cama Hospital episode, in which Karkare, Salaskar and ACP Ashok Kamte were killed, remains the most controversial part of 26/11. Conspiracy theories still exist about who killed Karkare, then in the thick of exposing a nationwide Hindu terror network. These claims may be fantastic, but what Kazmis cross-examination revealed about that episode was equally disturbing.        
	When Kasab and his partner landed at Cama Hospital, they were obviously lost. Yet, they managed to outmanoeuvre 30-odd policemen and three members of a quick response team. SMSes and calls for reinforcements were constantly sent by Karkare and ACP Sadanand Date, but none came. It took an hour for help to reach Date, lying injured inside Cama, and half-an-hour before anyone reached the three officers lying bleeding in a lane that leads to the special branch office.        
	The trial didnt leave the Centre untouched either. A SIM card used by the terrorists was traced to an ID card issued by the ministry of urban development in the name of one Suresh Prashad. The prosecution had his electricity bill, but insisted that he was untraceable. A ministry spokesperson told the court that the ID card had been forged.        
	Kazmi had planned to call his own witnesses; among them Anamika Gupta, injured at Leopold Caf, who claimed that she had seen the assailants 48 hours earlier. He was trying to scrutinize Vinita Kamtes revelations about the death of Ashok, Karkare and Salaskar that had Rakesh Maria running for cover. Kazmi was also determined to question the identity of Abu Jindal, the Indian trainer named by Kasab.        
	But before he could do any of this, Kazmi was removed by the judge for non-cooperation. Refusing to accept affidavits presented by the prosecution as formal, Kazmi insisted that the court follow normal procedure and hear arguments from both sides and then rule on the nature of the evidence. But his insistence on doing what any defence lawyer would have done cost him his job. From then on, it was smooth sailing for the prosecution. The special public prosecutor, Ujjwal Nikam, even got away with filing two affidavits just five days before the judgment. This included an eye-witnesss statement on the shooting of two persons by Kasab and Abu Ismail after they had shot Karkare.        
	With such overwhelming evidence against the accused, why was the prosecution in such a rush? India could have afforded to have given Kasab the best possible defence, even if it took a while longer. We did neither that, nor are we nearer to unraveling the truth behind 26/11.                    JYOTI PUNWANI

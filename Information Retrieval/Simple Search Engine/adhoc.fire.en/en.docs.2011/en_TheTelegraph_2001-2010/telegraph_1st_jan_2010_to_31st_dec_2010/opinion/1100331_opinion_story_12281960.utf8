	If a man is known by the company he keeps, it seems possible that a nation is known by the icons it celebrates. At present, India is busy looking up to Amitabh Bachchan as an icon; his commissions and omissions become weighty topics of discussion in social and cultural arenas. Yet, India once boasted of icons acknowledged the world over for their extraordinary stature and immeasurable contribution, such as Rabindranath Tagore or Mahatma Gandhi. More than one generation of children were brought up with such figures to look up to. Their vivid presence in the cultural consciousness served as a kind of benchmark for extraordinary powers and deep humanity, against which the young could measure their aspirations, efforts and ordeals, their rebellions and achievements. India has produced a number of remarkable personalities who both defined the countrys culture and served as its launching pad, who made history while also changing it.        
	To put in their place the most celebrated icons of today, whether it is Mr Bachchan or Sourav Ganguly, argues a startling diminution of scale. This has nothing to do with the admiration and respect that brilliant actors and sportsmen deservedly command; they are indeed a significant part of any nations cultural life. But a Tom Cruise or a David Beckham is not accorded the iconic stature in their respective countries that Mr Bachchan or Mr Ganguly enjoys in India. Even serious discussions on society nowadays take their acceptance as icons for granted. But building up and leading a team of players with intelligence, patience, skill and determination, for example, is rather different from uniting the nation in quiet resistance. This lack of discrimination in the choice of icons reveals an immaturity that is far from charming. Unable to distinguish among greatness, excellence and popularity, this immaturity ends up devaluing standards, which leads to oddities such as the most prestigious civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, being given to Lata Mangeshkar as a singer of unrivalled popularity, in recognition of the highest degree of national service. When a nation lowers its sights in the perception of values, it is time to worry about the quality of its intellectual and cultural achievements.

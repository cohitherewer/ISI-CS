	There is an elementary distinction between running a government and leading a political party. This difference is often overlooked, especially when the party is in government. The distinction proceeds from two completely different premises. The leadership of a political party for the survival and expansion of its own organization has to be concerned about nurturing its own bases and constituencies. It has to steer clear, therefore, of alienating large sections of the population. There is thus, given the nature of Indian politics, a large measure of populism embedded in the various policies and programmes a party pursues and the rhetoric it uses in its various public pronouncements. Political leaders have to speak to the constituencies they are addressing. The head of a government, the prime minister, cannot and should not think in those terms. The prime minister has to think in terms of governance, in terms of what he considers to be good for the country rather than in terms of votes and popularity. The sign of an outstanding prime minister lies in his ability to leave his own indelible mark on policy; he has to impose his own will on his government. The priorities of the head of a government and the leader of a party are therefore different.        
	This preface is necessary to put in perspective the many voices that are emanating from within the Congress regarding how to tackle what has come to be called the Maoist problem. There exists the view  and the name of Sonia Gandhi has come to be associated with it  that counter-insurgency will not result in the permanent eradication of Maoist violence. What is required is taking the development initiatives to the backward tribal districts. This approach seeks to address the root cause rather than just the violence. It also tries to reach out to the poor in political economic terms so that they are not alienated from the Congress. The government, while not completely disagreeing with this approach, cannot afford to ignore or underplay the violence. Even after accepting the root cause, it has to confront the terror that is attacking the very existence of the State and of governance. Not to counter the terror is synonymous with surrendering the very raison dtre of the State.        
	The distinction that has been made in the previous paragraphs can also be seen as a difference between what is immediate and what is the long/middle term. The suppression of violence and the punishment of the guilty are immediate priorities. It goes without saying that such a process has to be followed by a political one involving dialogue and the proper implementation of developmental schemes. There is, in fact, a convergence between the two approaches. The party and the government have only offered different shades of emphasis to the same problem.

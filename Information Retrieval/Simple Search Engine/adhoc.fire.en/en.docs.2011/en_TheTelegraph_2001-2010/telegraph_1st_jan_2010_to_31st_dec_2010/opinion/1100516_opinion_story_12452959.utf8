	The saffron league is slowly, and painfully, coming round to admitting that Nitin Gadkari may have age on his side, but not much else besides that. If a recent Bharatiya Janata Party rally in the capital proved that the octogenarian LK Advani could still beat those half his age in stamina, Gadkaris recent faux pas has driven home the point that the former party chief beats his successor hands down when it comes to a sense of discretion. Many, however, blame the apparent rawness of Gadkaris language (with reference to the Yadav leaders) on his small-town antecedents. His peculiar mix of Nagpur-Bombaiya Hindi supposedly goes down equally badly with his party colleagues. In party councils, Gadkari often talks of fixing somebody by saying usko thokunga. Moreover, he usually dismisses party members making tall claims with this typical phrase  khali-peeli bamb marta hain. This has dissuaded many partymen from boasting. The problem is with Gadkaris manner of speaking, his supporters are heard saying these days. With time, everyone will get used to it, just like they did in Lalu Prasads case. Any takers for that?                          
	After Shashi Tharoor, Congresswallahs have discovered their new pet hate  Jairam Ramesh. Witty and unconventional, Ramesh often rubs his party colleagues the wrong way. The other day, he ran into Anand Sharma, the Union minister for commerce and industry. Ramesh announced that he had recently been to Cape Town, South Africa. Before Anand could react, he went on to add that it was Anands home town. Ramesh was perhaps hinting at Anands association with the place via his wife, who is from South Africa and specializes in psychiatric counselling. But a proud Himachali like Sharma may have found the comment a bit too rich.                  
	 As for Shashi Tharoor, his exile has not made much of a difference: he remains a man with an attitude. Tharoor is supposed to have marked certain people out for their contribution to the situation he finds himself in. At a recent function, Tharoor apparently refused to talk to a politician and made it quite clear that he was not interested in maintaining any contact with him. But then, hasnt that always been a politicians prerogative?           
	 Jairam Rameshs outburst in China is supposed to have been a deviant reaction to P Chidambarams increasing grip on all departments of the government. Well, from the look of it, Digvijay Singh seems to share the anguish. Diggy Raja has openly locked horns with PC on the handling of the Naxal threat, and was recently all over town blaming the sangh parivar for its involvement in several bomb blasts. Coming shortly before PCs trip to Pakistan, the tirade may undermine Indias position vis--vis terror groups in the neighbourhood. Not that it particularly bothers Diggys supporters. They refer to PC as Quick Gun Murugan, an obvious reference to his southern connections. The Tamil superhero had to contend with just one villain: Rice Plate Reddy. But poor PC has to fight several, and, at times, it looks as if he could do with a little help from his reel avatar.                
	 Rajiv Shukla, quite evidently, is a rising star in the Congress. From cricket to politics to Bollywood, Shukla is undeniably the man of the season. On a single day last week, he travelled to three states, courtesy a Congress chief minister. He was in Gujarat first in connection with the 125th-year celebrations of the party. From Ahmedabad, he moved to Mumbai next to attend another function as a Rajya Sabha member of the state. By evening, he was in the capital, attending yet another function.                
	 Amitabh Bachchan is planning to set up a museum in Bareilly in memory of his father, Harivansh Rai Bachchan. It was here where Bachchan senior had met his wife, Teji Suri. So the Bachchans have a special bond with the town. Among other things, the museum will have over 150 rare photographs and letters of Harivansh Rai.                      
	An unusual political contest seems to be on in Madhya Pradesh. It is being dubbed as tear for a tear. First, the state assembly Speaker, Ishwardas Rohani, broke down after hearing a woman BJP legislator accuse her Congress colleague of passing sexist remarks. Days later, even before Rohanis tears had dried, the senior Congress leader, Ajay Singh, wept like a child at a symposium in which party members recalled the atrocities perpetrated on them by the BJP regime. Ajay is the son of the veteran Congress leader, Arjun Singh, who is known for his ability to cry at will. A few years ago, the senior Singh broke down at a function to mark the death anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi in the presence of the former prime ministers relatives. He was seen crying again when his daughter was denied a party ticket from Satna. Surely, not all tears shed are crocodile tears.

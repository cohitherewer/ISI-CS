	From cheering vuvuzelas to murderous violence, the scene in South Africa has radically changed in a few weeks time. Whatever credibility the administration of Jacob Zuma had gained for itself after hosting a relatively uneventful Fifa World Cup has dissolved into sheer anarchy since August 18. For more than a fortnight, public-sector strikes have paralysed hospitals, schools and other essential services across South Africa. The dispute is over disproportionate demands for pay rise by the Congress of South African Trade Unions. An important ally of the African National Congress, the Cosatu is generally used to having its way. However, already reeling under a steep inflation, the government has refused this time to concede to the Cosatus demand  for a wage hike that is double the rate of inflation. As the negotiations stretch on, a million workers are out on the streets  fighting off the police, and getting beaten up, stabbed or kidnapped. The attack on nurses yesterday was the last straw, leading to an outburst of public anger.        
	Mr Zumas desperation for an economic recovery is understandable. It would be in the interest of the people if his administration were able to rein in the crisis through reasonable compromise. However, it could be imprudent, if not altogether suicidal, to assume a ham-handed approach in the matter. So far, Mr Zumas policy of coming down heavily on the media has only sullied the spirit of South Africas 1996 constitution, which had removed arbitrary restrictions on public access to government documents. By reviving the draconian laws that are inimical to a free press, Mr Zuma seems to be harking back to the dark days of the apartheid. In a bitter irony, the president of South Africa, once hailed as the man of the people, appears to be unmaking his own popular image. In politics, such manoeuvrings often turn out to be fatal. Mr Zuma is unlikely to be forgiven in next years local elections unless he undertakes some serious, and sensible, damage control.

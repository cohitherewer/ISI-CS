	In a recent evening of music at the Vidyamandir auditorium, singers Rajyasree Bandopadhyay, Debmalya Chattopadhyay and Ruprekha Chattopadhyay negotiated with the past with consummate ease. They chose popular songs from the 1960s and 1970s, and presented them with enough charm to overwhelm the audience with pure nostalgia.         
	Rajyasree Bandopadhyay sang numbers such as E shudhu gaaner din and O mor moyna go melodiously. The quality of her timbre was ideally suited for the buoyantly amusing Arati Mukherjee song, Ami Miss Calcutta 1976, although her rendition of Je jon premer bhab jane na lacked the exuberance its engaging lyrics and lively melody call for.         
	The wonderfully introspective Tagore song, Badol diner prothom kadam phool, found elegant expression in Debmalya Chattopadhyays inaugural offering. His interpretation of the Akhilbandhu Ghosh gem, O dayal, bichar koro, was evocative and charming, while Hemanta Mukhopadhyays Jodi jante chao tumi was sung with the melodious grace it deserved. But it was in another Tagore number  Hare rere aamay chhere dere dere  that the singer truly shone, infusing his singing with compelling energy.         
	Towards the end of the evening, Ruprekha Chattopadhyay regaled the gathering with songs such as Amar prothom gaaner prothom kathay.         
	Odissi dancer Dona Ganguly and her troupes presentation of an evocation of goddess Durga in her many elements served to bring variety into the predominantly musical evening. The opening performance, set to the Tagore number, Anandadhara bohichhe bhubane, was enjoyable.               
	Another recent evening of music at Aikataan, EZCC, dedicated to Tagore, however, had little going for it. The occasion was the release of a CD of Rabindrasangeet that Swami Vivekananda is known to have been partial to. The first part of the programme featured songs by the artists who had sung for the album. Mediocrity ruled this segment, with the singers putting up a disappointing performance. Sanghamitra Chakrabortys Naba anande jago was sung with appropriate grace, but Abhijit Ghosh was below par in E ki e sundar shobha. Bhaswati Dutta may have impressed with her singing in Tomari tore ma, but Debashis Chakraborty, Sumita Bandyopadhyay, Bhaskar Chakraborty and the others failed to leave a mark.         
	Chitra Bandopadhyay sang Akash jure shuninu oi baje, but, curiously, chose to introduce the word, aji, at the beginning of the song. The programme had pretty much run out of steam by this time.

	Doomed flight                  
	Sir  The nation was shocked by the news of the plane crash in Mangalore which claimed 158 lives (Air India flight touches down near halfway mark, May 23). The causes behind the crash will be fully known only after detailed investigations are carried out by a competent team of experts. However, one of the factors responsible for the tragedy is the inadequate length of the runway where the Boeing 737-800 aircraft was set to land. If such accidents are to be averted, it is imperative that the length of runways located at an elevation accommodates a sufficient safety margin.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
J.N. Mahanty, Puri

                
	Sir  Once the initial shock of the tragic plane crash at Mangalore has sunk in and the customary probes into the causes of the accident conducted, it will be time to reflect on the age-old systems that are entrenched in Indian aviation. Initial investigations will try and unravel the immediate reasons behind the accident, which could have taken place due to a brake failure, a burst tyre or some other technical snag or even human error.          
	However, the accident throws light upon several critical issues that also need to be addressed. To begin with, flight-safety norms should become an integral part of the aviation system. Perhaps an independent air safety authority should be established as well. This would be affiliated to the directorate general of civil aviation, Airport Authority of India and all airlines based in India. It could be formed under the aegis of the Indian Air Force, and be responsible for laying down and enforcing safety regulations.          
	The training and certification of pilots must also be re-examined. The entire system concerning training and education in aviation needs to be revamped. A number of schools for aircraft maintenance engineering are in a shambles, operating from decrepit premises and using poor equipment. For engineers graduating from such schools, it is difficult to maintain modern aircraft. A committee of aviation experts needs to be constituted to review the present set-up to ensure a more efficient and safer aviation system.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In a disastrous accident at the Mangalore airport last Saturday, a Boeing 737-800, which was inducted on January 15, 2008, overshot the new runway while trying to land. The plane was piloted by Zlatko Glusica, a British national of Serbian origin, who had 10,000 hours of flying experience. It appears that the key problem was the faulty construction of the runway, which had opened only 10 days ago. However, the real reason behind the crash will only emerge after the inquiry is completed.          
	Several families have lost their near-and-dear ones in the fatal incident. The Central government has already announced a compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the families of the deceased. The airline authorities are also likely to offer an ample sum. The loss the victims families have suffered, however, is irreparable.          
	The discovery of the black box, which holds the key to the mystery behind the crash, will undoubtedly speed up the investigation. It is to be hoped that the government and the airport authorities get to the bottom of the problem and ensure that such a tragedy does not happen again.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The plane crash in Mangalore is one of the worst disasters in Indias aviation history. It is a grim reminder of the need to improve safety standards in the aviation sector, which has seen massive expansion in recent times (Mangalore calling, May 25).          
	In the case of the Indian railways, impartial probes are conducted by a commission for railway safety which works under the administrative control of the civil aviation ministry. The probe into the aviation disaster, however, is being headed by the DGCA. What is needed is the setting up of an independent authority along the lines of the American National Transport and Safety Board. In the aftermath of such accidents, the government should take steps to set up a regulatory body like the NTSB, which would be empowered to order probes, define policies and safety parameters for flights, monitor airport infrastructure and improve training of aviation employees.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It was painful to read about the accident in Mangalore, which killed all but eight persons on-board. The new runway at the Mangalore airport is difficult to negotiate, and pilots needs special skills while manoeuvring aircraft. There has been some speculation that bad weather could have caused the crash. After all, inclement weather was responsible for the crash that claimed the life of the Andhra Pradesh chief minister, Y.S.R. Reddy. If this was indeed the case in Mangalore, the plane should not have been allowed to land at all.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty

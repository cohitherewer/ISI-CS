The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Creatures of the frontier
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CREATURES OF THE FRONTIER                                  Looking for pirates in the Sunderbans, Ipsita Chakravarty finds how the phenomenon of water dacoits is spawned by borders                                            
	It is a land of frontiers. Earth melts into water, the river meets the sea, the wilderness strains against inhabited areas, India verges on Bangladesh. And in the Sunderbans, boundaries breed their own resistance. Frontiers beget their own creatures and conflicts. The jal dashyus or the water dacoits of this region were perhaps born out of these frontiers.        
	Although their numbers have dropped, tales of the jal dashyus are told throughout the region, from Hingalganj in the north-eastern reaches of the Sunderbans to the island of Satjelia in the west. Armed with guns, these dacoits have been known to capture boats and take fishermen hostage. A rich haul of crab and fish, stocks of honey and spices or supplies of wood might be seized unceremoniously. Many of these attacks occur in winter, when vast fishing nets are set up. Some of the jal dashyus have become legendary, like the notorious Atiya, who was finally killed in fighting among the dacoits. But their origins are shrouded in mystery. Local inhabitants say that the jal dashyus come from the other side of the border, as if to dissociate themselves completely from the dacoits. They are creatures of another kind.        
	Yet, villagers are quite matter of fact  yes, attacks by jal dashyus used to be a regular occurrence. Yes, till about three years ago, these dacoits would exact an annual toll of a few thousand rupees per person  a crippling amount for those who can barely make ends meet. And yes, the motorboat we were riding was once captured by dacoits. The dacoits have an intimate knowledge of the terrain and operate on both sides of the India-Bangladesh border. The phenomenon of jal dashyus has a curious relationship with borders.        
	In the delta, the water border dividing India and Bangladesh is supposed to fall on the middle point of the rivers mid-channel flow. This is qualified by two conditions. The middle point must be measured according to the current form of the river, local sources say. In a region where land and water continually trade territories, this form keeps changing constantly. Moreover, during low tide, a vessel may navigate parts of the river that have higher levels of water, never mind on which side of the border they occur. Such borders are nebulous, and there have been points of dispute. Notably, the island of South Talpatti. India and Bangladesh wrangled over this island until reports in March, 2010 said it had disappeared, claimed by the waters once more. According to local fishermen, the jal dashyus were most active in this area.        
	Parimal Medha from Satjelia says he has been attacked at least 12 times. About 10 years ago, he was taken captive by the famous Atiya. Parimal was fishing with his father and another person when they spotted an unknown vessel. One man from the vessel climbed into their boat. There were eight of them, says Parimal. We were three. We didnt put up a fight. He was taken hostage and the dacoits sailed off in the direction of Talpatti. Back in his village, people were too scared to inform the police; one of the dacoits had stayed back with his father to keep a watch. After eight days, Parimal was released. The cost of his freedom  four shawls and a sum of Rs 2,200. It was a lot for us, especially back then, he explains.        
	Manik Mondol says he was held captive near Talpatti four years ago. The dacoits had been lying in wait inside the forest. Manik and two others had gone crab-fishing. The moment they neared one of the banks, the dacoits robbed the boat and kidnapped the fishermen. For the next six days, Manik says, he was forced to join the dacoits when they went looting. But some jal dashyus must have an erratic sense of mercy. Manik claims they finally yielded to pleading and let the captives go. Their boat had been spared, and they were allowed to sail back home. Both Manik and Parimal had been captured between Bakultala and Rajakhali, on the other side of the border. Indian fishermen in those waters usually get attacked, they say.        
	The disruptive jal dashyus have also given rise to moments of amity. Fifteen years ago, when Mizanur Gazis boat was stolen by them, he sought the help of the Bangladesh Rifles. Seven months later, the BDR recovered the boat from Bangladesh (picture). Sometimes, a bit of home-brewed justice is administered. The people of Samsernagar still talk about the boy kidnapped from Bangladesh three years ago. His distraught parents appealed to villagers on this side of the border for help. Several mid-river consultations followed. Boats from the two countries, bearing their respective flags, would sail halfway across the river for meetings. Help finally came from unexpected quarters. A local goon sent his henchmen after the dacoits. After two months, the dacoits were found and turned in to the authorities. The child was rescued and handed back to his parents. Jal dashyus had managed to blur several distinctions  between countries as well as between goon and vigilante.        
	But over the last decade, borders have been enforced and defences strengthened. Never before has the region been mapped and monitored this extensively. New thanas have come up, camps set up by the Border Security Force. The tiger project has divided the Sunderbans into core areas and buffer zones. Forest guards and BSF personnel patrol the channels and forests. With greater support from the authorities, the villagers have also fought back against the jal dashyus.        
	Things started to change with the incident at Kultali, almost 15 years ago. A notorious gang of dacoits had captured a boat and taken people hostage. The villagers informed the local authorities and a massive operation was launched. Police from surrounding thanas joined forces with forest guards. Air cover was also provided. When the villagers went to deliver the ransom, security forces surrounded the dacoits. A gun-battle ensued and the fighting continued for days. Finally, the dacoits ran out of ammunition. All of them were killed. It had been the most decisive action taken by the authorities till date. Since then, dacoits have been wary about taking hostages, villagers say.        
	Tara Mondol, a fisherman from Satjelia, describes how he helped catch a dacoit called Mujibur. Ten years ago, Mujibur and his gang had taken a hostage, to be returned for a ransom. They dont give you a specific meeting point, Tara says. They tell you to go to a certain area. Then they signal you to collect the hostage in return for the money. A bugle, made from buffalo horn and with a sound that reaches great distances, is used for this signal. In this case, the villagers had notified the police and two boats had been sent to meet the dacoits. They were hiding in a creek, recalls Tara. When they sounded the bugle and we didnt go into the creek, they came out after us. One of the police boats had moved forward while the other one stayed behind. Once the dacoits reached the mouth of the creek, they were trapped between the two boats. Mujibur was killed, Tara says with quiet satisfaction.              
	Borders have closed in, displacing the jal dashyus from their old haunts. Cornered, they have retreated further into the wilderness and almost into lore. But they can still be a disruptive force. Although tight-lipped on the matter, forest department officials admit it is not possible to patrol some of the narrower creeks and inlets. Often, crimes cannot be reported immediately because of the poor communication in these areas. Fishermen, for instance, are not allowed cell phones. Even when dacoits are nabbed, confusion follows. It must first be ascertained whether the dacoits are Indian or Bangladeshi, says a BSF officer. Moreover, there seem to be no specific laws to prosecute such crimes. Once caught, the dacoits are prosecuted according to their specific offence, whether it is the stealing of forest produce or crossing the border illegally. In a region of shifting boundaries, nothing is fixed and official control is continually challenged. And Sunderbans jal dashyus, as creatures of these frontiers, can still remain elusive.

	The prime minister deserves to be commended for the intensive use he has made of economists in his government. The good ones have been ensconced in the Planning Commission; those with a heart have been accommodated in the National Advisory Council. And the best ones have been admitted to his economic council. It regularly briefs him on the state of the economy and its prospects; he makes its reports promptly available to the nation, so that the nation can judge how well advised he is. And there can be no doubt that he gets almost as good counsel as he can in this economist-rich country. Agricultural economics, public finance, monetary economics, indescribable economics  the prime minister has an expert in each at his command.        
	If the prime minister has the princes of economics sitting in his council, he has a gorilla of an economic problem confronting him  the problem of chronic inflation. To be fair to them, the members of his council have given considerable attention to the problem in their latest report. What is most noticeable about their analysis is its sustained concentration on micro variables. They wallow in price indices, in tons of grains, in those common lentils with exotic names. The other thing that distinguishes them is their total familiarity with the complicated structure of controls the government has built up. But for them, the nation would never have known that the government has permitted the sale of an entire truckload from one of its godowns without insisting on a tender. This is a great advance for a government holding some 400 million truckloads.        
	It would not be unfair to conclude that the prime ministers choice advisers are lost in detail. They fully share the governments approach to inflation management, which involves getting hold of every grain that those profit-hungry traders might get hold of, and to use it for socially permissible purposes such as AAY, TDPS, OMSS and other esoterica. They have forgotten that prices depend on stocks in the market and on expectations. Because the government buys up stocks, the market has hardly any. The government has given traders an implicit guarantee that no supplies will come into the market, however much prices rise. So market prices keep rising inexorably. That does not bother the government because it thinks it is doing an excellent job of delivering foodgrains to the deserving. But it has also created ideal conditions for corruption in the form of two sets of prices  prices in the public distribution system and outside. All that a trader has to do is to get grains out of one into the other, and he can get rich. The system suits him well, so he ensures its permanence by funding the ruling party.

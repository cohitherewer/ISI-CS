The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Giants in blood
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GIANTS IN BLOOD                                                          
	Not all books are made to be read, or to be books at all. It is bizarre, to say the least, that the most talked-about biography of the most celebrated contemporary cricketer might turn out to be one of those impossible-to-read objects. Not only impossible to read, but also impossible to buy (unless one is Arab royalty) and hold in ones hands without feeling squeamish or faint. Sachin Tendulkars forthcoming biography will cost $75,000, weigh 37 kilograms and its signature page will be made of paper pulped with Mr Tendulkars blood. The publishers are said to have taken a sample of his saliva to create a DNA profile, which will be printed as a two-metre-long pull-out in the book; its 852 pages are going to be edged in gold leaf. There will be 10 such copies, and other limited editions priced between $3,000 and a throwaway $300. Naturally, Mr Tendulkar finds all this mind-blowing.        
	The Opus List, as the publishers call this series, includes a book on Diego Maradona that uses his blood, saliva and hair. Some other Opusites are Michael Jackson, Vivienne Westwood and the Rolling Stones. The book on Manchester United was auctioned for $1.5 million, making it the most expensive sports book ever sold. And the Prince volume, co-produced with Asprey, had the singers logo etched in platinum and inlaid with diamonds. They cost millions, of course, and buyers got a private performance in Princes Los Angeles home. No wonder that the publishers, Kraken Opus  initially operating from the Channel Islands and founded by an eager young British investment banker who wanted to be an ad man  recently announced a management buy-out by a new Arab funder; their headquarters shifted to the United Arab Emirates. There, they made a 15-foot book about the Burj Dubai hotel that remains installed, and gloriously unread, in the lobby of the hotel.        
	Blood, together with the other body fluids, is incorporated sometimes into sensational forms of art and performance, shocking the hygienic, apart from being an essential part of initiation rituals in savage as well as civilized societies. Poetry, love-letters and suicide notes are outpourings that also occasionally use blood. They come together, figuratively, when Sylvia Plath writes, in a poem called Kindness, The blood jet is poetry,/ There is no stopping it. But the Opus books logic behind using the body fluids of Messrs Maradona and Tendulkar is positively eucharistic: they are religious icons, so the selling-point is to take consumers as close to the gods as possible, almost inside them.        
	Aptly, the publishers of the Opus List are named after the Kraken monster, a mythical sea-creature of gigantic proportions, possibly modelled on the giant squid. The Scandinavian word also means something horribly twisted  and mercifully far removed from the world of ordinary people reading real books.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE MASTER TOUCH                           - Another great performance by the quiet genius        The Thin Edge - Ruchir Joshi                                                        
	On Wednesday, I decided to watch a one-day international match after a long time. Ive been off what I call burger-cricket for a while now, the whole commercialization of ODIs and T20s really sticking in my craw: the fact that a viewer has to look at a woman in a swimsuit walking through shallow sea towards camera, the sea and the advert drowning the frame as the bowler begins his run-up, the fact that broadcasters will cut to ads if the bowler so much as pauses in his run-up, forget about doing the decent thing and showing a replay of a boundary or a wicket just after it happens  all of this putting people like me off the hitherto quasi-religious act of watching a game of cricket.         
	Some reason, perhaps some mystical message, made me turn on the television at the friends place where Im staying in Delhi. I had a free day, focused around the wedding of a close friend, and I poured myself a vodka and decided to watch. That India had won the toss and had chosen to bat might have played a part, I just wasnt in the mood to put up with the ad-barrage while watching some Boer-Gujju combo from the kraal bat India out of the game before the lights came on, no matter that our Hashim-bhai is in beautiful touch, a symphony in old-fashioned correctitude of stroke play, no matter that there are few better sights in cricket than Fat-boy Kallis steamrollering a gaggle of hapless bowlers, no matter that Im less in love with our current bowling attack(s) than almost any in the recent history of Indian cricket. I wanted India to bat, I wanted Tendu and his ex-clone Viru to score big, I wanted a proper, fat-laden, Indian fast-food meal, and I decided to give my tryst with the TV set five overs.               
	After the first three overs, I knew my plans for an abstemious afternoon (five overs, one vodka, quick lunch, nap, a spot of work on the laptop, yoga etc.) were toast. Serious aficionados of Hindustani classical vocal performances will tell you they can gauge how a maestro will perform that evening from the way he or she clears his throat, from how the first few notes emerge, from the curve of the back of the tabla player even as he sits unmoving through the alaap, from the serenity, or lack thereof, of the tanpura support and so on. Similarly, seasoned watchers of Pandit Tendulkar can sometimes tell, construe from what is happening around the Ustad, when a great rendition is about to unfold: the best fielders in the world will be just that much more tense  that ball, today, seeming to belong to the batsman as it repeatedly just misses their outstretched hands; the umpires will be quicker on their toes  that ball coming back past them just that bit faster; the fielding captain will be already murdering his chewing-gum, the last absurd man standing in the Cordon of Hope, having scattered from around him his posse of slips.         
	In an Indian one-day innings being opened by an on-song Sachin, the biggest giveaway, however, will be Virender Sehwag, batting on the other side. Viru-beta has every right to be called a great batsman himself, in all forms of the game; he is fearsome to watch when hes sighting the ball, often in impossible conditions; once ignited, he can go on and on and on, recycling his exhaust to provide his own rocket-fuel; but if hes partnering the Ustad and the old man finds his range first, Sehwag can become comical. In tests specially, Dravid or Laxman are secure in their respective greatnesses, in the grand sonorousness of the second fiddle they have had to play to Ustad Tenduddin, but Sehwag is as insecure as Bianca Castafiore: he can be easily put off, he reaches for notes that are out of his range, or ones he can easily sing in a solo aria but ones which are impossible to sing as seconds to the Master. His dismissal at Gwalior was, on the one hand, a typical Sehwag harakiri but on the other, that skied catch was borne on a pure Arre, main bhi hun! petulance.         
	No matter, Kartik came in and things continued as if Sehwag had never padded up. The Tenduddin dissection of the Dakhni attack continued. Dale Steyn began the match as Glen McGraths rightful successor but by the end he was reduced to being a wannabe Matthew Hoggard. It brought to mind the (few, but carefully preserved) occasions when McGrath himself was reduced to paati Hoggardity by Tendulkar. By the time Pathan and Dhoni had finished their killer piggy-backing on the massive Sachin innings, the only thing left to fall was the record of the first individual double century in ODIs. This was a milestone bizarrely uncrossed, with several batsmen coming closer and closer over the last thirty-odd years, every one of them falling just short of the mark; part of the oddity was that a young, snarling fit Tendulkar himself had never breached it once, even against some of the second-rate bowling attacks he has routinely dismembered. When Tendulkar went past the two hundred mark, his celebration resembled that of a man who had finally tidied up a drawer from which a pesky bit of paper has been sticking out for a long time.               
	A friend once told me a story that sort of begins to explain the role Pandit T has played in many of our lives over the last twenty-one years. This friend was meeting a lover in a hotel room in a large Indian city; the lover was married to someone else and, as especially happens in adulterous assignations, she kept him waiting; the man switched on the TV in his room and watched as Tendulkar opened the batting. Somehow, the pain and irritation of waiting disappeared, my friend said; that was to be my friend and this womans last meeting as lovers, as she left she told my friend that she could no longer continue the affair; the man was shattered, but as the woman left, he again switched on the TV: Tendu was in the nineties, and suddenly, all my sadness was suspended, replaced by the tension. When he crossed his hundred I felt a double relief  some wonderful things were a constant, life would go on. That day Tendulkar scored a beautiful big hundred and to this day my friend claims that that innings helped him overcome his sorrow quickly, to this day he insists that no one elses batting could have had the same palliative effect.         
	As for me last Wednesday, I switched off the TV as soon as Dhoni creamed the last ball of the innings and began to dress for the reception. I didnt want to know about the state of Sachins back, or his elbow, or his knees, or even whether he was ever going to bat for India again; I didnt want to know if South Africa was going to pull off another impossible run-chase; all I knew was that, along with my gift for the newly-weds, I was also carrying the collectively shared gift of another great performance by the quiet genius.

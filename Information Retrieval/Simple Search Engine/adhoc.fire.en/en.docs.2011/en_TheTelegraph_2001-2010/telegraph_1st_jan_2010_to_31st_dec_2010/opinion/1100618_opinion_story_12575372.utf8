	New light on an old problem      
	Maoism: A critique from the Left (LeftWord, Rs 150) edited by Prasenjit Bose introduces a new element in the theoretical analysis of the phenomenon known as Maoism. Interpretations of the Maoist problem have got increasingly polarized between those that denounce it as a destructive force and others that perceive it in a sympathetic manner. However, given the inadequacies in both positions, it is important to examine Maoism in a new light. This, the book argues, can be achieved by examining its origins and then critiquing it from a Marxist perspective. Among the contributors, P.M.S Grewal discusses the loopholes present in the history, programmes and praxis of Indias Maoists; Nilotpal Basu interprets Maoism as an antithesis of Mao Zedongs ideology while Vijay Prashad enumerates the history of leftist extremism in South America. The academic undertones notwithstanding, this book is an important addition to the growing body of literature concerning Maoism.                          
	Cinema Bhojpuri (Penguin, Rs 399) by Avijit Ghosh is a delightfully informative book that explores the history, content and present trajectory of Bhojpuri cinema. Much of the urban elite may turn up its nose at Bhojpuri films, but their phenomenal commercial success since the early 1990s prodded Ghosh to find out the answers to a few relevant questions. What were the factors that rescued the Bhojpuri film industry from the near-death experience of the 1980s? What are the aesthetics that guide these films, and why have they been a target of derision and violence? Finally, in a world where success is measured in terms of profit, what makes the Bhojpuri film industry a dependable money-spinner? Ghoshs research is extensive, and his analysis will make readers wonder whether they are witnessing the emergence of a new genre in the landscape of Indian popular culture.                        
	Marias room (HarperCollins, Rs 299) by Shreekumar Varma straddles time but not place. Soon after Goas liberation, pretty young Maria fell in love with a French artist but their affair ended in a tragedy. Years later, Raja Prasad, a novelist desperate to escape the drudgery of his existence, travels to Goa to write his second book. But as he settles down, he comes across the story of Maria and her death. Intrigued, Prasad starts to unravel the mystery surrounding Marias demise, and in the process, he goes on to discover the ghosts that haunt his own past.

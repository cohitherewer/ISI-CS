	Not just politics, economics too has to be about people in a democracy. No agenda for economic development can work if it ends up alienating the people. The Union environment and forests ministry has not acted too soon in vetoing the Vedanta groups bauxite-mining project in Orissa. The violations of its guidelines that the ministry cited for its decision are clearly of a serious nature. Only a few weeks earlier, the ministry stalled work for Poscos integrated steel project in Orissa. It is possible that the clearance for the Vedanta groups refinery project, too, could come under a cloud. The environment and forests minister, Jairam Ramesh, says that there is no deal linking the governments moves on the two projects by Posco and Vedanta. But there is a larger link that connects the new national mineral policy to the questions of land and livelihood alienation of the community living in the countrys mining belt. Across the country, local communities are protesting, often violently, against the acquisition of their land, forests, water and other resources by advancing armies of industrialization. Singur in West Bengal and Kalinganagar in Orissa started a process that has now spread to different parts of India.         
	Mining holds a special place in Indias new economic roadmap. The countrys rich mineral resources have caught the worlds attention. The fact that only five per cent of Indias mineral wealth has actually been exploited makes the country an attractive proposition for investors from home and abroad. While declaring the new mining policy two years ago, the mining ministry estimated that foreign direct investment worth five trillion rupees could flow into the sector within five or six years of the new policy. But mining  or economic development as a whole  is not all about growth and FDI. It is also about the people who would be displaced from their land and livelihoods. It is about water, pollution, deforestation and other biodiversity issues. The top 50 mineral-bearing districts alone account for about one-fifth of Indias forest cover. These are also areas where some major rivers originate. Above all, the tribal people living there are among the poorest in the land. Also, 80 per cent of these districts are currently hit by the Maoist rebellion. Indias economic hopes from mining could remain a pipe dream unless the government and the industry adopt more inclusive policies.

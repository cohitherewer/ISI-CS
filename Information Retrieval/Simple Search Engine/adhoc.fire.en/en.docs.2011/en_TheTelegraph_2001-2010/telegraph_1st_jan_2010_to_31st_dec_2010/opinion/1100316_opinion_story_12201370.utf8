	Better late than never                  
	Sir  At last, the special investigation team, appointed by the Supreme Court, has summoned the chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, in connection with the Gulbarg Housing Society carnage of 2002, in which a former Congress member of parliament, Ehsan Jafri, was burnt alive with 69 others (First riot summons on Modi with FIR hole, March 12). This is perhaps the first time that a sitting chief minister has been summoned to appear before a SIT for questioning about his role in a pogrom.          
	One of the most hyped chief ministers in the country who happens to be a favourite of industrialists apart from being a Hindu icon  will have to fight tooth and nail against the allegation to save his popular image. While the Bharatiya Janata Party has acknowledged the summons as being a part of the legal process that has to be dealt with as per the process of law, it failed to apply the same yardstick on many similar cases. Even the former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, was unable to sack Modi when he failed in his duty.          
	The people must also be wondering why it took eight years to issue the summons which have been long overdue.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  The secular press seems to have gone euphoric with the news of summons being issued to the Gujarat chief minister by the SIT. In the process, they appear to have overlooked the snails pace at which the wheels of the legal machinery move in this country. First, the SIT is not a court of law to announce and carry out punishment. Second, even if the SIT finds incriminating evidence against Modi, would that deprive him of his constitutional right to approach a higher judicial tribunal for justice? Third, politically, this whole episode can be utilized by Modi to paint himself as a martyr, who has been made to suffer for championing the cause of many.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

                
	Tough decisions          
	Sir  Brijesh D. Jayals article, Time to walk the talk (March 4), is forthright. The army is indeed all-pervasive in Pakistan. The top brass, most of whom were originally landlords, have, over time, extended their feudal approach to politics, industry and business. The uniform protects them from any sense of accountability. Their writ alone runs. An unsettled political climate within Pakistan ensures the perpetuation of the nations dependence on this class of people. Even the United States of America deals with Pakistan army more assuredly than with the civilian leaders, and no one was happier than the US when Pervez Musharraf was playing the role of a two-in-one facilitator. Knowing all this too well, it is perplexing that the Indian leadership, irrespective of the party in power, hopes for a friendly walk together with our neighbour, and are willing to traverse a blind alley that is getting increasingly infested with Taliban snipers. There can never be a fortuitous time, now or in the future, for any meaningful exchange with Pakistan. Although unfortunate, a showdown, sooner than later, with a view to lower the Pakistan armys image, is perhaps an inevitable but a more fruitful alternative.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                
	Sir  Brijesh Jayal, in his otherwise excellent article, should have highlighted three additional points.           
	First, Islamabads practice of statecraft has been far superior to New Delhis, as the former is based on Jinnahs pragmatic foresight, while the latter still survives on Nehrus odd vision of living in a make-believe world, far removed from reality.          
	Second, we are basically a diffident and pusillanimous nation that has been brought up on Gandhis teaching of absorbing any amount of punishment without retaliating in kind. That is why we tend to opt for talks by willing to walk any number of extra miles.          
	Third, the primary concern of the Indian netas is pandering to the their target vote banks (which include various religious communities), not the security of the nation.                    
	Yours faithfully, J.K. Dutt, 
  Calcutta              
	Driving home          
	Sir  In response to Ticket to drive (March10), I would like to express my views about the proposal to ban people over 72 from driving. Although one appreciates the fact that concern about the health of senior citizens is the foremost reason behind such a proposal, the idea needs to be reviewed seriously. Periodic medical check-up, particularly in regard to those parameters essential for driving, before the renewal of licence could be of immense help.          
	Robbing the elderly of their independence in such a manner, as banning them from driving their own vehicles, could create a sense of alienation and loneliness. It would literally make them feel old and useless,which will unnecessarily enhance the feeling of being shunned by the society. I am sure senior citizens behind the wheel are capable of deciding for themselves when they need to stop driving on the roads.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Meenakshi Sanyal, Calcutta

                              Better fruit        
	 Rahul Gandhis tour of Tamil Nadu was proving to be quite a success until a youth Congress worker, rather sheepishly, asked him the dreaded question: regarding the price rise of onion and other essential commodities. The AICC gen-sec was not at all pleased with such a tactless remark. Instead of replying directly, Rahul asked the questioner to focus his energies on contributing more actively to the frontal organization.      
	Elsewhere, in Bhagalpur, the BJPs Shahnawaz Hussain faced another trial at his own constituency. Sitting down to a meal of biryani, Hussain realized that he had not been offered the customary raw onion that comes along with the free chutney. Although the reason behind the omission was pretty obvious, Hussain reportedly lost his cool and lamented that Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the great connoisseur and popularizer of biryani, must be turning in his grave.                        
	 Jaganmohan Reddy seems determined to throw a few surprises at the Congress. The rebel leader is having a whale of a time choosing from potential Congress MLAs vying to defect to him. The other night, Ghulam Nabi Azad, the Congresss point man responsible for keeping the flock together in Andhra Pradesh, could not tear himself away from late-night Telugu television. For the better part of the night, the Kashmiri Azad closely followed the mannerism and body language of young Jagan, and discovered striking similarities between him and his late father. Azad, the astute political animal that he is, is now dreading the prospect of facing Jagan in the electoral field.                            
	 The AICC plenary ended on a high note, with the supremacy of the Sonia-Rahul-Manmohan trio re-established. But the mega meet pleased the treasurer, Motilal Vohra, for another reason as well. The session had the provision of giving away special invitee passes to those who are not official members of the Grand Old Party. Now it appears that the receipts show a much higher figure than what the actual number of those who turned up would indicate. Perhaps Delhi was too cold for some who had spent good money but did not care to show up. But the collections, nonetheless, have been good  and all in white as well!                            
	 The revelations by WikiLeaks have certainly pleased some sections of the countrys political class. The chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, has been gloating, while his rival, Mehbooba Mufti, is running desperately for cover. As it happens, the leaks have thrown some light on alleged large-scale violation of human rights in the valley during the reign of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, Mehboobas father, as chief minister. Omar, of course, now wants Mehbooba to come clean.                            
	 The AICC gen-sec Digvijay Singh is in a tight spot. Singhs comparison of the sangh parivar with the Nazis has not gone down well with many, including some in the Congress. The Israeli embassy has also reportedly lodged a protest, saying that the suffering of Jews cannot be compared with the current political situation in India. Some RSS leaders and sympathisers cornered an AICC functionary and demanded to know the number of persons who have allegedly been killed by the RSS in independent India. And, if such were really the case, then why have successive Congress regimes not clamped down on hundreds of sanghis, especially since the magnitude of the excesses committed by them is so high?                            
	 Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hoodas stars are not shining bright. His detractors in the Congress are not the only ones demanding his ouster  even his own Jat community is distancing itself from him. Since a Jat boy threw a shoe at him, attempts are being made to dispel the view that the Jats are against him. But a Jat mahasabha in Mundka village in Delhi, expected to cover 360 khap panchayats, turned out to be a flop. There is a growing perception that Hoodas days are numbered. Giving weight to the speculation is the superstition that whoever has visited Mundka has lost his gaddi within a year. Both Madanlal Khurana and Sushma Swaraj were unseated within months of addressing rallies there. But Hooda is unlikely to run to either of them for tea and sympathy.

	 Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee may not have been very lucky as the leader of Lok Sabha this year, but the corporate sector left no stone unturned to make him feel special. The moment he stepped inside Assocham to attend the 90th foundation day of the chamber on December 10, he was greeted with a pre-recorded Happy Birthday tune, asked to cut a cake, and even to have a bite of it, despite his high blood sugar. All this in spite of his polite reminder that his birthday happened to be on the following day, December 11.       
	Of course, the next day, when he flew in to Mumbai to take part in a different corporate platform, he was given another birthday bash. After a politically and financially tumultuous year, Pranabda could jolly well use some positive attention.

	TRICKSTER CITY: WRITINGS FROM THE BELLY OF THE METROPOLIS   Viking, Rs 499
    
	Memory has an uncanny ability to jumble things up, defy the logic of sequence and spring surprises during unfancied moments. Similarly, a city doggedly refuses to conform to an easily decipherable pattern, accommodating things that are glaringly incompatible. This probably is the reason why T.S. Eliot refers to memory time and again in Rhapsody on a Windy Night, while portraying London through objective correlatives at different hours of the night. In his essay, titled On Some Motifs in Baudelaire, Walter Benjamin describes Baudelaire as flneur  an observer of life who seeks refuge in a crowd using it as a veil of anonymity.  
	The milling crowd and the faceless masses are the leitmotifs of urban life. The present book, translated from Hindi by Shveta Sarda, captures the murmurs and muffled voices that rise within the swelling crowd, only to be submerged under a relentless cacophony. The contributors are complete strangers to a sheltered life. They are repeatedly evicted, dumped on Delhis waste lands, traumatized by police atrocities, and sometimes made to disappear mysteriously. But the only thing they know is to survive the monumental odds, manifest in the form of State power and formidable laws related to citizenship.        
	The accounts often bristle with disturbing insights. The book compiles 36 contributions distributed under eight sections: arrival, en route, repartee, whereabouts, eviction, incognito, encounter and frontier. The section titles reflect the variable themes and moods that chart the contours of a mans relationship with his city.         
	In the introduction to his book, The City and Man, Leo Strauss wrote, The theme of political philosophy is the City and Man. The City and Man explicitly is the theme of classical political philosophy. The Man that Strauss refers to is certainly not the man represented in this volume. When Aristotle wrote in A Treatise on Government that a non-self-sufficient individual is to a city what other parts are to a whole, he could not have imagined the dispensable parts of the city these wretched individuals represent.        
	The writings in this collection startle with their nuggets of wisdom. In Having seen it from close, Suraj Rai describes the demolition of settlements and writes, That is how we make and structure our memories throughout our lives. We narrate our life as if it were a story from the moment we begin living it. In Is Delhi shrinking?, Azra Tabassum has this to say: The taste of the city is its crowds, its density. When the number of people reduces, how will this city breathe? Will this city become a place where, rather than living in it, people merely spend their lives in it? Very few people, other than the displaced, will be able to distinguish between living and spending a life. In The night was dark then, Rakesh Khairalia talks about Bhoori, an unknown young woman, who dies unattended on a deserted street in the dark hours of the night. In the morning, she becomes yet another body to be identified by the policemen and the municipal corporation. The concluding sentences convey a chilling sense of popular nonchalance regarding the official ritual after this death: Did something happen? Nothing happened. Drenched in their duties, their work, they floated into the day, searching again the restfulness in their lives.        
	These vignettes challenge the bhadralok readers perception of reality. Like Baudelaire, the flneur, he may be tempted to say, For me everything is an allegory.                    ARNAB BHATTACHARYA

	It is not enough to know an adversarys game plan; the trick is to devise a strategy to foil it. New Delhi could not have been unaware of the possible political fallout of Thuingaleng Muivahs planned visit to his native village in Manipur. For the Naga leader, this was no simple case of home coming after a long time. The visit was meant to be politically symbolic as he wanted to use it to further justify his demand for the inclusion of all Naga-inhabited areas of Manipur into his proposed Greater Nagaland. Manipur has always opposed the demand, often violently. New Delhi should have weighed the possible repercussions when it cleared the visit and played its part carefully in setting the stage for it. The violence over the visit and the subsequent stalemate suggest that the Centres handling of the issue left much to be desired.         
	The Union home ministrys failure is evident also in the complete mismatch between its strategy and the Manipur governments plan of action. The events have proved that the chief minister, Okram Ibobi Singh, was right in his assessment of law and order problems over Mr Muivahs visit. That New Delhi could not carry even a Congress-led government with it shows how badly the former has handled the issue. The Centres indiscretions have not only angered Mr Muivah but have also created a political problem for Mr Ibobi Singh with six Naga members of the state legislature resigning over the state governments decision not to allow Mr Muivah to enter the state. Both New Delhi and the Naga leader should move fast to mend matters so that the stalled visit does not derail the Naga peace talks or inflame ethnic passions in Manipur.

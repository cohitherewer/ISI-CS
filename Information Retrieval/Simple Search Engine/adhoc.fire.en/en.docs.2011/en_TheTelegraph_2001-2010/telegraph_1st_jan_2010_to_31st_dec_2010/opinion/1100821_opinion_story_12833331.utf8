	Distinct, yet in silent conversation, the two exhibitions of photographs  one by Richard Bartholomew entitled The Critics Eye, the other by his son, Pablo, entitled Outside In: 70s and 80s - A Tale of 3 Cities (till September 25)  create within the single space of the Harrington Street Arts Centre an experience of peaceful visual pleasure. It is not the peace of stasis, for both sets of black-and-white photographs provoke a sense of travelling in time. The Fifties and Sixties become real again in Richards images, while Pablos hold, as if for a luminous moment, the brittle, intense, youthful life of the Seventies.        
	Richard Bartholomew, remembered as art critic, poet, painter and careful recorder of the art experience of his time, has been less known as photographer than his photojournalist son. But Pablos earliest photographs travel back towards his fathers black-and-white world, claiming both origin and difference. The viewer is led through Richards photographs to Pablos. But time travels in many directions here, and one moves forward and back again, across and over, caught in the currents and reflections generated by the images.                  
	The first photograph, Richards Rati wearing a sari (right), with the end of the sari billowing out behind his wife and her barely glimpsed lower hand blurring as she settles her sari in its last twirl, is like a keynote struck. At the centre of the routine yet graceful movement is stillness  in the womans lowered face, chiselled by light, self-absorbed yet impersonal, its attention on the sari. The patient cameras eye, loving the woman and the moment, lets light from a window mould and texture the walls, face and figure wreathed in soft folds. Always gentle yet measuring, Richards camera repeatedly captures the life inside his home, as Rati and his sons, Pablo and Robin, read and sleep, on beds, mats, chairs, with books, papers, ashtrays matches, glasses, spectacles and bags scattered around them. Light from a window or an unseen bulb, sometimes secretively angled, gives to surfaces, the wood and cane and metal, the floors and walls, the sheets and covers, an almost tangible reality, evoking the smell and feel of living in a certain time and place. In the View of the kitchen, Old Delhi, light streams inwards over discarded slippers through the door, letting things animate the empty space with their essential thing-ness, used and worn, and somehow loved  wicker seat, racks and shelves and pail.        
	More deliberately public, the artists portraits and groups have acquired a different kind of historic importance, because the critics eye is unerring in its choice and framing. The image of Husain in profile, in partial dark with his face touched by light, is almost uncanny in its mysterious auguring. Pablos portraits and figures enshrine a different kind of history, more personal, yet documenting the spirit of a particular milieu at a particular time, evoking music, drugs, individuality, and a kind of youthful inwardness full of the moment. Innocently theatrical or moodily candid, Maya, Zarine, Pooh or Ayesha, Amita, Nommie, Yusuf and Chander, sit, lie, knit, dance or light up, gather in gangs, sprawl and chat, caught in a fragile intensity almost cinematic in sensibility and subtle drama.        
	Pablos camera, too, captures the air and breath of life in the cities he explores, as his fathers had done. There is something almost fantastical, even mythic, in some of Richards outdoor photographs. But the streak of curving movement in Pablos A bird in my room looks forward to a new kind of visual poetry, as does Solar eclipse on TV. His Kitchen is a still life taken from the outside, with the wall texture and light almost mannered in its effect, composed as if in reply to Richards suggestion of limitless space in the photograph of his kitchen.        
	Pablos camera often seeks the spirit of its subject in the drama of mood and positioning, as in My parents, Richard and Rati, at home  the careful identification reflected in the particularity of the moment. This recurs, with a less self-conscious engagement but greater deliberation, in A horse and matador van (top left). With the single glow of light, the shadowed ribs of the horse, the front of the van, and the man moving on the grained surface of the pavement, the camera seems to have caught a scene from a Sixties thriller. It is difficult not to recall, paradoxically, what Pablo will do with roads and buildings and buffaloes and water in the future, as he travels the world to capture explosions and floods and other disasters. Can his publicity photograph of Arundhati Roy, glowing serenely in tender colour, be free of the experience of his earliest portraits?        
	In Outside In, the photographer inhabits his subjects space more palpably than is discernible in A Critics Eye. Not only do the two titles suggest this difference, so does the number of self-portraits in Pablos collection. Richard is a shadow on a wall (Self-portrait, 1971) behind an ordered, busy desk; Pablos torso is reflected in a mirror behind a table strewn with the disorder of impatient, youthful creativity (Self-portrait, 1979). He is not a watching shadow, he needs to be in as well as outside. It will be different in the future.

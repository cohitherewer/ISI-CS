	Decades dont usually have the courtesy to begin and end on the right year. The social and cultural revolution that Western countries think of when they talk of the Sixties only got underway in 1962-63, and didnt end until the Middle East war and oil embargo of 1973-74. But this one has been quite neat: the Noughties began with the Islamist terrorist attacks on the United States of America in 2001, and they ended with a global financial meltdown in the past year.        
	The terrorist threat to the West was minor, but the Wests hugely disproportionate and ill-considered response was a key factor in the great shift that defines the decade. The War on Terror, the invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq and all the rest, did not deter a Muslim Nigerian student from trying to blow up an airliner over Detroit. It also accelerated the rise of Asia and the relative decline of the West. That shift was happening anyway. When China and India, with 40 per cent of the worlds population between them, are growing economically three to four times as fast as the major Western countries, its only a matter of time until they catch up with the older industrial economies.        
	Back in 2003, however, the researchers at Goldman Sachs predicted that the Chinese economy would surpass that of the USs by the mid-2040s. By the middle of this year, they were predicting that it would happen in the mid-2020s  and this year, for the first time, China built more cars than the US. That acceleration is in large part a consequence of the huge diversion of Western attention and resources that was caused by the War on Terror.        
	Prestige is a quality that cannot be measured or quantified, but a reputation for competence in the use of power is a great asset in international affairs. After the centuries-old European empires wasted their wealth and the lives of tens of millions of their citizens in two world wars in only 30 years, their empires just melted away.                
	New order        
	Something similar has happened over the past decade to the US. Unwinnable wars fought for the wrong reasons always hurt a great powers reputation, and wars fought amidst needless tax cuts, burgeoning deficits and financial anarchy are even more damaging if the countrys power depends heavily on a global financial empire.        
	The US spent the past decade cutting its own throat financially, ending with the near-death experience of the financial meltdown. The Europeans made all the same mistakes, only more timidly, and the Japanese sat the decade out on the sidelines, mired in a seemingly endless recession. The old order is passing, the US dollar is on its way out as the only global currency and the real power is shifting to mainland Asia.        
	Or is it? There are two trends that could slow or even stop this shift. One is peak oil; the other is global warming. In Europe, North America and Japan, energy consumption is growing slowly or not at all, and it is relatively cheap and easy to reduce dependence on imported oil. Whereas Chinese and Indian dependence on imported oil is soaring. So is their use of coal.        
	Thats unfortunate, because for purely geographical reasons these countries are far more vulnerable to high temperatures than the older industrial nations. At even two degrees centigrade higher average global temperature, they face floods, droughts and storms on a massive scale, probably accompanied by a steep fall in food production. That sort of thing could abort even the Chinese and Indian economic miracles.        
	So were back in the old world where the future is uncertain. We can only observe the trends, and try to remember that they are always contingent. But at the moment, it looks like the decade when the West finally lost its domination over the worlds economy.

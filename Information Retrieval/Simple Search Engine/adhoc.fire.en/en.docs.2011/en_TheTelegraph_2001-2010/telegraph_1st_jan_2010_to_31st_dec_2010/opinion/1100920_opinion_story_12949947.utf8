                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MODEST THREAT                                  Gwynne Dyer                              
	People often wind up believing their own cover story. The former British prime minister, Tony Blair, for example, is trapped forever in the rationalizations he used in 2003 to explain why he was going along with George Bushs invasion of Iraq. He was at it again recently, telling the BBC that radical Islam is the greatest threat in the world today. But is militant Islam really a bigger threat than nuclear war? Bigger than the risk that infectious diseases are going to make a major comeback as antibiotics become ineffective? Bigger even than the threat of global warming?        
	Blair has to say it is, because he was one of the people who launched a crusade against radical Islamists after 9/11. Or at least against those whom they accused of being supporters of radical Islam, although many of them were nothing of the sort. Its far too late for Blair to change his story, and the argument about Iraq has gone stale by now. Except for one thing: many influential people in Western countries still insist that radical Islam is indeed the worlds greatest threat. Some do it for career reasons, others do it from conviction, but they all get a more respectful hearing than they deserve.        
	It depends on what you mean by radical Islam, of course. In some Western circles, any Muslim who challenges Western policies is by definition an Islamist radical. But if it means Sunni Muslims who believe in the Salafist interpretation of Islam and are willing to use terrorist violence to spread it, then there arent very many of them: a few hundred thousand at most. These people are unlikely to start blowing things up in New Jersey or Bavaria, though they are a serious threat to fellow Muslims living in their own countries. The vast majority of them speak no foreign language and could never get a passport. Its a big, ugly problem for countries like Iraq and Pakistan, but it is a pretty small problem for everybody else. The number of people killed by radical Islamist terrorists in the past decade outside the Muslim world is probably no more than 15,000.                
	Blown up        
	None of these deaths is justifiable, but it is weird to insist that a phenomenon that causes an average of, say, 1,500 non-Muslim deaths a year on a planet with almost seven billion people is the worlds greatest threat. Yet the people who launched the war on terror do say that, as do many others who built their careers by pushing the same proposition.        
	They do it by the simple device of warning (to quote Blairs recent interview) that there is the most enormous threat from the combination of this radical extreme movement and the fact that, if they could, they would use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. You cant take a risk with that happening. Never mind the quite limited damage that terrorists actually do. Imagine the damage they might do if they got their hands on such weapons. Very well, let us imagine just that. During the Cold War, the United States of America and the Soviet Union had 10,000 nuclear weapons ready to launch at each other. If they had ever gone to war, millions of people would have been killed.         
	If radical Islamists ever got their hands on a nuclear weapon, it would be one bomb, not 10,000 warheads. If they managed to explode it, it would be a local disaster, not a global holocaust. Besides, just how does invading Muslim countries shrink any of these dangers? It probably increases them by outraging Muslims and providing the extremists with a steady flow of recruits. Terrorism by radical Islamists or anybody else is a real threat, but a modest one. It cannot be defeated, but it can be contained by good police work and wise policy choices. It may make it to the top ten global threats, but it wouldnt make it into the top three. Anybody who says this has something to sell or something to hide.

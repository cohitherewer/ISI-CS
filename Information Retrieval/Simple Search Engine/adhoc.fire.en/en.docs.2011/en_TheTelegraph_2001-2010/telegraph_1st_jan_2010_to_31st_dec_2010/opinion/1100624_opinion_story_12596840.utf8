	Want leave to watch the World Cup? No problem. There are doctors prescriptions available for any kind of illness to enable you to take sick leave. A doctor who posted an ad online told an interested customer that she could provide the diagnosis, medical reports from hospitals and discharge certificates, but the customer must have either a history or a symptom of some ailment such as backache, inflammation and so on. As a sample, she sent over diagnosis and sick-leave certificates from a Beijing hospital. She could not get these from hospitals of other cities, she said, but was confident that Beijing certificates would work everywhere!        
	The World Cup fever is on. Bars are vying with one another to lure viewers, specially among the high-spending expat community. Five-star hotels have guess the winner competitions, lucky draws and free drinks equal to the number consumed. But most viewers flock to the Bar Streets, which dont need to offer any promotion. These open-air bars lining the entire street are always full, noisy and stay open till the wee hours.        
	China has a personal connection to the World Cup  those annoying vuvuzelas, which are blown all the time during the match, are almost all made in China. A handful of factories in two cities, flooded with orders since November, have just finished production. But though their production value increased by 50 per cent, they didnt make a killing  their profit margins are just 5 per cent with distributors getting most of the money. And, of course, most of the World Cup memorabilia have also been made here. Football jerseys are also selling like hot cakes here for 75 yuan a piece, accurate copies of the originals down to the last detail.                
	Favourite team        
	China qualified for the 2002 World Cup, but lost every match. Not surprisingly, the Chinese laugh derisively when they talk about their football team, in contrast to their pride in their countrys performance in other sports. China failed to qualify for this World Cup, but 1,000 Chinese are in South Africa to cheer their old allies, the North Koreans, on tickets given by the North Korean Sports Committee in Beijing. These include Chinese actors, singers and sports officials who would otherwise have been there to cheer the Chinese team.        
	Chinese blogs are full of praise for the poorly-paid North Korean team, which looks under-nourished and which has to make do with just a few plain uniforms, neither from Nike nor from Adidas. So moved was one Chinese who lives in South Africa by the Koreans grit that he rushed to Johannesburg, bought 10 cases of water, 20 Cokes, six boxes of chocolate, and two big boxes of Milo, and went to the hotel where the team was staying to give it to them. The team was said to be in a meeting and hence could not meet him; however, he left the stuff there.        
	What caught the Chinese viewers fancy, apart from the Koreans fighting spirit, was the image of the Korean star footballer, Jong Tae-Se, crying as the Korean national anthem was being played. Jong lives in Japan, yet chose to play for his own poorer country, said the Chinese bloggers. A few did speculate that Jongs patriotic tears could be ascribed to the fact that he didnt have to suffer in his own inhuman country, with its empty belly revolution.        
	Wrote one: I wish them the best, hope they wont be punished to coal mining if they play a bit better, that during their leisure time they can spend it with the colourful world and its colourful people, so that they will know that the people of other countries actually have good lives, and dont need their liberation, that they should be more concerned with their own countrys suffering people.

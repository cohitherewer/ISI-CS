	Basing their new plays on short stories, two established Bengali dramatists explore how Everyman characters can make a difference to society. The theme is not original for Mohit Chattopadhyaya, whose fascination with telling simple but idealistic stories about ordinary people stretches back two decades, or for Dwijen Bandyopadhyay, who has directed and acted the lead in many of them, including the latest, Bhutnath, produced by Samstab (picture).        
	Herman Melvilles Bartleby, the Scrivener inspired Bhutnath, whose obedient, eponymous typist decides one fine day to say no to his bosss orders. Chattopadhyaya transplants him to a typical soul-killing, file-pushing office stacked to the ceiling with yellowing papers, where his sudden self-assertion makes his colleagues recognize that they have the individual right to refuse to do something they should not do, rather than unthinkingly carry out mechanical and dehumanizing tasks. Unlike Melville, who concludes his tale grimly, Chattopadhyaya characteristically opts for a happier ending, though we wonder if Indian babus will ever smile at work. Ironically, for a play showing the tedium of monotonous bureaucracy, Bandyopadhyay (as the mild boss looking forward to retirement) repeats a variation of similar Chattopadhyayan roles that he has enacted before; such parts dont test him now. Partha Sarathi Chandra performs Bhutnath, who prefers not to do things, with a forlorn diffidence like Ionescos Brenger. Partha Sengupta and Subrata Samajdar contrast each other as the mid-level officers.        
	Sekhar Samaddar developed Abhashs Baba Asben from a vignette by Procheto Gupta in which an otherwise contented man starts seeing (and talking to) his father who had died a few years previously. It seems he had unfinished business with him  things left unsaid  which pressures him psychologically to deal with the absence in this fashion. Allegorically, his father could represent a preceptor from whom the collective psyche expects guidance (thus, his stated resemblance to Netaji may reflect an affectionate dig at Bengali idolization of Netaji). As in Bhutnaths case, everybody thinks the son (played most naturally by Samaddar himself) has gone bonkers and requires professional help. His wife (acted by a harassed Enakshi Sen) leads them, until the surprise conclusion. However, some of the other figures introduced by Samaddar do not seem essential to the basic theme of the need for human interaction to settle relationships kindly.        
	Both plays have a pleasant and comic touch, but both could do with editing in the middle to intensify impact. Bengali groups persist with the convention of an interval that such scripts should drop. Both productions feature interesting sets designed by Soumik Piyali in Bhutnath, magnified photographic prints of dusty shelves looking like the Writers Buildings or any other government hellhole, and in Baba Asben, a lattice effect suggesting mental light and shadow.

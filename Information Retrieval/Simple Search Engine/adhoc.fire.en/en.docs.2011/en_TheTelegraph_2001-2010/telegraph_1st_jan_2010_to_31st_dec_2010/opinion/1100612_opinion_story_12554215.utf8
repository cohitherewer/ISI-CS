The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | in praise of a goal
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        In praise of a goal                                                          
	Short of the Olympics, the greatest sporting extravaganza in the world is the football World Cup. For one month, across the globe, all kinds of people  the rich and the poor, the religious fundamentalist and the secularist, the scholar and the idiot  will be glued to their television screens (this excludes the fortunate few who will be physically present at the grounds) to watch some of the dazzling shooters trying to score a goal while some equally dazzling defenders go all out to stop them. Sporting skills of a very high order will be packed into 90 minutes every day for one month. Passions will run high in the countries whose teams are playing; they will also run high, strangely enough, in India, even though an India XI playing in the World Cup is more than a pie in the sky. Debate will rage among Indian sports lovers about this plight of Indian football since countries smaller in size and in gross domestic product are far more successful in kicking the football around in the global arena. Despite the love of Indians for football, India, in so far as the World Cup is concerned, is irrelevant.        
	Looking back at the history of previous world cups, it is clear that the contest is really between the countries of Europe and the countries of Latin America. The contrasts among the competing countries range from the style of football to the size of the economy. Europe is part of the developed world despite being badly hit by the recent recession. South America, on the other hand, is part of the developing world. The contrast is between the former colonizer and the former colony. Even more striking are the different kinds of football in which the countries of the two continents excel. At one time, it would have been convenient to describe the contrast as one between individual genius and teamwork or between brilliance and discipline or between magic and reason. Those stark differences are gradually being blurred. Latin American football, while retaining its native talent for dribbling and ball play, has learnt the virtues of teamwork, defence and formation. European football, within its disciplinary framework, has created space for sheer individual brilliance. This has made international football more competitive, and watching it even more attractive.        
	One reason  many would argue that this is the only reason  for this blurring of distinctions is the fact that every top soccer player in the world plays for a leading European football club. The primacy of football in Europe and the wealth that the game garners there have done away with the differences of nationality, race and colour of skin. Sport has often been described as a great leveller: of no other sport is this more true than soccer. It is this embedded spirit of egalitarianism that accounts for the global popularity of football. A goal is recognized everywhere from the alleys of Calcutta to the Middle Kingdom in Beijing to the glitzy casinos of Monaco to an oasis in the Sahara.

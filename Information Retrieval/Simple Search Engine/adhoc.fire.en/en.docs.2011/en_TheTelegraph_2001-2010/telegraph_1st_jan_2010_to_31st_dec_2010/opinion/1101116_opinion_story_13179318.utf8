	The West Bengal governments financial bankruptcy has a long history, stretching back to the time when Jyoti Basu was the chief minister of the state. This is so obvious that even grandmothers in West Bengal, without any knowledge of the intricacies of public finance, can work it out. The West Bengal government has been spending money without adequate sources of revenue. This overspending is an essential part of the history of Basus tenure as chief minister. His successor has done precious little to remedy the problem. The situation has gone from bad to worse and today it is untenable with a debt burden estimated at Rs 1.69 lakh crore. The excess of expenditure over revenue is the direct result of policies pursued by the Left Front government for over three decades. These policies pampered the electorate rather than following the path of financial prudence. This enabled the Left to win elections but reality has finally caught up with Asim Dasgupta, the states finance minister. The Left today stands hoist by its own petard.        
	There are three elements to the present crisis that need to be highlighted. The most simple of these is the low level of excise collection in West Bengal  only Rs 1,500 crore, whereas states like Andhra Pradesh collect many times more than this as excise duty. West Bengal has very few liquor shops compared to Andhra Pradesh. One result of this is the proliferation of illicit liquor. Mr Dasgupta now wants to call an all-party meeting to resolve the moral issues involved in opening more liquor shops. Why did he not open more such shops in the high noon of Left power when no opposition existed? The other issue concerns the huge salary bill of the government, a large part of which is devoted to paying the salaries of teachers. The Left Front government has steadfastly followed the policy of wooing teachers to convert them into a solid vote bank. Finally, there is the Lefts championing of small savings through post offices offering interest rates that are higher than those prevailing in the market. A part of these savings comes back to the state as a loan, thus increasing the debt burden. The Left Front government has never objected to this process; in fact, it has connived in it in the name of favouring the poor. For its parlous plight the Left has no one to blame save itself and the irresponsibility of its erstwhile leader, Jyoti Basu.

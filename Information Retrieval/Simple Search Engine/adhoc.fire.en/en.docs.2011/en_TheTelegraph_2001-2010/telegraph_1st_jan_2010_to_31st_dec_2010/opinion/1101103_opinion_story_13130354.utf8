                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SLOW FADE                                                    
	It sounds sensible, but also a bit sad  not so much for Calcutta as for its culture-loving chief minister. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has announced that the Calcutta film festival is going to be a curtailed affair this year, with his government shelling out much less money for it. But what could have sounded like a bang sounds more like a whimper from the chief minister. His logic is impeccable though. There is no point wasting public money on an industry that can generate its own funds for festivals. Besides, lovers of serious cinema in the city can get their films much more easily now for home viewing. So, film festivals do not create as much frisson, even in a city like Calcutta, as they used to a decade ago. As a result, not only has this years festival been budgeted down, but there will also be fewer films shown at fewer venues with fewer invited delegates attending. Mr Bhattacharjees heart seems not to be in it as well. After years of putting a sarkari stamp on festivals (and on cinema and culture, in general) in the city, to the extent of slowing down private initiative, the government seems to be minimalizing its subsidizing of culture. But the inevitable nature of this change of heart somehow feels more like defeat than progress, in terms of the governments overall political image, especially with the chief ministers principal political opponent being invited to the international film festival in Goa, which will take place with its usual fanfare.        
	Perhaps Calcuttans could have hoped for an alternative scenario in their city, in which the festival could have been given a fresh lease of life precisely because of the governments withdrawal from it, with private sponsors coming in and making some sort of an event of it. And here, the chief minister may be right, after all. The film festivals moment has passed, and watching films at home has become a much better option than going to a technologically backward Nandan complex or to multiplexes showing standard commercial fare. Yet, after decades of stifling cinematic creativity, technology, marketing, education and conservation in the name of patronage, the state governments withdrawal becomes one last occasion to think about where the governments control over matters cultural in Bengal has left the state, its culture and the government. Tollywood is in the process of discovering its own robustness today. It probably is just as well that the chief ministers brow happens to be too high for it.

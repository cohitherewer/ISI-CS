The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Two villains in a simplistic tale
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TWO VILLAINS IN A SIMPLISTIC TALE                                                                  
	Left Politics In Bengal: Time travels among Bhadralok Marxists By Monobina Gupta, Orient BlackSwan, Rs 245        
	Good journalism may be the first draft of history, but it takes more than journalistic information to give important events or phenomena truly historical perspectives. It is one thing to retell important events that have been reported in the newspapers, but it is quite another to try and make sense of them in dispassionate, analytical terms.        
	Unfortunately, this book does not quite succeed in making sense of the turns and twists of Left politics in Bengal. Everyone interested in West Bengals politics can see that the long reign of the Left is being threatened as never before in the past three decades. But an informed analysis of why and how this is happening takes a lot more than stating the obvious.        
	Gupta seems to depend too much on the obvious to capture the big picture. Most newspaper reports and analyses indicate that the issue of land for industry, as in Singur and Nandigram, has been the undoing of the Left in West Bengal. For most, it is the beginning of the Lefts end. Or is it that the Singur-Nandigram upsurge only ended a process that actually began much earlier?         
	The first big battle by farmers anywhere in India to save their land from acquisition by a government or an industrial group occurred in the mid-1980s in Balasore, Orissa. In the current wave of farmers battles for their land, the first big casualty in police firing also took place in Orissa  at Kalinganagar  where 13 people, all belonging to tribal communities, were killed in January, 2006 during a protest against the proposed land acquisition for a new steel project by the Tata group.        
	It should help one understand the fallout of the Singur-Nandigram events on West Bengals politics if one compares it to the political character and impact of the agitations in Orissa and subsequently in other states. Obviously, there are factors in West Bengals politics that made the land issue explode in the Lefts face in ways that were very different from those in other states.        
	Such a study can help explain the relationship between the land question and the politics of a state at different periods of independent Indias attempts to break free of the stranglehold of a backward, agrarian economy.        
	This book, though, offers the familiar sequence of the land-related revolts against the ruling Left, beginning with Singur, and pins the declining popularity of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on the all-important land question. It also retells the old story of how the Lefts long rule was founded on its first push towards land reforms.        
	It ends at Lalgarh, where the largely tribal population is now tossed up and down in the bloody turf battles between the Maoists and Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress on the one hand and the CPI(M) and the joint security forces on the other. To Gupta, Lalgarh captures the wheel turning full circle with the Marxists joining the security forces to wage a battle against poor tribal people.        
	The author sees in all this a huge betrayal of the pro-poor ideology and politics that brought the Left to power in 1977. The chapter on how writers, theatre personalities and other cultural icons took up the strains from Singur-Nandigram is perhaps the best part of an otherwise unsatisfactory narrative.        
	Gupta has her answers as to why the Left took this suicidal U-turn. She singles out two villains  New Delhis neo-liberal economic policies, and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, West Bengals chief minister who is apparently presiding over the decline of the CPI(M) and the coming fall of its 34-year-long regime. She is clearly sympathetic towards Jyoti Basu, whose supposed pragmatism, as against Bhattacharjees hurried surrender to the neo-liberal policies, was a safe bet for the CPI(M)s continuance in office.        
	This is worse than simplistic. Anyone familiar with the CPI(M)s official documents knows that the partys shift towards big capital happened during Basus time. The change was a result of a complicated challenge thrown up by the collapse of socialism in the former Soviet Union and its socialist bloc, New Delhis entry into the new economic order and the stark economic realities of West Bengal. Bhattacharjee was only the public face of the mismatch of Left politics with the new world of an aggressive global capital.        
	Editors of the book could have been more careful about correcting some obvious errors. Runu Guha Neogy, the police officer who earned notoriety during the anti-Naxalite operations in West Bengal, was only an assistant commissioner, not Calcuttas police commissioner. And, most Bengalis know the popular song, Coffee houser sei adda ta, to be a Manna Dey hit. How could Gupta mistake it for a Hemanta Mukherjee song?                    ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

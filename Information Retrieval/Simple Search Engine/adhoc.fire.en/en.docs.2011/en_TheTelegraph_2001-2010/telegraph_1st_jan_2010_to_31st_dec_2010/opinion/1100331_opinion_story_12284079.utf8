                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GREEN AND BEAR IT                                  The National Green Tribunal Bill, 2009, may promise to deliver speedy justice in cases related to the environment, but it is riddled with loopholes, says Shabina Akhtar                                                
	Earlier this month the government tabled the National Green Tribunal Bill, 2009, in Parliament with the object of setting up a special autonomous tribunal to address environmental issues ranging from environmental clearance of development projects to the enforcement of legal rights related to the environment. The tribunal is also to have jurisdiction over civil cases pertaining to central environmental laws. The proposed law is supposed to expedite all cases relating to the environment as the dedicated tribunal will have powers equal to a civil court.        
	However, instead of rejoicing, environmental experts are sceptical about how effective the new law will be. In fact, even when it was first introduced in Parliament in July 2009, it was met with widespread criticism. Experts had urged that the tribunal should be given the power of contempt and that Schedule 1 of the bill  that gives the government the power to amend the list of laws over which the tribunal would have jurisdiction  be deleted. Subsequently, the parliamentary standing committee recommended several changes to the bill, including the two mentioned above. Though the Cabinet approved most of the amendments in November 2009, the two amendments related to the power of contempt and the deletion of Schedule I were rejected.        
	Some argue that this will seriously undermine the powers of the tribunal. That is because under Schedule I of the bill, the government can amend laws such as the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and so on, without going to Parliament and by merely issuing a draft notification to the effect. Says environmental health researcher Gopal Krishna, who is associated with a Delhi-based non governmental organisation (NGO), Ban Asbestos Network India, Retaining the right to amend the laws mentioned in Schedule I of the bill undermines the supremacy of Parliament. It is also a clear indication of the fact that the executive is getting more power than the legislature.        
	Others point out that the composition of the tribunal also leaves a lot to be desired. There will be one main tribunal and four other benches that will be set up in different parts of the country. The criteria listed in the bill for becoming a member of the tribunal indicates that it will comprise a battery of retired judicial members, bureaucrats and academics. That shows how effective this toothless tribunal will be, jeers Delhi-based environmentalist Archana Prasad.        
	Another grave flaw of the bill, say experts, is Section 14(3) that deals with the tribunals jurisdiction, powers and proceedings. Under this section no application for the adjudication of a dispute will be entertained by the tribunal unless the complaint is made within a period of six months from the date of the dispute or the date on which the effect of pollution became evident. This is ridiculous, exclaims Sanjay Upadhyay, advocate, Supreme Court, and managing partner, Enviro Legal Defence Firm, New Delhi. The effects of pollution can surface at any time. The bill keeps silent on disputes arising beyond the mentioned time frame.        
	Similarly, Section 15(3) states, No application for grant of any compensation or relief or restitution of property or environment under this section shall be entertained by the Tribunal unless it is made within a period of five years from the date on which the cause of such compensation or relief first arose.        
	According to Krishna, in most cases the adverse effects of various environmental and public health hazards like silicosis, asbestosis, and health issues owing to exposure to radiation or chemicals often take more than five years to manifest themselves. Therefore, the fixing of a period of five years should have either been removed, or the bill should have specified who would be liable for such effects beyond the specified time frame, he adds.              
	Another issue in the bill that is a matter of concern is that though the tribunal can direct a polluting agency to award compensation, it does not say anything about whether or not it can cancel the agencys clearance for the project. The bill talks about making compensation available in case of environmental hazards caused by companies but refrains from giving the tribunal the right to quash their environmental clearances, points out Delhi-based environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta.        
	Whats more, the bill seems to confine itself to non-serious environmental offences. For it says that every offence under this Act shall be deemed to be non-cognisable within the meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Hence, says Krishna, This law will be inadequate to deal with serious environmental cases like a Bhopal gas tragedy.        
	The bill also makes an attempt to deal with false or malicious charges of environmental pollution. Section 22(ii) lays down that in case of a false case or dismissal of a petition, the tribunal has the right to impose costs of trials and other costs upon the petitioners or the accused, as the case may be. However, even this may be counterproductive, stress activists. Imposing a penalty will act as a deterrent to concerned citizens who wish to complain against an environmental offence, says Sanjay Parikh, advocate, Supreme Court.        
	With so many loopholes still remaining experts doubt if the bill will be passed smoothly in the next session of Parliament that begins on April 12. Instead of ensuring rapid justice in environmental cases the new law will cause a bigger backlog. The only difference will be that the backlog will be with the tribunal and not scattered across high courts and the Supreme Court, sums up Souparno Banerjee of Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi.

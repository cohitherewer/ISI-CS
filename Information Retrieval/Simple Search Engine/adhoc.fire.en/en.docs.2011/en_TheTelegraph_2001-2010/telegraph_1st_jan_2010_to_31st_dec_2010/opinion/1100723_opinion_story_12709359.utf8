	THE CRIMES OF PARIS: A TRUE STORY OF MURDER, THEFT, AND DETECTION By DOROTHY AND THOMAS HOOBLER,   LITTLE, BROWN, Rs 995
          
	Consider this. On May 20, very late at night or a bit later, as the Eiffel Tower stood guard in the distance, a lone thief entered the high-security Muse dArt Moderne in Paris and walked out with five incredibly valuable paintings, representing the cream of 20th-century avant-garde in its glory years, conservatively valued at 500 million euros. An anguished art historian asked, what underworld connoisseur ordered this impeccable crime? We wont know that because stolen art is rarely unearthed. An angrier response was, why was the critical malfunction of the museums alarm systems allowed to remain that way for three months? An inside job? We have yet to find out.        
	Ninety-nine years earlier, on August 11, 1911, the Mona Lisa was lifted from the Louvre. The iconic work was recovered after two years and hangs, fortified, in the Louvre so that all you Paris travellers can line up for three hours, even on a slow day, to fleetingly glimpse the woman through thick, bullet-proof glass. So, apart from the obvious, what is the connection?         
	It seems that the thief knew the schedules and systems all too well, from the inside, mainly that the empty space where the Mona Lisa had hung would mean that the painting and frame, all of 200 pounds, had been taken away for photographing, as sometimes happened, for any number of days. He walked out of the salon with the lady hidden under his ersatz staff smock.         
	Even Pablo Picasso, who had earlier bought artefacts stolen from the Louvre, was implicated to begin with and later exonerated. Ironically, 99 years later, he is again in the news, once more for the wrong reason.        
	The contentious lady was recovered two years later, though in their scrupulously researched and pacily written book, the husband-wife team of Dorothy and Thomas Hoobler wonders if the original was ever found and whether the one hanging in the Louvre is the original Leonardo work. After all, they write, many know of the lucrative trade in highly original Mona Lisa copies, some that date back to the time Leonardo painted his original. If you buy the stolen Mona Lisa, accurate to the last coat of darkened varnish and the highly distinctive pattern of craquelure  the cracks that have appeared on the surface of the paint over time  you can hardly go around advertising the fact; so you store it in your garage and look at it every once in a while. And as long as the dealer is assured of this, he can create more sales, provided, of course, that the counterfeiting is impeccable. And so on.        
	The Hooblers, however, conclude that it was the original Mona Lisa that was recovered, in itself a highly exciting interlude because the motives for the theft and its subsequent return had become, in the supercharged atmosphere of Europe, and particularly Paris of the early 1900s, an anthem for the disenchanted and the chauvinistic. Italys bounty must be returned to Italy. We Anarchists must blacken our political leaders who have infamously sold out France on issues of Alsace-Lorraine and Agadir. To the Parisian in the streets and the pensions and the cafes and the night places, where the artistic and the intellectual gathered, stealing was a bourgeois word; it was a matter of reprise individuelle  taking back by individuals. Much of the Hoobler material deals with such issues rather than the theft and recovery, both of which lack sufficient animation.        
	But the Mona Lisa affair is not why I liked the book so much. Sure, the Hooblers start and end their book with the theft, but they soon spin off into the realms of, first, the scientific detection of crime and, then, into a scrutiny of the socio-political milieu of the late 19th- and early 20th-century Paris. The Hooblers seminal research tracks the growth of the dreaded Sret , the French equivalent of the FBI but with several twists in its tail, the career of Francois-Eugene Vidocq, who started the countrys first private detective agency, and the first slow steps in the development of criminal inquiry, which began with bertillonage, the science of anthropometry or man measurement, and, concurrently, archival documentation, created by the legendary, if sometimes error-prone, Alphonse Bertillon (witness the miscarriage of justice in the Alfred Dreyfus case), as a means to pin down both victim and perpetrator. From there on, it was an exponential move into the delicate science of fingerprinting, though I would have wanted the Hooblers to spend a little more time on the pioneering work of Sir William Herschel of the Bengal government round about the mid-1800s. Most importantly, these times marked the rise of the scientific detective in fact and fiction: Poes fabled Auguste Dupin was actually inspired by Vidocqs Memoirs, and Dupin, in turn, was a template for Frances first great fictional detective, Monsieur Lecoq, whose creator had read Baudelaires translation of Poe. The other significant metaphor of the period was that of the grand detective who once was a grand criminal, like Vidocq in real life and Lecoq in fiction.         
	The Hoobler book has to be classified as reportage; it offers little analysis and somewhat less of persuasion. For instance, it devotes a largish segment to the escapades of the ill-fated Bonnot gang, whose ability to get the better of the citys law enforcement machinery at every twist and turn had the populace thumbing their collective nose at Authority. It would therefore have been exciting to draw parallels between them in 1911 and the Bonnie and Clyde gang whose exploits were uncannily similar, as was the popular sentiment they generated, though the two were separated by thousands of miles and two decades.         
	Again, with their predilection for hard facts, the Hooblers ignore what I think could have been an engaged look at the politico-social fabric of Paris which was being shredded by the anarchists, the nihilists and plain dyed-in-the-wool discontents. The media, of course, fuelled the subversion in thought and action and kept the reality of la belle poque alive and kicking. And it sold copies.         
	I believe that the Hooblers in The Crimes of Paris are often enslaved by their research. Whilst this is not such a terrible thing in itself, it is best for the reader to know that this is one of those books where he has to script his own drama in the privacy of his mind.                    PARTHA BASU

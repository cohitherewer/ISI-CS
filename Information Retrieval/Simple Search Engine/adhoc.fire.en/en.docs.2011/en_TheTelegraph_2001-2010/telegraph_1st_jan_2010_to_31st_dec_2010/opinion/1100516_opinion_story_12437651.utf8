	Paradise lost                  
	Sir  The continuing strikes in Darjeeling have ruined the tourism industry there (Tourists stranded on way to hills, May 15). Even a few years back, a large number of tourists used to visit Darjeeling. But now, people hardly make a trip to this hill station for fear of getting caught in a bandh there. Tourists prefer other places to Darjeeling, even if it means higher expenses. The people of Darjeeling should protest against these bandhs that are ruining the beauty and serenity of the hill station.          
	Yours faithfully,         Priyanka Das, Calcutta 
              
	True legend          
	Sir  Rabindranath Tagores 150th birth anniversary was celebrated all over West Bengal on May 9 (Bounty of the bard, May 11). Few literary figures in Bengal are remembered and revered like Tagore. It is not easy to gauge the depth of Tagores creative genius. His writings do not shy away from confronting the drudgery of daily life; nor do they seek peace or divinity. Instead, they strive to find a ray of hope in the simplicities of life and teach one to be patient and optimistic, no matter how difficult the situation. Bengalis have always turned to Tagore for succour and guidance. Today, Bengal is passing through a difficult phase. It is suffering from violent insurgencies, underdevelopment and bad governance. One hopes Tagores writings will give us the courage to overcome this crisis.          
	Yours faithfully,        Samudra Gupta, Calcutta            
	Sir  On May 9 this year, which was also the 25th day of the Bengali month, Baisakh, the 150th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore was celebrated. In many places across the world, particularly in West Bengal, the day marked the beginning of a year-long celebration. Tagores birthday celebrations inevitably involve renditions of songs and poems composed by the poet. In terms of creativity and versatility, Tagore is, undoubtedly, a legend. He is unique, and his works have created a benchmark for Bengali literature. However, we should not forget that 19th-century Bengal has also produced other notable poets, songwriters and literary figures. Their works may not have been as popular as Tagores, but they too deserve appreciation and a prominent place in our society and culture.          
	Yours faithfully,        Dilip Sengupta, Mumbai    
	Be responsible  
	Sir  It is annoying to see how government employees function in India. They perform their duties at snails pace, and are absolutely unapologetic about it. They are arrogant, careless, and dont have any sense of responsibility. The sixth pay commission has provided substantial hikes in their salaries, but that has not inspired them to perform better. Most of them are notorious for accepting bribes and harassing those who fail to comply with their demands.          
	The corruption in government offices is adversely affecting the country. After 60 years of independence, India is slowly emerging as a global power to reckon with, but it has a long way to go. Illiteracy, poverty and unemployment are very much present in the country. In order to take the nation forward, those who are fortunate enough to have received education and employment have to act responsibly. We should follow Japans example. The country rebuilt its economy successfully, and quite rapidly, even after suffering huge devastation during the second world war.          
	Yours faithfully,        Titisha Biswas, Calcutta

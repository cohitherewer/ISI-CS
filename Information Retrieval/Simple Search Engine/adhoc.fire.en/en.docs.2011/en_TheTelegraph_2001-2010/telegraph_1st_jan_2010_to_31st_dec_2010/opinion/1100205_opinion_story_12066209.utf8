                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FULL CIRCLE                                                    
	Privilege is notoriously hard to earn; it is harder still to protect. Unless tempered by a growing sense of accountability, people in positions of power tend to go haywire. Not only does power corrupt, but it also becomes an easy addiction. The recently retired military secretary, Avadhesh Prakash, who has been indicted in a land scam, seems to be caught in a time warp: his tryst with power is not yet over. While in office, he had allegedly helped a friend, the Siliguri-based realtor, Dilip Agarwal, acquire a piece of land next to the Sukna military station. Mr Prakash probably imagined that his exalted position in the pecking order, as top aide to the army chief, would help him cover up such glaring indiscretions. Now out of uniform, Mr Prakash is keen to seek a stay on the order to court-martial him. It seems as though he is yet to wake up to the enormity of what he has been charged with by the Armed Forces Tribunal. (The AFT, which has the powers of a high court, can only be challenged in the Supreme Court.) In any case, a court of inquiry, convened by the eastern army commander in Calcutta, has already declared Mr Prakash guilty of issuing a No-Objection Certificate to a private organization with dubious intents, and sought his dismissal.        
	Mr Prakash should not expect any amnesty, let alone immunity or special treatment, simply because he happened to be involved with an august institution like the Indian Army for years. No one is above the rule of law, and due process must be followed in his case, as with any other person suspected of abetting unfair practices. Given his long tenure in the army, Mr Prakash is best aware of the exacting standards that are demanded from those in uniform. More than Mr Prakashs personal image, it is the honour of the army that is at stake here. The army has been ethically upright by initiating the inquiry against Mr Prakash. It would be a shame if that salutary gesture is interrupted abruptly.

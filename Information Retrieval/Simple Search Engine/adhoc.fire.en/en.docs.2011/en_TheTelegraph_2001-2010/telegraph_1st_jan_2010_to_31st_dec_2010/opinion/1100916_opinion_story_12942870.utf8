	Surrounded as we are by a profusion of still and moving images, we can scarcely imagine now how the world must have looked before the invention of the camera. How did pre-photographic people preserve the vestiges of life and death? What did their archives look like? Beyond familiar conventions of memorializing  monuments, busts, death-masks and portraits  there were other, less obvious, ways of preserving history.        
	The narrator of Prousts novel, In Search of Lost Time, tells us about his grandmothers rather unusual project of keeping the past alive: Even when she had to make someone an ostensibly practical gift, when she had to give an armchair, a dinner service, or a walking-stick, she would look out for old ones, as if these, purged by long disuse of their utilitarian character, were able to tell us how people had lived in the old days, rather than serve our modern needs. In the absence of photographs, she could revive, and archive, the traces of lost time by going back to objects that had belonged to another era. In her perception, the armchair or the walking-stick stands in, as it were, for the photograph  a medium that had also evolved out of the need to record the way people of another time lived.        
	Unlike photographs, which are visual documents divested of the physical circumstances of life, antique objects are charged with distinctly individual spirits. The teacup or the walking stick is haunted by the hands that had once held them. Layers of time and memory accumulate on these objects, turning each of them into a memento mori. If a death-mask captures the fact of death, these objects embody the meaning of death by making the absence of their users all the more acute in contrast to their solidity and sensual presence. So mundane heirlooms, or everyday items once used by the great, acquire an aura of almost fetishistic value. Goethes writing desk, preserved in the house in Frankfurt where he was born, is such a revered object, which conveys a keener sense of the writer as a private individual than of the public persona that is depicted in the famous portrait by Tischbein.                  Goethe rsquo;s desk in Goethehaus, Frankfurt       
	A portrait, like a photograph, depicts a face, or a body, at a certain moment. But can it convey the essence, the personhood, of the individual it depicts? Is it possible to capture life in its entirety visually? Or can it be only done in words? Such questions have been raised and pondered in theory and in practice throughout history. Writing and the visual arts complement, enrich and feed on each other. We find artists repeatedly compelled to revisit the scene of Socrates death that Plato had described vividly. It is as though the final moments of Socrates life must be reconstructed in paint in order to capture the truth of his entire existence in all its fullness. In Prousts novel, into which history, autobiography and fiction are finely intertwined, we notice the opposite urge  to paint, in the finest detail, the passage of a life through time. Prousts life-writing draws on the Horatian principle of Ut pictura poesis  as is painting so is poetry. In the 16th century, when Michel de Montaigne retired to the country after a busy public life in the city as a lawyer, he decided to devote his time to writing essays, an activity that he likened to painting. It is my own self that I am painting, he tells the reader in the prologue to his book of essays.        
	Fiction, painting, biography, sculpture and the world of everyday objects not only fill up the void left behind by death but also those gaps in time that history failed or forgot to record. They help us re-imagine the essence of those people, places and events that no photographer was around to preserve from oblivion. So the absence of a visual archive often turns itself into a fount of inspiration. In the work of Louise Bourgeois, for instance, especially in her body of work called Cells, we find old clothes, rags, beds and other objects thrown in together as if into the chaotic backyard of the mind. A lifetimes associations and feelings suddenly come sharply alive in these assemblages  and make photography redundant to this work. Bourgeois, who, like Prousts grandmother, attached great value to the bric-a-brac of the past, once admitted as much, when she said in an interview, I dont need a photograph to remember.

	The fight between the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority has ended in a draw. The quarrel was about who was to regulate unit life insurance plans issued by insurance companies which are liquid investments like mutual funds. The issue came to the boil because Sebi abolished entry load on mutual funds. Insurance companies continued to charge entry loads. To equalize competition, Sebi asked them to cease; Irda asked them to continue charging them. The dispute went to the finance ministry, which has issued an ordinance which essentially says that Ulips could continue to be regulated by Irda. This is typical of a stressed mother of two fractious daughters; she frees the daughters hair from each others clutches, locks them up in separate rooms, and goes back to lording it over the house. But while the daughters may have been separated, their toys continue to play and row with one another. Specifically, insurance companies can continue to charge entry load and pay salesmen from the entry load; mutual fund managers cannot pay them. So salesmen will go from door to door and sell Ulips; Ulips will get an advantage over mutual funds. Mutual funds will go to Sebi and plead that they are its daughters, but get such stepmotherly treatment. Those upstart Ulips can go on bribing salesmen, but Sebi would not let them.        
	The only course left before Sebi is to rescind its ban on entry loads. That will return investors to the situation where they would have to shell out money to agents for no essential service. Any investor can buy a capital market magazine or guide which would tell him how to choose and invest in a mutual fund; he does not need an agent to do it. But mutual funds will pay agents 1-2 per cent, and will take it out of the investors money even before they accept it. This is sheer robbery  robbery that the finance ministry has now authorized. There can be only one of two conclusions. Either the finance ministry is in collusion with the salesmen, or it has no understanding of the issues involved.        
	Arrogance and ignorance make an impenetrable combination. Still, it is necessary to adumbrate the elementary point that regulation must be principled, and that the principles cannot change with industry. This implies that there should ideally be only one regulator for both mutual funds and insurance companies which would govern both even-handedly. The ministry cannot, of course, have that, since one of the governments objectives in creating regulators is to create jobs for retired and useless bureaucrats; from its point of view, the more the regulators, the better. If they fight, so much the better. Then they will run whining to it, and give it a chance to give arbitrary rulings. Or better still, appoint a super-regulator to arbitrate between them.

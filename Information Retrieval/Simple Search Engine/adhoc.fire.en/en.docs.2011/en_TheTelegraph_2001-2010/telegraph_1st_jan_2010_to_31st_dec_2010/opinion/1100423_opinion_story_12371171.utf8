	Like Henri Cartier-Bressons portraits of the Existentialists, Raghu Rais photo essays on Indian classical musicians have attained iconic status. Most of the photographs included in INDIAS GREAT MASTERS: A PHOTOGRAPHIC JOURNEY INTO THE HEART OF CLASSICAL MUSIC (Collins, Rs 3,500) first appeared in India Today in the 1980s, when Rai was photo-editor with the magazine. Revisiting these images after three decades, one is struck afresh by the rare vibrancy that Rai managed to capture in his subjects. Be it in the photographs of Ravi Shankar vigorously making music or Mallikarjun Mansur coming up for breath as though from a sea of melodies, Rai gets to the core of the person behind the art.        
	A concert, as the critic, Edward Said, memorably wrote, is a unique performance: it cannot be replicated. Modern technology can preserve each concert experience in DVDs and CDs, but in Rais photographs, fleeting moments, made up of frantic gestures or facial expressions, invoke the spirit of each concert in its entirety. It seems as if the power and dynamism of a full-length performance have been absorbed in a flash by Rais camera. This feeling comes across most strikingly in the photos of Bhimsen Joshi lost in song  anyone who has ever attended a soire by Panditji knows what a spectacular event it usually is.        
	It is apparent that Rai has intimately known many of the musicians he has photographed. Although closeness has its special gifts  it takes Rai into the drawing room of the famously reclusive Annapurna Devi  there are mild pitfalls as well. Often, Rai ends up being the obedient family photographer, as in the series showing Ravi Shankar and his wife, Sukanya, doting on their daughter, Anoushka. The feel-good charm of these images is transformed into something rich and strange in other kinds of family photographs  Kishori Amonkar stilled by thought, with her son sitting in the background (left); and clockwise from top right  Vilayat Khan watched over by portraits of the great masters, with his family reflected in the mirror; Kumar Gandharva and his wife relaxing in their house in Dewas; Bhimsen Joshi seen with his beloved Mercedes on a hilltop in Pune; and Mallikarjun Mansur having a last drag on his deathbed. Myths and memories get intertwined in an eternal present.         
	Ashok Vajpeyis text is informative though a bit unimaginative next to the lyrical elegance of Rais work. Rai recounts lovely anecdotes about his encounters with musical geniuses  the mercurial Kishori Amonkar rebuking him for smoking and another man for reclining on a bolster at a private concert. M.S. Subbulakshmi and S. Balchander are the two Carnatic musicians represented.

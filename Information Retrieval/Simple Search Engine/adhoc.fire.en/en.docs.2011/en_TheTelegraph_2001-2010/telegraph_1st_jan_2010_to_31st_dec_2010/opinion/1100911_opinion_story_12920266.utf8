The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From the usual to the uncanny
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FROM THE USUAL TO THE UNCANNY                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                                                  
	Mahesh Baliga has chosen an unusual, though precisely thought out, title for his solo exhibition, Confabulations, at Galerie 88 (ending today). The verb, to confabulate, derives from the Latin confabulari, which means to have a conversation. The word, however, has a different resonance in psychiatry, where it means the replacement of the gaps left by a disordered memory with imaginary remembered experiences. This last explanation, endorsed by the dictionary, comes from Kenneth Toomey, the mischievously unreliable narrator of Anthony Burgesss novel, Earthly Powers, which Baliga acknowledges in his concept note. The association of these two senses suggests that Baliga is spinning a fantastic, or at least fictitious, yarn in a language that is intense without being overtly illustrative. So even before we have taken a proper look at the work, our perspective is queered  and quite gainfully so, as we realize later  by the artists assertion that the line is thin between truth and untruth.        
	Although such a statement does sound very much like a platitude, Baliga proves himself to be an exception. A figurative painter grounded in the traditional realist mode, Baliga may, to all appearances, come across as an artist who is easy to fathom. There is an intimate, even a cute, simplicity to his figures, which can be instantly pleasing. But this is true only as far as the outward visual appeal of his work is concerned. Arranged in a sequence, his watercolours gain in complexity as we begin to notice repetitions, extensions and inflections of themes and motifs. There is a novelistic charm in the work that arrests and entertains the imagination, as we quickly pick up the gossamer thread of humour running all along.        
	In this thematically inscrutable series, Baliga introduces seemingly mundane characters and moments which are often marked by the use of vivid colours. But he does not bother to bind these together into any obviously discernible narrative structure. Each painting illustrates a situation or an event that has its special significance in a larger story, which the viewer must tease out on his own. The pieces of this jigsaw puzzle seem to fit and yet make no apparent sense. Is the boy dangling a snake on the edge of a stick in Backyard the same as the one in Escape in Landscape, where he is seen dangling a cluster of leaves in a similar manner before a vanishing donkey? Is that spooky fellow with his face covered and seated between two policemen in A Morning a petty thief? With no feet poking out of his trousers, he may well be a disappearing man, like the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland. There are too many lacunae, physical and metaphysical, in Baligas work that are perhaps meant to be filled in by the viewers imaginary memories.        
	An alumnus of M.S. University, Baroda, Baliga puts his skill and training to good use. His work can be readily enjoyed both by the common man and the connoisseur. Baligas dramatis personae belong to the everyday order of things, they draw us in with the promise of the familiar but elude the grasp of reason in the end. In an apparently straightforward work like Senior Citizen, an old man climbing up the stairs with a bagful of vegetables seems to be on the verge of doing something inexplicable. The floor before him melts into little puddles of light reflected from the huge French windows in the background. The solitary neon lamp, placed vertically on the wall behind him, becomes what Barthes called the punctum of this composition  that single touching detail, that tiny puncture, which opens up the pictorial space to a whole range of responses and interpretations.        
	Although Baliga mentions the influence of his teacher, Ullas Sanzir, and of artists like N.S. Harsha and L.N. Tallur, one detects distinct echoes of Sudhir Patwardhan, Bhupen Khakhar and Gieve Patel in his work. Baligas professed admiration for a painterly style, and his evident pleasure in executing vigorous brushstrokes outside the convention of line-bound figurative drawing, are some of the direct legacies of these Indian masters.        
	The narrative force inherent in Baligas work also comes out of a tradition of Western modernism  Bonnard, Balthus, Morandi, Seurat, Picasso, Dal and de Chirico come to mind as we observe the sinuous shifts or mingling of modes in his work. In Speech, a man in a Gandhi topi, presumably a politician, declaims before what one imagines to be a large gathering of people (picture). And yet, the sea of humanity takes on the aspect of a vast flowerbed as tiny dots of red stretch ahead of the speaker. An anodyne scene of activity, viewed from a quirky perspective, becomes rich and strange; pointillist dots coexist with bold impressionist strokes, and the usual turns into the uncanny.        
	The two wooden sculptures on display, though cleverly conceived, lack the effortless elegance of the paintings. In one, the life-size figure of a woodcutter chops a log with an axe that grows out of his upper arm, replacing his entire his right hand. This is a rare instance of a semiotic overload that Baliga conspicuously avoids elsewhere.

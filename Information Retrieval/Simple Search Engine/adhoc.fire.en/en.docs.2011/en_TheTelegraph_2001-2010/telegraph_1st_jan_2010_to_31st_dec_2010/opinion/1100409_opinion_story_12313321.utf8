                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE GREEN VANISHES                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	We are a strange lot. On the one hand, you have the prime minister and his senior colleagues expressing deep concern about the fast-depleting forestcover, the rape of the sacrosanct reserve forests, the brutal poaching of tigers, rhinos and much more. On the other hand, in Assam, from where the prime minister was elected to the Rajya Sabha, there is absolutely no governance of the forests, with 5,000 square kilometres lost to illegal felling, the timber mafia active with the connivance of those deemed to protect the habitat. In this Congress-ruled state, the population of rhinos and tigers has radically diminished.        
	The hypocrisy of the leadership that mouths platitudes about wanting to conserve the treasures of the land has begun to pall because the truth is apparent and clearly contrary to what governments say when confronted with questions. Moving away from Assam in the east, across the sub-continent, to the western end in Rajasthan, the same denial is evident in the way forests are being administered.         
	Those mandated to protect the environment are operating as development agencies. There is no clear delineation of work, no accountability and absolutely no integrity. The number of tigers in India today is 800, at the very most. That is the plain truth no authority is prepared to admit because it goes to prove the abject failure of the forest departments.        
	Fortunately, there is a Central minister of state at the helm in Delhi who is proactive and more than willing to change the course that was hurtling towards an unfortunate end. Sitting in a now transparent office, a bureaucracy used to telling endless half-truths leaving space for interpretations and manipulations far more dangerous than the truth itself is unable to handle the changing work environment and desperately trying to protect what was once a lucrative playing field. India is losing what can never be restored. Nature is bound to takes revenge sooner than later.                 
	Time to act        
	The prime minister has announced a division of the ministry of forests and environment, which must be completed and instituted post-haste, lest the destruction and mutilation continues unabated. Pressure to implement the many fundamental correctives needs to be accelerated. The babus in the field, directed to serve the forests, need to be told what is expected of them. It is corruption and greed that compel bad practice and the government must monitor the action of its officers on the ground on a regular basis to ensure protection and conservation.        
	The Ganga has been reduced to a dirty rivulet in parts of its course down to the plains. The mother of Indian rivers and its tributaries have been mercilessly polluted. Lakes have become enormous cesspools. Mountain ranges have been assaulted and hopelessly degraded.         
	Nothing in nature remains pristine as it should have. And all this in the name of development to enhance some mythical rate of growth that has, in fact, got poverty levels up and steadily rising. Something basic is missing in our planning, which is filled with skewed policies and non-inclusive initiatives.         
	Rising graphs, deemed to be positive indicators of growth, seem to have taken precedence over abysmal realities. Will checks and balances kick in or will we tumble into deep decline? Are we forcing a patient people to rise in revolt against the administration that has exploited their habitat?        
	The forests minister has raised contentious issues of misuse and mal-governance with his bureaucrats, and stopped interventions by party colleagues trying to get illegal clearances for mega projects. Will he survive the stranglehold of powerful groups and factions? Hurray if he does.

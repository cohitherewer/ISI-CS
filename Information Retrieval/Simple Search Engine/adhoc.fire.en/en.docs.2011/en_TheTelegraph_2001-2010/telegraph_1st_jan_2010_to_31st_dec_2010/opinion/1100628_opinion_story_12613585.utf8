	History is not the sole judge of an action. For people of transient fortunes like the modern-day president of a nation, it is inadvisable to wait for its judgment. Barack Obama had an entire nation looking at him to know if he would excuse a general in command of one of the most serious wars the United States of America has ever fought for not having the common sense to know that a spit in the air usually hits one on the face. There cannot be any disagreement over the fact that General Stanley McChrystal, in charge of the US forces in Afghanistan, showed poor judgment in venting his spleen over the civilian command freely to the media. This automatically raised questions about his capabilities. But the other equally worrying question that the spontaneous flow of venom raised was of control. By pitting the image of the self-sacrificing, battle-hardened men in uniform against that of confused, self-seeking politicians, General McChrystal was quietly announcing the armys prerogative in the conduct of war. In itself, this is not unusual and armies the world over have pushed this claim. Unfortunately, in a democracy, this claim is unsustainable. The military, in all democracies worth their salt, has to be subservient to civilian control. With his nation watching, it is this fine balance that Mr Obama sought to restore with the sacking of General McChrystal. Very few commanders-in-chief would have stuck their necks out to state the obvious at a time when the nation was so critically dependent on the army for security, perhaps the least so in India, where showdowns with the military are conscientiously avoided, never mind its transgressions.         
	Given that General McChrystals replacement has been so easily found in General David Petraeus, history may even be kind in its judgment of Mr Obamas action. General Petraeus is the father of the counter-insurgency operation that General McChrystal had been running in Afghanistan  which means that there will be no decisive break in battle policies. But the realities  a war room working at cross purposes, the confused loyalties of the Afghans, the irreconcilability of the Taliban and an unrealistic date of withdrawal  that surfaced in General McChrystals killer interview will remain. General Petraeuss political savvy and connections in the Muslim world may help but not win Mr Obama his war.

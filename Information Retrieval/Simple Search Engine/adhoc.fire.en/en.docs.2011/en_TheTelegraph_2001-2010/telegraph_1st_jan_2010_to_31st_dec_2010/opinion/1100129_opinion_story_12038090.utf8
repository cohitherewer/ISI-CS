	The bestowing of national awards in India is always a dodgy business. This is because, as a general rule, Indians do not possess any standards of comparative excellence. So, often, figures with achievements in minor fields have the highest honours in the land showered upon them because they are popular or because they have contributed to popular culture. This is a point that is much more important than the current brouhaha over the award of Padma Bhushan to a hotelier from the United States of America who, in the past, had cases filed against him by the Central Bureau of Investigation. There is no denying that this particular nomination does not bring any special glory to the national awards. There are reasons to suspect that it may very well be the product of vigorous lobbying that made interests other than sheer merit prevail. It is also true that it is not the first time that such a blot has appeared on the entire idea of conferring awards. That awards should be free from lobbying and political patronage is a pious thought that is seldom adhered to in reality. What even this cynicism does not reckon with is the failure of standards.        
	Take two examples from the recent past. Both Lata Mangeshkar and Bismillah Khan were decorated with the Bharat Ratna, the highest award that the Indian State confers. One made her mark in a form of popular music that is utterly discordant with Indias rich tradition of classical music. The other excelled in playing an instrument that was originally played on the nahabat and in weddings and thus never accorded the same status as the veena, the sarod and the sitar. The question needs to be asked if these two persons deserve to be on the same roll-call of honour that includes Ravi Shankar. The point is an important one. Edward Lear excelled in writing limericks and provided immeasurable enjoyment and fun to a large number of readers. But will anyone ever place him next to William Shakespeare or T.S. Eliot? The answer is obvious. In the arts, and possibly in other fields as well, there are genres that are almost by definition limited. However outstanding an individuals achievements in these areas, he or she cannot be considered for the highest awards. People who sit on the juries of award committees should keep this perspective in mind. Otherwise they might mistake a florin for a guinea. Even before a hotelier was decorated, it had become open season in the national awards landscape.

	What is the thread connecting three distinct moments in the social and legal history of India in this century? The first, in 2001, marked an early, and rather disheartening, phase in the battle to do away with Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code  the sad old law that ended up criminalizing homosexuality in this country. The Centre had then objected to the petition challenging Section 377 by declaring that Indian society was not yet ready to tolerate homosexuality. It was not universally accepted behaviour in India, and in a parliamentary secular democracy, the legal conception of crime is not based on an absolute conception of justice, but had to reflect shifts in public attitudes, perceptions and morality. Delhi High Court sharply disagreed with this after almost a decade, the case took a progressive turn, and the section was read down in 2009.         
	The second instance moves from sex to religion, to that ancient site of dispute and suspended resolution. A crucial aspect of the historic verdict on Ayodhya, a few weeks ago, was founded on an argument that was again based on public or collective  some would say, the majoritys  perception. Only, in this case, the words used were belief and faith, not perception. It was irrelevant whether Ram was really born on his janmabhoomi; what mattered  theologically and therefore historically and legally  was that a significant number of his devotees believed him, for long enough, to have been born there. So, public perception triumphed over other, more empirical and less subjective, forms of evidence. And the voice of the law found itself identified with the voice of this perception or belief.         
	The third instance is the most recent, and moves from the temple to the home, from public to private  or the apparently private. The apex court is clarifying what sort of heterosexual relationship would be deemed in the nature of marriage so that the woman can claim maintenance from the man. The relationship becomes quasi-marital, as opposed to a mere fling, when, among other things, the couple should have presented themselves before society as akin to man and wife. In other words, they are as good as married when they have been perceived publicly to have been so. The space of this definition is, again, society and its perceptions. In this society, there are ordinary women, and women who are keeps or servants. The latter, even when maintained financially and used mainly for sexual purposes, would never qualify for claiming maintenance. That is, their relationships with the men who kept them could never be perceived as being in the nature of marriage, whatever their nature, duration or, dare one say, seriousness. Is this because such a ubiquitous and regardful society would never be able to bring itself to perceive a man and his keep or servant as a couple even if they were to present themselves to it as one? Is this a clarification, or is the law halting at the threshold of the unspeakable?

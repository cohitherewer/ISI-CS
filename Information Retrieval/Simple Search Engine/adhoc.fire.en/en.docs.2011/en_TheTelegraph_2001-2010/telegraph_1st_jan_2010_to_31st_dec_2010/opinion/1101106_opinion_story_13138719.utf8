	President Barack Obamas visit to India has been awaited with anticipation tinged with anxiety. His soaring rhetoric and historic election victory had created enormous goodwill in India, as well as expectations of change. Over time, these expectations were eroded by reservations. A quest for continuity appeared to prevail over hopes of change.        
	Obamas visit is also being seen in the backdrop of his plummeting popularity at home and his being badly bruised by the reversals his party faced in the midterm Congressional elections. The fact is that the presidents party has consistently fared poorly in midterm elections of American presidents, except for just three occasions in over a century. Unlike in our parliamentary system, losses in Congressional elections do not always have negative implications for the presidents of the United States of America. Indeed, these have often led to less constrained and more assertive presidential leadership. We should, therefore, not jump to premature conclusions about Obamas authority or his ability to deliver.        
	The series of special gestures made by Obama  receiving our prime minister as his first State guest with all the bells and whistles and ceremonial trappings, accorded to very few visiting dignitaries, making his visit to India in the first half of his first term as president, and so on  have not been given due recognition. Similarly, a number of highlights of his visit are being dismissed as being high in symbolism and low in substance. It is remarkable that despite our rich civilizational legacy, so many are ignorant that symbolism is an important manifestation of policy, and personal gestures are as reliable barometers of outcomes of visits as deals concluded or statements issued. Deng Xiaopings extraordinarily long public handshake with Rajiv Gandhi in 1988 was a sure signal of a successful visit. I have witnessed several other such instances.        
	There has been constant harping on some missteps in the initial transitional stage of the Obama administration. Subsequent policy pronouncements notwithstanding, we seem to need repeated reiterations of continued US priority accords to India, and periodic reassurances of US support on various issues. These betray a sense of insecurity that does not behove a country of our size and potential.        
	There seemed to be undue US emphasis on concrete outcomes, or what is termed deliverables. There was also a concerted effort to utilize the visit as an action-forcing event on a broad range of pending decisions and proposals under consideration, including at the micro level. This was understandable up to a point. Some constituency interests do sometimes figure in informal exchanges, like Ronald Reagans interest in increased Indian import of almonds from California or P.V. Narasimha Raos concerns about falling Russian imports of tobacco from Andhra Pradesh. But normally we should not allow sub-texts to clutter the agenda of summit-level discussions.        
	Obamas primary focus will be on the economic agenda, reflecting his top priority to revive the US economy and address the persistent problem of high unemployment. Some deals may be concluded and announced during or after his visit. It would be in the mutual interests of both sides to counter protectionist sentiments in the US by projecting the realities of two-way flows of goods and services, investments and consequent job retention and creation in both countries. The relaxation of outdated US export control regimes and revoking the so-called entities list would be elements in a larger, mutually beneficial framework of greater market access by both countries. These issues could be discussed in the margins of the visit and do not merit discussion at the summit level, unless Obama raises issues of this nature. We had closer cooperation with the US than with any other country. A mutual desire to renew cooperation could be on the lines of Rajiv Gandhis technology missions, using high technologies to benefit rural India.         
	Though Obama became the first US president to celebrate Diwali and make a moving statement on the occasion, we should not expect him to carry any Diwali gifts. For instance, a general US endorsement of Indias claim for permanent membership of the United Nations security council would be pointless. We should stop pleading our case for a second-rate status as a permanent UNSC member without veto powers. We should focus our efforts on strengthening our unity and cohesion through good governance and public accountability, and on emerging as the worlds third largest economic and military power. If the UNSC still retains its relevance, we could then give favourable consideration to accepting a UN general assembly resolution to join the UNSC with a rightful status. It is also not an edifying experience to hear high-level carping about US arms supplies to Pakistan which pale into insignificance in comparison with what the US is pressing India to accept, both in terms of enhanced technological sophistication and volume.        
	Diversification of our defence procurements was initiated by Indira Gandhi. Our defence cooperation and procurements from the US were initiated by Rajiv Gandhi. These endeavours culminated in the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership jointly announced by George W. Bush and Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2004 and the comprehensive framework for India-US defence relations signed by the two defence ministers in 2005. Long-term capital investments, whether in defence or in nuclear energy, have to be anchored in strategic partnerships. Enhanced mutual stake-holding, and the resultant interdependence, invariably lead to increased mutual confidence in the reliability of supplies. Now we have the opportunity of choosing from the best globally available equipment and technologies, and dovetailing collaborative arrangements and procurements for our armed forces, paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies.        
	Obama has visited our largest neighbour, China. After India he will visit our second largest neighbour, Indonesia, and then other countries neighbouring China. Evolving Asian security scenarios should figure in the discussions. Uppermost in Obamas mind will be Afghanistan and Pakistan. He will appreciate our views on working together for a solution which is not just desirable but practicable under the current circumstances, where open-ended commitments may not be politically sustainable.        
	In discussions on strategic issues, despite de-hyphenation, triangular perspectives may come into play, whether it is India-US-Pakistan, India-China-US, or India-Pakistan-China, and so on. Henry Kissinger and Yevgeny Primakov had separately told me that in any triangular relationship, all partners endeavour to have better relations with the other two than they have with each other. Thus we should not harbour illusions of US willingness, or even ability, to pressurize Pakistan beyond a point which may lead to a a serious dilution of US leverage to the corresponding benefit of China. Hence we need to always keep effective links open with Pakistan.        
	Unlike Bill Clinton, Bush generally adopted a hands-off policy on Kashmir. He later recognized that this approach contributed to a forward movement in back-channel India-Pakistan discussions on Jammu and Kashmir from 2004 to 2007. Bush, however, had very good relations with Pervez Musharraf. Colin Powell did not even keep us in the loop regarding the US decision to accord Pakistan the status of a major non-Nato ally. The relationship with Musharraf soured only in 2008. Obama, on the other hand, seems to have no illusions of Pakistani double-dealing. Yet he appears sensitive to Pakistani concerns. Obama has wisely remained noncommittal on Kashmir, though he is reportedly worried about developments in Jammu and Kashmir.              
	The forthcoming summit should not be seen in isolation, but as a landmark in the process of strengthening a strategic partnership which is equally important to both countries and increasingly important in the Asian and global context. We will need to fulfil past commitments, consolidate gains, and maintain the momentum of our cooperation. In this process, we need to shed some self-defeating assumptions of perpetual economic and technological dependence on the West inherent in some aspects of our positions on issues ranging from climate change to civil nuclear liability. Our relationship has still to mature. It has not yet reached the critical mass at which it can be self-sustaining. It will need nurturing, not only by both governments but by all stakeholders in both countries. The success of Obamas visit will be measured in this overall perspective.

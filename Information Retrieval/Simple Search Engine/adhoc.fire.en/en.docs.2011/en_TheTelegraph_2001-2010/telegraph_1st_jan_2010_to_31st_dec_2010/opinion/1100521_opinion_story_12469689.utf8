                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STAYING ON                                                    
	The Northeast is not the only place where organizers of mob violence try to whip up xenophobic sentiments. The Meghalaya government should, therefore, treat the recent violence in the state primarily as a law and order issue. That the clashes and other acts of violence involved people of two different ethnic groups is of secondary importance. The Northeast has always had a greater ethnic diversity than other regions of India. The division of Assam into several small states in 1960 was aimed at recognizing the territorial and political aspirations of the dominant ethnic groups. Even so, each of these states has its own mix of ethnic groups. There are groups of people who had migrated to Meghalaya even before it became a Union territory and then a state. But that alone does not make any community in Meghalaya outsiders. Such migrations have been an old demographic feature in a region that borders Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh and China. It is understandable that political parties and other groups in Meghalaya are upset over the deaths in police firing at a village on the Assam-Meghalaya border. But serving a quit notice on any community is not going to ease tensions. A community forced to flee from one state could mean trouble in another.         
	All this requires governments of neighbouring states to have closer and more frequent interactions on law and order as well as economic issues. The village in Meghalaya where the violence erupted this time sits on a disputed part of the states border with Assam. Violence breaks out periodically in villages on disputed sections of the Assam-Nagaland border as well. Unfortunately for the people living in such disputed border villages, the state capitals are too far away and the administrations too detached from these outposts. Both the governments in Shillong and Dispur must have known of the tensions in the border village. But they clearly failed to intervene and prevent the violence. Worse, there were other acts of violence thereafter. The Meghalaya government has ordered an inquiry by the Criminal Bureau of Investigation into the police firing. But more important, it has to involve all parties and social groups in its efforts to restore peace and the peoples confidence in the law.

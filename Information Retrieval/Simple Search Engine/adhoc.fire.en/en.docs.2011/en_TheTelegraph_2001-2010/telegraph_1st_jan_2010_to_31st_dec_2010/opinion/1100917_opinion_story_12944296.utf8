	SPLENDOUR AMP; SQUALOR: THE DISGRACE AND DISINTEGRATION OF THREE ARISTOCRATIC DYNASTIES By Marcus Scriven, Atlantic, 25        
	This is the first book of the journalist, Marcus Scriven. Carefully researched, it provides such a wealth of detail on the lives and families of his four unlovely aristocratic subjects that the reader can hardly keep up, rapidly losing track of numbers and names of wives, stepmothers and the infinite tangle of their more distant relations. For the incurious reader, these sad family stories induce a sort of creeping queasiness and, in sympathy with Scrivens rakes and ruins, the need for a strong drink. In this democratic age of rising and so-easily-falling celebrity, one supposes that the accident of high birth still adds a particular frisson to tales of disgrace and disintegration, but this book is still a bit like an overdose of Hello! magazine combined with our best known Sunday scandal sheet, the News of the World. The aristocratic families concerned  Fitzgerald, Montagu and Hervey  are mixtures of good and bad, like others of less exalted heredity. There is, however, greater scope for damage when a black sheep with hereditary power and money runs amok and commands public notice.        
	Many of the stories in Splendour amp; Squalor have had previous airings in the press. In this book of four individuals and three families, those of Edward Fitzgerald, 7th Duke of Leinster, who squandered his vast inheritance and killed himself in a one-room flat in Pimlico, London, and Angus Charles Drogo Montagu, 12th Duke of Manchester, severely educationally challenged and ultimately a convicted embezzler whose enormous size required him, when dying, to be winched out of the window of his small provincial apartment, are somewhat lifeless padding around the main event, those of the two Marquesses of Bristol.        
	We are introduced to the 6th Marquess, the repellent Victor, in Part Two. A fantasist and convicted jewel thief, who lived in a style more flashy-parvenu than old-aristocracy, Victor Hervey lived up to his historically notorious name, but remains, like Montagu and Fitzgerald in Scrivens hands, a somewhat one-dimensional figure with little sense of the man behind the image and the grubby headlines.         
	The book comes most alive in its fourth and final part, the tragic story of John, the 7th Marquess, cruelly neglected by his father, a crook, a drunk and abysmal parent who engendered both fear and hero-worship in his shy and lonely son. Johns is the most vivid and saddest section of the book, partly perhaps because his death is relatively recent and the waste of his life and heritage remain a raw memory while his friends and contemporaries are still, ten years or so later, only in later middle age. He would have had to have a far greater strength of character than was the case to overcome the extraordinary disadvantages of his upbringing, however theoretically cushioned by wealth.         
	Johns loveless childhood, his mother banished from Ickworth, the extraordinary family home of the Herveys, his father cold, critical and distant, and both the parents having other partners and children led to his desperate need to belong. His expensive tastes were shared and pandered to by the hangers-on, toadies and scroungers, who increasingly surrounded and lived off him as his spending and addictions to fast cars, young men, drink and drugs spiralled out of control. He died with AIDS, broken and broke, aged 44.         
	The ancestries of all four men are traced exhaustively by Scriven through bloodlines blotched here and there with madness and badness. Can one draw conclusions on heredity and genes? In his epilogue, Scriven wonders if the lucky dip of genetic inheritance  is less random than it appears. Well, perhaps  but the possessors of more recent titles and privileges named in the epilogue exemplify his view that the new elite is as capable as the old of developing the self-regard and sense of entitlement that permit a tossing out of the rules of normal civilized behaviour, and without the habitual leavening of family histories that include tracts of time spent in mundane and worthy service to country or county.        
	Splendour amp; Squalor is unnecessarily long. There are too many attempts to link its main characters over and above distant familial attachments, although later social historians may be thankful for the detailed genealogies that make the book dull reading in parts. One senses that Scrivens heart is not in the Fitzgerald and Montagu stories. He may have done better to write a slighter book solely on the Bristols, including in the body of the text more of the endnotes that add colour to the text with illuminating snippets of gossipy information or may have been better enjoyed as footnotes. The lack of an index is surprising in so detailed a book and will prove an irritant to those followers or students of the history of dwindling aristocracy to whom it is most likely to appeal.

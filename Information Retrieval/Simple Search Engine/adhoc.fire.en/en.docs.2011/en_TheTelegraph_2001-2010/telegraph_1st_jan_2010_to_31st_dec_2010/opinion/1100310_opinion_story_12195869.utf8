The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | an open letter to m.f. husain
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AN OPEN LETTER TO M.F. HUSAIN                                  SHAZI ZAMAN                              
	Respected Husain saheb, Your flight to Qatar has anguished us in more ways than one. Firstly, because we could not keep you here. Secondly, and more importantly, because you thought you could not live here.        
	I hope you would not mind the reaction of a person less than half your age. Great responsibility comes with greatness. Your action has to be questioned and cross-examined by all who stand and fight for freedom of expression. The issue is far too important to be glossed over as a Husain act. Your flight to Qatar is not an artistic latitude that we could be indulgent about.        
	Your flight has dealt a blow to our deep belief that the fight for freedom of expression has to be fought and won on the Indian soil. By bolting, you dealt a blow to this belief. And you did not have the right to do that.        
	For two reasons. A large body of people stood up and spoke for you in the confidence that you are with them in this struggle. Secondly, a large body looked up to you as a symbol of creative freedom. We thought you would stand up and fight. Who would, if not you? We thought that a person as privileged, as loved, liked and respected as you would certainly fight. But you took a flight out to Qatar.        
	Husain saheb, you have left a gaping hole in our cherished belief that we can fight and win. Is that the example to set for those who face the forces of intolerance? Would you expect all of them to take a flight to Qatar? That is, if they had the option.        
	While taking the Qatari passport did you spare a thought for those who stood up for you? People you left behind. Did the thought cross your mind that your departure only resolves your personal issue? If at all. It does not resolve the larger battle.        
	Your ticket to artistic freedom took you of all places to Qatar. Did you think it affords you greater freedom than lndia? We would wait for an answer or watch for developments.        
	Giving up a citizenship or taking another is a matter of personal choice. But could it be so personal for you? Could you be so oblivious of the message this would send to liberal India? While your life is yours, what about the voices of those who rose for you?        
	Husain saheb, I am raising these questions because we felt answerable for your plight in the past. Do you think you are answerable to the people who believed in your freedom of expression? Standing on a pedestal you had become more than a person. You had become an idea. Could that idea migrate to Qatar?        
	Why am I raising these questions? I am trying to articulate the vacuum many feel at what you have done. Did we fail you or did you fail us?        
	Sir, as a great artist you had to show a way to all who believe in the freedom of expression and creativity. Lesser mortals expect great messages and signals from great people. Their life and message are meant to guide the multitude. The signal that emanates from your flight to Qatar is a sad one.        
	Can these words of yours (in Barkha Dutts interview) justify your taking the Qatari passport: Hindi hain hum watan hai sara jahan hamara? Did you realize you had mixed up the two Iqbals  the separatist and the nationalist! The nationalist Iqbal had said, Hindi hain hum watan hai Hindostan hamara. Later, the separatist Iqbal said, Muslim hain hum watan hai sara jahan hamara.        
	We cannot take one line from the separatist Iqbal and the other from the nationalist one. We cannot quote conveniently, the same way as we cannot always live conveniently.        
	Shazi Zaman,

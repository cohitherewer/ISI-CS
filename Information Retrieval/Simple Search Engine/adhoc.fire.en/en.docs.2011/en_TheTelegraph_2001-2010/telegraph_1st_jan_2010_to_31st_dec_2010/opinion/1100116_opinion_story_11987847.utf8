	Calling all friends                
	Nazrul Mancha on December 4, 5 and 6 played host to 15 sets of performers  individuals, duos and groups  as part of the third edition of the Friends Music Festival. Day one began with choral Rabindrasangeet by the Santiniketan group, Madhuri. Once Srikanto Acharya took the stage, he did not let the spirit of Tagore leave the stage, invoking it every now and then with such songs as Shukhaheen nishidin and Emni korei jay jodi din. The most impressive performance of the evening came from Bickram Ghoshs Rhythmscape group, whose jam with percussionist Greg Ellis was just as refreshing as album tracks such as Purple moon and Zinc. Shubhamita set a high benchmark for the second day, though popular demand forced her to sing only her most-heard numbers. Lopamudra, the last performer of the evening, too stuck to the audience wishlist. Dohar chose not to venture out of their niche and sang traditional folk numbers that have now become synonymous with their sound.         
	The third evening had three popular Bengali bands, Chandrabindoo, Bhoomi and Lokkhichhara, who had to contend with the showmanship of Usha Uthup and the mass appeal of Nachiketa. For the umpteenth time, Uthup effortlessly captured the crowd with a toss of her Kanjeevaram and the bluesy appeal of her voice, while Nachiketa engaged in his usual banter with the audience.         
	Sreyashi Dastidar                
	Emotional style        
	Surolok presented Rabindranath Tagores dance-drama, Tasher Desh, at Uttam Mancha on January 9. The programme started with a chorus inaugural song, directed by Gayatri Chowdhury. This was followed by the dance-drama. It is a popular dance-drama, put up many times in various forms by various dancers. Directed by the senior dancer, Aditya Mitra, and coordinated by Apala Basu, this presentation was simple and straight. The group dance performed by Mitras troupe was well-synchronized and well-rehearsed which are important factors for a successful production. They did justice to the choreography with their sense of rhythm. Kaushik Chakraborty as rajputra had a charming stage presence. Samapti Das as haratani was convincing. In songs, Aloke Roy Chowdhury, Apala Basu, Suchhanda Ghosh and Dipankar Pal were impressive. Narration was done in an emotional style by Kajal Sur. The programme was anchored by Debashis Basu.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        COOLING OFF                                                    
	Paul Volcker, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of the United States of America in the 1980s, observed that it was a psychological fact of life that the risks almost always seem greater in raising interest rates than in lowering them. That is because no one likes to create an economic slowdown, which is when the political flak flies. So it might be that when the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, D. Subbarao, announced at Tuesdays second quarter monetary policy review that the RBI would not raise policy interest rates  which influence all other interest rates within the economy  for three months, he was deflecting criticism from industry about continuous interest rate hikes. As the commentary accompanying the review says, the decision does not imply that inflation is not a concern anymore. If anything, the RBI emphasized its concerns about the kind of inflation that monetary policy is unable to influence directly: asset prices (equity and real estate), global commodity prices and food prices. The central banks analysis also referred to potential higher inflation expectations that stem from a current account deficit that continues to widen steadily, and to the elevated levels of inflation expectations that emerged from the RBIs household survey.        
	The net effect of the policy review was to create some puzzlement among financial markets that struggle to reconcile the announced pause on policy rate hikes with the tone of the central banks analysis that implies sustained inflation. Mr Subbarao also focused on prudential measures to contain asset price inflation, particularly in commercial real estate and housing. In recent months, real estate prices have gone up quite a bit, something the central bank feels is not justified. Since the bulk of housing purchases are financed by bank loans, the RBI has required homeowners to put up 20 per cent of the value of the homes they wish to buy as equity; the requirement is similar for commercial real estate. For the banks making those loans, provisioning requirements have been raised, and this could dampen the banks enthusiasm for real estate lending. The next three months could be a cooling off period where the government and the RBI wait out the impact of global developments like QE2  the second round of quantitative easing by the central banks of developed countries. From all accounts, that seems to be the appropriate thing to do  and Mr Subbarao seems to have done just that.

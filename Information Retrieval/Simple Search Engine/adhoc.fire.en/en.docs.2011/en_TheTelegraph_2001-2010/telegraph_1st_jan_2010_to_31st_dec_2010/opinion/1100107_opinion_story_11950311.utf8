                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME OUT                                                    
	It is no real surprise that the all-parties meeting on Telangana has ended inconclusively. Given the deep divisions within and amidst the eight parties that attended the meet, no one could have hoped to hear them speak in one voice. What does surprise is the ease with which the Centre has been able to secure its agenda  to postpone state-formation for an indefinite period. Although all further discussions on the matter have been committed to an unspecified time limit, there can be little doubt that the government has saved itself the unpleasantness of an immediate dissection and bought itself reasonable time. What made this possible was the projected Maoist threat that the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, elaborated on at the meeting. Between the time of the Centres announcement of its decision, on the night of December 9, and December 23, when the all-parties meet was scheduled, the situation in Andhra Pradesh is supposed to have altered significantly. The Telangana agitation, according to intelligence reports with the home ministry, has been infiltrated by Maoists, who not only intend to exploit the political divisions among democratically-elected leaders but also look upon Telangana as their much-sought-after haven. Given the Maoists long-standing presence in Andhra Pradesh, it is strange that the government should have been blind to its implications for Telangana when it gave the go-ahead for state formation. In fact, there should have been no room for such a specious error when the decision was taken in no haste, as Mr Chidambaram has repeatedly asserted. Given that the same party which heads the Centre also rules the state, there is even less reason to excuse the intelligence failure, which has set off an inexorably complicated and dangerous chain of political events.        
	It is unlikely that the ruse of a Maoist threat will be sufficient to stall the surge for Telangana for too long or quieten Andhra Pradesh, something the Centre has been hoping for since it gave its sanction for a separate state. Telangana is a difficult problem to resolve, especially because of the free-reining politics it has inspired across the board. The moment calls for constructive leadership from the Centre. If it is unable to provide that, it should let the dogfight on the streets of Andhra Pradesh decide the matter once and for all. Unfortunately, that will be no inspiring example to democracy.

	Cast away                  
	Sir  It is shocking that M.F. Husain is not being able to return to his motherland because of the bigotry of Hindu fundamentalists (Painted out, Feb 28). A line must be drawn between artistic freedom and public sentiment, especially when the latter infringes on an artists rights of expression. The right to differ with creative expression must end in a dialogue that agrees to disagree to sustain the spirit of diversity.           
	A democracy is meant to assure the rights of all, regardless of personal opinion or beliefs. A failure to do so needs to be addressed by the law. The Indian governments inability to ensure Husains right to live safely and with dignity in his own country has betrayed not only democracy but also the values of tolerance and non-violence that are believed to lie at the heart of Hinduism.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Surajit Dasgupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The ordeals of M.F. Husain and Taslima Nasreen bear testimony to the fact that it is not the rule of law but sheer muscle power that reigns supreme in the worlds largest democracy. If we fail to welcome Husain back to India and provide him with adequate security against the extremists, or cannot rehabilitate the banished writer, Nasreen, Indians will lose their moral right to boast about secularism, and freedom of speech and expression.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                
	Sir  The last two sentences of the editorial, Painted out, have a sad resonance. India, a secular democracy, has a plural society in which sarva dharma samannay is believed to be the guiding philosophy. Sadly, the hideous face of religious intolerance crops up time and again in this country. The brilliant artist, M.F. Husain, is a victim of such religious prejudice. His paintings of Hindu goddesses in the nude have brought upon him the ire of fanatics. All the world is his home, but perhaps not India, which is his homeland and where he bloomed as an artist and received accolades for his works. Husain has been forced to remain in self-exile for long because he has been accused of hurting Hindu sentiments.          
	While religious intolerance should not be supported, religious faith should also not be hurt. One feels that Husain should and could have refrained from painting the controversial images. He actually failed to feel the pulse of his homeland. Or did he take the generosity of Hindus for granted? It could be argued that nothing is vulgar in art, and that nudity can be seen as purity. But how many pious Hindus would accept this emotionally? Somewhat similar is the case of Taslima Nasreen  a rebellious writer and social activist. She was hounded out of Bangladesh by Islamic fundamentalists. She took refuge in Calcutta, but was mired in controversy even here that resulted in extremist groups successfully demanding her ouster from the city. She, too, had to leave the country. Popular rage against Nasreen was fuelled by the supposed blasphemous contents of her writings. She, however, considers these elements as revelations of the truth about the improprieties in her own religion. Political parties in India, including the one that governs the country, are in a dilemma when faced by such issues. Most secular parties play the religion card to win votes. True secularism is indeed wanting in this country.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Ranesh Ch. Dey, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that a renowned and gifted painter like M.F. Husain has not been able to return to India. Extremist groups in this country are responsible for depriving Indians of his talent. If they had politely advised the artist to avoid hurting religious sentiments, things may have been different indeed.          
	However, it is also unfair to criticize those opposing the paintings of Husain depicting Hindu goddesses in the nude. Whenever revered icons of any religion are depicted in a poor light, followers of that particular religion rise in protest. This trend is not exclusive to Hinduism.          
	Yours faithfully,        Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi      
	Sir  History shows that India has always welcomed creative people warmly. Even the content of Rabindranath Tagores Ghare Baire could have become a cause for popular discontent. But the nation has given Tagore due respect for his work. The controversy surrounding M.F. Husain has exposed the narrow-mindedness of certain religious groups and political parties of the country.          
	Every creative person loves his land and his people. But an artist is not a slave of religion or politics. A creative person should never compromise his freedom of expression. An artist is a citizen not only of his country but also of the entire world. Politicians often say how they are proud of great artists, but these very politicians disrespect artists as and when it suits their purpose. They often manipulate popular sentiments to secure their vote banks. The Left Front government in West Bengal has provided reservation for backward Muslim classes. But the same government refused to give shelter to Taslima Nasreen. The common people, nevertheless, can feel the agony of these artists. Our leaders are only worried about their chairs, and are afraid to welcome modern opinions.          
	Yours faithfully,        Uttam Bhowmik, Dhalhara, Tamluk

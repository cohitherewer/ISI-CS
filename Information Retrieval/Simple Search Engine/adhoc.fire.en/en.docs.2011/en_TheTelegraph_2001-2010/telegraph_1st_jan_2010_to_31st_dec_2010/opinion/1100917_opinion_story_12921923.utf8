	In trouble                  
	Sir  The hostage crisis in Bihar came to an end when the Maoists released three of the four policemen they had taken captive (Dawn release near holy place, Sept 7). Eight days earlier, the policemen had been kidnapped from Lakhisarai district. The release may provide a starting point for dialogue between the government and the Maoists. But the killing of the fourth policeman, Lucas Tete, cannot be forgiven. The Maoists had no qualms about doing away with the sole breadwinner of a poor family.          
	Before talks begin, the government must take steps to stem violence. Maoists must stop killing innocent villagers who refuse to support them or who have been branded police informers by the rebels. On the other hand, there are hooligans in these areas who loot and kill in the name of the State. The government should rein them in as well.          
	The chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, and other politicians should try to engage with the Maoists and arrive at a solution to the problem. However, they should refrain from using the situation for gaining political mileage. If talks with the Maoists fail, the government must be prepared to use force in order to end the crisis for good.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  Although it is a relief that three of the policemen captured by the Maoists in Bihar have been set free, there is little to rejoice about. The incident should be a lesson for the state as well as for the Central governments. It is imperative that all political parties unite in the fight against the Maoists.          
	Dialogue with the Maoists, who do not seem to believe in the rule of law, can only be meaningless. The recommendation that the Maoists should contest elections sounds ridiculous. This cannot be a solution, especially since the Maoists do not subscribe to the Indian Constitution and the laws laid down by it.          
	Even as the hostage crisis was making headlines, the Congress leader, Rahul Gandhi, decided to hold a rally in Bihar to kick off the partys election campaign in the state. This appears to be a blatant attempt to take advantage of the situation and score political points.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Agartala

                
	Sir  As a member of the adivasi community, I cannot shake off the feeling that Nitish Kumar, in spite of being touted as one of the most successful chief ministers, has somehow failed the tribal people of Bihar (CM line pays off for now, Sept 7). Had he proposed earlier that the Maoists come to the table for talks, Lucas Tetes life could have been saved. Even in a time of crisis, the Bihar government refrained from taking concrete action and persisted in talking about development.          
	The Nitish Kumar government has been cautious in dealing with the Maoists since they draw power from the politically powerful backward castes of Bihar. Of course, the state governments appeasement of the influential backward castes will pay rich dividends in the approaching assembly polls in Bihar.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Pavitra Hembrom, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As the Maoists wreak havoc in the country, kidnapping and killing police personnel, the people expect the home minister to come up with a solution to the problem. However, officially at least, the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, has maintained silence on the recent hostage crisis (PC mum on crisis, Sept 5). Even as the policemen remained captive, there were reports of Chidambaram attending a celebrity wedding in Chennai and hobnobbing with film stars. One cannot help wondering if the home minister is adequate to the task at hand.          
	Yours faithfully, N.S. Venkataraman, Chennai          
	Sir  The killing of the sub- inspector, Lucas Tete, was horrifying. Had Tete been an important leader, there would undoubtedly have been a greater furore over the incident. The hostage crisis comes in the wake of numerous train accidents in Bihar. Perhaps this is an attempt to discredit the state government, led by Nitish Kumar, especially since the assembly polls are drawing near.
      
	Yours faithfully,      
S.S. Almal, Calcutta

                
	Tried and tested          
	Sir  It was heartening to read about 69-year-old Cha Sa-soon getting her driving licence after taking the test 960 times (In driver seat, on 960th try, Sept 5). The human spirit is truly indomitable. Hyundais present of a car to Cha is a fitting tribute to her grit and determination. The collective endeavour of the teachers of the driving school is also remarkable. Perhaps there is something to learn from the rigorous manner in which driving tests are conducted in South Korea. Despite frequent accidents on the road, it is easy to acquire a driving licence through corrupt means in India.          
	Yours faithfully,        Jyoti Prakash Basu, Calcutta

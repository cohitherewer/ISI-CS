                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SUSPENDED ANIMATION                              Soumitra Das      Visual Arts                                                
	The Society of Contemporary Artists continued its celebration of its golden jubilee with an exhibition of sculptures at Aakriti Art Gallery titled Not so long ago (December 14-31). Most of the works were by established artists, the majority of whom are basically painters. Not surprisingly, with the exception of the sculptors, most of these artists seemed to have conceived form in two-dimension, as opposed to the former, who have a three-dimensional imagination. So it is heartening to discover artists who are willing to break these barriers.        
	B.R. Panesar, after he gave up creating collage and was busy with his landscapes that were close to abstraction, would, on the side, be engaged in doodling the figures of human beings in action. Many of these were of young cricket players conjured up with a few eloquent lines that suggested motion. And at this exhibition, one saw these doodles taking shape in bronze. There was the batsman and there was the bowler (picture), both frozen at the moment before they would bounce into action  suspended animation personified, without going too much into the physical details of the two cricketers.        
	Feminine forms are what Manik Talukdar usually exhibits. Here, his two pieces were more structured  the human form was, in both cases, broken into its essential components and all the extraneous details were removed to expose the structure within. This is a familiar device, but the pieces have a certain dignity because he was not trying to impress by being trendy. Many artists are susceptible to doing that without understanding the dynamics of the trend itself.         
	To our great relief, Suhas Roy did not display his Radha, which has been done to death. He has reverted to his printmaking days when he did a successful series on birds. Roy has transformed the bird into a primordial beast with a long neck like that of a dinosaur. With a touch of humour and patina of warm blue-green, it was way different from his stock images.        
	Lalu Prasad Shaw is best known for his paintings of 19th century Bengal babus and bibis, often with a touch of wicked humour. However, some of his best works are black-and-white prints with their stark calligraphic strokes. His bird and fisherman have some of that austerity  pure form without any frills. Pradip Maitras faceless deity with its huge tongue-like protrusion, too, is severe, a quality it shares with some traditional as well modernist sculptures of this goddess.        
	Another artist who has made a successful transition from brush to bronze is Ganesh Haloi. His Landscape may look like a block of solid metal from afar but one does not have to scrutinize it to discover the deep maze-like grooves. As in his paintings, it would be difficult to point out exactly how Haloi creates the impression of Bengals fertile paddy fields and ponds in his works. In the same indescribable manner, farmland with crops gently waving in the breeze came alive in this bronze piece. His other work, with its crescent-shaped pieces of bronze, were quite as poised as his paintings.        
	Neither Amitabha Banerjee nor Sanat Kars pieces held any surprise  they were their paintings given three-dimensional form  although one has to admit that Kars phantom faces shaped out of beaten metal must have been more technically challenging. Manu Parekhs flowers fraught with eroticism reappear in bronze, although in this avatar they have lost their sexuality. Dipak Banerjee, too, has translated his Tantric paintings into bronze. Aditya Basaks heads were rather confusing. The idea behind his two pieces seemed obscure, at least to this reviewer. They were quite unlike his paintings, which are more easily accessible.        
	Sculptor Sunil Kumar Dass pieces are known for their clean lines and for the simplicity of his ideas  which is not a bad thing, for an artist need not tie himself in knots. This time, however, he misfired. His piece, Time, looked contrived. At least Das took chances. Sculptor Bimal Kundu, on the other hand, played safe. His heads were clones of his earlier work.        
	A particularly banal piece was Sadhan Chakrabortys Moon Walker (sic). The inspiration was obvious, but the conception and execution both proved that the man has neither ideas nor skill. Clearly, nobody was bothered about quality.        
	One of the highlights of this exhibition was a video created for this exhibition by Aditya Basak using black-and-white stills of SCA member artists at work with the voiceover explaining the history of this society. It placed the show in its right context.

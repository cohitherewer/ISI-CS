The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Hardly the best option
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HARDLY THE BEST OPTION                          - Clumsy early electioneering in Westminster					 					      Westminster Gleanings      Anabel Loyd                                                      
	I am returned to this country from Ethiopia to find a population almost suicidally depressed by a cold winter that goes on and on, mirroring apparently both our economic and our political climates. Thank goodness that three weeks in the sun have warmed my bones and improved my sense of perspective as has, in a very different way, a glimpse of the fight for survival that is the way of life for the majority of people in Ethiopia, where life expectancy at birth is over 10 years lower than it is in India and more than 30 years lower than here.        
	Ethiopia is, nominally at least, a democracy and, like us, has a general election looming this May, albeit one that hardly seems the same instrument as our long-standing and relatively straightforward race to the finish. Ethiopian political parties weave as tangled a web as those in India and date from the various regional factions victorious against the brutal communist dictatorship known as the Derg that overthrew and replaced the imperial regime of Haile Selassie in 1974 and continued to torture and terrorize the population until 1991.        
	There are concerns that a victory for the incumbent combined Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front and Tigrayan Peoples Liberation Front and the prime minister, Meles Zenawi, will confirm what is seen by some to be, to all intents and purposes, another dictatorship. There were certainly irregularities in the last election result in 2005 and violence is expected during this campaign, although many of the policies of the opposition coalition parties and the government are hard to tell apart, being based on infrastructure building, education and progress. Meanwhile, outside rarefied political circles, the general population has seen forward movement under Zenawi and has greater faith in his probity and patriotism than that of those who oppose him  seen as corrupt and opportunistic  or are snapping at his heels in his own administration.              
	Whether or not Zenawi encourages a personality cult vested in himself  and my impression is he does not  the clumsy early electioneering at Westminster seems to have come down to a democracy-belittling question of who is the nicest or the most vote-catchingly attractive of our potential leaders, regardless of policy. Gordon Brown is currently coming off worst with headlines over allegations of staff bullying at 10, Downing Street emanating from a new book by the political journalist, Andrew Rawnsley. This story though, along with more important political commentary, has been massively overtaken in the press by the marriage break-up of the Premier League footballer, Ashley Cole, and his pop star and television personality wife, Cheryl. Cheryl is a judge on the X Factor, a hugely successful TV talent contest and, we are told, the nations sweetheart.        
	It is not much of a stretch to imagine a situation where our political leadership would be decided by a similar sort of contest with a public vote based on brief televised performances from participants  in many ways we are already there. Funnily enough, our fascination with footballers over politicians is something we have in common with Ethiopia, where everyone supports a British premier team and English and European matches are screened in cinemas, some open-air, in every town and city. On the other hand, I think that football coverage there, for the time being, remains more about the game and the team than individual foibles.        
	So far as I can discover, and I have only been irregularly in touch with any English news from very remote areas of Ethiopia, the Liberal Democrats and their leader, Nick Clegg, who most of us still wouldnt recognize if we passed him in the street, have been keeping a fairly low profile as the personality battle rages between Brown and David Cameron and their various supporters and detractors. Browns being predictably as much from his own party and, indeed, core government members as from the opposition, with the chancellor, Alistair Darling, suggesting that he was briefed against by Downing Street over his 2008 predictions that the recession would be the worst for 60 years.        
	Peter Mandelson has naturally, in his role as Labour chief spokesman, Lord High Everything Else, and, still surprisingly, the chief Brown supporter, denied any and every allegation of bullying on the part of the prime minister or anyone close to him. Such blanket denial of at least occasional lapses in behaviour of a person or persons working with others in an extraordinarily stressful environment has done nothing to pour oil on troubled waters and made Mandelson look faintly ridiculous. It is considered a well-known fact amongst journalists that Gordon Brown is at best emotionally complicated.        
	The possibility that the Conservatives are somehow tied up with the National Bullying Helpline charity, the organization to which the prime minister was allegedly reported by his put-upon staff, has made them look pretty stupid too as the charity fails to stand up to any sort of scrutiny under the press microscope, its founder, joyously called Mrs Pratt, being seen to be as leaky as a sieve with expectedly confidential information and altogether too close to the Conservatives to be impartial. Conservatives on the organizations board, including the peculiar former minister, Ann Widdecombe, have resigned, doing nothing for either Mrs Pratt or their partys credibility.        
	Cameron, meanwhile, is reducing his popularity by imposing his will on his party in less immediately explosive ways but ones that may return to haunt him. Actually, it is not new for the Conservative central office to attempt to manipulate the selection process for new parliamentary candidates around the country in an effort to create a new, more dynamic and contemporary image for the party, and, in the light of the recent expenses scandal, it is not surprising that the party should encourage a new broom approach. At the same time, Conservatives, however left, right or centre, are not conservative, and note the small c here, for nothing. In fact, aside from the really remarkable new broom that was New Labour, voters in general in this country are disposed to take a conservative position, especially if they feel their right to choose their political representative is somehow being reduced from on high.               
	There has always been a desire, particularly in relatively rural constituencies, for a parliamentary candidate who is a local. Of course, it isnt always possible, but when there is a local on the candidates list and he or she is left out in the cold in favour of some unknown of the right sex and ethnicity endorsed by the central office, all the promises to live in and get to know the constituency count for very little and do nothing to encourage support on polling day. Selectors and voters know that the central offices correct candidates have travelled up and down the country on countless shortlists and made the same promises from Preston to Plymouth. They are not impressed and it may make a huge difference to Conservative results, particularly in times when the character of a known individual, whether or not fitting the new party profile, may count for more than party loyalty and may be as good a reason as any for voting at all.        
	The latest YouGov poll has narrowed the Conservative lead over Labour to six points and Camerons lead over Brown has been halved in the past six months. Meanwhile, the former Conservative deputy prime minister, Michael Heseltine, not yet in his dotage, predicts a hung parliament with the Conservatives the largest party but requiring another election to get, if they can, a ruling mandate. I remain uncertain that the Conservatives will do that well, but at the moment I imagine we are all looking for the least bad, rather than the best, option and it will probably take the campaign and the leaders TV performances for us to decide in which, if any, direction to cast our votes and exercise our tired old democratic rights.

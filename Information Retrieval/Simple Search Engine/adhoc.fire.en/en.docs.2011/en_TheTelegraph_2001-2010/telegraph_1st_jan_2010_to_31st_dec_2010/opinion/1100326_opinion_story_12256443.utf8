	The Swan Thieves By Elizabeth Kostova, Little, Brown, Rs 595        
	Elizabeth Kostova seems to possess a love for the literal. The Swan Thieves, she tells you, is about a mystery in the heart of the rise of French Impressionism; it is a story about painting and painters. The subject of her first book, The Historian, had attracted her as she is interested in history. Kostova also stresses the role of research in both novels. Shortly after starting work on The Swan Thieves, she mentions reading A.S. Byatt. One cant help feeling this might have been injudicious candour.        
	Robert Olivier is a painter. He likes the French Impressionists. Hes obsessed with a woman he may not even know. One day, he flies at a painting in the National Gallery. Admitted into a mental home, he refuses to speak. As the story progresses, this rather interesting situation is sidetracked. Olivier must be crazy in the good old-fashioned sense of the word. At least, thats almost all the explanation youll get.        
	Andrew Marlow, a psychiatrist, sets out to record Oliviers history. This entails sentimental reminiscences by women in the painters life and trips to exotic locales. Marlows perambulations are interspersed by letters between two 19th-century artists who had been lovers. As promised, everyone in the novel paints copiously.        
	The women are good-looking and, through sheer insistence, one is made aware that Olivier has a looming presence, dark locks and dishevelled clothes. Each character comes to that conclusion independently, several times over. Kostova seems to confuse her characters with the paintings they profess to love.        
	Perhaps this is partly intentional. Kostova begins with a rather obvious mis en scne, conflating text and painting. Presumably, the story that is about to be told must be seen within the framework of this painting. What follows is relentless description, often in an irritatingly formulaic cadence: it was too pale, translucent, The furniture was modern and unobtrusive, incidental. Sometimes Kostova has a stab at intensity. Lines like and I felt his selfhood go down through me like lightning certainly make for a lively read.        
	A glut of adjectives and frames clutter The Swan Thieves. The novel refers to so many contextual frameworks that it confuses itself. The myth of Leda and the swan is evoked, apparently to question traditional notions of power and sexual domination that it employs. Yeatss poem is dutifully quoted. Kostova succeeds in making one almost comfortable with this disturbing myth. For a novel about obsession, its remarkably placid.        
	Painters diligently discuss what they feel about painting; a sentiment largely centred on paint under fingernails. Yet the engagement with French Impressionism seems superficial at best. Perhaps Impressionist painting, with its lilt of light and shadow, its fervent brush-stroke of heartfelt immediacy, its rebellious energy, is difficult to depict. Kostova periodically utters Sisley and Monet, describes paintings in laboured detail and offers a tenuous historical link through the epistolary narrative. Impressionism must serve a functional purpose; it must provide an object for the quest undertaken by Oliviers psychiatrist.        
	In yet another ambitious frame of reference, Andrew Marlow is named after Joseph Conrads famous narrator. Conrads Marlow tells the story of the mysterious Lord Jim and goes on a quest that leads him to the depths of the human psyche, to the very heart of darkness. Andrew Marlows quest leads him to Oliviers secret and, according to Kostova, to a mystery that lies at the heart of French Impressionism. Only its more of a puzzle, complete with clues and a solution, a triumph of the literal.

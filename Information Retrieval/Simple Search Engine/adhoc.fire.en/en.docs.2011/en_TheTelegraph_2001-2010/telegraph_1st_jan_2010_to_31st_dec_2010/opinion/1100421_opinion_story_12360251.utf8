	India wants to be part of global trends but on many crucial issues it refuses to follow accepted global practices and conventions. One area in which this is particularly noticeable is the official attitude to government documents and their availability to historians and researchers. The convention in most democracies is to follow what is called the thirty year rule. By this rule, after 30 years have lapsed, government records and documents are declassified and made available in archives or public records offices. In India, the thirty year rule is honoured more in the breach. What is worse is that even papers of individuals that have been deposited by their families and heirs in libraries and archives are not open to scholars. All sorts of restrictions are imposed. A recent example of the official attitude to government records is the statement made by the defence minister, A.K. Antony. The minister refused to make available to the public a report about Indias military failures in the Sino-Indian border dispute in 1962. This report was prepared by T. Henderson Brooks, who was a general of the Indian army. The report is still classified as top secret, and Mr Antony said that its contents are not only extremely sensitive but are of current operational value.        
	Mr Antonys reasons are inexplicable for more reasons than one. They completely disregard the thirty year rule by taking refuge under that highly dubious term, sensitive. They beg the question, sensitive for whom? Even without the Henderson Brooks report, the broad contours and the details of the 1962 conflict with China are well known. There exists a slew of memoirs and papers of some of the important actors which bring to light Indias forward policy in Ladakh and NEFA that was a factor in precipitating the conflict; these records also show up Indias military unpreparedness and the blunders made by the leadership, civil and military. The Henderson Brooks report would at best reveal a few more details and at worst assign specific responsibility. What harm would that cause nearly half a century later? Mr Antony scores an own goal when he says that the contents are of operational value even today. If the details of 48 years ago are of relevance today, then it is an admission that in 48 years India has made little progress in its dispute with China. The fragility of the reasons is indicative of an attitude that makes a fetish of secrecy.

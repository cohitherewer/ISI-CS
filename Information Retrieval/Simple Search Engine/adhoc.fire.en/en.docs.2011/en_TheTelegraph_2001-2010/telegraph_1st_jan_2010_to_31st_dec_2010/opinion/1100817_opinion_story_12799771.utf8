	Peace rally                  
	Sir  The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Janata Party are unjustified in hitting out at the chief of the Trinamul Congress, Mamata Banerjee, for the rally in Lalgarh (Ends and means, Aug 11). These two parties are only trying to make their presence felt in the political arena of the country by criticizing Banerjee. Although one cannot agree with Banerjee that her Lalgarh rally was completely apolitical, one also cannot claim that it was a full-fledged TMC rally. It was largely attended by the people of Jangal-mahal, including members of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities and the Maoists. Banerjee is reported to have made a general call to the people of that particular region and other districts to desist from violence. She also expressed her willingness to mediate between the Central government and the extremists. Time will reveal whether Banerjee is sincere about her promise. For the time being, it is clear that Banerjee wants peace to prevail in Jangal-mahal.          
	Why should a Union minister be criticized for trying to arrive at a consensus with the extremists of Lalgarh? Banerjee has every right to suggest methods she deems fit to bring back peace in Jangalmahal, especially since the Central as well as the state governments have failed to do the same. Why not try out a new peace process? No government, whether in the states or at the Centre, can deny that extremist violence is a direct result of the deprivations suffered by the people, specially the tribals, over the years. The method of protest adopted by the rebels is, of course, wrong. The need of the hour is to initiate welfare programmes for the affected areas while opening up dialogue with the Maoists. The Lalgarh rally might prove to be the right step in this direction.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Manas Kumar Majumdar, Barasat 

                
	Sir  It is ironic that Mamata Banerjee, who has never encouraged dialogue with the Marxists, should seek to build bridges with the Maoists. It seems that her primary objective is to secure the support of the PCPA and the Maoists. When the state government joined hands with the Centre to crack down on the Maoists, the latter turned to the TMC. While this suits Banerjees purposes fine at this point, she must consider how she will tackle the rebel forces if and when her party comes to power.          
	Her condemnation of the killing of the Maoist leader, Azad, who allegedly died in Andhra Pradesh in an encounter, fake or otherwise, is in sharp contrast to the Union governments official position on the issue. Ultimately, the rally turned out to be a shot in the arm for the Maoists.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  The left parties and the BJP are creating an unnecessary fuss over Mamata Banerjees Lalgarh rally, which was an entirely apolitical event. Banerjees courage in going to the Maoist heartland is commendable. Even the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has not made such an attempt. He and his party are probably resigned to the fact that their days in power are numbered. Perhaps Bhattacharjee thinks that it hardly makes any sense for him to walk that extra mile now. In fact, none of those political leaders who criticized Banerjee for her Lalgarh trip has ever tried to visit the Jangalmahal to witness the neglect people have suffered there in the 33 years of the CPI(M)s rule. The Maoists are but a creation of the communists. As the rebels have now become too unruly for the communists to control, the latter are seeking the Centres help. All reasonable individuals should support Banerjees initiative to bring peace to Jangalmahal. The unholy nexus between the CPI(M) and the BJP must be exposed.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is regrettable that politicians across party lines are always looking after their own short-term gains rather than acting in the larger interests of the nation. During the proceedings in the Lok Sabha on August 11, the BJP and the CPI(M), quite expectedly, demanded a statement clarifying the essence of Mamata Banerjees speech at Lalgarh. Banerjee never supported the Maoists. She merely insisted that the Maoists should shun terrorism. She was right in her approach. The government has no plausible explanation for its miserable failure to provide basic amenities to the inhabitants of Jangalmahal. It cannot find a solution to the problems because it is not ready to admit its mistake. Banerjee, on the contrary, was able to rise over parochial considerations like a true leader.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Pradeep Sanyal, Calcutta

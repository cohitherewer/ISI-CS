	LEAVING INDIA: MY FAMILYS JOURNEY FROM FIVE VILLAGES TO FIVE CONTINENTS
   By Minal Hajratwala, 
  Tranquebar, Rs 595        
	It is difficult to classify the book under review into a single category. Initially, it may seem to fall under the class of memoir, but it is much more than that. The subtitle of the book: My familys journey from five villages to five continents, points to another aspect of the book. It takes up the history of a particular Gujarati family which, probably because of the famine of 1899, moved out of India to Fiji. With the passing of time, the family members migrated to five different continents in search of a better future. The story shows the tremendous adaptability of this particular family as far as settling on foreign soil is concerned. It also establishes the dexterity with which the Indians, down the ages, have migrated to different parts of the globe and made their second homes in far-off countries. The book is autobiographical, for the author deals not only with the history of her own family but also narrates her own life. The readers interest in the book is increased by the fact that it gives him a peek into the lives of people in countries as diverse as India, Fiji, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America. After the reader has finished the book, he feels like having been on a holiday in different countries across five continents.        
	Initially, the book is about the history of Minal Hajratwalas family  weavers from Gujarat  but it is also an interesting account of any immigrants life who has to fight the odds in order to carve out a place for himself in an alien land and learn to live amidst strange people, speaking unfamiliar languages. Today, based in the US, the author comes to know about her Indian lineage and her migratory family that have branched into different parts of the world through more than a century  a story that can have few parallels in the history of the Indian diaspora. Thus, to pick up all the strands of her exceptional family history and tell its amazing tale, she has to spend seven years travelling around the world to interview more than 70 members of her extended family and make sense of a conglomeration of data and stories.        
	A graduate from the Stanford University, Hajratwala knows how to weave a tale by mixing it with other elements to keep the curiosity alive. The book presents a delicate mix of the histories of different countries intermingled with the familys account in such a way that the reader does not lose interest as he flips through the pages.        
	For example, when the story begins with the migration of Motiram, the authors great grandfather, to Fiji in 1909 to set up his tailoring shop there, Hajratwala makes it a point to provide details about the country, its history and its economy, so that the reader gets a complete picture. Or, when another member of the family, Ganda, goes to try his luck in South Africa, the reader is taken back in time to relive history with Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. It is surprising to see how well Hajratwala knows each country she writes about. Whether it is India in the pre-Independence days, or Fiji, South Africa, New Zealand or the US, she has done her homework well.        
	The book is also about the amalgamation of a memoir with history, economics, and the political and social life of strange people. Yet, whether Hajratwala leads the reader to Fiji or to South Africa, to New Zealand or to Michigan, she always takes a slice of India with her. Her familys Khatri history begins with the myth of the family descending from gods and kings and approaches towards how, ultimately, the members of the family were reduced to weavers during the British raj that forced them to migrate to distant lands. Their life in Fiji  from being humble tailors to departmental store owners  forms a tale of the ups and downs of real life that are as fascinating as fiction.         
	Divided into three different parts, the book delves first into history, and then weaves the story of the family in a labyrinthine pattern, flitting from the past to the present as easily as we are led from one continent to another. Hajratwalas own life has been narrated towards the end  from being brought up in New Zealand to her parents immigration to the US and their getting settled in Michigan. This, too, is a story of struggle, about the authors loneliness, and about racism, trauma, sex and various other things. But in whatever she writes, Hajratwala is absolutely candid.        
	Leaving India is the story of a family forever migrating from one country to another for a better life. The story brings within its folds many questions about immigration with very few answers. The book is about a familys trials and tribulations, its saga of success and failures, and a humane account of tragedies and happiness that overwhelms the reader because of its universal appeal. Leaving India makes its readers feel and understand what it is to leave ones own country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Spin out of control
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPIN OUT OF CONTROL                                  The failure of the air traffic control system at the Delhi airport shows that the latter is still not the best in the business, writes Abhijit Bhattacharyya                          Tricky territory                                  
	The recent failure of the sophisticated air traffic control system at the Delhi international airport, during peak evening hours, takes one back to the fundamentals of flying at a time of increasing congestion in the air corridors over Indian skies. To fly an aircraft in an emergency without radar guidance or navigational directions from the air traffic controller, a pilot has to depend on visual flight rules as well as the attitude direction indicator if the speedometer and altimeter are functional. The ADI is equipped to indicate whether the aircrafts nose is facing up or down, and how it is placed geometrically vis--vis the flight path. On the other hand, the speed and height measuring meter would provide the pilot with basic inputs that would enable him to land under blind conditions  a time when the machines in the control tower are down.        
	In fact, the forefathers of the present fliers could not afford the luxury of flying with these modern gadgets  both airborne and land-based  to cover their missions from take-off to touchdown. Todays pilots are luckier. They command a fat professional fee, and different kinds of flying gadgets have taken over the many aspects of the hazardous job that was once done by man. Pilots of yesteryear, however, had more fun while flying planes. They were also at a higher risk, owing to primitive technology, and the comparatively inferior infrastructure that was in place then.              
	Seen in this background, the failure of the ATC system at the airport in Delhi can indeed be seen as a major lapse on the part of the overall airport command systems management in the capital. Why does one say so? Has not airport infrastructure improved ever since the slow, sarkari Airports Authority of India handed over ownership to efficient and professionally managed private enterprises?        
	Today, the airport in Delhi boasts of brand new terminals, the longest runway, state-of-the-art parking bays, rising air traffic and commercial outlets. But if one were to try and park ones vehicle in one of the authorized parking lots, one would end up paying through the nose for the service rendered. In true spirit of private enterprise, the prime slot facilities are given to select cabs or groups that are the only privileged operators allowed to drop and pick up the high-end users of the Delhi airport. Nevertheless, it seems that no one has the responsibility to control the rash drivers of buses, trucks, cargo-carriers and sundry four-wheelers that operate in the danger zone through which aircraft move for take-off and landing. The tarmac in Delhi is one of the most dangerous and accident-prone among all the Indian airports. It is possible that drivers of the private operators have taken their cue from their brethren who drive equally dangerously on the capitals roads.        
	Perhaps the most unplanned and thoughtless acts have taken place in areas that are considered to be the cash crops of air traffic  capacity expansion and frequency enhancement  thereby leading to parking problems on ground and compromising the safety of flights on air. In the latter category, the Delhi airport does not inspire much confidence, despite the promises of professional service.        
	In spite of possessing the longest runway, the airport cannot use it fully owing to defective planning. This has rendered a sizeable portion useless and inoperative. Next, come winter and the fog, be assured that flights will either be late, cancelled or diverted, the solemn pledges of modern navigation and landing facilities notwithstanding.        
	Under the circumstances, the fact that a software that helps planes take-off and land crashed recently may not come as a surprise. At the Delhi airport, at any given time, approximately 30 to 100 aircraft land or take- off in the evening. The most serious threat to the airborne traffic emanates from the descending track. Here, one must compliment the employees at the airport air control tower. Indeed, the lowly-paid government officials did a superb job, handling the situation manually when the sophisticated computers crashed. One mistake, and the situation could have spun out of control, as the switchover from automatic to manual mode normally makes the pilots jittery owing to the eagerness of the descending aircraft crew to land on time and proceed home.        
	Here, one is reminded of the mid-air collision between the Kazakh and Saudi airlines on November 12, 1996, over Delhi. The accident took place because either the foreign aircrafts cockpit crew were unable to follow the Indian controllers language or the because the Kazakh aircraft did not follow the stipulated flight path.        
	That the air traffic controller and the flight crew are inseparable is universally known and accepted. Hence the snapping of links between the two is fraught with the risk of potentially fatal consequences. Miscommunication has often resulted in air crashes. For instance, some years ago, when the pilot of a Calcutta-Imphal flight misread and disregarded the ATCs instructions, he crashed into the mountains near Imphal.         
	On another occasion, an Indian Airlines flight  a chartered Tupolev-154 from Uzbekistan  misunderstood the Delhi ATCs advice and made an upside down landing on Delhi airport in zero-visibility. Miraculously, no one died on that occasion, but the aircraft was badly damaged. Later, investigations clearly established, once again, the embryonic connection between the pilot and the men in the control tower.              
	To make things even clearer, one can also recall how, some years back, an Indian Airlines plane force-landed on a paddy field near Tirupati. The pilot had miscalculated the rate of fuel consumption vis--vis the distance, and his obstinacy and the air traffic controllers inability to understand the gravity of the situation resulted in the crash landing.        
	On that day at the Delhi airport, a major mishap had been averted. Yet, anything could have taken place. The defendants of private operatorship may say that there is no need to raise a hue and cry over the matter as nothing dangerous had happened. But it is time to make the Delhi operators learn what it takes to be the best in the business. Surely, the airport in the capital has a long way to go in this respect. The airport, on that fateful day, was saved by the underpaid government employees working at the ATC, and not by the private sector whiz- kids who constantly harp on their pet, but hollow, phrase  the government has no business to be in business.

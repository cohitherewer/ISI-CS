	Investment, it is said, is an act of faith. When the Tata group decided earlier this month to set up the first five-star hotel in Assam  and in the whole of the Northeast  it clearly signalled a new hope for the state and the region. This change of perception was evident at the meeting between the chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, and representatives of several leading industrial groups in Guwahati on March 9. It is easy to understand why business groups are now prepared to explore opportunities in the state. Assams main insurgent group, the United Liberation Front of Asom, is in disarray after the arrest of several of its senior leaders. Although Paresh Barua, the chief of its armed wing, is still at large, the outfits popular support and striking ability never seemed as low as now. More important, most of the senior leaders, including Arabinda Rajkhowa, the Ulfa chairman, favour peace talks. The groups militant cadre may still have the capacity to trigger sporadic violence. But all signs indicate that the Ulfa is a much weakened, if not a spent, force. All this makes it the right moment for the government, the business community and the political class to push the long-suspended development agenda in Assam. Assams prosperity can usher in a new economic regime for all the six other states in the region.        
	However, bad losers everywhere try to raise a stink. It is no surprise, therefore, that the Ulfa has threatened to launch an armed protest against the Tata groups project. Opposition to industrial projects is rising in several parts of India. The Tatas had to pull out their small-car project from West Bengal in the face of violent opposition to it. In Orissa, two ambitious ventures  the iron ore project of the South Korean group, Posco, and the bauxite mining project of the Vedanta Resources  face strong opposition on land acquisition. The Ulfas reasons for opposing the project in Guwahati are absurd. It argues that the states decision to allocate land for the project is against the national interests of Assam. The real reason seems to be the outfits anxiety to use the issue to claim that it is alive and kicking. If it is losing the real war, the Ulfa hopes to win a publicity battle. Mr Gogoi can react to the threat in only one way  by ignoring it and making sure that the project goes ahead. At stake is not merely the success of one business venture but a new dawn for Assam.

	Seasons of Flight By Manjushree Thapa, Viking, Rs 399        
	Holed up in a spare, uncluttered flat with a transient feel in Los Angeles, 26-year-old Prema from Nepal watches the world outside through her binoculars. Duplexes... wood shingles, stucco, tile... a bluegum eucalyptus across the way... the concrete of the pavements, the metal grates of the manhole covers  the listless inventory sums up Premas life in a country not her own, where people mistake her for either a Mexican or an Italian, where the word Nepal might sound like nipple to foreign ears, and where she had landed because she had nowhere else to go. In her birth village at the foot of the Himalayas, a war rages in which her sister has enlisted herself. But the heat of that battle cannot touch Prema in her antiseptic world of duplexes, indifferent neighbours and imported trees.        
	Every time Prema zooms in on her surroundings through her binoculars, one is reminded of Charulata in Rays film of that name. Like Charu, Prema is intensely lonely, and becomes a voyeur to quench her thirst for a life to which she is an outsider. The words describing life out there as seen through Premas binoculars have a flat, hollow quality  as if she is dispassionately itemizing it in an effort to understand it. This makes these words the literary counterpart of the heavy silence accompanying the introductory shot in Charulata, where Charu longingly watches the sun-glazed street outside through her opera glasses. Prema has a neediness similar to Charus that no relationship, however loving or kind, can quite satisfy.        
	Prema achingly desires to reinvent herself, to let go of her old self that had shivered in the poverty and cold of a Nepalese village, to have an American relationship as a passport to the New World where different races have found their home. But she is doomed to loneliness not because America rejects her, as the Nepal of warmongers had rejected her, but because hers is a vagrant soul. When the smell of momos, the image of a happy family in a Mongolian tent-house, and, at times, Nepali, the language of her sorrows, make up Premas idea of sanctuary, it is not unexpected that she will roam the earth forever forlorn, searching for something to which she cannot give a name.        
	Prema, the butterflies are out there, says Esther, the once-famous artist who had found refuge in the blissful oblivion offered by senile dementia. Premas job in LA involves looking after Esther for whom her family has long stopped caring. Esther once had a happy home, a rich husband, but what she painted was women in different colours with blank expressions. After Prema walks out of her relationship with her American boyfriend, she literally keeps knocking on the door of everyone she has known in America, asking for directions. She asks Esther the meaning of happiness, and Esther directs her outside, where the butterflies are.        
	The old lady seemingly cannot help her, and yet she does. Prema finds her place in the forgotten green patches right in the heart of urban LA  Not in America, and not in Nepal, but in the wilderness at the heart of human habitation. With her new-found lepidopterist friends, she goes searching for the El Segundo Blue butterfly, and finds it, along with a job to teach children the flora of California.        
	Manjushree Thapas novel is pure poetry. Although I have compared it to Charulata, it actually doesnt need the help of any other text to yield its meaning. It is what it is  emotional, lyrical, and heartfelt. Since novels about immigrants are churned out by the dozen everyday, and are usually characterized by their vapidity, Seasons of Flight seems all the more striking in the way it makes the usual rare.

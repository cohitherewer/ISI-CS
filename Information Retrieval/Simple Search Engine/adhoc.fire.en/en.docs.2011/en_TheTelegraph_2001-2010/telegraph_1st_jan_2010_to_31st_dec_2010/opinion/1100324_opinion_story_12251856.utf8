                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE REAL ISSUE                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	The bill for the reservation of seats for women in Parliament and state assemblies has been forced through the Rajya Sabha. When it will be placed in the Lok Sabha is still not known. Nor is it known whether the bill will get the same unqualified support from the principal opposition party it got in the Upper House. Meanwhile, fingers will be pointed at the Lalu Prasads and the Ram Vilas Paswans for creating obstacles in the path of women enjoying a cherished right. What, however, is not being appreciated is that the reason for continued opposition to the proposed legislation is rooted in reality. And that reality is not the creation of the Prasads and the Paswans alone.        
	The bill proposes that one- third of the seats in the Lok Sabha and the state legislatures be filled by women, thus presuming that there are enough women available who are qualified to shoulder such responsibilities. Now, the Prasads, Paswans and leaders of the Dalits are almost wholly dependent on the backward castes and Muslims for their electoral success. Unfortunately, in north India, these segments of the population are yet to enjoy in any large degree the benefits of education. In the vast countrysides in the grip of feudal mindset, women are still underprivileged and generally not seen as having minds of their own. It wasnt so long ago that even a convent-educated woman like Roop Kanwar was forced to become a sati by her father and others. The backward castes and Muslims are in an even less enviable position. Yet the law, when it comes into effect, will force the likes of Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Sharad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan to find candidates for the seats from among these people.                
	Cosmetic treatment        
	This is a Herculean task. It will also not be easy for parties enjoying upper caste support, but their problem will be comparatively less since by virtue of their birth these segments are economically better off, enjoying a greater exposure to education. Even then, the upper caste leaders of the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party are not quite at ease with the proposed legislation. Champions of womens rights, of course, will argue that it is to fight such a situation that there should be more women in the House  an argument that seems to suggest that put the cart before the horse and the journey will be smooth.        
	Giving women greater parliamentary responsibility requires preparing them at the ground level which has never been attempted even when the states had been under the rule of the Congress. So there is little point in blaming the leaders of the backward classes now. They are not saying so in so many words, but their objection stems from a very real problem.        
	It is unfortunate that instead of speaking out, these leaders are, in the accepted style of Indian politicians, seeking to further confuse the issue. Their demand for sub-quotas is aimed at further splitting of the already badly fragmented population. This will be dangerous, particularly the demand for a quota for the Muslims which reminds one of the British attempt to have separate electorates along religious lines.        
	Champions of womens reservation cutting across party lines  remember the picture of Sushma Swaraj and Brinda Karat hugging each other are speaking of womens empowerment. The need, however, is for empowerment of the poor, irrespective of gender. What joy can a poor woman in a Bihar, Uttar Pradesh or Madhya Pradesh village feel on knowing that some privileged sister of hers has become an MP or an MLA? Actually, the entire debate over reservation is an attempt at cosmetic surgery to hide the real face of society, its wrinkles and warts. Those opposing the bill should have had the courage to say so. Instead, they chose to be equally mindless.

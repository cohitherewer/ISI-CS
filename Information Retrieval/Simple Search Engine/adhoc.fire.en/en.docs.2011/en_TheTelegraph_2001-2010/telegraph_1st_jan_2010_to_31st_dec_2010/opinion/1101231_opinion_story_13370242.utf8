                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LEFT BEHIND                                  BONA FIDE -MALVIKA SINGH                              
	It is the last day of a rather volatile year that witnessed the start of the unravelling of decades of dishonest decision-making, political and corporate racketeering, with those who make the laws deviating from them with impunity, and more  all laced with a governance that lacked integrity, probity and accountability. Teaching ethics and values makes no sense whatsoever in the India of today because anyone who abides by the mandatory laws of this land is left behind in the growth race while those who break the established norms gain money and power. Hopefully, we have reached the beginning of the end of this horror that has infiltrated the lives of a majority of good, ordinary Indians.        
	Will the gods above save us from the disease that has weakened us over the last decades? Is 2011 going to bring in some semblance of dignity and pride? Is our extraordinary civilization going to regain its inherent strengths that made the cultural and philosophical ethos so special and resilient? Are our leaders going to give up on greed and avarice? Will elected representatives continue to betray the people of India or will they rise from the mire and restore the dignity of life and living across all sections of our society? Will they have the intellectual and emotional wherewithal to reach out and bring in the corrective? These are questions that haunt us today. This nation deserves better, and the misuse of patience and goodwill cannot continue any more.        
	It is surprising that all through the last year the men and women in power did not feel the urgency to clamp down on the corruption that has immersed this land in profound despair. Why do our leaders respond and react only when they are pushed against the wall at gunpoint? Growing insurgency is a result of abject and unforgivable neglect and the urban upheavals and distress are an outcome of careless, faulty governance. If the system needs to be overhauled, surely those at the helm should be engaged in ensuring the rejuvenation? It is quite impossible for a young and energetic nation state to function and be productive within this anarchic framework. Citizens are compelled by the reality on the ground to do wrong and not right, thus defeating every tenet that defines civil society.                
	Truly sad        
	It is time we make a definite and concerted effort to rewrite all the colonial laws that continue to govern us even though we are a democratic, federal, secular republic. The police laws need to be reformed radically. An Indian of the new generation will not be ruled by laws that were created to deal with natives because we are determined by a Constitution that promises equality and fraternity. Centralization of the process of law enforcement is a short-term solution to social unrest. It is dangerous as well because knee-jerk, dictatorial stances are corrosive for civil society. The Indian State needs to be far more intellectually and legally creative to make sure that a decentralized, effective, honest rule of law prevails across the subcontinent.         
	With the transfer of power in 1947, it was easy for the political and administrative class to continue operating within the inherited colonial laws. This has resulted in the gap between the people and the State. Over the last many decades, this exclusive rule has aggravated existing problems, polarized society and created a situation that is spiralling out of control. It is truly sad that ordinary Indians are forced to feel ashamed and dishonoured in the larger neighbourhood and international public domain.         
	Where we could have been a leader in Asia, we are now perceived to have reduced ourselves to a follower of the diktats of a declining world power. Our leaders do not seem to be able to actively engage with the people of India and excite them into the challenges of nation building.

	Absurd drama                  
	Sir  The editorial, A fall foretold (May 25), highlights a new low in the politics of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. As the BJP leader, Murli Manohar Joshi, remarked, the situation in Jharkhand has become a theatre of the absurd. The JMM leader, Shibu Soren, is now considering a defection to the Congress. No doubt he considers an alliance with the Congress to be an effective way to fend off charges against him and probes by the Central Bureau of Investigation. It worked, after all, for Lalu Prasad. The Congress should resist the temptation of forging an alliance with the JMM or with Madhu Koda, who currently faces charges of being involved in a mammoth scam. The party should instead call for fresh elections in Jharkhand.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Shibu Sorens vacillations over whether to vacate the chief ministers chair are reminiscent of the drama that unfolded in Karnataka not long ago. After the coalition between the BJP and the Janata Dal (Secular) collapsed in 2007, the state was under presidents rule for a year. In Jharkhand, a similar tussle is taking place between the BJP and the JMM. It is sad to see that the BJP has not learnt any lesson from its disastrous power-sharing experiment in Karnataka.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  With Shibu Soren declaring that he will not resign from his post, the present turmoil in Jharkhand has deepened (Trust deficit, May 20). The Jharkhand chief ministers latest move has made the BJP unsure about its next step. Meanwhile, the state has been adversely affected by the political instability, and matters need immediate attention. Governance has disappeared completely from this state, which has seen frequent change of chief ministers in the last decade. Even if the BJP and the JMM manage to reconcile, the parties will be too busy wrestling for power to pay much attention to the peoples problems. At this juncture, it is up to the governor to assess the situation and decide whether it calls for the imposition of presidents rule on the state. Fresh elections should then be held, even though they will be a severe drain on the States exchequer.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Justice delayed          
	Sir  The former police chief of Haryana, S.P.S. Rathore, has been sentenced to 18 months in jail on charges of molesting Ruchika Girhotra, a minor, who later committed suicide (Not enough, May 28). Incidents of molestation are common enough but they often go unnoticed. Despite the increase in Rathores sentence, the case reflects deep-seated flaws in the judicial system.          
	Rathore, who was charged under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code, was liable to a maximum of two years in jail under this provision. But he got away with a lighter sentence. Moreover, he could still appeal against the decision of the district court in higher courts. The case dragged on for years. The crime was reportedly committed in 1990. Since then, Ruchika has taken her own life and her family has been harassed relentlessly. After the latest sentence, he can still take recourse to appeals in higher courts. He has already filed a plea for suspending the 18-month jail sentence. This way, he may never get the punishment he deserves, and Ruchika and her family may never get justice.          
	 Public trust in the legal system has plummeted in the last few years. Corruption is rampant in the judiciary, as the case of P.D. Dinakaran proves. It is very likely that Rathore used his influence to manipulate the judicial system and escape punishment.          
	However, the appointment of the new Chief Justice of India, S.H. Kapadia, and the fact that M. Veerappa Moily, the current law minister, is enthusiastic about reform augur well for the legal system. In the Rathore case, it is also encouraging that the media played a positive role. While many are critical of a media trial, without the public outcry against Rathore, the court trial would not have speeded up and the sentence would not have been increased. Not long ago, the Supreme Court also convicted Manu Sharma, who had almost succeeded in evading the law after murdering Jessica Lal. The conviction was made possible by the media-led agitation. Despite the attempts of the corrupt and the powerful to stifle them, the media have succeeded in upholding the citizens constitutional right to freedom of speech. By bringing legal cases to the public eye, the media have proved to be an invaluable aid in combating social evils.          
	Yours faithfully,

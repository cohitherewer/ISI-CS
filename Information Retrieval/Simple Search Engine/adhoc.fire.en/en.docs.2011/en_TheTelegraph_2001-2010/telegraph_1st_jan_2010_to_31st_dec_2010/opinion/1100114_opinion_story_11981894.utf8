                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FUTURE PERFECT                                                                  
	I warily peeked inside one of the galleries of the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum on Gurusaday Road. My apprehension stemmed from the low lighting and pin-drop silence inside the museum. I stepped in nonetheless, and the sight of black walls covered with white diagrams of the water cycle or the solar system eased me. I assured myself that since I remember my geography and life science lessons well, I would not feel at a loss here.        
	As I have a tendency to press a button whenever I see one, I was immediately drawn towards a grid that had several red and green buttons accompanying icons of animals, aircraft and the like. This board was meant to demonstrate the sounds produced by these creatures and objects. Instead of reading the text, I pressed the green button next to the picture of a hen. To my surprise, instead of the crow I had expected, I heard a loud voice welcoming me and asking if I wished to participate in the interactive learning session. There was no way I could stop the voice, although I searched frantically for the right button. I was afraid that the guard lurking around would take me to task for touching the museums objects. As I was guiltily sneaking away from the scene of crime, a boy not more than eight years old gave me a mischievous grin. He seemed perfectly at ease with the museum, with its interactive LCD monitors and sound devices, and amused at the blunders I was making.         
	What I encountered during the rest of my visit was a healthy fusion of traditional science and digital technology. Since new age learning is mostly about the use of multimedia to make education less intimidating, one can get to know much about the effective methods of teaching children from the museum. There were interactive demonstrations of how wind produces energy. Lifelike models showed how the muscles in the human body form the basis of the sophisticated machines we use today. A life-sized steam engine parked on the premises appeared charming to a train-lover like me. But it could also be instructive for an engineering student interested in mechanics. I was surprised at how updated everything was  there was even a panel on swine flu.        
	Climate change being much in the news right now, I was impressed by two models demonstrating the use of alternative energy. One was of a brightly-lit bungalow using solar power. The other was of a self-sustaining household, complete with its vegetable patch, cowshed and well, that used biofuel to meet its energy needs. As I walked out wondering if the models could be put into practice in Calcutta, a carnivalesque sight greeted me.        
	Preparations for the forthcoming science and engineering fair were in full swing. Students were adding final touches to their stalls. This fair is a part of the several activities, camps and workshops the BITM organizes. Here too, climate change ruled the roost. As I caught a glimpse of some unfinished hand-drawn posters that called upon visitors not to waste the waste, I could not help wondering why these students had used new chart papers to demonstrate recycling.

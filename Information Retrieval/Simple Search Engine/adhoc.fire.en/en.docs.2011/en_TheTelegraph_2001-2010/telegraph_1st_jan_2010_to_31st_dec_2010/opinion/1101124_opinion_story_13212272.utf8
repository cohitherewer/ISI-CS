	Nothing succeeds like success. While embarking on his second term in office as president of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa would vouch for this simple truth. Two astonishing successes during his first term in office have given him a headstart which few politicians in his country have had the fortune to share. The first is the defeat of the decades-long insurgency of the Tamil rebels and the second is the passing of the 18th amendment to the countrys constitution. If the first has won him the undying loyalty of the majority Sinhala population of his country, the second has guaranteed him an unshakeable hold on political power. Mr Rajapaksa himself acknowledges that without the constitutional guarantee, which now allows him to run for the presidency even after the second term, he would have been in a less secure position. But there are also other factors that compound his sense of security. One of these is the unchanged power structure and hierarchy that have been repeated in toto during his second term. The government is still in the control of Mr Rajapaksas family, with his brothers handling some of the major portfolios. A cabinet expansion has absorbed the new supporters of the establishment, such as the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, which provided yeoman service during the passing of the constitutional amendment. A supine opposition also contributes to the strength of the new presidency.        
	But what undeniably adds to Mr Rajapaksas confidence is the knowledge of Sri Lankas importance in the emerging power equations in South Asia. It is this knowledge that has allowed him to ignore the threats of economic boycott by the West for Sri Lankas alleged human rights violations. By the clever use of Sri Lankas economic and strategic advantages vis--vis the rival nations in the region, Mr Rajapaksa hopes to make his country the next economic miracle of Asia. He also hopes to use the ensuing economic progress to steamroll all divisive and secessionist tendencies within the country. The emphasis on a trilingual policy (enormously significant, given that linguistic differences were a major cause for ethnic tension), the new tax structure and wooing of foreign investment are all directed towards that goal. Little wonder then that the need for a political solution to the ethnic strife has been pushed to the margins.

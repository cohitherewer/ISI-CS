                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GROWING PAINS                                                    
	New economic realities are changing the rules of the game for governance and politics. But state governments in India often seem to be unprepared to play by the new rules. They are anxious to get investments for new industrial and infrastructure projects, but lack the will and capacity to change outdated attitudes and practices. Orissas chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, seems to be realizing the inadequacies of the system to meet the new challenges. If three of the biggest new projects in the state are mired in controversies, the reason is primarily the state administrations failure to shake off its lethargy and ready itself for the big push. Two proposed steel plants  one by the South Korean firm, Posco, and the other by the Jindal group  face charges of violations of environmental guidelines. Now, the Orissa High Court has raised serious questions about the legality of the land acquisition for the proposed Vedanta University. Similar questions had earlier been raised by politicians and the civil society about the land acquisition for the groups iron ore mining project as well. The governments responses to some of these questions suggest that its officials had not done their homework properly. The administration seems to have been indifferent to the demands of the new regime that requires industries to follow environmental norms and protect forest-dwellers rights.        
	However, all this is no reason to make investment and industry a new weapon in partisan politics. What the Opposition did in the Orissa assembly last week was, therefore, entirely unwarranted. Its demand for Mr Patnaiks resignation, allegedly for misleading the House, smacked of bad politics. The Opposition is within its rights to force the government to come clean on the issues relating to the new investments. It is primarily the peoples right to know that their elected representatives are supposed to protect and uphold inside the legislature and outside. But experiences of other states such as West Bengal should be a warning to Orissas politicians against sacrificing the states economic interests at the altar of petty politics. Its reserves of iron ore and other minerals make Orissa a prime attraction for investors under the new economic dispensation. But the race for attracting investors has to go hand in hand with necessary improvements in the quality of governance.

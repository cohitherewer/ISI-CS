	Newton and the Counterfeiter: The Unknown Detective Career of the Worlds Greatest Scientist By Thomas Levenson, Faber, 20        
	Richard Westfall, the dean of Newtonian scholars, spent 20 years preparing to write the biography of his hero. More than 950 pages long, Never at Rest, as any reader will attest, is a masterpiece. But the time it took to be written, Westfall confessed in the preface, was also too long  from when my children reached consciousness to when they entered their respective careers. The authors declaration of his perseverance was not to impress the readers but to reveal the enormity of the task of chasing his subject. The more I have studied him, the more Newton has receded from me, wrote Westfall. Only another Newton could hope fully to enter in his being, and the economy of human nature is such that a second Newton would not devote himself to the biography of the first.        
	Just how difficult it is to come to grips with the life of the man who initiated modern ideas about the material world will be understood from a simple fact. Newton died in 1727 at the age of 84. Since then, there has been no dearth of biographies of the scientist who solved the riddle of the planetary motions, invented an entirely new branch of mathematics known as calculus, discovered what constituted light and built a new (reflecting) telescope far superior to the existing ones. But  let alone the hagiographies  none of the biographies, not even the still-highly-acclaimed The Life of Sir Isaac Newton by Sir David Brewster (last revised in 1875) discussed in detail what Newton surreptitiously pursued for 20 years  alchemy. The omission was not deliberate, though. That a supposedly new-age thinker could indulge a medieval dream of turning lead into gold, or concocting a potion for eternal youth, came to be known in vivid detail only in 1936. The man behind this somewhat unsavoury disclosure was Lord Lymington, the Earl of Portsmouth who, as a leader of the British Union of Fascists, was a friend of Adolf Hitlers.        
	A descendant of Catherine Burton, Newtons niece who kept house for him for 30 years and inherited his papers when he died, Lymington owned a big metal box. Locked within it were manuscripts that Newton had hidden during his lifetime and they were unread for 200 years afterward. In need of money to finance his organization, Lymington sold off the contents of the box in 329 separate lots at an auction at Sothebys in London. This earned him only 9,000, a ridiculously paltry sum considering that the tercentenary of Newtons birth was merely six years away.        
	Interestingly, one of the buyers at the auction was the great British economist, John Maynard Keynes, who procured as many alchemical papers of Newton as his means permitted. Though bogged down with the onerous task of keeping the British economy afloat during the turmoil of the World War II, he devoted himself to a scholarly reading of the Newton papers in his possession, and based on that, he delivered a lecture  titled Newton, the Man  at Trinity College during the tercentenary celebrations. Keynes admitted that Newton seemed to him neither a rationalist, nor the first of the modern age of scientists, but the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians...        
	Thomas Levenson, professor of science writing at the MIT, has come out with what may be the latest addition to the already voluminous literature on this other Newton. His book has under the scanner those years of Newtons life just after he made a career move to London in 1696, leaving behind decades of solitary scientific studies in Cambridge. Levenson captures the physicist embroiled in a fierce feud. That he was no saint when dealing with his adversaries is well known. His quarrels with Robert Hooke (on whether light consists of particles or waves, and who invented the inverse-square law) and with Gottfried Leibniz (over who plagiarized calculus from whom) have been fodder for many a yarn portraying him as a ruthless, even nasty, opponent. Now, Levensons book pits Newton against the vicious underworld of 1690s London.        
	To help the readers understand the ramifications of this battle, Levenson has beautifully contextualized it. Newton, he writes, came to London in the wake of two personal tragedies. The first one was the sudden snapping of his intense emotional relationship (whether it was physical, Levenson cant tell) with a handsome young Swiss mathematician named Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. Compounding the pain was another setback  a crisis of faith. The devout Christian that Newton was, he practised alchemy so that he could rescue god from the threat of irrelevance posed by the new-found mechanistic philosophy, which viewed all happenings as merely matter in motion. After all, whats alchemy if not a direct encounter with god, with the divine spark that is supposed to govern all transformations in nature? But Newtons dream failed him. Though for a few days in 1693 he was ecstatic, thinking that, after years of attempts, he had found a method to turn base metals into gold, he soon discovered that the success was an illusion. What followed was a period of severe depression and paranoia. So the man who came to London was a troubled soul.        
	The bureaucratic post that awaited him in the capital  warden of the Royal Mint  promised to be one with a respectable salary but no work. However, for Newton, that was not to be, as England was in the throes of a major financial calamity.        
	British coins had been prey to counterfeiters malpractices for a long time. Unscrupulous men and women were clipping the edges of coins and melting down the clippings so that they could sell them as pure silver for profit in the bullion markets overseas. To tackle the problem, in the 1660s, the government started machine-milling the edges of coins, but that measure too failed, partly because the face value of the freshly-minted coins was less than the value of silver that they were made from. By the 1690s most of the milled coins vanished from the market. The treasury was in a shambles as it would not take clipped coins as tax payments with the excuse that they contained less silver. The remedy? Take seven million pounds worth of non-milled coins out of circulation, melt them down and re-coin them with milled edges. Newton had to oversee this huge operation.         
	It was this business that saw him cross swords with the most notorious counterfeiter: William Chaloner. A peddler of sex toys and a philanderer himself, Chaloners lust for wealth took him to many roads. His men would rob people of their belongings, while he would pose as a clairvoyant, charging fees for helping them get back their stolen goods. He would also print fake anti-monarch pamphlets so that he could earn monetary rewards by handing them over to the administration. Can such a crook keep himself aloof from counterfeiting for long?         
	Newton was as determined to root out the malpractice as Chaloner was to further it. Levenson documents the three-year battle between the two giants. While Newton hires informers to gather details of Chaloners counterfeiting operations, the latter makes sure the warden of the Royal Mint is tried on charges of corruption. In the end, however, Newton wins the war of attrition, as Chaloner, found guilty of counterfeiting, is sent to the gallows.        
	With a gripping narrative of deceit, murder, pursuit and punishment, Newton and the Counterfeiter will beat many a crime thriller. It would make a fabulous novel, were it not true.

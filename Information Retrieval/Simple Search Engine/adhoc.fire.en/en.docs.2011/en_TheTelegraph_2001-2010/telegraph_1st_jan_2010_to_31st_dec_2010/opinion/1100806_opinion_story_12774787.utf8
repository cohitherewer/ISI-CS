	Love, herbs and other matters                
	Dancing with Kali (Niyogi, Rs 295) by Lalita Das is composed of the two great Indian clichs: karma and Goa. The price of trying to wipe out your karma, it warns, is blood. But this is precisely what most of the characters seem bent on doing. Hippies descend on Goas beaches, trying to find themselves; local women engage in subversive love affairs  with disastrous results. This tale of love, rebellion and marijuana is steeped in Christian and Hindu philosophies. The novel attempts to explore the clash between the hippy culture that has spread in Goa and the traditional rural way of life. It ends up essentializing both and perhaps understanding neither.                        
	The Poison Diaries (HarperCollins, Rs 299) by Maryrose Wood assures you there is no cure for love. Jessamine lives with her apothecary father in a house with a walled garden full of dangerous plants. Enter Weed, the botanically gifted hero. Although a person of few words, Weed claims he can communicate with plants. A lurid version of The Secret Garden seems to follow as Jessamine discovers the secret of the Poisons in the locked garden. Of course, in this herbal romance, the greatest poison and the most powerful antidote is love.                                  
	The Golden Gandhi Statue from America, Early Stories (Harperperennial, Rs 199) by Subimal Misra splits the skin of stories, revealing the dark, savage matter beneath. Familiar narrative structures are abandoned; Misra urges meaning through a montage of images. This collection of short stories, originally written in the 1960s and translated from the Bengali by V. Ramaswamy, is as radical in form as it is in content.         
	The bloated corpse of a starved young widow floats towards Kalighat, even as everyone waits, with mounting excitement, for the unveiling of a golden statue of Gandhi. Neon signs suck the hearts blood while beggars tear at the flesh of a dead donkey. Rumours course through the country, prophesying massive floods or a rebellion of refugees in Calcutta. The immediate human tragedy is sharpened by a keen sense of wrong, a political rage. Misra, a major figure in the little magazine movement, declares that he has never published his work in any mainstream journal or daily. The establishments, he claims, will never even dare to touch his stories.

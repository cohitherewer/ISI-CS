The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | not the usual nutcase
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT THE USUAL NUTCASE                                  GWYNNE DYER                              
	If Geert Wilders were some underemployed bigot ranting in a pub, youd just move away from him. He calls the Islamic veil a head rag, and says it should be taxed for polluting the Dutch landscape. He condemns Islam as the sick ideology of Allah and Mohammed and the Quran as the Mein Kampf of a religion that seeks to eliminate others. Just another nutcase with too much time on his hands.        
	But Wilders is no ordinary nutcase. He is a Dutch member of parliament and the leader of the Freedom Party, which came an impressive third in last Junes elections. So the other parties cannot ignore him, even if he goes to jail, which is quite possible. His trial on five charges of inciting hatred and discrimination began in Amsterdam on October 4.        
	Wilders first achieved global notoriety in 2008 with the film, Fitna, which juxtaposed images of suicide bombings with verses from the Quran and depicted Islam as a force bent on destroying the West. After that, his Freedom Party got lift-off, and last June it won 15 per cent of the vote. In the Dutch political system, that gives him real leverage.        
	The Dutch political scene is so fragmented that no party has achieved an overall majority in any national election since World War I. No single party has polled over 30 per cent of the vote for more than two decades. Its a system that often allows small, single-issue parties to wield influence far beyond their numbers.        
	The two traditional conservative parties ended up with only 52 seats between them, which meant that they needed the Freedom Partys 24 seats even to achieve a paper-thin majority in the parliament. But how could they sit at the same table with a man who said such incendiary things about his Muslim fellow-citizens?                
	Random outcome        
	They solved their little problem by agreeing that the Freedom Party would vote for the new coalition government, but would not be an official part of it. There was a price to be paid: the new government would pass laws that sharply diminished the rights of Dutch citizens who happen to be Muslim.        
	Like most extremists, Wilders is obsessed with clothing, so burqas are to be banned altogether in the Netherlands if the deal holds. Police officers and other government employees would not even be allowed to wear the Islamic head-scarf. Immigration from non-Western countries would be halved, and the rules on granting political asylum to refugees made much stricter. This wont fully satisfy Wilders, but its certainly a good start.        
	How can this be happening in the Netherlands, once seen as a bastion of liberty and tolerance? What is happening is the result of an accident that sometimes happens in political systems like the Netherlands, which encourage a proliferation of small parties. The Freedom Party doubled its vote in this years election, partly because people are more likely to vote for a protectionist, xenophobic party in the midst of an economic crisis, but it still got only one-sixth of the vote.        
	Thats the level at which anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim parties have peaked in other western European countries like France, Belgium and Denmark. Its actually less than what the predecessor to Wilderss party, the Pim Fortuyn List, polled in 2002. There are xenophobes everywhere who can inflate a six per cent Muslim minority into a threat to the nations identity and safety, but they are not all that numerous themselves.        
	The Netherlands looks as if it has been taken over by the crazies, but what we are seeing is a random outcome, unlikely to be repeated, of the system of proportional representation. If Wilders can turn this into a free speech issue, and if he is jailed, then his support may expand beyond the far-Right. But the Dutch really arent nastier than everybody else.

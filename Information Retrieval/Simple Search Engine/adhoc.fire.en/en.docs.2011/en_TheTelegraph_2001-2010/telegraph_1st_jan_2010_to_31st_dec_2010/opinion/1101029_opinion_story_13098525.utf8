	Pay heed                  
	Sir  It is indeed sad, as Amartya Sen has pointed out, that nations across the world  including the champion of democracy, the United States of America, and the largest democracy, India  have turned a blind eye to the situation prevailing in Myanmar (Amartya: World ignoring Myanmar, Oct 22). If Aung San Suu Kyi, the victorious candidate in the last elections in Myanmar about two decades ago, could be kept under house arrest by the military junta for all these years, it is anybodys guess what the outcome of the forthcoming elections would be. In any case, preventing Suu Kyi from contesting the elections on flimsy grounds is itself a shame on democracy. Quite obviously, the overwhelming popularity of this opposition leader among the masses is a matter of great anxiety for the junta.          
	India has a special bond with Myanmar historically. The Indian government ought to have cold- shouldered its present Myanmarese counterpart instead of extending the hand of friendship. Our interest in cross-border trade should not be so overwhelming as to make us ignore the violations of human rights in Myanmar. Now that Indias importance in international forums is on the rise, our government should try garnering support from the superpowers to free the people of Myanmar from the juntas oppression.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Suman Sankar Dasgupta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  One often feels that Amartya Sen has two personas, one reserved for countries beyond the shores of the Atlantic, and the other for India. It was so nice to hear him condemn the military regime of Myanmar from the cool confines of Johns Hopkins University. Sen wants a change in Indias attitude towards the rulers of Myanmar. The same Sen has emphasized time and again that a mere change of the political regime will not do any good to West Bengal.           
	Sen has asked for an immediate investigation into the alleged crimes against humanity committed by the junta in Myanmar. This fits in with his credentials as a civil rights activist. In India, however, he keeps mum when Tapasi Malik is burnt to death in a plot owned by the Tatas.           
	Sen can rest assured that his advice with regard to Myanmar will not be heard by anyone here. Had Indians been more attentive to the counsel of Sen, the automobile factory in Singur would have been a reality by now.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

                
	It stinks          
	Sir  After spending billions, we have managed to host the 19th Commonwealth Games successfully and to make our capital an enviable showpiece in the process. However, the report, Toilet trauma for Commonwealth cops (Oct 9), highlights the utter failure of the organizers to provide basic toilet facilities for the 6,000 policewomen especially recruited to ensure the security of the foreign guests in Delhi. While everybody was bothered with the foreigners, no one was concerned about the plight of these policewomen. Whatever the excuse for this neglect, it should not have happened. It is the governments duty to spend money not only on an international event like the Games, but also on the construction and maintenance of basic public facilities like toilets.           
	Over the decades, slums have mushroomed all over our metropolitan cities, and slum-dwellers have been lamenting that the government does very little to provide them with sanitation facilities. The limited facilities available are not maintained properly. As a result, sewers are choked and overflowing, producing obnoxious odour and posing a serious health threat to the inhabitants of the surrounding areas. The scenario in Calcutta is probably the worst in this regard. Despite promises from the state government and private bodies, the number of public toilets in Calcutta is less than adequate. One cannot but feel pity for the drivers of vehicles parked under the Gariahat flyover who are compelled to endure the stench of urine as they wait for the car owners.          
	At the third South Asian Conference on Sanitation hosted by New Delhi and attended by over 1,000 delegates, Lizette Burgers, chief of water, environment and sanitation of the Unicef, had said that India is an emerging power but it lags way behind Pakistan, Bangladesh and even Afghanistan when it comes to providing basic sanitation facilities for the people. In India, people have no qualms about relieving themselves in every nook and corner. The need of the hour is not only an increased spending on public sanitation but also campaigns to improve peoples sense of hygiene.                     
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The return of the heroes
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE RETURN OF THE HEROES                              THEATRE                                                
	Historical drama, featuring larger-than-life monarchs against epic panoramas, has gone out of fashion, even on screen. This age does not believe in real heroes, so the few who do emerge appear in fantasy. Therefore, one welcomes the rare excursions into history.        
	Fans of the genre can luxuriate in the grand manner of Rangapats Aurangzeb, which boasts spectacular old-style painted vistas by Sanchayan Ghosh and heightened classical acting in the principal parts. Mohit Chattopadhyaya wrote it, taking off from the Bengali translation of the English translation of Indira Parthasarathys Tamil original (1973). This Aurangzeb does not have plot similarities to K. P. Vidyavinods Alamgir, made famous by Sisir Bhaduri, but Chattopadhyaya does draw upon Alamgirs inner conflict for his characterization. Nor does it attempt to revise received opinion about Aurangzebs fundamentalism in the light of recent reassessments, as Parthasarathy did. Instead, Chattopadhyaya states his intention of examining whether any one faith can ever become the cornerstone to govern pluralistic India.        
	In fact, we do not see Aurangzeb until after the interval (picture), the first half delineating Shah Jahans rapid decline, starring powerful performances by the director, Harimadhab Mukhopadhyay, as the anxious old emperor and a fiery Rita Datta Chakrabarti in her best acting to date as his daughter, Roshanara. Debshankar Haldar in the lead offers a studied psychological portrait of outer strength and moral conviction against god-fearing uncertainty inside. The tragic Dara Shuko represents Akbars syncretic religious tradition. Completing the vicious circle of political life, Aurangzeb finally reaches the same position his father had, realizing the futility of all he had enforced.        
	Bandel Arohi coincides its first full-length production with the centenary of D.L. Roys nationalistic but imaginative Chandragupta, which presents the Mauryas founder as determined to restore the honour of his Sudra mother, Mura, by deposing his half-brother, Nanda (who had banished him and insulted Chanakya, thus bringing both together), yet ready to release Nanda, except that the avenging Chanakya has him killed. Eventually, Chanakya himself withdraws from public office, once reunited with his kidnapped daughter. Director Ranjan Roy sympathetically enacts the most complex role, Chanakyas, as an angry loner, but he must ensure that his cast pronounces Bengali properly: far too many convert the prefix pra- into pa-, and hiss all three sibilants like the proverbial Shashibabu from Shyambazar. Sudipta Dutta gives Chandragupta the force of a young lion raring to dominate the pride, whereas his Greek wife of convenient alliance, Helen, unhappily sports an orange wig in the Bengali clich to denote Europeans. Satyaki Bhattacharyya makes the opportunistic Katyayan simultaneously vengeful and comic.

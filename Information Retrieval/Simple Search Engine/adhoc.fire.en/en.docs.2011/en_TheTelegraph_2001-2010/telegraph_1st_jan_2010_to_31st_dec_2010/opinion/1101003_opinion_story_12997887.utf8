	Save them from knowledge                  
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee made an open appeal to members of the All Bengal Primary Teachers Association to help him save his government (Taught a lesson, CPM banks on teachers, Sept 24). The teachers were not asked to impart proper training to students, but were advised to join the political struggle of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) against the Trinamul Congress. I am confused. Can the head of a state directly instigate teachers to take part in politics, and that too in favour of the ruling party?

	Free no more          
	Sir  It was a pleasant surprise to see the pavement in front of the Grand Hotel freed of hawkers in preparation for the presidents visit (The day we walked free, Sept 23). For once, the place looked like the arcade of a star hotel and not like a market. The Oberoi Grand is the one of the foremost hotels in the country and yet its arcade is occupied by hundreds of hawkers. The peddlers not only make the area an eyesore but also pose a security risk. It is unfortunate that the Calcutta Police has not learnt any lesson from 26/11.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The report, The day we walked free, along with the photograph of an uncluttered Grand arcade, served as a reminder of the sorry state of affairs prevailing in Calcutta. At first glance, the Grand arcade in the photograph did not appear to be a part of Calcutta at all since we are not used to having such a lot of free space for pedestrians. But a closer look brought back fond memories of this place in the past, when one could walk there freely. It is sad that the rule of law was enforced in Calcutta only for the sake of the first citizen. We appreciate the fact that political parties of every colour complied with the ban on rallies enforced by the police on September 23 to ensure easy passage for the president. But had political outfits behaved as obediently as this throughout the year, our appreciation would have been much deeper.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The photograph of a hawker-free Grand arcade that appeared on the front page of The Telegraph on September 23 was fantastic. But in sharp contrast to the state of the Grand arcade that day was the condition of the relatively unimportant Gurudas Mansion arcade in Gariahat. While my wife bravely opted to rub shoulders with vehicles rushing down the main road, I committed the mistake of attempting to walk along the arcade, which, I presumed, was for pedestrians. I almost collapsed of suffocation as a result. The side of the arcade facing the main road was completely sealed with tarpaulin sheets to protect hawkers and their wares from rain or shine. The vendors took up much of the pavement and the remaining narrow space was clogged with shoppers, leaving no escape route for pedestrians. I learnt two lessons from that day. One is that the fairer sex is definitely wiser. Second, the people of this city can survive any degree of congestion.           
	Yours faithfully,        Tapan Lal Dasgupta, Calcutta 

              
	Bad deal          
	Sir  The Doon Express, which runs between Dehradun and Howrah, needs urgent attention. It has 73 scheduled stops, but it makes numerous unscheduled halts along the way. The train is also lacking in passenger amenities. The Doon Express is one of the oldest trains connecting the plains with the Himalayas. It demands a better deal.           
	Yours faithfully,

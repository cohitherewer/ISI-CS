The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Look back                  
	Sir  I must thank The Telegraph for the insightful and thought-provoking article, Born to charm (Jan 18), by Sunanda K. Datta-Ray. The other day, I got into trouble in a north Calcutta tea stall when I asked a simple question, What has Jyoti Basu done for West Bengal? Some loyalists of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) who were there at the stall created a fuss over this question, saying that Bengali bhadroloks are really chhotoloks. While their allegation was not entirely false, their warning bothered me. Erakam ekjan mahamanaber sambandhe esab bolte apnar lajja kore na? (Dont you feel ashamed to ask such questions about a great man?), they asked. Sensing that a scuffle might ensue, my friends dissuaded me from arguing further with them. Then I came home and read the article, and felt vindicated.           
	But what Datta-Ray has left out of his critique, perhaps inadvertently, is Basus policy on the teaching of English in the state. Once, as the programme officer for a project commissioned by the ministry of minority affairs, I had to interview some students to be recruited as field supervisors. The students were competent and skilled in fieldwork. But when it came to articulating a thought in English, they fumbled and hesitated. Later, when we were working, they described the embarrassment that came with not being able to speak English. This shame is what Basu had given to the state in all those years. Not only this, he has constructed a language of his own which is distinguished by its intolerance of any resistance or dissent.           
	Basu is no more, but if you go out in the streets, you will hear the autowallas and taxiwallas speak his language. I call it the goonda vocabulary. The only difference between Basu and these lumpen elements is that the latter lack the sophistication of Basu, who used this language to mobilize ordinary people. From January 17 to 19, Calcutta witnessed the drama of Basus body being carried from one landmark to the other, while normal activities in the state came to a standstill. From the inhabitants of the remotest village of Bengal to Sheikh Hasina, everybody has been singing paeans for the departed leader. But what has Basu done for West Bengal to merit this adulation?           
	Yours faithfully,      
Ruprekha Chowdhury, Calcutta

                
	Sir  At a time when everyone is going overboard extolling the virtues (real or imagined) of Jyoti Basu, the editorial, Gentleman prefers ism (Jan 18), and the article, Born to charm, by Sunanda K. Datta-Ray came as breaths of fresh air and the voice of reason. One must thank The Telegraph for presenting such a rational, pragmatic and well-balanced evaluation of the former chief minister. It is unfortunate for Bengal that during his unusually long tenure as the chief minister, Basu did so little for the people when he could have done so much. Electing him as the chief minister of West Bengal may be the real historic blunder for which the state and its people  if not the country itself  would have to keep on paying long after he is gone.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Rupnarayan Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The editorial, Wasted love (Jan 19), was ill-timed, coming as it did on the day of Jyoti Basus last journey. While a writer has the right to his opinions, there should be some objectivity in the assessment. Basu was not above criticism, but one cannot forget his role in the revival of land reforms, the panchayat system and in the solution of power problems of the 1960s and 70s. Above all, Basu should be remembered as a towering political figure, who had saved the country many a time with his valuable advice to various political parties in times of emergency.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Pabitra Kumar Bhaumik, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Wasted love, was not in good taste. Jyoti Basu was not an ordinary man. On account of his qualities, he earned respect from people across the political spectrum. Basu may have been rigid in his views but he was not hypocritical. All his life, he worked selflessly to strengthen his party and the state. This ensured that the CPI(M) had a sound footing in West Bengal. His government might have driven away industry from Bengal, but Basu never made any bones about it. He did this because he preferred an agricultural economy to industry. His policies were validated by the people, who consistently voted for him.           
	Yours faithfully,       
K. Karna, Patna 

                
	Just cause          
	Sir  I often read reports on the disturbances in Darjeeling that blame, directly or indirectly, Bimal Gurung and his Gorkha Janmukti Morcha for the current crisis. But is Gurung really responsible for the problems besetting the hills? I had studied for quite a few years from the early 1960s in an Anglo Indian public school in Kurseong. Having lived in the school hostel, I have first-hand knowledge of the local people. I had noticed that the hill people, in general, were sceptical of those from the plains. I could not fathom the reasons for this scepticism then, but later realized what might have caused it. Over the years, the plains people, mainly leaders and politicians, have taken advantage of their simplicity and honesty, and have often exploited them as cheap labour.          
	Almost 50 years have passed since I lived in the hills, but even today not much has taken place there. No new employment opportunity has been created, no new school, college, hospital or roadway has been constructed, at least none to speak of. The existing infrastructure in the hills had been built by the British. Lack of maintenance, added to slow and steady deterioration, has brought the queen of the hills to ruins today. In this situation, the hills need someone who can protest against the continuing exploitation of the people, and demand self governance. This is exactly what Bimal Gurung has done. How long can the people in the hills tolerate the indifference of the state and Central governments? It is time that those honest people had their own Gorkhaland to end years of injustice.           
	Yours faithfully,

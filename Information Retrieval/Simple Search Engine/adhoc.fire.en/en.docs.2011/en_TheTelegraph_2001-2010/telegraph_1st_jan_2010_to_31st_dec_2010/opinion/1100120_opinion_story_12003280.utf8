The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | state funeral
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STATE FUNERAL                                                    
	Perhaps because comrades believe in the historical inevitability of the coming of communism, they can always be relied upon to be predictable. The first responses to the death of the patriarch, Jyoti Basu, include proposals to memorialize him. Fortunately, comrades here, unlike their counterparts in erstwhile Soviet Russia and China, do not believe in embalming leaders, so Basu has escaped that fate. But communists in Calcutta have mastered the art of renaming roads and erecting ugly statues that only attract pigeons. The search is already on to find a suitable stretch of tarmac to name after Basu. This is, of course, a much easier thing to do than to make a realistic reckoning of Basus lamentable legacy to the people of West Bengal. Unfortunately, there is no road in and around Calcutta that leads nowhere: that would have been the most appropriate road to name after Basu. He took West Bengal nowhere. There is another proposal on the table, and this needs to be resisted. This is the idea to convert Indira Bhavan, where Basu lived for many years, into a museum in honour of him. Indira Bhavan is a government building, which was not built to house a museum. It should go back to being used for what it was originally constructed. A museum to honour Basu may be needed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to create an aura around Basu, but that need cannot be met from the taxpayers money.        
	The attempt to make a myth out of Basu is manifest in the pomp and pageantry surrounding his funeral. Even Basus critics admit that he dedicated his life to communism, which he saw as an ideology to make the world a better place for the poor. Basu believed in changing society, and for the better part of his life he criticized and fought the Indian State. Yet, on his last journey, the Indian national flag was more visible than his beloved red flag; the State ritual of gun salute was more prominent than his comrades red salute. In the process of making a myth out of Basu, his career as a chief minister prevailed over his life as a communist. Between his commitment and his career fell the shadow of his partys desire to fix for Basu a place in history. Nothing in Basus life was more incongruous than his last journey with the Indian army as the escort. What could be more ironic than a communist party wanting its leader to be celebrated in his death by the pomp and circumstance of the Indian State?

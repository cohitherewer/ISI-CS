The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Broken promises
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BROKEN PROMISES                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	Temperatures below freezing point in winter are nothing new for the people of Darjeeling. Neither are broken promises. Subash Ghisingh took the people for a ride when he promised them Gorkhaland and ultimately settled for a life of comfort for himself. Bimal Gurung, Roshan Giri and other leaders of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha broke away from him, forced him out of the hills, and told the people that they were their real messiah and will not stop at anything less than a separate state. Now the Morcha seems prepared to shelve the agitation and settle for an autonomous council, which the state government had been insisting on for a long time, and which it was not prepared to accept. Of course, the GJM leaders will say that the proposed council will only be an interim arrangement and Gorkhaland still remains their goal. But there are unlikely to be many takers for this story. The Morcha leaders cannot have missed the fact that Ghisingh had also said the same thing while ensconcing himself in Lal Kothi, and then forgotten all about it. So it is yet another winter of discontent and resignation for the Nepalese, Bhutiyas and Lepchas.        
	Right now, they can only keep their fingers crossed about what shape the interim council will take. Whatever the plans, Siliguri and parts of the Dooars will have to be kept out of it because of objections not only by the state government but also by the Congress which, with the elections round the corner, cannot afford to be blamed for conceding more than is strictly required. Even the member of parliament from the Bharatiya Janata Party, Jaswant Singh, is unlikely to be of much help as his leader, L.K. Advani, had earlier said that he was against a new state on ethnic lines on the borders. The Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad also does not want any interference in its areas from the hills. So it seems certain that the GJM will have to forget about an expanded territory. People may well ask  what was the renewed agitation all about then?                
	Considerable relief        
	What is particularly worrying for the GJM is that it no longer calls the shots in the hills, something Ghisingh did when he came to terms with Calcutta. The murder of Madan Tamang has galvanized the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League into action, and it has by its side not just the Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists but also the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist). To make matters worse for the GJM, Ghisingh has began to flex his muscles after lying low in Siliguri for a long time. Little wonder then that the GJM wants the interim council to be an appointed body, with itself playing a big role in the appointments, rather than an elected one.        
	Meanwhile, there are signs that normality is creeping in. When the inspector of Darjeeling sadar police station arrested 24 youths from Chowrasta for smoking in public, he was doing his duty. But it is doubtful whether he could have done that even six months back, when any such administrative action would have been met with a bandh call. The change is welcome  it indicates that the GJM is not sure about its sway over the people. The hill people are also becoming vocal against bandhs at the drop of a hat and at the prolonged spells of forced government non-functioning that have only brought them misery.        
	But thats about the people in general. It cannot be anybodys claim that all have lost interest in Gorkhaland. For one thing, agitations in support of it have always brought personal profits to those who join them. What is more important, leaders of local outfits would not know what to do if the demand is totally given up. So permanent peace will continue to elude the hills even if increased autonomy ends the present impasse. For the time being, of course, that will be of considerable relief.

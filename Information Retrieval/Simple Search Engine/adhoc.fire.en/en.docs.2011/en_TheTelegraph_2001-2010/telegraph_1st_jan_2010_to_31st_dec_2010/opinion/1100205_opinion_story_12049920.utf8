	New shock                  
	Sir  We were deeply shocked and pained to read Ashok Mitras article, Influencing people (Jan 29). We are not questioning the use of big money and power in managing scandal and shielding the guilty by some big shots in the Congress after Sujata Sarkars tragic death in Calcutta in the 1930s. We are aghast that the victim of the tragedy, a 21-year-old girl who died while her pregnancy was being terminated and who had no voice in the subsequent police inquiry, legal proceedings and scandal management, is described by one of the most distinguished critics and writers of our times as a poor girl who had to pay with her life for perhaps wanting to own a Murshidabad  not even a Benarasi silk sari.          
	It has also been said that Sarkar belonged to the bevy of comely girls who would provide company to the sophisticated and rich bachelors for the lure of an expensive shawl or a gold necklace or an evening bag imported from Paris and perhaps the offer of some cash too. Could girls only be bought as commodities for pleasure? Or like their brothers who came from mofussils to study, did they also have the right to explore the big city and have a good time at parties if they so wished? Is it only men who need fun and have the right to tell salacious stories?          
	We learnt about the case from the sister of Sabitri Dasgupta from Sarkars hometown, Dhubri. Both Sabitri and Sujata had come to Calcutta to study the same year. Sabitris sister remembers Sujata as a very good-looking and soft-spoken girl with an elder brother who loved to hang around the rich and the powerful. It was he who would show his sister off at the parties thrown by the group of eminent bachelors, who succeeded in sealing all lips after Sarkars death.          
	Such cases are not rare, and it is not necessary to know a victim or her family in order to take a stand on the way they are reported. We could not agree more with Mitras statement that politicians with money can silence the truth today; they did the same thing three-quarters of a century ago. But have writers and opinion-makers changed within this time with regard to the way they cruelly stereotype women who are seen with men not related to them either by blood or marriage?          
	Yours faithfully,        Sipra Mukherjee,
  Swati Ganguly,
  Sarvani Gooptu 
  and Sarmistha Dutta Gupta, Calcutta                    
	Sir  The insensitivity displayed in Ashok Mitras article is appalling. When he says, A police officer... should he, maybe in a slightly inebriated condition in a party, pass his palm across the rump of an unwary lady, that will be the end of the road for him, what does he mean? That ladies should remember that they are to be seen, touched and felt, but not heard? And, in accordance with the mores of ladylike behaviour, keep quiet about unwelcome sexual advances?          
	It is surprising that an intellectual of Mitras standing is unaware of the impact that sexual harassment has on women. K.P.S. Gills behaviour, for example, did not spell the end of the road for him at all. He went on to win laurels, is seen as a tough and effective officer, and constantly speaks in public about fighting terrorism. Even two decades after the pass Gill made at a party, eminent intellectuals continue to write in his defence and trivialize the issue of sexual harassment.          
	And then Mitra writes of a young college student who died of a botched abortion in Calcutta early in the 20th century. In a distasteful, salacious way he writes of the circumstances that led to her death. He talks of the way the media then reported the scandal, how everyone knew who the woman was and what happened to her, but how the powerful and influential men who contributed to the fatal circumstances were left unnamed.          
	Mitra has compounded the injustice that society and the media perpetrated on the woman all those years ago. He has named her, painted her as this ingenue cheaply led astray. After all, in his view, she was just a poor girl who wanted to own a Murshidabad silk sari. And although Mitra fulminates against the men, he has left them unnamed too. So this young woman continues to be treated irresponsibly and disrespectfully by the influential sections of Calcutta.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Anchita Ghatak, Calcutta

                
	Sir  We are really shocked at Ashok Mitras approach to the case of Sujata Sarkar. Sarkar came to this city with an ambition to study. Our mother was also from the same town in Assam and studied in the same school. She also came to Calcutta for her studies a couple of years later. She knew Sarkar and, contrary to what Mitra has written, she believed Sarkar was far from being one of a bevy of comely girls.          
	Our mother remembered Sarkar as a soft-spoken, shy and very loveable person. She was used as bait by her brother, who took her to parties for his own benefit. She did pay with her life, but for what? Mitra, like many others, believes that she perhaps only wanted to own a Murshidabad... silk sari. It is very likely that the naive girl, not used to the crookednesses of elite society, fell in love with one of those eligible bachelors for which she had to pay with her life.          
	Sarkar was violated exactly three-quarters of a century ago. We feel the same has been done to her again. What is the point in publishing this story identifying the victim if Mitra does not have the courage to spell out the names of those involved? He knows that gossip did indeed whisper names but he does not even hint at the identities. We agree with Mitra that money has a silencing effect, unbroken even after three-quarters of a century.          
	Yours faithfully,        Bhaskar Gupta, Nupur Gupta 
and Sudipa Sen, Calcutta

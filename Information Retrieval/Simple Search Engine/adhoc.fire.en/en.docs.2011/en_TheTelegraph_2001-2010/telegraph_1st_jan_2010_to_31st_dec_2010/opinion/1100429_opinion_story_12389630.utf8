The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bonding over disaster
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BONDING OVER DISASTER                                  Neha Sahay                              
	Has the Yushu earthquake brought the Tibetans and the Chinese authorities closer? Reports from the site of the earthquake, a county bordering Tibet, describe the rescue efforts as teamwork between Tibetan monks and the army, both unable to communicate in the same language, yet complementing each others efforts perfectly. Inside tents, monks burnt diyas, chanted sutras for the dead and counselled survivors.        
	Outside, as soon as the armys equipment moved rubble and sensed life underneath, the monks would plunge into it to rescue survivors. Even before the army reached, monks had rushed in and started digging with their bare hands, sometimes not even aware that their hands were bleeding.        
	Their familiarity with Yushus extreme climate made the monks indispensable. At least 200 fire-fighters and para-military troops from the coastal regions had to be evacuated from Yushu within three days after they found it difficult to breathe and their lips turned purple. The monks, on the other hand, would often take over digging from the professional rescuers, seeing them breathless in the thin air.        
	The local Gyegu temple became the centre of the rescue efforts, with bodies kept there for three days. Probably to show that they care for their most rebellious minority, the Chinese government went all out to respect the victims religious beliefs. It announced that destroyed temples will be rebuilt first, and the disposal of dead bodies was done as per the monks wishes.        
	The monks brought millions of yuan in relief from their temples; but the army also requested them to distribute the relief sent by the government. For survivors, getting relief from a high priest was a bonus. Some high priests were quoted praising the government, but its the children who may never forget what the army, a symbol of suppression to Tibetans, has done for them. Three days after their school was destroyed, 60 out of a total of 165 orphans were back to class in four rooms built by the army and the volunteers.                 
	Help at hand        
	The Sichuan earthquake flattened many schools, prompting allegations about poor construction quality. Though it was not officially announced that school reconstruction would be a priority, the official in charge of relief in Yushu declared that schools here would resume functioning by the end of the month. A survivor told President Hu that more than food and clothes, what they wanted were homes and schools. Away in Brazil when the earthquake struck, the president reached Yushu after four days. The vice-premier reached on the day the earthquake struck, and the next day, Premier Wen arrived on a two-day visit, cancelling a trip to Indonesia. As he had in the Sichuan earthquake, here too, he comforted orphans, held the hands of old women, squatted with soldiers, patted volunteers and checked out blankets.        
	President Hus slogan, which he wrote on the blackboard of a makeshift classroom, making the children repeat it after him  There will be new schools! There will be new homes  made headlines. In the rest of China, sympathy for Yushu turned to resentment when government employees found voluntary donations of 100 yuan for earthquake relief cut from their salaries. Some netizens expressed anger at the scrapping of public entertainment programmes, including sports events, for the one-day national mourning a week after the earthquake.        
	Even private websites were asked to suspend music and video games. Newspapers and private websites went black- and-white; but government websites retained their characteristic red format. Asked why, the reply was: Turning it black would just be for appearances.

	Blame not                  
	Sir  The editorial, Unhomely (Dec 15), rightly questions the comments made by the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, about the connection between crimes against women in Delhi and the large number of migrants in the city. It is these migrant labourers who were responsible for sprucing up Delhi in time for the Commonwealth Games this October. Chidambarams subsequent attempt to save face by calling himself a migrant as well (Migrant PC blames amp; balks, Dec 14) does not compensate for his tactless words.          
	He even hinted at a connection between the unauthorized colonies that the migrants inhabit and unacceptable or criminal behaviour. Perhaps he is not aware of the fact that people residing in these colonies have to struggle every day to acquire even a few buckets of water. They live in such miserable conditions that it is a wonder that only a few of them resort to criminal activities. Chidambarams comments have betrayed his feudal mindset. His unfortunate words come at a time when the country is riddled with scams and corruption. Interestingly, those who live in unauthorized colonies are not the ones responsible for the corruption.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The recent comments made by P. Chidambaram, linking the rise in crime in Delhi with the influx of migrants, are representative of the mindset of the wealthy, and reflect its biases. People like Chidambaram seem to think that migrants from other parts of India are a threat to the safety of the people of Delhi. Chidambaram is unaware of the trying conditions under which these people live.          
	In 2008, the Union civil aviation minister, Praful Patel, had appealed to airlines to cut the rising costs of their tickets (Pressure on airlines to cut fares, Dec 17), and was even said to have instituted a committee that would regulate airfare. If there is a committee that works for a reduction in the prices of air tickets, to be bought only by affluent Indians, why is there no institution to regulate the hikes in the fare of buses, trains and taxis?           
	Ordinary people, for whom these are the only means of travel, are often beaten and imprisoned if they protest against price-hikes. It is only fair that a citizens committee be created to investigate the rise in the prices and tariffs of essentials like transport, water and electricity. These are things that are required daily. This will be a democratic way of ensuring that the divide between the rich and the poor is somewhat bridged. It will also prevent politicians from increasing their own salaries threefold while hundreds of people die of hunger in the streets. Once the chasm between the affluent and the needy is narrowed, our politicians might learn to speak of the people of India with more respect.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  P. Chidambaram has blamed the rise in crime in Delhi on the citys migrant population. By doing so, he has joined the ranks of Sheila Dikshit, who had blamed migrants for many of the problems of Delhi (Sheila draws flak, Dec 28, 2009). It seems that the Union home minister and the chief minister of Delhi wish to convey the message that people from other regions of India are not wanted in the city. It is unfortunate that Indians are not welcome in their own capital city. Chidambarams suggestion that these migrants are criminals is also shameful. It is true that the crime rate of Delhi is on the rise. But how can migrants alone be responsible for this? If the crime graph in Delhi is so alarming, it is due to the failure of the citys police force, which is controlled by the Centre. In an attempt to shield his government from censure, the Union home minister is putting the blame on the migrants.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Noise pollution continues unabated in Calcutta. But the police do not seem to be bothered at all about this. Blaring microphones at open-air concerts and the bursting of firecrackers during wedding processions are regular occurrences. To counter this trend, police booths have been set up in important areas of the city. But instead of stopping the offenders, policemen are often seen standing around idly and enjoying the music and the fireworks. If the police can control noise pollution on festive days such as Kali Puja and Diwali, why can they not do the same on other days as well?          
	Yours faithfully,

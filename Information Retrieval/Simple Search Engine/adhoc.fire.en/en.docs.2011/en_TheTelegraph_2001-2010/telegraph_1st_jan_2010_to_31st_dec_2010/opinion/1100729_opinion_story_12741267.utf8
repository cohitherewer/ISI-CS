	The legacy of imperialism continues to persist in not-so-subtle ways even in the age of globalization. Outright war, politely termed as military action, is still inflicted upon delinquent nations to make them behave. But war, usually, is the last resort. Before war, comes that more devious weapon, the imposition of sanctions, that is believed to cure poor nations of their intransigence. Iran, by any standards, is now a veteran of sanctions. After being recently hit with a volley of sanctions by the United Nations, it has now earned yet another set of embargoes, from the European Union this time. Iranian banks, insurance companies, oil and gas industries and the transfer of military equipment are the latest targets  all this, ostensibly, to force Iran to give up its uranium enrichment project. Yet Iran has steadfastly refused to buckle under pressure from big Western nations and carried on with its nuclear programme, which, Iran insists, is entirely for peaceful purposes. So, apart from pushing the country into deep economic crisis, the new sanctions are unlikely to achieve their intended effect.        
	If historical evidence is anything to go by, sanctions have usually spelled more trouble than led to any obvious sense of triumph. In the 1990s, at the height of the Gulf War, Iraq was not only battered by air strikes but also had its troubles exacerbated by the sanctions brought upon it. Child mortality rates in the country soared. Iraq was pushed back to a pre-industrial age after being cut off from imports and exports. However, in Rhodesia, the colonial government was ousted with the help of sanctions among many other factors. Imposing sanctions may be the middle path between resorting to military action and carrying on with diplomatic talks, but it is clearly not as smart a strategy as strategists make it out to be. Between words and warfare, covert or overt, the former remains the more sensible and sensitive option.

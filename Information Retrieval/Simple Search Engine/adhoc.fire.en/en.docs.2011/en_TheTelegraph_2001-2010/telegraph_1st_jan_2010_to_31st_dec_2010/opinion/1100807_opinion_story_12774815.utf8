	Miserable state                  
	 Sir  The increase in the number of rail accidents, bandhs, Maoist attacks and the intensity of the Gorkhaland agitation is a matter of grave concern. Neither the Communist Party of India (Marxist) nor the Trinamul Congress is taking any constructive step to solve these problems. What is required is a comprehensive, and not a populist, solution to bring the situation in North Bengal and in Jangal Mahal under control. Singur and Nandigram have already tarnished Bengals image. As a Bengali, I am saddened by the present state of affairs in West Bengal.  
	Yours faithfully,         Shiladitya Gupta, Calcutta
                  
	Pocket pinch          
	Sir  The rise in the prices of vegetables, pulses and other essential food items is the result of the faulty economic policies followed by the United Progressive Alliance government (Jargon tweak gets House running, Aug 3). Most economic policies are framed by the government to contain inflation. At present, the Centre has justified the rise in prices by citing the existing shortages and the high demand. But the government itself is responsible for the shortages in food grains. It should have put in place long-term plans to ensure adequate production and the availability of storage facilities for essential commodities.           
	Hoarders and blackmarketeers should also be blamed for the current crisis. Intermediaries  who are a part of the production and distribution chain  have also contributed to the price rise. The poor implementation of existing laws is another critical factor. Hoarders and sellers of adulterated goods are seldom punished. Moreover, there is too much money chasing too few goods as a result of embedded corruption.           
	It is neither the upper nor the middle class that is feeling the pinch. The sufferers include the poor, the lower middle class, and senior citizens who have no means to counter the price index that is spinning out of control.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
M. Kumar, New Delhi

                
	Sir  Household items are costing more with every passing day. The prices of kerosene, cooking gas, food grains and, now of electricity, are soaring. It is evident that the government has no control over prices. Even if it were unable to check the price rise, it should have thought twice before raising interest rates in banks. Neither has the government announced a hike in pension. The truth is that the government has no idea about how the poor are surviving these tough conditions. If this situation persists, people will lose their faith in the government. A nations economy has to be balanced. Otherwise, it will add to the peoples misery. Hopefully, the government will take some steps to alleviate the sufferings of the people.           
	Yours faithfully,

	True nature          
	Sir  I would like to thank Rudrangshu Mukherjee for revealing Prakash Karats true nature and his habit of running the party in an autocratic manner (My party and I, July 29). Karat is trying to emulate the authoritarian ways of Joseph Stalin, but even Stalin never used the phrase, My party. Karat seems to have forgotten that the people of this country love democracy. It is obvious that Karat will lead the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to disaster, unless the party suffers another split. There were great expectations of the CPI(M), which has been nurtured by old stalwarts like Jyoti Basu. The CPI(M) is headed towards catastrophe if Karat cannot mend his ways.          
	Yours faithfully,

	The Gilded Stage: A social history of opera By Daniel Snowman, Atlantic, Rs 1,750        
	One of the primal experiences of life, like first death or first sex, is to sit in a great theatre when the lights begin to dim for Wagners Tristan und Isolde. The talk stops, the curtain is yet to open and, suddenly, the darkness exhales four mysterious new notes, followed, after a pause, by four more. We are, in every sense, at sea. Anything is possible in the space that opens up with the first few bars of Tristan. We seem to be listening to the invention of a new sublimity, perhaps to the discovery of modernity itself. Yet, this is a modernity that reaches back through the highest achievements of music (through Beethoven, for instance) to the very origins of music, drama and myth.         
	In the Tristan prelude, we stand on the cliff of that history and look out towards a shimmering, unresolved future. But between this cliff and that horizon is the sea, for time turns into space here, as Gurnemanz sings in Parsifal. It is the sea of Wagners words and music presented to us by a specific set of people: conductor, director, singers, musicians, technicians, managers, sponsors. But it is also the sea of life, of everything that we, the listeners and watchers, bring to this preposterously ambitious and expensive work of art, the living chaos of our own histories of feeling, sensation and thought. We surrender them, for a few hours in the dark, to the manipulations of a protean genius and a rather horrid man. Marooned in that sea, alone yet in society, we somehow hold in our heads not only this Gesamtkunstwerk or total work of art, but also less elevated things  the largeness of the soprano, the squatness of the tenor, the price of the ticket, the unfamiliar feel of formal wear, the promise of people-watching during the interval, of a good dinner, a walk in the balmy night through a beautiful city with friends.         
	Opera remains immersed in the mundane even as it takes us beyond this mundanity through the power of music, words and spectacle. This is what makes it so addictive, so vulnerable to the ups and downs of commerce, and so alienating for those who are committed to the idea of accessibility in the arts. There are purists, too, who like consuming their sublime without the intrusion of the banal, like Proust shutting himself up in his cork-lined bedroom to listen to private broadcasts on the newly- invented thtrophone. Opera sometimes means sociability and entertainment, and sometimes solitude and transcendence. But, on rare evenings, these different ways of being come together when, as Daniel Snowman puts it in his introduction, everything is spectacularly right.        
	Snowmans Gilded Stage is a witty, erudite, but effortlessly readable, single-volume history of opera. It helps us sketch back in, around that quintessential operatic experience, precisely those human and historical actualities which the dimming lights and sublime music manage to drown out. As expected of a British historian whose reach goes beyond the universities into broadcasting, it is a solidly worldly book. Snowman is tempted to abolish the word, opera, which simply means a work, but has come to stand for a certain kind of grandeur, wealth and elitism that any historian of the form might feel compelled to take a stand for or against. Refreshingly, Snowman would like to banish the word, elitism, as well. He robustly marries state-of-the-art musicology to social history in order to trace some major themes through his geographically inclusive survey.         
	First, the political uses of opera, be it in the late-Renaissance Mantuan court, Napoleonic and then post-Revolutionary France, Stalinist Russia or the Third Reich, by the State, the emergent bourgeoisie or the Volk, in the Old and New Worlds or in parts of Asia. With the question of power and its display or subversion comes that of money and its management, given that operas production costs have regularly run ahead of income. So, the story of opera is also a story of spectacular bankruptcies and conflagrations (1,100 major fires during the 19th century). Then, opera is a social phenomenon too, and Snowman excels in evoking the changing nature and behaviour of audiences, patrons and performers  lusty castrati, squabbling divas and lion-taming conductors, across the centuries and the globe.         
	Germanic highmindedness is wonderfully put in place by the fact that the rudiments of the typical opera house  horseshoe-shaped auditorium ringed with boxes  are formed by putting a domed roof above the Italian piazza, teeming with life and surrounded by balconies. The darkly enchanting boisterousness of Venice (as much Volpones city as Viscontis) vies with the (occasionally spine-chilling) refinements of Bayreuth within the history of opera. In a nutshell, it is the story of the Germans trying to stop the Italians from talking after the lights have dimmed: idealism vs frivolity, opera seria vs opera buffa, Parsifal vs Papageno, Ariadnes high laments vs Zerbinettas drollery. Snowman devotes around six pages to figuring out why gay men take to opera. Because opera is often about failed love, is one of his answers. In spite of braving the Wagnerian seas, he is obviously out of his depth here.        
	With his interests ranging from changing technology (surtitles, amplification and digitization) to individual predilections (Mozarts freelancing, Beethovens wily Romanticism, Mahlers perfectionism, Toscaninis political integrity, Richard Strausss ambivalence with the Nazi authorities), Snowmans book provides a long view of operas diverse and continuing lives. But it is necessarily an outer history of opera, a social history. It needs to be supplemented by the work of operas inner historians for a fuller sense of the many levels at which opera might engage us  Nietzsche on Wagner, the fiction and essays of Proust and Mann, Claude Lvi-Strauss on the Ring, Pierre Boulezs Orientations, the work of philosophers like Bryan Magee and Bernard Williams, films like Viscontis Ludwig, Liliana Cavanis Night Porter and Fellinis And the Ship Sails On.        
	Snowman writes how, in April 1945, days before the official end of war, Bayreuth was bombed, severely damaging Wagners Villa Wahnfried. The festival theatre itself was untouched. A few weeks later, an opera-loving American soldier from the occupying force drove up to Bayreuth through a bombed-out Nuremberg. He saw that the sets for Act II of Die Meistersinger were still on stage at the festival theatre: The janitor said it was in the middle of the performance that they had come  and he pointed his forefinger significantly toward the sky. The soldier climbed onto the stage, as he had always wanted to. Wahn, Wahn, he sang from Hans Sachss great monologue in this very scene. Madness, madness                    AVEEK SEN

	Customer disservice                  
	Sir  I had gone to watch a film at Menoka recently. After the show, I went to the washroom and discovered that it was filthy. I had not expected this as tickets at Menoka cost as much as those in a multiplex. When I wanted to lodge a complaint, one of the personnel replied, Jan, jan, anek baje katha bolechhen (Go, go, you have spoken enough nonsense). When I pointed out that clean toilets are part of the service for which I had paid, they said, Aapnar moto lok dorkar nei amader (We dont need people like you). Once, I had been served soggy, unsalted fish and chips at Peter Cat. The steward said that nobody else had complained. I have lived in other metros, but Calcutta is the worst when it comes to customer service.

	Too high          
	Sir  That domestic airlines have lowered their fares by 30-40 per cent on spot rates after the civil aviation ministry and the directorate general of civil aviation cracked the whip is welcome news (Overnight air fares come closer to earth, Dec 9). However, ticket prices are yet to be what they were during the same period last year. The ad hoc measure taken by the government to set up a committee within the aviation ministry to monitor air fares is the best way to check the exorbitant prices of last-minute tickets issued by domestic carriers.           
	What really shocks are the games played by the private airlines. At booking counters, passengers desperate for last-minute tickets are made to pay a hefty sum. Low-cost airlines, in particular, are the main culprits, and such practices must be curbed at the earliest.           
	The DGCA has done the right thing by asking airlines to come clean on fares. The government should appoint an authority to mediate on every aspect of the aviation business to clean the mess that it is in.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Almost every private operator increases air fares arbitrarily. Taking note of this, the civil aviation ministry has stepped in and slashed air fares. But even the revised fares are a bit too much: very few ordinary people will be able to afford them and travel on planes. The demand and supply principle can determine prices, but airlines should lower fares further keeping in mind the interest of the people.           
	Taxes are also responsible for the hike in the price of air tickets. But taxes do not include airport charges that are levied and recovered from the unsuspecting passengers. Steps should be taken to ensure that the price of an air ticket includes all charges that need to be paid to the authorities concerned. Perhaps the ministry of civil aviation should think of fixing a single sum that will include all taxes and other charges, something like the maximum retail price, which is affixed to consumer goods.           
	Meals and snacks should be served in every airline, including low-cost carriers. The charges for the same can be included in the ticket. The authorities should also make it mandatory for airlines to advertise on their websites air ticket prices that include all taxes and charges.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Bengals political leaders block public institutions like hospitals and Metro stations very often. It is surprising how people  who claim to be champions of the masses  end up harassing ordinary citizens day in and day out.           
	Shouldnt voters question the integrity and commitment of the people they elect?          
	Yours faithfully,

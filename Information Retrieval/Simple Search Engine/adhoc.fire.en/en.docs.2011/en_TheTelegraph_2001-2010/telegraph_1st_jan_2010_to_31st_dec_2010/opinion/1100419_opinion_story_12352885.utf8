	Cruelty can go to inconceivable lengths where a woman is concerned. Maheswari, a 26-year-old woman in Andhra Pradesh, was doused with kerosene and set alight allegedly by her husband and in-laws for being fat. She had been married for three years and had continued to put on weight. Instead of trying to find out whether she was suffering from ill-health, her husband forced her to an abortion in case she gave birth to an overweight baby, and refused to let her out of the house in daytime since he considered her obesity shameful. But that did not stop him from milking this shame for gifts from her father, including furniture, a motorbike and an air-conditioner. All Maheswari could do was accuse her husband, mother-in-law and sister-in-law of setting her on fire just before she died.        
	Reminiscent of Ayesha Siddiquis statement that the cricketer, Shoaib Malik, had married and then left her because she was fat, Maheswaris murder shows that obesity has been added to the list of womens flaws. And that they can be tortured and killed on that pretext. Obesity may have its roots in a medical condition, and should at least be looked into. But while India now worships an imposed ideal of slimness, it also nurtures the old callousness towards womens health. What is startling is the vicious cruelty that is unleashed by such a minor cause. Maheswaris murder exposes the crudeness that underlies the Indian attitude to women. A new bride is a source of wealth, squeezed out of her natal family by open or covert blackmail, and she is also at the mercy of her husband and in-laws, to live and die at their will. The laws against dowry torture and domestic violence become irrelevant against this implacability. Maheswaris story would seem incredible to an outsider. Why should the way out of a marriage with an undesired partner be a hideous murder? It is as if Indians have an insatiable craving to make vulnerable women suffer and die. Ultimately it is this inexplicable perversity that has to be addressed.

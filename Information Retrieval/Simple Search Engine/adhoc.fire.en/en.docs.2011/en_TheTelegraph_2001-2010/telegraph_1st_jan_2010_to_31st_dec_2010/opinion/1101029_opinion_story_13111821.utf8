The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | hawked out
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HAWKED OUT                                                    
	Why do ordinary pedestrians not count as a vote-bank in the same way as hawkers or the drivers of autos and buses do in Calcutta? Surely, there must be more pedestrians than all the latter put together? Yet, when political parties, governments, the police and civic authorities regulate the citys street life, then the common, and most legitimate, users of the streets matter the least. The state government has now approved Bengals new hawker policy. It is expected that the policy will smoothly become a law that would give to the states more than 15 lakh hawkers and their dependants legal entitlement to the urban spaces they occupy and a better quality of life and work. Identity cards, a third of the pavement, provident fund, pension and midday meals for children are among the benefits that legality would entitle them to. Most of these sound fair enough for not just hawkers, but also many others in the unorganized sector. But is there a necessary link between enjoying these benefits and being allowed to reign undisputed on the pavements? Why can the State not rehabilitate them properly, making the city safer and less chaotic and polluted for those who live in it, including hawkers and their dependants?         
	In its unabashed pre-elections populism, the state governments move also induces a bizarre disunity among the actions of the municipal corporation, the mayoral council and the courts, all of which maintain conflicting positions on the matter, now overridden by the governments legalization. This peculiarly conflict-ridden mode of governance undermines civilized notions of the legal, the democratic and the civic. In every matter, from pollution control to regulating illegal autos, graffiti and hawkers, party-political activity provokes judicial activism, rather than being challenged by civic action. The power of the unions and parties (usually united over these issues in spite of being political opponents in every other way) compels the courts to intervene (and be ignored eventually), which, in turn, weakens the will and voice of ordinary Calcuttans in demanding from the State what they are entitled to get. This has a profoundly damaging effect on civil society, urban life and the civic ethos, apart from turning Calcutta into an unsafe and impossible city, its people ignored in their own name.

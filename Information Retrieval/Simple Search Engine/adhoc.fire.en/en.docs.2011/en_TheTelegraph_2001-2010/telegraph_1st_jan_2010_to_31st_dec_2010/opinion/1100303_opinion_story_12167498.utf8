	There were no surprises in the prime ministers statement that India was willing to walk the extra mile with Pakistan. The offer, however, came with a simple but serious caveat. India would take the extra step if Pakistan cooperated and took decisive action against terrorists. Both parts of the statement are of equal importance. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has made it abundantly clear ever since he took office for the second time that he is very keen to establish some degree of normalcy in Indias relationship with Pakistan. To achieve this end, Mr Singh is not unwilling to make some concessions. But all this cannot be unconditional. There has to be a modicum of reciprocity and responsibility from the Pakistan side. Unfortunately, no such gesture has been forthcoming. As the talks with the foreign secretaries of both countries showed, in its public posturings and rhetoric, Pakistan has shown no signs of climbing down from its high horse. One reason behind this might be the lack of any central direction in Pakistan and therefore the failure to look beyond the immediate scoring of points.        
	If lack of response is the prime ministers problem so far as Pakistan is concerned, at home he might be forced to take action against the malady that has no better name than verbal diarrhoea. Shashi Tharoor, the minister of state for external affairs, has demonstrated once again that he is incapable of holding his tongue. The most sensible and responsible action for Mr Tharoor was to let the prime minister do all the talking in Saudi Arabia. He had no obligation to hold forth on any subject. If he had kept quiet, he could have avoided the tortuous clarifications regarding the meaning of the word interlocutor. Mr Tharoor seems to be under the illusion that he is the only man in India who understands the meaning and implications of polysyllabic words. The time has come perhaps for Mr Singh to tell his junior colleague to hold his counsel and to keep his fingers away from the keyboard of his Blackberry. Otherwise, Mr Tharoor may prove to be an embarrassment to the prime minister if he isnt one already. Mr Singh has problems galore across Indias western borders, but he also has problems, albeit of a different order, across the corridors in South Block. He should not permit the latter to aggravate the former.

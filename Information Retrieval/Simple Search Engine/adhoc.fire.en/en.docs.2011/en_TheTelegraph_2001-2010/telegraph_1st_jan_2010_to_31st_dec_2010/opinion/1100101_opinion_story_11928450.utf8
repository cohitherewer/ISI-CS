	Petitions can be stranger than fiction. When D. Vikram of Coimbatore petitioned the Madras High Court because his neighbours were trying to deprive him of his pet dogs, he was evidently convinced that it was his fundamental right to keep a dog. Getting down to the fundaments is always a risky business, as he seems to have found to his cost. Generating sound and air pollution, that is, sheltering sources of barking and howling and of stench, cannot be anybodys fundamental right, the court has ruled. There was also a small discrepancy in Mr Vikrams petition. He claimed to possess a dozen dogs as pets, while inspection by authorities has reportedly revealed about 30 dogs, or at least far more than a dozen, for which Mr Vikram appears not to have a licence and which, according to irate neighbours, are bred for sale. But delving into the slightly murky doggy background would distract attention from the deep philosophical issues the case has thrown up. Animal-lovers are reportedly disturbed by the sentence; they are naturally far more exercised over the dogs fundamental rights than the mans. And the dog has a right to bark, just as a baby has the right to cry. However, they seem to be less agitated by the courts reference to stench.        
	Conflicting rights  the neighbours right to quiet against the far-more-than-a-dozen dogs right to bark in a residential locality in Coimbatore  are just the tiny symptoms of a vast, historical, perhaps pre-historic, problem, about who owns the earth. Dogs are mans best friend: humankind has carefully bred them to be so. To fight for the right of domesticated dogs to bark uncovers an interesting philosophical paradox  wild dogs, tragically dwindled in numbers in Africa, would perhaps not wait for human beings to fight for their rights. They are famous for getting what they want, swiftly and dangerously. The Animal Welfare Board of India, however, has decided to go through the court order and take suitable legal action to establish the rights of dogs. Do the dogs have a choice?

	There should be no compromise with quality when it comes to education. It is heartening that the cabinet also thinks so, although a legislation allowing the entry of foreign educational institutions into India may not be the best way of enhancing quality. The ostensible reason behind this move is no doubt noble. In a global context, Indian higher education has to catch up with exacting standards of excellence. However, the idea of excellence is itself a novelty in a country that is yet to address its dismal literacy record. With the unfinished business of primary education weighing heavy on it, India needs to be extra careful about its plans to refurbish the higher education sector. A necessary precondition for any sensible thinking on higher education is to get rid of the idea that foreign equals excellence. India is an untapped minefield of merit  thousands of brilliant students and researchers are unable to pursue their interests due to lack of infrastructure and funds. It would be worthwhile to ponder why India still lags behind in higher education in spite of a great many talents. Moreover, it may be a sign of openness to allow foreign universities to set shop in India, but how freely would these institutions be allowed to function? The struggle for autonomy is an abiding theme in the history of Indian higher education. The human resource development ministry is used to wielding its iron will over home-grown institutions, as red tape and bureaucracy continue to ruin systems of delivery and accountability. If the draft bill is anything to go by, the issue of regulation seems to remain as messily unsorted as it used to be.        
	It is only reasonable that any foreign university that wants to build a campus in India should undergo certain checks and balances. There cannot be any quarrel with the State refusing permission on grounds of national security or sovereignty, which should never be undermined. It is also well and good that a regulatory authority  the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research  would follow a checklist of clauses before giving institutions the go-ahead sign. But to allow the NCHER the power to exempt universities of its choice from scrutiny is to queer the pitch instead of creating a level playing field. Special provisions leave the door open for corruption to sneak in. India really does not need to be riddled with any more vices.

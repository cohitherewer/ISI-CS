                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EXQUISITE PAIN                              DANCE                                                
	Nothing is in our hands. Everything is predetermined, and we are puppets on the stage of life, dictated by forces beyond the orbit of our comprehension.        
	Shikhandini was a puppet, so was Amba, in her previous birth. Shikhandini/Amba was the woman who got pulled in different directions eternally. And yet, she was not given her due. The ultimate symbol of exploitation, she continues to be represented and ridiculed as the abandoned gender. This story from the Mahabharata was presented by the Upasana Centre for Dance at Rabindra Sadan on September 23.        
	Conceived and choreographed by Ashimbandhu Bhattacharjee, a gifted Kathak dancer, the entire production was soul-stirring. It was heartening to find that classical dancers are trying to explore a new approach, even while maintaining the vocabulary of a particular form in all its purity. Indeed, they are using that vocabulary innovatively in an altered context. The traditional solo presentation has been rearranged into a group performance to tell a story more relevant to our times. Ashimbandhu is a sensitive dancer who approaches his art through thought and experience. He has found a unique point of integration in his latest dance-theatre Shikhandini.        
	Starting with the inaugural scene, where a dancer wearing a mask sat at a corner of the stage, to the culminating choreographic concept, the production reflected his way of thought, directed by an ideological necessity. The musical composition, especially the use of sitar and flute, was exquisite. Well-trained dancers in a group executed patterns mainly based on the Kathak style. The accompanying teental theka lent commendable support.        
	The choreographer intelligently used his group to create and sustain the drama of the presentation instead of producing mere visual delight. Luna Poddar as Amba used her effortless grace and restrained expressions to build up her character convincingly. With soulful movements, she brought out the pathos and desperation of her character.         
	Kajol Hazra, a talented kalaripayattu dancer, is always an asset for any production. His neat, perfect and majestic movements, full of energy, revealed his solid training and made his portrayal of Yaksha memorable. His captivating presence, with a well-trained body and performative intensity, created a tremendous visual impact.        
	Saswati Sen, who lent the voice-over for Shikhandini, justified her selection. The light was aesthetically designed by Dinesh Poddar, while Luna Poddar and Neeloy Sengupta did the costume. Anutosh Mukherjees jewellery was suitably dramatic. Bimbavati Devi was excellent as Ambas voice, while Artabandhu Bhattacharjee played the role of Bhishma. On the whole, it was a professional and spectacular presentation. Ashimbandhu as Shikhandini stole the heart with his emotional performance as well as technical expertise.

	If the Indian prime minister is travelling in the East, the question of Indias relationship with China will inevitably arise even if he is not visiting China. And sure as eggs are eggs, Manmohan Singh had to field a poser on China in Kuala Lumpur two days before he is scheduled to meet the Chinese premier in Vietnam. Mr Singh used the occasion to reiterate the fundamental parameters that have informed Indias relations with China. Mr Singh shifted the premise from competition between India and China to co-operation and collaboration. The prime minister emphasized that the global space offers enormous possibilities for the two countries to work together. On the face of it, this might appear to be a restatement of the obvious but what is important is Mr Singhs effort to reduce the level of tension and animosity that have haunted Sino-India relations since 1962, and even more so after both countries emerged as powerful players in the world economy. With great tact, Mr Singh spoke of the positive aspects of the fraught relationship and avoided the controversial issues.        
	The controversial issues, however, will not go away. China continues to be Pakistans staunch ally and this affects the balance of power in South Asia. Chinas claims on Arunachal Pradesh continue to torment India. Between India and China, the latter is the bigger economic power at present and would probably be so in the near future. To curtail its dominance in Asia and elsewhere, countries like Japan and the United States of America are making special deals with India. This is bound to be of some concern in Beijing despite the proverbial Chinese inscrutability. What the prime minister was suggesting in his terse statement was that by overcoming these obvious hurdles, it is possible for India and China to work together. Indeed, some progress has been made and no one will say that Sino-Indian relations have not improved over the last decade. This provides ground for hope, but on the Indian side, there is the feeling that Chinese public postures are sometimes too provocative. There is perhaps a tussle here between the dragons flame and the elephants patience. Mr Singh, if he is sincere about reducing competition between India and China, will have to strive to achieve a major breakthrough fast. For in the long run, to use another Keynesian quip, everyone is dead.

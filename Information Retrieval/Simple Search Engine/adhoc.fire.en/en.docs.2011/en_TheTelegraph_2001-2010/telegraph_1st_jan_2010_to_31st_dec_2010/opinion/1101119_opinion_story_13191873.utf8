                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CENSOR THYSELF                                                    
	The 21st century may not have a problem with Lady Chatterley, but it is not that unbothered by Lady Gaga. There is no permanent and universal solution to the problem of censorship. The best that a modern democracy can do is to regard it as precisely that, a problem, and like all such issues, open to public discussion and debate. But when a modern State takes its role as censor for granted in an untroubled way, it is time for adult citizens to wake up to what is being done to them. So, when the Centre makes private television channels broadcast some of their shows late at night with a warning scroll, so that children may not be adversely affected by their adult content, it should be an occasion for mixed feelings. On the one hand, this is censorship, an imposition of restrictions by the State on the viewers freedom of choice. On the other hand, this might also mean that a space is being created on Indian TV  late at night and in the early hours of the morning  for the broadcasting of adult content, although the governments guidelines about this are still vague and unformed. Watching TV at home confounds the private and the public, and so the censors responsibility is shared by the family and the State. But the State does not fully trust the family in this matter. So, parental guidance must be overseen by the States paternalism. And that, together with the question of who makes the rules of decency, is the core of the problem, often leaving adult citizens furious at being treated like children by a specially empowered group of their peers.        
	This problem is by no means confined to India or the subcontinent. The permissiveness of European TV channels with regard to nudity, sex and violence, compared to American TV, continues to be discussed threadbare on the internet by both pro- and anti-censorship groups. In China, political censorship overrides restrictions over other kinds of content. The internet, with its ability always to elude censorship (sometimes with dangerous consequences, as with paedophilic content), becomes an ungovernable space in which the problems of censorship and control are endlessly stood on their heads. All modern States, India included, must exercise their critical intelligence to the utmost and never leave their own knee-jerk puritanisms unexamined. Censors must learn to be their own best censors.

                              Calling home        
	 Winter is round the corner, but Arun Jaitley may not be too keen to pack his bags and go on a holiday.Whenever Jaitley decides to go on a trip, some crisis or the other grips the Bharatiya Janata Party back home. Recently, when Jaitley was on tour, things in Karnataka took a turn for the worse. As the crisis contained legal and constitutional issues, Jaitleys intervention was deemed necessary. Consequently, Jaitley spent much of his time abroad giving advice to party leaders and lawyers on the tricky affair. And this wasnt the only time Jaitley had to combine business with pleasure. A few months back, when he had taken leave to go on a Mediterranean cruise with his family, trouble broke out between Narendra Modi and the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar. For a while, it seemed that the two allies would go their separate ways. Jaitley, one of the few BJP leaders who shares close ties with Kumar, was pressed into service and he managed to soothe the frayed nerves. Worse, having spent hours on the phone in crisis management, Jaitley usually ends up paying huge phone bills. Poor Jaitley, wherever he goes, his troubled party seems to follow him.                               
	 The Commonwealth Games may be over, but there seems to be no end to Suresh Kalmadis troubles. For a while, the beleaguered Kalmadi had been wondering why Sheila Dikshit, the Delhi CM, has turned against him. Till the last moment, when the whole of India had been criticizing Kalmadi and his co-organizers for landing the Games in a mess, Dikshit had acted as an able ally. The two leaders had worked as a team to try and put things back in order. But then came Dikshits volte-face, and Kalmadi suddenly found himself parrying uncharitable remarks directed at him.      
	Kalmadi then pressed his secret agents to find out the reason behind Dikshits turnaround and was apparently told that someone extremely important in the corridors of power had forced Dikshit to wage war against him. In return, Dikshit, reportedly, was assured that she would continue to remain CM. Kalmadi surely understands Dikshits compulsions now, as well as the fact that there are no permanent friends or foes in politics.                            
	 Politicians seldom tell the truth. Sample this white lie from HD Kumaraswamy, the leader of Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka. Recently, to keep the flock of dissident BJP leaders and independents together before the crucial trust vote in Karnataka, Kumaraswamy was seen rushing from Bangalore to Chennai and then to Goa, where the rebels had been kept in five-star comfort. The BJP accused Kumaraswamy of hijacking its members and overseeing the entire operation of splitting votes. When asked to comment, a nonchalant Kumaraswamy simply replied that he was in Goa to recuperate and enjoy the sun and sand.                             
	 According to a wag, the Ayodhya dispute is witnessing developments that would undoubtedly remind Indians of Awadhs famed pehle-aap culture. On the face of it, the three warring parties  the Nirmohi Akhara, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board-Sunni Waqf board and the Hindu Mahasabha-Vishwa Hindu Parishad  are all itching to move the apex court against the recently passed verdict. Yet, each of the contending parties seems to be waiting for the others to make the first move. The AIMPLB, despite airing strong views on the judgment, is taking an inordinately long time to study the content of the high-court order. Meanwhile, leaders of the Nirmohi Akhara have made it clear that they will not move the Supreme Court till the end of November and the Hindu Mahasabha is waiting for a clear signal from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh before going ahead with its plans. Does this mean that it will take a few more decades to settle the matter finally?                            
	 Rita Bahuguna Joshi may have managed to retain her post as Uttar Pradeshs Congress chief but she is not out of the woods yet. Both the UPCC executive and the state AICC have been packed with her opponents. But Bahuguna isnt the only one frowning. Digvijay Singh, who failed to get Raj Babbar nominated in Bahugunas place, is sporting a glum face as well.

	 The platinum jubilee celebrations of the Doon School were a grand affair. The dignitaries included its former student and Union road transport minister, Kamal Nath, the president, Pratibha Patil, Kapil Sibal and other VIPs. What was noticeable was that most of the old boys who had travelled by road to Dehradun seemed eager to have a private word with Kamal Nath. Nope, they werent exactly discussing the old times. The grapevine has it that the conversations had to do something with the quality of roads. Nath was heard assuring everyone present that things will be alright soon. But havent we all heard that before?

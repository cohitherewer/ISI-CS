	In the end, Africa could not have an unblemished run of the World Cup. On the day of the grand finale, two suicide-bombings in Kampala, Uganda, not only robbed it of its complete share of the glory, but also reminded it of the cruel realities that a month of merry-making had obscured. Together with poverty, hunger and civil war, the remnants of an unusually harsh history, Africa now has to counter the scourge of international terrorism. The two attacks in Kampala, which killed as many as 74 people, were carried out by al Shabaab, a terrorist organization in Somalia that has recently joined its agenda and resources with al Qaida. Al Shabaabs immediate target is Uganda, a nation that has handsomely contributed its troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia, which has been propping up the moderate Islamist transitional government there that the radical Islamist al Shabaab is desperate to overthrow. Al Shabaabs overland target is the United States of America, which is the major backer and funder of Amisom and also the pet hate of al Qaida. Given such a combination of common interests, it is not surprising that devious minds have met and are presently working overtime. With the aid, training and encouragement from the highly intricate network of terror organizations that al Qaida represents, al Shabaab has managed to carry out its first cross-border attack and is said to be planning several more in Burundi, Ethiopia and other countries that have tried to checkmate it. US targets, naturally, figure prominently on the list.        
	Al Shabaabs activities firmly put the Horn of Africa on the map of international terrorism. With the inclusion of local terror groups in its network, al Qaida will be able to repeat, with much more certainty than before, devastating attacks of the kind it carried out in 1998 in Africa. The established employment exchange of terrorists will also expand its field of activity elsewhere. All of this is bound to make Africa increasingly less peaceful and stable. With its frightening record of poverty, health and human-rights abuse, more violence is the last thing Africa should be looking forward to. The situation is equally grim for the US, whose war against terror is reaching nowhere near a closure. By the time the US exits Afghanistan, Africa will be ready to welcome it.

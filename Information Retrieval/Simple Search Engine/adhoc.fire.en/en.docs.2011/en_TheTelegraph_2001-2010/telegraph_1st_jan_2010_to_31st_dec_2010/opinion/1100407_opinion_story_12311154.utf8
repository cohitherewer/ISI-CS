	Q: Is it mandatory to change my surname to that of my husbands? Will there be any problem if I continue to use my maiden name?        
	Reema Bhadra, Gobardanga, North 24 Parganas        
	A: As such there should be no problem if you retain your maiden name even after your marriage since there is no law in our country restricting it. In future if you do wish to use your husbands surname you can do so by making an affidavit.        
	Q: We own a piece of land and have entered into an agreement with a developer. The power of attorney granted to the developer has a clause which states: Our attorney shall be able to enter into an agreement for sale and deed of conveyance for selling our undivided share of land together with structure in respect of the said property. What does this mean? Also, should the development agreement be registered or is it enough to get it notarised?        
	Sudip Kumar Das, Haltu, Calcutta        
	A: The clause stated in the power of attorney means that your developer shall have all rights to endorse his signature on the agreements of sale and to execute the registration of the sale deed or deed of transfer with a third party on your behalf with respect to your un-partitioned share of land along with any structure, including flat etc. It is fine to get the development agreement notarised. But the power of attorney should be registered.         
	Q: My late husband had inherited several properties through a Calcutta High Court decree. Some of them are in Calcutta while some are in Rajasthan. I have one son and three daughters. My daughters want to relinquish their right to the properties in my favour. I want to know if relinquishment is allowed. If yes, do I have to pay stamp duty on it? Can the reqlinquishment of property in Rajasthan and Calcutta be shown in one document either in Rajasthan or Calcutta?        
	Maruti Nandan, via email        
	A: A deed of release or relinquishment is required to be registered. Thus stamp duty needs to be paid. But a deed of release does not create a title to a property but is a mere renouncement of a claim against a person. It would be better if your daughters executed a deed of gift in your favour, gifting their undivided share in the inherited properties. Property in Rajasthan and Calcutta should be gifted by way of separate registered deeds of gift in the registry offices having the appropriate jurisdiction.

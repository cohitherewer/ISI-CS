                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BEYOND WORDS                                                    
	In the beginning are always words. This is how the Indian National Congress proceeds, and has done so ever since it first met in Bombay in the winter of 1885. The problem arises when a shadow falls between words and deeds. Thus both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have spoken at the plenary session of the Congress. In many ways, their speeches marked a departure from the pious sentiments that are mouthed at such sessions of the Congress. Both mother and son, especially the latter, were sharply critical of the complacency of Congress members, their propensity towards making the quick buck and the lack of sustained work at the grassroots. Ms Gandhi reiterated her confidence in and solidarity with the prime minister but emphasized that the future growth of the party would depend not on any individual, however good or great, but on the quality of work done by workers. As they stand, these words are faultless, but the question before the party and its leadership is: are they enough? Similar sentiments have been expressed before but they have not resulted in any remarkable recovery in the fortunes of the Congress. Only the very audacious would dare to suggest that the Congress will be in a position in the near future to form a government on its own at the Centre.        
	One principal reason for this is the paucity of ideas within the Congress. This plenary session was no exception. There was no discussion, going by reports, about how the growing gap between the rich and the poor would be bridged. That the interests of the poor and the common man should be looked after is a statement with which hardly anyone is in disagreement. The critical question is how to make the common peasant and the tribal person a participant in and a beneficiary of the economic growth that India is experiencing. There are millions of Indians who know nothing: how are they to be reached? The machinery of the Congress is obviously no longer able to touch the lives of such people. The Congress leadership needs to go beyond a critique of the existing system to thinking about and establishing a new mechanism that is neither closed nor opaque and is geared towards delivery.        
	In electoral terms, in Bihar, in Uttar Pradesh, in Gujarat, in West Bengal and in Tamil Nadu, the Congress is nowhere. Powerful provincial leaders have become a thing of the past; now everyone drinks at the Delhi fountain. But the problem is deeper than losing or gaining votes. There are places in India where the credibility of the Congress is less than zero and where the penetration of its organization is non-existent. It cannot be expected that Mr Gandhi will be everywhere all the time. Yet the Congress moves, maybe out of the inertia of 125 years.

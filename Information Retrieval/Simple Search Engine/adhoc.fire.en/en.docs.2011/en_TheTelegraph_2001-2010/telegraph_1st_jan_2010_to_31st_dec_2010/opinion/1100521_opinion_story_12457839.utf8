                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LOOK FORWARD                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Born 125 years ago, the Congress is planning a grand, nationwide celebration. There is much to speak of regarding the achievements of the party till the Forties of the last century  from the strategy to liberate India from colonial rule to the culmination of those many sacrifices that led to Independence on August 15, 1947. But, thereafter, a systemic decline set in that has resulted in social and economic fragmentation, exclusive, uncaring governance, all of which has led to unimaginable anarchy for those who are not the privileged few in politics, administration and the corporate world. The citizenry has been exploited, treated inappropriately, with no concern for its basic need of an adequate and functioning infrastructure. Corruption has overwhelmed this country, suffocating it to a point of no return. This is not a whine about nothing working, it is the sad truth about a modern and young nation state that did not reconstruct new laws to administer its own people, and ended up exploiting them, as the colonial rulers had done. The burra sahibs continued to rule, and 63 years down the line, despite an attempt to enforce affirmative action and bring in some social equality, the same exploitative rule continues.        
	There is something in the DNA of those who get elected that makes them forget the horrors that they had to climb out of, the exploitation they and their forefathers had to endure, something that makes them all alike regardless of caste, class, creed or faith, when they assume office. They just do not care. They are shamelessly colonial in their attitude, and in their strut, in their trappings, they demand to differentiate themselves from their people. The police treat civilians like dirt, administrators operate with unacceptable arrogance, politicians treat the country like a feudal fiefdom, and the citizens of India, from top to bottom and sideways, are victims of this untenable horror. Our erstwhile colonial masters have changed and moved on. They have reinvented themselves, their institutions, and their mindset.                
	Renew the pledges        
	The Naxalite movement and other such protests are a direct result of gross maladministration and unfailing corruption at every level, except when goods and services have to be delivered to the rulers and their babus. Free housing, and all the other freebies that come with office have degenerated the service class into parasites who have chewed the cake and not distributed it. Whatever growth there has been is because of the spirit of India, the resilience of its men and women, the patience of its youth, and their incredible ability to beat the system by bypassing it. This creative energy, both intellectual and physical, has been neglected and abused.        
	Instead of conducting a fake and flimsy poll on the record of 125 years of the Congress, the leaders of this party need to renew and activate a series of pledges. For example: there are undemocratic police acts that defeat any humane liberal position in this day and age which need to be removed from the statute. Acts that were set in stone in the 1800s, the Indian Telegraph Act for instance, must be rewritten immediately to deal with the life and needs of citizens in the the new millennium. Government spending on itself must be reduced by two-thirds.        
	On the political and party front, backtracking on the womens bill, to cite one example, must not be permitted because alliance partners have begun the process of political blackmail. The United Progressive Alliance government should stand by what it believes, be prepared to run a minority government as it has done in the past, be firm in its convictions, and cease to take advice from all those failed individuals who are unable to win their elections, who are the parasites that live off the status quo, buying and selling. Can India look forward?

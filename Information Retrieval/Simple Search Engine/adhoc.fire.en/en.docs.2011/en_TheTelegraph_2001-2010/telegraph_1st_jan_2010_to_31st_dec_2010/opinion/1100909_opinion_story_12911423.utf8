	Ranil Wickremesinghe was not on a holiday in India. In Chennai this month, he sought Indian assistance for agriculture in northern Sri Lanka and promised to hear out all stakeholders to resolve the ethnic problem.        
	But should he not have been in Sri Lanka, where, as leader of the Opposition, he could have tried to build up a public protest against the Mahinda Rajapakse administrations attempt to pass the 18th amendment? After all, Wickremesinghe has always opposed executive presidency and its unbridled powers. Given that the government was so close to passing the 18th amendment bill  which, among other things, would give his political opponent the right to rule in perpetuity  was he not expected to strain every sinew to stop it?        
	No. Despite the fact that the 18th amendment would end Sri Lankas liberal democracy and deprive democratic institutions (including the judiciary and the election commission) of the right to function impartially and independently, the main opposition party in the country hardly seemed to be making an effort to defeat the governments diabolical designs. There was no consistent attempt at building up public opinion. A few posters and the Sri Lankan medias hyperventilation apart, there was nothing to indicate that anything momentous was in the offing. Even now, there is scarcely much public awareness on what the amendment is all about. The public demonstrations are either by hardened political cadre or by lawyers.        
	It is not that the Opposition had had no time to get its act together. Yet, strangely, it seems to have competed with the government in keeping all deliberations on the 18th amendment away from the public glare. Wickremesinghe was seen meeting the president, apparently to carry out negotiations on the amendment, but nothing much was made public about the tte--tte. Rajapakse now claims that much of the idea of the amendment had come from Wickremesinghes United National Party.                
	Individual politics        
	But why had the Opposition looked so secretive and self-absorbed when it could have made a valiant effort to shame the government and defend the constitution? As things stand now, the opposition parties seem to have been preoccupied with a matter closer to their skin than the nation.        
	The matter will be made clear if one looks at the desperate excuse that Shafeek Rajabdeen, the national organizer of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, made while explaining the partys last-moment decision to support the amendment after opposing it all along. Its eight legislators helped the ruling alliance achieve the two-thirds majority it would require to pass the bill. Rajabdeen, said, If we dont support... [the United Peoples Freedom Alliance] will surely break our party. Party politics is much more important than individual politics.         
	Opposition legislators have fallen like nine pins to the enticements offered by the ruling UPFA. Even if a party the size of the UNP could survive mass defections (as in 2007), smaller parties like the SLMC cannot. So they have made a judicious choice  sacrifice national interest (which Rajabdeen believes falls within the purview of individual politics) to save the party.        
	Wickremesinghes UNP, too, has made a choice: not to make an issue of the amendment and allow legislators to vote as their political canniness dictates  if that is all that is required to keep them in the party. After the Sarath Fonseka debacle, another mass defection is the last thing that the UNP could look forward to. But since such calculations could not be made public, it decided to keep the haggling on the amendment as far away from the people as possible. Who knows, Wickremesinghe may have even shed a few tears in India over the passing away of individual politics.

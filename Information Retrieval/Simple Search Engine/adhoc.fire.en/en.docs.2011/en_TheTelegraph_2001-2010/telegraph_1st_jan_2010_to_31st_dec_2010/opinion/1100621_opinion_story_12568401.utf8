	Striking back                  
	Sir The recent operation by the joint forces that demolished a Maoist camp inside the Ranja forest near Lalgarh and killed eight insurgents shows what the security forces are capable of in this war against the Maoists (Forces kill 8 guerrillas in night assault, June 17). The successful assault proves that by using the available resources in an efficient manner, the joint forces would be able to inflict heavy losses on the Maoists. However, the raid is likely to bring about a swift and brutal response from the rebels. As an Indian, it is painful to witness this endless cycle of violence that has resulted in the loss of many lives.The government is in no mood to meet the demands of the people who inhabit the countrys backward regions. Rather, it is hell-bent on continuing this war against the Maoists who have been described as Indias single largest internal security threat. It is unlikely that the conflict will end soon or in a peaceful manner.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The joint forces have finally tasted success in their battle against the Maoists in West Bengal. It is time the Maoist rebellion is curbed and peace brought back to the affected districts. The rebels have killed countless people, caused a horrible train accident and disturbed the peace in many places of the country. Much blood has already been shed, and more will be spilled till the Maoist scourge is erased.          
	It is surprising to learn that most members of the Maoist cadre are of a young age. It is evident that the lack of education and limited access to basic amenities compelled them to commit these heinous acts. The spread of Maoism indicates the lopsided nature of development in India. While a few states and most cities continue to flourish, people living in vast swathes of the hinterland remain below the poverty line. Illiteracy and the lack of jobs have forced these people to tread the evil path.          
	The government must work to spread the light of education to every nook and corner of India so that ignorance can make way for all-round development.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Closer ties          
	Sir  Brijesh D. Jayals superbly scripted article, To work on a friendship (June 16), provided a useful commentary on the nature of the present relationship between India and the United States of America. The pattern of relations set since the time Bill Clinton visited India has assumed a new dimension, despite the disquieting developments in some parts of the world that have affected both nations.          
	Sceptics might wonder whether the first strategic dialogue between the two countries will lead to substantial changes in mutual ties. But optimists will argue that the dialogue definitely yielded some positive results. To start with, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, was sincere in her endeavours to make the visiting Indian delegation feel at home. When President Barack Obama, who attended the dinner hosted by Hillary, announced that he would visit India soon, the Indian delegates cheered profusely.          
	The Indian foreign ministers emphasis on the need for reciprocity in addressing mutual concerns suggests that strategic partnerships entail something more than the usual reassurances exchanged during diplomatic visits. However, Obama can hardly be expected to drastically change Americas existing policy on India. His colleagues seem to favour the traditional position of viewing Americas ties with India vis--vis its relations with China and Pakistan.          
	The US perceives India as a regional player, as New Delhi does not have a long-term strategic vision that can help it exert serious global influence in the future. Even its Asia policy is fixated on China and Pakistan. The US wants India and Pakistan to set aside the ticklish issue of Kashmir, so that both countries can concentrate on expanding trade and commerce. This point is well taken, but India has the right to express its reservations, given Pakistans belligerence and noncooperation.          
	US officials, besides lending support to Indias role in Afghanistan, have rubbished Pakistans trumped-up charges of India playing a subversive role in the strife-torn country. This may be considered as good news, but the Indian think tanks weaknesses, when it comes to engaging in in-depth strategic analyses, cannot be overlooked. Moreover, the government prefers to maintain a studied silence on matters of international import and is unwilling to take the public into confidence. It must be admitted that the strategic dialogue has boosted Indo-US ties. But Jayals caveat that India must not allow itself to be treated as a vassal by the US makes a lot of sense. If India and the US are natural allies, their alliance must be converted into a mutually beneficial partnership. Else, a mere strategic dialogue is likely to draw a blank.                    
	Yours faithfully,

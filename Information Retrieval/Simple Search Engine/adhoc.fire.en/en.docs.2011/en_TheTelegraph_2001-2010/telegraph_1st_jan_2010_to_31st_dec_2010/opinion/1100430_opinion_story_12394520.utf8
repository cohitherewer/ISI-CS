                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO SUBSTANCE                                                    
	India is full of silly people. That might have been dismissed as Indias special misfortune if they had not been taken seriously. Their presence looms so large that those with respectable IQs cannot express their opinions without being forced to contend with them at some point in their lives. The Tamil actress, Khushboo, suddenly achieved national fame by having remarked in the course of a talk on AIDS awareness that women who have sex before marriage should protect themselves from sexually transmitted diseases and from pregnancy. Silly people, together with other silly people motivated by business competition  Ms Khushboo was an anchor on a television channel  immediately kicked up a rumpus, claiming that she had defamed Tamil women. Then they went to court. The Supreme Court has at last quashed 22 cases filed against the actress in 2005.        
	That the silliest people should have a say is certainly part of democratic culture, just as the free expression of opinion is also a very significant part of the same culture  as long as it does not incite one group against another. That is one of the arguments given by the court in quashing the cases, but the question is, why should the court have to say this at all? The substance of the cases against Ms Khushboo, bringing charges of licentiousness, evil influence and opposition to that strange creature called Indian culture, did not seem to deserve the courts attention. This is not the first time that the higher judiciary has had to say that there is nothing wrong with live-in relationships or sex between consenting adults. And that people are meant to have different opinions. Where does law come into all this? With its enormous backlog of cases, the justice system is strained to its utmost. The courts time is precious; the court itself should screen out cases that waste it. Or get them over with in a couple of days. Instead, it has taken years to quash these cases, which is all the more amazing because there is virtually nothing to be said except a few platitudes. The court takes on many issues that should be the responsibility of the administration, such as the environment or the distribution of food. There it might be argued that the administration is not doing its job, so the court has stepped in. But that is not the situation in Ms Khushboos case. Giving silliness so much importance would merely encourage the rest of India to be sillier.

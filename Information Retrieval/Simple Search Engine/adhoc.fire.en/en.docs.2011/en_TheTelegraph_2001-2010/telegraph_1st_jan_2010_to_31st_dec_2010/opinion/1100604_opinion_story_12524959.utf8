	PICASSO By Philippe Dagen, The Monacelli Press, $150                  
	In the epilogue to this brilliant exploration of Picassos life and art, Philippe Dagen, best known as a critic for Le Monde, concedes that one cannot come to conclusions about Picasso but only admit that the subject is inexhaustible. Dagens admission brings out the strength of this book. Never for a moment does he get carried away by his erudition. On the contrary, he is always willing to let his intellect be harnessed and humanized by a self-effacing humility. Even as he extensively refers to art history, Dagen does not lose sight of the mercurial personality behind the mask that Picasso often put on with effortless ease. To his credit, he avoids the easy temptation to read Picassos work in relation to his chequered life by refusing to endorse the critical fixation with the artists amorous, often amoral, activities, and with his many tempestuous affairs.        
	So, instead of narrowly focusing on either the life or the art, Dagen attempts a historicist reading of Picassos career, situating him in a political, social, economic and anthropological context. The result, to borrow a phrase from Clifford Geertz, is a thick description of Picassos life, of the ways in which various histories  of nationalism, internationalism, communism, Stalinism, the two World Wars, the Holocaust, the Spanish Civil War and the Cold War  are seamlessly woven into the texture of his art. Beginning with Picassos absorption in the classical methods of Raphael, Rembrandt, Velsquez and the Impressionists, Dagen charts his evolution into an artist of outstanding originality, who drew, painted, sculpted or experimented in crazy abundance. Yet, as Dagen demonstrates, it is notoriously difficult, if not misleading, to interpret the growth of the artists mind as a linear progression of ideas and patterns. If anything, Picassos own notion of development implied quite the opposite. He envisioned the artist as standing between two mirrors that face each other and... reproduce his image in an infinite regress. He elaborated: One imagines that one is looking at the succession of images in one mirror as extending into the past, while his real image is considered to be his present condition. One doesnt realize that these are all the same image one after another. While expounding the theory of the continuity of selves, Picassos exemplar brings into sharp focus the tussle between the past and the present, illusion and reality, and memory and desire.        
	Picassos frenzied pace and volatile creativity make a neatly historical evaluation of his oeuvre practically impossible. He refused to adhere to one single idiom or style at any stage of his career. The celebrated Blue Period, filled with a deep, brooding melancholy, comes right after a boisterous spell of documenting the Parisian high life of Proust, Toulouse-Lautrec and Matisse, reaching its pinnacle in Picassos own version of Le Moulin de la Galette (1900). In 1901, Picassos friend, Carles Casagemas, with whom he shared a studio, shot himself dead after being jilted in love. Picassos tribute, painted with thick impressionist strokes, captures the bullet wound on his friends temple with disturbing clarity, alluding unmistakably to van Gogh, who had also put a bullet through his head in 1890.        
	In the works of the Blue Period, with the profusion of suffering humanity, one discerns the despair of van Goghs stricken peasants and potato-eaters amidst echoes of Moorish Spain and the impeccable touch of Zurbarn. As Picasso lived for a year in extreme financial difficulties through these wet paintings, blue and pitiful like the damp deep of the abyss (Guillaume Apollinaires words), he started shedding the burden of traditions by internalizing the very idioms he had wanted to outgrow. He did not conform to any one school, nor did he declare an affiliation to any one master. Instead, he subjected his imagination to a rigorous process of purification to arrive at the starkly disjunctive syntax of the Blue Period. In La Clestine (top, left), the inexorable force of several styles of European portraiture  from Vermeer to van Gogh  reaches an apotheosis of sorts.        
	If the pain of life is condensed in La Vie (1903), then the monsters of the mind are unleashed in the outburst of broken, twisted forms that follow shortly. As Dagen suggests, Picassos insistent return to brutally pornographic scenes of sexual violence was a deliberate attempt to paint an inverted image of the liberated woman. More than a century after the publication of Mary Wollstonecrafts A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), France, at the turn of the century, was yet to become the liberals haven. Second Sex (1949) and the wave of Womens Lib that followed in its wake were far away. Picassos fascination with low life, his sojourns into seedy Parisian alleys, and infatuation with prostitutes exposed him to a harrowing range of experiences that was absorbed into the structure of his art. Beginning with the shockingly candid images of menstruating girls, Picasso took the idea of violation to a different level. Rape does not only manifest itself as physical assault. The artist violates his models in sinuous ways, denying them all privacy  even girls at their toilette are not spared  and making them subservient to his voracious gaze. Picasso would develop this theme at length in the Suite Vollard.        
	To unleash this violence, the artist must twist and turn every sinew of his subject, an impulse that lies at the roots of Cubism. With his lingering preoccupation with sex, death and disease, it was only natural for Picasso to feel perversely attracted to the grotesque and the uncanny. His cubist women are an odd synthesis of Eros and Thanatos. For them, motherhood is a curse, pleasure leads to sickness. Shattered beyond recognition, each of them is a memento mori. It is as though Picasso banishes every perspective, breaks all forms with a monomaniacal intensity, to recreate the body, de-boned and dangerously pliable. From his horrific kissers (top, right) to the aggrieved weeping woman (bottom, right) to the figure by the sea (bottom, left), he trained his gaze to look into the dark night of the soul.        
	Given his obsessive interest in sexual biomorphism, exotic Negro art, and psychosomatic maladies, Picasso made an inevitable transition from the gestural intensity of painting to the sensuous vigour of sculpture, as seen in Head of a Woman (left). Living in the age of photography  Brassa, Cecil Beaton, Paul Strand and Man Ray were his close friends  it was also clear to him that photography has developed enough to free painting from... subject matter... a certain aspect of the subject now belongs to the domain of photography. So after epochal events, like the destruction of Guernica or the massacre in Korea, he attempted ambitious projects, perhaps to surpass the hegemony of photography. And each time he produced the most sublime work, making us behold the unbelievable and believe it despite ourselves, as Andr Breton put it.                                                          SOMAK GHOSHAL

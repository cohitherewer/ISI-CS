The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The shining brass pole
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE SHINING BRASS POLE                          - In Calcutta, there is more for money to buy, less to enjoy as a right        Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                                                        
	We were entranced by the legend of the shining brass pole. It was supposed to run top to bottom in the Fire Brigade headquarters so that when the alarm sounded, athletic young firemen saved precious minutes by sliding down its polished surface to leap into waiting tenders  damkal  and rush clanging to the rescue.        
	Other traffic stopped immediately. Children rushed to see the exciting spectacle of red vehicles with standing men holding on to a horizontal rail, one of them clanging away at the gleaming brass bell. One reason for fantasizing about the service was a man whom we knew only as Fire Brigade Das Gupta. He had been in England with an uncle, and living nearby, often gave us a lift to school. I didnt know his position but his crisp khaki, polished leather and bright brass made him the most smartly kitted out man in our world. I imagined the entire crew to be equally lean and trim, and as nattily turned out, all sliding down that unseen but smooth and shining brass pole.        
	I had seen them in action. Visiting from Lucknow during the great famine, we were guests in a flat in Entally when the meter box caught fire. The engines were there even as we rushed out under the licking flames. Why do meter boxes of tatty wood and grimy net with festoons of wire and cobweb have to be next to the front door? Thats still the usual place in most middle-class apartment blocks.              
	I dont know who informed the fire brigade that time but, later, I became familiar with a sturdy red pillar-box at the corner of Lower Circular and Ballygunge Circular roads with a round glass pane where a letterboxs opening would have been. Behind the glass was a brass handle. The sign outside read, In case of fire break glass and turn handle. Walking past it every day after school, I wondered how they would know in Free School Street where the fire was if someone did smash the glass and turned the handle. There was no speaking device I could see. It would have been different if the city were dotted with alarm mechanisms that each lit up a bulb at headquarters to indicate location like the bells to summon peons in my old office did. But I never saw another pillar-box.        
	One day the glass was smashed and the brass dented. It looked like vandalism. Beckbagan and Karaya, not salubrious addresses in those years of change and uncertainty  1946, 1947, 1948  were only a whisker away. The telephone receiver I saw a few days later thrust into the round hole from which the bits of jagged glass had been removed suggested improvisation. But I also thought it an improvement. Presumably one could speak into the receiver to a switchboard manned round the clock. The sense of assurance was shortlived. The receiver vanished, again leaving a gaping hole. Then the pillar was removed. I didnt see any digging. One day it was there like the Maidans immutable British statues; another day it had gone. I wondered how people raised an alarm if a fire broke out.        
	Calcutta has undeniably undergone many improvements. An efficient underground railway belies the old conviction of swirling waters just below the surface. There is far less flooding in areas that were regularly inundated. Fancy bars and restaurants cater to fat wallets if not to sophisticated taste. After visiting one of our glittering malls, an English friend fumed he hadnt come all this way to pay inflated prices for things he could pick up cheaper in London. But much has also gone and the qualitative difference between what we have lost and what we have gained is revealing. Theres more for money to buy, less to enjoy as a right.        
	An old friend visited me the other day after a gap of more than 40 years for he lives in Brussels and his visits back are spent mainly in his ancestral home in North Bengal. His most compelling memory of Calcutta is the sound of streets being hosed down at dawn. An American sociologist told me that several Bengalis had mentioned that to her. The steady whoosh of gushing water  we used to frighten my infant brother it was the juju man  was like the damkals clanging bell: both signifying service and stability.        
	Losses include much that an individual cant buy. Like pavements that are wide enough (cluttering is another matter) to walk. Well-kept parks to which people have unlimited lawful access, not as guests of corporate custodians. Street hydrants that work. Tubewells that save modest households the cost and trouble of purifying drinking water. Wholesome milk. Trams with fans and upholstered seats. Bad service negates even institutional gains: no one ever answers the maintenance telephone number for VSNLs broadband internet.        
	There are alternatives to VSNLs broadband just as there are alternatives to VSNL telephones. But private arrangements for water, power and garbage clearance, the last by paying corporation jemadars to collect domestic refuse, come expensive. Inefficiency rather than ideology drives coach and horses through Galbraiths post-office socialism which courier services have made almost redundant. Everything can be arranged  semunya bisa diatur, as the Indonesians say, when everything collapses.        
	I had a sanctioned plan to build a bungalow that I submitted for updating and never got back despite letters, telephone calls and personal appeals. Then I went abroad and forgot about it. But if the Israelis can clone British, French and German passports, theres nothing that ingenious municipal architects cant do with my plans authentic seals and signatures. It might even have legitimized some deathtrap of an illegal building by a successor of the tribe that Jawaharlal Nehru threatened to hang from the nearest lamp post but didnt. Money buys everything when greed is the only motivation.        
	Ironically, Jolly Mohan Kauls lament that the comrades with whom he set out in search of a better world have turned from being champions of the poor, the workers and the peasants, to becoming protectors and promoters of the interests of the richer sections of society echoes the last person he would wish to be clubbed with. In one of his regular diatribes against independence, Winston Churchill warned that though liberty was mans birthright, rascals, rogues and free-booters would strangle free India and make money from every bottle of water and loaf of bread.              
	No damkal has clanged into my orbit for many years. Perhaps no damkal can cope with Calcuttas congestion. Apart from the occasional ministerial motorcade, the only emergency warnings in the street nowadays are of battered ambulances packed with chattering hospital staff and government cars taking the wives and children of officials shopping, visiting or pandal-hopping during the Pujas. Lee Kuan Yew told a high-powered Bombay gathering that one reason why Singapore had abolished distinctive car lights, flags and sirens was that any political party whose men are instantly recognizable tends to lose elections. I suppose the counter-argument here would be that bureaucrats are the handmaidens of whichever party happens to be in power; they are even now eyeing the distance to be leaped between the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Trinamul Congress.        
	Fire Brigade Das Gupta must be long dead. For all one knows, modern firemen have followed the policemen stumbling along in the Republic Day parade, pot bellies quivering, to derisory chants of Chowanni! from little boys lining Red Road. No self-respecting constable would consider a bribe of four annas, even if the coinage had survived, but the nickname sticks. I wonder if the brass pole  if it ever existed and was not part of boyhoods romantic nonsense  is still there. If so, I also wonder if any eager fireman slid down it on that fateful Tuesday of last week.

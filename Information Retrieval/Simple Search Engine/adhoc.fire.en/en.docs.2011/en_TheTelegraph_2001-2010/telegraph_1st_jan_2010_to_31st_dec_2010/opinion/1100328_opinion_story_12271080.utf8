	 The new chief of the Bharatiya Janata Party has got going with gusto. To let all and sundry know about what he is up to, seven spokespersons have been appointed, including Ravi Shankar Prasad. Three of them are new faces, and the party is trying its best to keep the men busy. Every day, they hold press conferences in the capital as the BJP leadership has made it quite clear that media interaction is mandatory. But the problem is to get the men sing the same tune. On any given day, many apprehend, there may be seven men speaking in at least seven different voices. Things seem to be getting worse since one nominated spokesperson, Shahnawaz Hussain, has already expressed his dissatisfaction over the role given to him. His recent admission to a hospital was supposed to register a loud protest. It is not known if he received any get-well messages from the high command.                
	 A booklet on the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s late patriarch, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, was to be released last Tuesday. It was compiled by the top leadership of the party in the capital, but not many knew about it, not even, allegedly, members of the politburo and the central committee. The book release function was dominated by the star couple of the party  the Karats. There were murmurs of dissatisfaction over the fact that the booklet ignored the formation of the first United Progressive Alliance government and the contribution of Surjeet to the process. One senior politburo member is supposed to have said later that leave alone the books content, he did not even know about the function till a phone call came on the morning of the event. Friction out in the open?                             
	 The Delhi police recently arrested a cobbler of some repute. He, apparently, polished shoes outside Jawahar Bhawan, the headquarters of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. The man had allegedly duped several ticket-seekers, promising to make them MPs or MLAs. He had also flaunted patents to polish shoes of the residents of 10 Janpath and displayed sandals, claiming they had adorned the feet of the scions of the Nehru-Gandhi family. Trust a clever man to stitch fantastic yarns.                            
	 A remarkable change seems to have taken place in the demeanour of Indian politicians. They no longer look at the camera while talking; they look away from it. Apparently, Satyavrat Chaturvedis experience has taught our netas this new trick. Chaturvedi was sacked from his post as Congress spokesperson after a news channel showed him using unparliamentary language against Sharad Pawar. Dodging nosy cameras is thought to be an easier option than making changes in the vocabulary. In any case, there are doubts over Chaturvedis punishment, considering that he now has a swanky room to operate from in place of his earlier dingy media cell. Why trouble the tongue unnecessarily when careful eyes can do the job?                             
	 Narendra Singh Tomar, who took over as the newly-appointed BJP national gen-sec, arrived in Morena, his home town, amidst a huge controversy. Enthusiastic workers gave him a 101-gun salute that left a hole in the reputation of the party. Next, Tomar reached Bhopal, hoping the worst was over. Here, the reception  minus the fireworks  was equally grand. Tomar was pleased to see that the minority wing of the party had arranged to weigh him with laddoos. It was lunch time and Tomar could see that many of his party workers were eyeing the sweets. A considerate leader, Tomar signalled to the hungry souls that the 80 kgs of crisp laddoos prepared in desi ghee could be consumed at will, provided the first beneficiaries were women. Men stepped aside to let the women grab the goodies first. Within seconds, however, Tomar realized that the minorities had not quite warmed up to the BJP. The top two layers of the container had laddoos. The rest were filled with stones.                             
	 Two days after the womens reservation bill was passed in the Upper House, the Congresss Pratap Singh Bajwa told Ambika Soni not to be too elated with the legislation. Once Parliament was flooded with women, there would be more competition for the likes of Soni, he said. To illustrate his point, he said that Ambassador and Fiats have become redundant with new cars flooding the market. Would she want to become a Fiat, Bajwa enquired of Soni, who, obviously, wasnt amused.                      
	 Jaya Bachchan has been left high(strung) and dry by the rift in the Samajwadi Party. This was apparent when she sent out confusing signals during her interaction with women journos. First she asked all male journalists and cameramen to leave, pointing out that she was supposed to interact with women only. Next, she ordered a women scribe out for speaking on her mobile phone. Another reporter was asked to be courteous and address Sonia Gandhi by adding a respectful ji. On being asked about Big Bs dalliances with the Gujarat CM, Jaya chided the Congress for targeting her husband but insisted that Amitji was capable of defending himself. Jaya defended Mulayam Singh Yadavs distasteful remarks against women, but her praise for the man dried up when it came to his treatment of brother Amar Singh.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOME TRUTHS                                                    
	The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, prefers to keep his copybook as spotless as the white clothes he often wears. Alas, he has only himself to blame if now only his clothes are without any stain. His record as the home minister stands defaced by ugly black marks. This is because of the letter he has written to the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. It has nothing to do with the veracity or otherwise of the various charges that he has levelled against the government of West Bengal and the ruling party of the state, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The tone and the language of the letter are utterly unacceptable not only in formal communication but also in civilized society. It is amazing that Mr Chidambaram could choose to use a word like harmard in a formal letter to a chief minister of a state. It exhibits nothing other than Mr Chidambarams familiarity with words and terms that are not heard beyond the street level. He has allowed that to enter the governments vocabulary. In so doing, Mr Chidambaram has done himself a disservice and has brought disgrace to the entire process of communication between the Central and the state governments.        
	There are other reasons for describing Mr Chidambarams missive as unacceptable. His letter is openly and crudely partisan. It echoes, sometimes even in the choice of epithets, the various allegations voiced by his cabinet colleague, Mamata Banerjee, who is leading the charge of the anti-Left brigade in West Bengal. Mr Chidambaram occupies one of the most important ministries in the Union cabinet. He carries with him certain constitutional responsibilities. One of these is that he should have independent access to ground intelligence that is not contaminated by the political squabbles prevailing in any given area. The timing of his letter suggests that the home minister did not live up to this responsibility. The letter was sent a few days after Ms Banerjee spoke in a public rally against the activities of the armed cadre of the CPI(M). It is difficult to rule out the timing and the language as sheer coincidence.        
	With certain remarkable exceptions  the name of Indias first prime minister comes to mind  the chair is always more important than the individual sitting on it. It is always the duty of the individual to uphold the dignity of the chair. Mr Chidambaram has failed to do this. His intemperate language, his despatch of the letter through ordinary speed post and the failure of his office to keep the contents of the letter confidential have brought indignity to the home ministry. In this sense, the real battle is not between Mr Chidambaram and Mr Bhattacharjee but between the former and the government of India.

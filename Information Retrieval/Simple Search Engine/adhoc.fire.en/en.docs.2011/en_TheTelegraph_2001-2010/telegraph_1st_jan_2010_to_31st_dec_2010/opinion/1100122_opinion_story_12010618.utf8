	YOURS SINCERELY																																																												 By K. Natwar Singh, Rupa, Rs 395        
	Letter-writing, it need hardly be said, is a dying art. The email and the SMS are killing it. Yet very few will deny that there is something very touching about receiving a hand-written letter. A typed letter, though somewhat better than an email, somehow doesnt have the same feel. Natwar Singh was  maybe still is  an indefatigable writer of letters. I am sure he wrote letters to various kinds of people but in this volume, only a selection of the replies that he received from the great and the good are brought together.        
	What is significant is that Singh preserved these letters even though none of them covers topics of any pitch and moment. But even letters covering matters of no consequence are often important since they tell us something about the writer and about his or her relationship with the recipient. The fact that Singh preserved these letters says something about his sensibilities since preservation of letters or historical memorabilia is not intrinsic to Indian culture. It is essentially a European pre-occupation. Singh obviously has a sense of history and the place of these letters in history.        
	The pride of place in this volume is given to letters written by Indira Gandhi even though there are letters here from E.M. Forster. Despite Singhs well known love for literature, politics gets preference.        
	There are two aspects worth noting about the letters that Indira Gandhi wrote to Singh. One is her keen interest in books  this interest was a common bond between her and Singh and the latter kept plying her with books  and her lament that she found so little time to read them. The other is a little gem in a letter she wrote on August 3, 1981. I quote the particular passage in full: I feel isolated, not because of policies, the correctness of which will be seen in time as it has been before. But while the earth spins on the beauty and with method, the world of men is a hollow one, where words have no meaning and sentiments no feeling, the young have lost wonder, lan and even hope. What can a leaden-eyed civilization do? Can a flame of idealism or a vision of a better man be protected from all this cynicism, hypocrisy and hatred?        
	It is difficult to believe that the person whose name has become synonymous with cynical political calculations and with Indias only flirtation with totalitarianism could have written these lines. The lines hark back to Jawaharlal Nehru or the tone he often adopted when he felt tired and disillusioned. Nehru, of course, wrote much more extensively than his daughter did but it will be interesting if someone who has access (or someone like Singh who received letters from her) could retrieve passages similar to the one quoted. It would reveal a little-known, humane side of Indira Gandhi.        
	On All Fools Day, 1955, Forster wrote, Now I get your line about Mr [Nirad C.] Chaudhuri. I had a letter from the British Council earlier in the day. They suggested our meeting, and I replied to them that if he cared to write to me direct I should hope to fix something. Its up to him to write, I think, after the way he snubbed my poor Aziz. The hint of self-importance, even pettiness, disappeared after meeting Chaudhuri. On June 30, Forster wrote again, I liked Mr Chaudhuri  thought him so first hand and it was remarkable how much and how genuinely he was enjoying English eighteenth century homes, the pictures of Domencio Veneziano. It would have been delightful to eavesdrop on a chat between the author of A Passage to India and that of A Passage to England.        
	Singh rightly describes P.N. Haksar as the most powerful civil servant of independent India. But none of the four letters displays any sense of power because none was written when Haksar was Indira Gandhis principal secretary between 1967 and 1972. Are we to assume that Haksar wrote no letters to Singh when he held the reins of power and tried, in his own manner, to centralize power in the prime ministers office, build Indias pook establishment (RAW) and impose socialism through his Left cronies to whom he gave important jobs? Or has Singh allowed his discretion to take the upper hand?        
	There is a letter from Sharda Prasad, the well known ghost of Indira Gandhi who wrote most of her speeches and worked closely with her from 1964 to 1977 and again between 1980 and 1984. This was written at the height of the Emergency on July 20, 1975. In this letter, even the redoubtable Sharda Prasad dared not name Indira Gandhi (this person can never be despotic, he wrote). This one line speaks volumes about the fear that then prevailed.        
	The letters in this volume will be of no interest to the prurient or to those seeking sensation. Most of them are social exchanges or letters to keep in touch. There are occasional nuggets. They stand as testimonies to more gracious times when people wrote letters and replied to them. Unfortunately, we only have replies and responses to Singhs letters. What did Singh write?                    RUDRANGSHU MUKHERJEE

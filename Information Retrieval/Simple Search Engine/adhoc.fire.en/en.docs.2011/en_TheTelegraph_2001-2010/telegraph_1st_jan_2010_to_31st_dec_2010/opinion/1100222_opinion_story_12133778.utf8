                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A LITTLE TOO LATE                                                     
	It is a well-known fact that the Left Front government in West Bengal wakes up only after the proverbial horse has bolted. Having deprived a generation of school-goers of the chance to learn English, the government decided to act in right earnest only as late as 1999 when the study of English was reintroduced from Class VI. Further sense dawned in 2004, as children started learning their ABCs from Class I  though a large section of their teachers had been students themselves during that era of Left rule when English was considered to be anathema. The irony is now deepened by the sudden epiphany that English, like any foreign language, cannot be taught usefully unless reading and writing skills are supplemented by the ability to speak fluently in the language. In an increasingly Anglophone world, ones employment and professional success are inextricably tied to proficiency in English. That, in fact, is the primary impulse behind bringing English back to the classrooms  the idea is purely utilitarian, and therefore perceived to be so by both the learners and their teachers.        
	There are systemic flaws behind the policy to teach English from the primary level. So much is made of the ability to hold forth in English that children become terrified early on. They do not develop any love for the language but are only riddled with a debilitating anxiety to ape certain functional modes of speech. So the idea of having Spoken English classes alongside grammar and composition is laudable. However, having such classes just once every week makes a travesty of the idea. Indeed, it is a demonstration of sheer mindlessness. A living language is more than the sum of grammar, syntax and spellings: it cannot be taught with textbooks. Children must be encouraged to speak in English from Class I and not wait till Class VII before they start speaking a language they have been learning for six years.

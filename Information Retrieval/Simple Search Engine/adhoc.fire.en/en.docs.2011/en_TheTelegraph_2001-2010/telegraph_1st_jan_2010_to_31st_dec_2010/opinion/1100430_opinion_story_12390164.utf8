	Globalization and digitization are the two dominant trends that have changed the face of book publishing in the last decade. They are interlinked because of the rapid advance in communications and computer technologies. Now we learn that Google will make millions of digitized books from research libraries, hitherto not easily accessed, available to readers for a fee. These include out-of-copyright books (whose authors have died more than 50 years ago) as well as those recently published. Whether copyrighted books should be put online is still sub judice in the American courts, but if the issue is settled in favour of Google, the latter could become the largest library and book-selling business the world has ever known.        
	Some questions arise. Will large distributors accept digitized books at the expense of traditional printed books to make Googles attempt a success? What are its implications for book publishers and authors? Would they stand to gain financially with digitized books that could replace the traditional print format or supplement it? Moreover, would readers get digitized books at lower prices, if you factor in the cost of the computer hardware/iPad and other hand-held devices that would be required to read the digital text and the fees that would need to be paid to the publisher for accessing it?        
	As things stand, publishers are scared for the simple reason that all new technologies are, to begin with, disruptive: the traditional infrastructure would certainly become obsolete and redundant. Also, nobody quite understands the complexity of the digital future and how it will pan out.        
	On the other hand, marketing costs will come down when readers can download directly from the publisher or the author. This would eliminate traditional infrastructure costs like inventory expenses, freight and packing, returns and other multilayered incidentals like accounting and design. Prima facie, readers will pay less, authors and publishers earn more. But it isnt that simple.        
	A lot would depend on the fees demanded by publishers and authors for downloading their materials. They would ask for a hefty fee for commercial use of digitized books. The fee could take various forms  advances, or royalty against sales  and differ from book to book. Neither the publisher nor Google would be given a carte blanche for an entire list because this would cut into the backlist which is their core business.         
	Would the digitized editions of books be relevant to the needs of Indian readers and would it affect Indian publishing and distribution, which still depends on American and British books for business? While the individual buyer would see the digitized edition as yet another technological toy, some of the big libraries would clearly benefit, especially in science, technology, medicine and out-of-print books.        
	Informed and critical readers will find that the kind of books available online are mass market fact and fiction. For books of high quality on general subjects, they will have to fall back on the print editions of traditional publishers.

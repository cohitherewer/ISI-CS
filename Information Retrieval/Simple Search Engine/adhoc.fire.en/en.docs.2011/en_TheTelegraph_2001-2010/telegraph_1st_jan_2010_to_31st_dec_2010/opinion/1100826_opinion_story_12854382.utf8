The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | no, minister
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO, MINISTER                                                    
	There is a distinction  a large one, in fact  between being a minister of human resource development and being the vice-chancellor of a university. Unfortunately, the HRD minister of India, Kapil Sibal, does not know, or recognize, the difference. He announced on Tuesday with all the pomp that a Union cabinet minister can command, Were ready to hand over the degree to him [Viswanathan Anand] whenever he wishes. Mr Sibal is wise enough to know that it is not the job of the HRD minister to decide on degrees and to hand them over. The granting of degrees, across the world and even in India, is decided by those who are responsible for running universities  the vice-chancellors and the constituted bodies of every university. It now appears, from Mr Sibals own pronouncement, that he has appropriated for himself the power to grant degrees. This is an unprecedented move and it diminishes the autonomy and dignity of universities all over the country. Mr Sibal should be told what his own business actually is and then be told, in no uncertain terms, to mind it. The point, however harsh, needs to be made because it is obvious that Mr Sibal has an exalted idea of his own importance. It will be recalled that earlier in the year in a show of highhandedness he had actually ticked off the director of an IIT for errors in question papers. The minister as class monitor is a new avatar in the realm of Indian education.        
	It is possible that Mr Sibals attitude is derived from the strange name given to his ministry. The department of human resource development is the fancy and new-fangled name given to what was once the labour and industrial relations department in corporate bodies. How education was brought under its purview remains a mystery. One consequence of this may be that the present HRD minister does not see academics in educational institutions as worthy of respect. He sees them as part of a labour force. Institutions of higher learning, even when they are fully or partially funded by the government, are best left to run autonomously. Mr Sibal has shown a dangerous propensity to run them himself, thus fashioning himself as vice-chancellor of India. He has blurred the critical distinction between a government department and institutions of higher learning. He should let the institutions be and also learn to give up the use of the royal we.

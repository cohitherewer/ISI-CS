	High command                  
	Sir  The army chief definitely has the right to express his views regarding the withdrawal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, since he is the one who is responsible for all the actions or inactions of the army (Speaking out of turn, July 16). The concerns voiced by him are well within his domain; his views do not violate the authority of the leaders presiding over this matter. Moreover, according to the Constitution, the defence forces are not accountable for the countrys internal security problems.          
	In any case, very few threats to Indias internal security have been successfully removed since Independence. Ethnic problems in Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh still linger, and people have taken up arms against the government on more than one occasions. Assam is bogged down with the load of immigrants who have infiltrated from Bangladesh. Successive Indian governments have failed to address these issues.           
	Now there is a fresh eruption of violence with the Maoist insurgency plaguing a number of Indian states. After the state police forces and the Central Reserve Police Force failed to tame the Maoist menace, there have been talks of deploying the army to capture the rebel groups.           
	Unless army personnel are protected from external interference, they would not be able to put up a good fight against the Maoists. Discussions and debates are all very well, but it is not possible to fully comprehend the situation without being physically present in the disturbed areas. And as regards political opinion on this issue, Indian politicians should make a united effort to solve the Maoist problem without bickering over vote banks.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjit Sinha, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  In his article, Ashok Mitra has tried to undermine the authority of the army chief of staff by belittling the latters comments regarding the AFSPA. Mitras arguments are contrived, biased and misleading.          
	The elected representatives of our nation summon the army or the paramilitary forces to quell internal rebellions. But the root cause of such insurgencies is the corruption, inefficiency and insensitivity inherent in our political system. When the problem swells beyond control, politicians use the armys protection to hide their incompetence. One wonders how many political leaders actually visit the affected areas to see for themselves under what conditions the army or the paramilitary forces operate there.           
	How is it possible to convince armymen that the Maoists launching violent assaults on them are not their enemy, but their own people? Mitra has emphasized the brutality of the CRPF carrying the Maoists dead bodies on poles, but he has forgotten to mention the cruel ways in which the Maoists have massacred numerous villagers.          
	The AFSPA provides legal shield to the armed forces, which operate in extremely difficult conditions. The army has its own way of taking disciplinary measures against the improper actions of its cadre. It should be borne in mind that the army chief is responsible not only for the security of the nation and its people, but also for keeping up the morale of the men under his command.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Siddharta Ray, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The article by Ashok Mitra seemed to attack the chief of army staff of India without reason. The dignity of his office should have been respected. Mitra harps on the fact that the army chief, Vijay Kumar Singh, has opposed the withdrawal of the AFSPA. But it should be noted that it was Singh who had also opposed the deployment of the army against the Maoists, saying that the Naxal rebellion was a law-and-order problem, stemming from issues of governance, administration, or socio-economic factors. Moreover, disparaging the army chiefs authority will ultimately reveal the lack of solidarity in our nation.          
	Every nation has laws to safeguard the rights of a soldier. If now the AFSPA is being debated, it should also be asked who enacted it in the first place and why. The army is indispensable for a nations security. Even when the country faces internal security threats, sometimes the army is required to step in to bring back law and order. Such internal security problems often stem from the ineptitude that is the speciality of our political class. If there had not been repeated administrative and leadership failures, the army would not have been required to intervene in the countrys internal matters time and again. The Indian Army tries its best to ensure the well-being and secure the sovereignty of this nation. Without it, the country would have slipped into anarchy. We, the people, should also look after the armys interests, and respect its cause.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  What Shuma Raha observes about the media brouhaha over the suicide of models is equally true for farmers suicides (Life and death under the arc lights, July 15). People in every profession routinely commit suicide. Yet, when a farmer drinks pesticide, the media make a martyr out of him, blaming agricultural policy and the market forces for it.           
	Strangely, they keep mum when prices of agricultural products go up and farmers make a killing. Agriculture is no philanthropy. It is just another vocation, and all vocations are exposed to the vagaries of external forces. The stock-trader, the obsessive gambler, the heavy borrower, the failed Naxalite  all take to self-killing when they have bitten off more than they can chew. Why then lionize farmers and fashion models?          
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The Man Behind The Mask
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE MAN BEHIND THE MASK                                  Fifth Column -Reena Sen                              
	In the mid-1970s, a small group of parents and their friends started the first school for children with cerebral palsy in two rooms in the Ballygunge military camp. The premises were on loan from the army and time-bound; all efforts at getting an alternative site had come to nought. A friend and well-wisher, Shankar Gupta, a young leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), introduced us to Jyoti Basu, and we appealed to him to help us locate a suitable tract to build a school that could be accessible for children with multiple disabilities.         
	Basu listened to us carefully and asked many questions. Perhaps it was our earnestness and passion that convinced him about the credibility of the cause, and he promised to help. A few weeks passed, and then there was a call from Writers Buildings informing us that there were a few plots that seemed suitable and we should have a look. What we did not realize then was that Jyotibabu would also come with us to see the land.         
	When I went to Writers Buildings, Gupta said that Jyotibabu was coming with us. I was completely speechless. As we got into the car, I remember sitting on my hands to prevent them from shaking and I kept giggling like a nervous school- girl. I have no idea what Jyotibabu made of this infantile behaviour but he appeared not to notice and for that, I was grateful. We saw a number of plots, and one seemed absolutely ideal  opposite the zoo, where the Taj stands. Unfortunately, it didnt work out as an esteemed judge from the high court opined that the presence of children with disabilities in the neighbourhood would be detrimental to the animals in the zoo. Jyotibabu did not give up. He was determined to help and it was because of his efforts that the Calcutta Port Trust agreed to give us, on long lease, an acre on Taratala Road.                 
	Another dimension        
	Jyotibabu was our quiet benefactor for years, offering unconditional support and brushing aside effusive words of thanks. He was there at the bhoomi puja and laid the foundation stone; he donated the first rupee for our buy-a-brick campaign; he visited our new school and approved of what he saw; he released a special commemorative book; he acknowledged our letters and the childrens cards, the little mementoes we sent him from time to time and remembered to congratulate those of us who got higher degrees in special education and even said we were good girls.         
	To us, this compliment felt like the ultimate recognition. A man not known to smile very much, his face broke into a smile whenever he met a child or adult with disabilities during his many visits to our institute. We remained in touch through the years, even after he had passed on the mantle of chief ministership.         
	The last time we met, it was at Indira Bhavan where we had gone to present him a special issue of our newsletter that included many photographs of his visits to our organization. He was frail and unwell but his face broke into a smile as we greeted him. He spoke little but leafed through the pages and we knew he was happy to see us. Later, when he was in hospital, we sent him a card and we were delighted when we heard the card had been shown to him and he had asked for the contents to be read out.         
	I had spoken to Joykrishna Ghosh in late December, asking for an appointment to meet him so we could present him with a copy of a book on the river Hooghly we had commissioned. Ghosh said he was not well, but if we waited for a few days he would see if we could get a little time to meet Jyotibabu. Unfortunately, time ran out. Jyoti Basu will live on in the smiles of our children, in our hearts, minds and prayers. We will remember him as a great man who was also a kind human being.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DANGER OUTSIDE THE DOOR                                  Neha Sahay                              
	What can Chinas parents do to protect their children from the mad men out to attack them in school? Teach them kung fu? Equip them with pepper sprays? Drop them and pick them up from school? Will all of these help their children when the assailant rushes inside a classroom and hits out with a hammer or a meat knife? And can four-year-olds be trusted with pepper sprays? The fifth in a series of attacks on Kindergartens and primary schools took place yesterday, in a small town. The man who had rented out rooms for the Kindergarten killed seven children and a teacher with a knife, then went home and killed himself.        
	Most Chinese schools are huge. Many have security guards and collapsible gates, but these didnt stop the armed assailants from reaching classrooms. They made no attempt to hide their weapons. One assailant managed to hit out with his meat knife at 29 children and two teachers, aiming for their heads and throats, and also wounded the guard who tried to stop him. Another had brought a can of kerosene along to set himself and his targets on fire  somehow the teachers managed to snatch the children from his grasp. By then, he had bludgeoned five children and a teacher. Both central and provincial governments have now woken up. A special security force has been set up for schools; teachers are being trained in the use of long poles with a semi-circular ring at one end to grab assailants; children are being taught self-defence. Some schools have installed CCTVs; others keep their gates closed at all times. It is common to see school kids snacking out on the road during their lunch break; that has now been disallowed in a few schools. In one city, shoot-to-kill orders have been given to the police in such incidents.                
	Weak targets        
	Why? is the question everyones asking. Angry with the system? Then go kill the officials, is a common refrain. Han Han, a popular young blogger, claimed to have seen this banner being put up  online  outside a Kindergarten: Injustice has a cause, debt has an owner, out the door and to the left is the government building. In other words:  for answers, go to the government.        
	Han Han recommended that all policemen guarding government buildings be immediately posted to guard schools. His post was removed. The government had by then sent out an advisory to the popular news portal, Sina.com, to use only Xinhua news on the subject in view of the Shanghai Expo.        
	The government could have given a better reason  already, sociologists and criminologists were cautioning that sensational media coverage could inspire a copycat reaction among those who felt left out of Chinas success story.        
	But is social inequality the cause of such attacks? In the first incident in March, it was a 42-year-old community doctor, jilted by his wealthy girlfriend, who picked up a knife and went on a stabbing spree outside a primary school, killing eight children and injuring five. He told the court that he had nothing against the children, but picked on them because they were weak and vulnerable. He was executed; on the very day, the first of three consecutive attacks took place. Another assailant, though unemployed, was the owner of eight rooms in a building opposite the school.        
	Were these persons mentally ill? One definitely was  a former art teacher who had had to leave his job because of a mental illness. He slipped into a primary school along with other teachers and stabbed 15 students with a fruit knife. China is notoriously deficient in counselling centres. Parents feel helpless and desperate; the one-child policy has only made things worse. As one parent said, I cant stop crying while cooking for my child.

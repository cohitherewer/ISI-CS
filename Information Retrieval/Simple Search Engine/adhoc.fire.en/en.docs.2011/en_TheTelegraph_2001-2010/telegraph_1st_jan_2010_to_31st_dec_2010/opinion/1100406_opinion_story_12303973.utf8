	The entire South Asian region is besieged by a tradition of political violence, with the exception of the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. Brutality has been rampant in South Asia, committed not by alien aggressors but by internal dissenters  M.K. Gandhi was assassinated by an Indian who was a fundamentalist, Indira Gandhi was shot dead by a Sikh bodyguard, Rajiv Gandhi was blown up by a suicide bomber  and yet we have the audacity to call ourselves a peace-loving nation. In the immediate neighbourhood, the first families of rulers have all suffered inhuman assaults. From Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to Nepal and Pakistan, mercy and a sense of dignity in dealing with political differences have been non-existent.        
	Physical assault has been the norm, and the connivance by disparate groups, some in control of the official machinery and others not, appears to be in the realm of possibility. Investigations take more than a span of life to be completed and cease to have any real impact. Perpetrators of such crimes see the lethargy in bringing culprits of heinous crimes to book quick and fast, and this in itself encourages many more acts of a similar kind. It is as though the State is helpless, soft and incapable of reading out the Riot Act, ensuring law and order, and thereby setting the norm of civilized living. This needs to be changed.        
	Many questions remain unanswered about who influenced and masterminded some of these assassinations. Was there an international conspiracy to destabilize a region that could, as a political collective in sync with one another, become a formidable market and a stronghold for Western powers to contend with? Was the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation geo-politically important for the superpowers, which wanted to conquer the largest potential market of this millennium? Puppet leaders have been safe, and in contrast, those who appealed to the larger masses with a mind of their own were eliminated.                
	Devise alternatives        
	A mature nation state would seize the moment and use its age-old strengths to manipulate the colonizer and extract only that which is imperative for its growth and betterment, rejecting, albeit deviously, that which suppresses its liberty, freedom and self-reliance. Present-day leaders need to play this political game deftly, with astute strategy. Instead, we seem to be grovelling for recognition and appreciation. The colonizers cannot remain powerful without being partners with nations in this region. Seeing the writing on the wall for what it is, the South Asian nations must play a carefully nuanced international game on their own terms. If serious, the Saarc summit  appropriately taking place in Bhutan, a young, fledgling democracy whose gross national happiness is an indicator of its development and growth  must make an international impact and shake other similar collectives of nation states out of their standstill attitude.         
	Saarc nations can devise, with ease, alternatives for the people who have been neglected and exploited for decades. Their skills and expertise, suppressed by modern tools and man-made, inorganic products, which have polluted the so- called rich world, need to be revived and put into the mainstream development agenda. People are comfortable and confident doing what they know best. The Western world is rapidly discarding all the horrors that have poisoned their land, and condescendingly dumping those failures on the developing world, which is, ironically, far more sensitive to the need for sustainable development. Saarc needs to teach the developed world some real lessons about life and living, cease being insecure when confronted with the other world, generate pride and secure its place in this competitive world.

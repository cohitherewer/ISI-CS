The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Listless in Lahore
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LISTLESS IN LAHORE                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                          The Great Red Storm, Archival C-print                                        
	The democratic government of Pakistan recently blocked access to Facebook and YouTube, among 450 other websites, because of their sacrilegious content and derogatory material. Following severe public outcry, the government has invited representatives from these two hugely popular sites to resolve the dispute in a way that ensures religious harmony and respect.        
	Even as the authorities are busy cleaning up the nation, some of the most inventive, edgy and iconoclastic works of art in the subcontinent are coming out of Pakistan, a country that remains marooned in a haze of terror, danger and foreboding. In fact, in a scathing irony, a new generation of Pakistani artists is ingeniously using new media in a myriad ways that would make the mad mullahs profoundly ill at ease.        
	After showing Bani Abidis accomplished work (especially her exquisite inkjet prints) at the group show, Freedom is Notional, last year, Experimenter is currently hosting a solo exhibition, till June 5, by another young Pakistani, Mehreen Murtaza, based in Lahore, whose work bristles with a sublime irreverence. From the intrepid title Who are you, defenders of the universe? to the radically subversive content, Murtazas art hits out at the zealously guarded spirit of religious harmony and respect that lies at the root of Pakistans self-definition as a nation.        
	In Murtazas case, the roots are necessarily loaded with various ambiguities that appear to have personal resonances, both sinister and secret, which can neither be disavowed nor acknowledged without irony. Roots, if they anchor you to a repressive society, are capable of inducing a strangely disturbing state of being  a feeling of belonging to a nation that does not really belong to you. Looking at Murtazas work, one feels the palpable restlessness of a mind alternating between domicile and exile as it reckons with the grim prospect of living and creating art in a country gripped by fundamentalism. The challenging tone of the title heralds Murtazas departure from that tradition of visual arts in Pakistan which is embedded in the ethos of an orthodox Islamic State, guided by codes of propriety set by fanatical preachers.        
	A.R. Chughtai, perhaps the most eminent Pakistani painter at the time of Independence, first upheld the Islamic style by encouraging a revival of Muslim elements  like miniature painting  to forge a national identity for Pakistani art. His project, which deepened during Zia-ul-Haqs dictatorship, aimed to protect the hallowed roots of an insular nationalist culture from foreign influence. But roots may not always be good things. As the Lebanese writer, Amin Maalouf, puts it, roots burrow into the ground, twist in the mud, and thrive in darkness; they make captives out of human beings, because, unlike trees, we need light and covet the heavens. If we sink into the ground like roots, then we decompose, Maalouf adds chillingly. Yet becoming rootless is no mean task. We are all planted in specific geopolitical soils, and shaped by our individual destinies, from which we must strive to pull ourselves free in order to grow roots in the air.        
	In Murtazas work, one glimpses that struggle to uproot oneself from a limited terrain, circumscribed by local histories, so as to escape into a global, trans-historical reality. As a result, her imagery is trapped within binaries  most prominently noticed in the clever mingling of traditional and indigenous idioms. The oversized black cube, which greets the visitor into the gallery, is, quite obviously, a replica of the Kaaba in Mecca. But it also recalls Malevichs minimal masterpiece, Black Square (1913), as well as a similar work by the German artist, Gregor Schneider, installed in Hamburg.        
	Similarly, though Murtazas digital collages look like echt Stuckist Art, they are also heavily influenced by the age-old tradition of truck art that can be seen on lorries and buses all over the subcontinent. So rather than looking smart-alecy in a contemporary European way, the small-format prints sizzle with a streak of original native humour and kitsch. Even in the hypnotic installation on LED screen, showing a cluster of silvery dots with tiny red lights blinking occasionally in their midst, a meditative calm coexists with a feeling of suppressed rage.        
	If Murtazas black cube quickly signals her socio-religious roots, it also defamiliarizes itself with remarkable alacrity. Floating on a bed of low light like a UFO, surrounded by a metallic hum, it transports you to another semantic level. From the din of a million pilgrims, you travel to a desolate sci-fi land. Just as in the exploding red cube, which looks like a magnificent frieze on the wall, the feeling of doom and dread dissolves into one of deadpan fixation. Various newspaper photographs of the lawyers protests during President Musharrafs misrule are juxtaposed on settings reminiscent of vintage sci-fi and horror movies (Independence Day, Godzilla and so on) or even of scenes from the Superman comics  another staple for classic kitsch art. The image of a group of jubilant lawyers, overjoyed by the reinstatement of the supreme court and the chief justice, is cleverly doubled, as if inside a topsy-turvy looking-glass world, and called, with biting sarcasm, Congratulations and Celebrations, after the feelgood teenagey tune by Cliff Richard.        
	It would have been lovely if one could properly see the video work, Compass Clouds, that has been unceremoniously thrust into a corner of the room. Although the work appears interesting, there is just too much light reflecting on it from the adjacent walls to allow one to make out what exactly transpires on the screen. For an artist whose fancies appear to be curled around images that are charged by a surreal dimness, the glare of artificial light can ruin the infinitely gentle spell that she casts so carefully.

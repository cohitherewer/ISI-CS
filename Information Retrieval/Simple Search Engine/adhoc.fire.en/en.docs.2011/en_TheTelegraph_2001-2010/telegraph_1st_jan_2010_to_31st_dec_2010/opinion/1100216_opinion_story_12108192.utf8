                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOUSES IN YELLOW, GREEN AND BROWN                                  Place-names and prejudices, fantastic tales and comic books, keep alive words and expressions that lost languages, cultures and ways of life have left behind                          A shop selling ironware near Bidhan Sarani                                  
	Boa Senior, who was 85 years old, died recently. In the last years of her life, the portly woman with sad eyes was the only surviving member of the Bo tribe in the Andaman Islands. She was also the sole custodian of Bo, one of the 10 Great Andamanese languages. With her death, a people and language have now been permanently effaced.        
	Language is a critical register to understand communities and their social and cultural histories. The death of a community, like that of the Bo, often signals the death of a language. But people and languages change over time. This transition is a kind of death as well. As communities evolve and alter, words and phrases that were once used to describe them or their practices drop out of the fabric of language. Sometimes, some redundant words remain, but they inhabit the peripheries of a language.        
	Dipika Santra, now in her seventies, told me that she knows of one such word in Bengali  kalwar. This pejorative term was used to describe the community of migrants who traded in scrap-iron. If you were to ask this still-sprightly woman to spell out the word for you, she would do so with care, and explain its meaning with relish. She is fond of disappearing words, she said, and of the dwindling tribe of people who use them.         
	Dipika had spent a considerable part of her early life in Howrahs Belilios Lane. Like other residents of north Calcutta and Howrah, Dipikas family used the word, kalwar, liberally to describe everything that was there to be loathed. She also remembers kalwars as dark-skinned people (as dark as the Santhals, she insisted), with strong bodies. They washed their clothes  shirts and pyjamas  carefully, chewed paan, consumed milk and tea and worshipped pictures of Lakshmi and Ganesh in gilded frames. Hearing this, I muttered that the kalwars seemed to share common traits with Calcuttas other trading communities. Dipika shot back that Marwaris and Gujaratis are much fairer.        
	The kalwars were also an industrious community. They made and sold iron rods, plates, burners, hand-pumps from tiny shops on balconies. The space was often rented to them by Bengali families whose fortunes were on the wane. (Sir Denzil Ibbetson, a British administrator during the raj, had also noted that the kalwars  a community of distillers and traders hailing from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal  were an enterprising, energetic and headstrong people.) It was their industriousness and keenness for education that helped the community prosper.         
	But what of language and bigotry? Disparaging terms, I told my interlocutor, divide and discriminate. Dipika said that it would be wrong to blame words and phrases, for a community never truly believes that there can be another equal to it.         
	Calcuttas kalwarpattis (also known as lohapattis), areas filled with shops selling ironware that dotted the city in Dipikas time, are far less numerous today. One of them is still to be found in Manicktala. A thousand-odd establishments survive in the stretch between College Street and Bidhan Sarani, but their numbers are falling. When I gave this bit of news to Dipika, Dipika looked at me disdainfully. It is always easy to spot members of this community. Go to Belilios Lane, take a right, and you will come across a house painted in yellow, green and brown. Yellow, green and brown! You will find them in buildings with similar colours.        
	Communities and languages die, but not prejudice. Kalwars continue to thrive, perhaps not as abundantly in the city as in the corners of our partisan minds.                           UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

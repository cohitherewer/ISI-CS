The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | back to basics
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BACK TO BASICS                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Rumour had it that the cabinet was to be reshuffled last Friday, before the prime minister went off on a trip overseas, because thereafter, Barack Obama was arriving, followed by a session of Parliament and the start of the New Year. Nothing happened, and Delhi continued to wallow in the comfort of the all-pervading status quo.        
	There is a huge sadness in the truth that cabinet in India has been reduced to a clumsy, file-pushing conglomerate of departments headed by politicians who are placed in position for reasons other than competence in the job at hand. Of course, there are some who are carefully selected for key ministries, who belong to the single-largest party in the coalition. Home affairs, finance and external affairs are the critical areas where the general policy trend of a government becomes tangible. Sadly, other important sectors such as urban development, environment, culture, law, health, woman and child, education, and science and technology are juggled about on a whim, not necessarily on the basis of expertise, understanding and commitment of the minister chosen for the job.        
	Sometimes a shuffle gets a good person in office. At other times, the choice is a disaster. We have to only look around to know how feeble the intellectual acumen of those who rule us is. If the prime minister wants to make his ministers achieve what has been set out in their mandate, and believes in making them accountable (which is what he professed in the early days of his second term), he must keep them in the same job and compel them to alter the course to start on a new trajectory for the new millennium. Only those found guilty of corruption or those who have faulted by doing nothing at all must be removed.                
	Fake morality        
	Why has it taken months to fill the post vacated by Shashi Tharoor? Why is there no minister of culture who can engage with the repository of Indias culture, with its people? Why is the sports ministry headed by a retired election commissioner? Why is youth affairs with the ageing? Why are coalition partners accommodated in ministries where they can add no value at all but which they can, in fact, destroy? We have had enough of playing with politics at the cost of effective governance. India has been torn apart by civil strife as well as by the neglect of its less privileged inhabitants. As citizens, we are not concerned with petty political juggling. Rather, we demand intelligent, liberal, forward-looking policies and a civilized present and future. We have had enough of being treated like a bunch of idiots at the receiving end of an unjust administration.        
	It is shameful to hear a chief minister say that a book needs to be banned from a literature syllabus because it has bad words in its narrative. Obviously, the leader lacks a liberal mind that should be mandatory for holding the position he does. We are a liberal, plural, democracy that has lived through thousands of years of multicultural influences, which have made India resilient to the dreadful realities of today. Why does the high command permit such gibberish to escape the lips of its representatives? Maybe there should be a summer school to train the minds of our elected leaders in order to assist them utter sense and not parochial, unacceptable statements.        
	The concerned leader did not made a strong statement about the disgusting behaviour of his colleagues in various Vidhan Sabhas across India when they bashed one another up and used foul language at the expense of the tax-payers. Fake morality? Was he playing the archaic Congress game of politics where you appease those who support your opposition by behaving like the opposition? This playing politics for votes has destroyed present-day India  and the uncaring elected representatives are the ones who are responsible.

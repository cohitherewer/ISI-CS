The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Have a safe journey!
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HAVE A SAFE JOURNEY!                                  The National Road Safety and Traffic Management Board Bill aims to beef up road safety measures and check the rising number of fatalities on Indian roads. Hemchhaya De reports                          Road to hell: India tops the list of countries with a high number of road fatalities                                  
	The government seems to have finally begun a legislative process that could go a long way in ensuring better road safety in India. The National Road Safety and Traffic Management Board Bill, 2010, was introduced in the Lok Sabha last month. Among other things, the bill calls for the setting up of a national board dedicated to ensuring the orderly development, regulation, promotion and optimisation of modern and effective road safety and traffic management system and practices across the country.         
	Kamal Nath, Union minister for road transport and highways, explains, The board will act as an independent and dedicated agency to oversee road safety activities in the country. Having one organisation to look after road safety issues comprehensively would not only be rational but also objective.        
	The bill also proposes that the board should comprise experts from various sectors like health, road transport and traffic management.        
	The need for making a coordinated effort to stop people from getting killed or maimed on Indias roads cannot be overemphasised. According to a recent World Health Organisation (WHO) report on road fatalities around the world, India tops the list of 178 nations, overtaking countries like China and the US. If we go by the Indian ministry of road transport and highways surveys, the number of reported road deaths has increased from 84,674 in 2002 to 1,14,444 in 2007. Independent studies have also shown that traffic fatalities in India have been increasing by about 8 per cent annually over the past 10 years.         
	Hence, say experts, a centralised body to oversee road safety was long overdue. International experience shows that road accidents were reduced after such central agencies were established. Japan established such a body way back in 1974, says Dinesh Mohan, a WHO consultant on road safety and the head of the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme (Tripp) at IIT Delhi.         
	The road transport and highways ministry seems to admit that theres a gap in the system that needs to be filled. Explaining the objective of the bill, the ministry notes that in most developed countries, focused and scientific research is carried out on road safety and injury prevention. It says, These countries have specialised bodies to manoeuvre adequate resources and supervise the activities required to improve road safety... Though the ministry is... responsible for road safety efforts in the country, it does not have enforcement machinery of its own and other technical resources required to ensure better road safety activities. It is, therefore, felt that an integrated... body is necessary.         
	Needless to say, the bill has been widely praised. It has certainly got merit. The need of the hour is to have a practical framework where our laws on road safety need to be strictly enforced, says Maxwell Pereira, former joint commissioner, Delhi Police.         
	The bill does set out standards for improving Indias road safety. As per sections 6(i) and 6(ii), the functions of the National Road Safety and Traffic Management Board will include recommending minimum standards for design, construction and maintenance of national highways and also the minimum safety requirements (such as those pertaining to load bearing and capacity) for the manufacture of mechanically propelled vehicles. (The bill says that these include all vehicles except bicycles and hand-drawn carts). Failing to comply with the standards for national highways and mechanically propelled vehicles will draw a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh.              
	Highway fatalities are, in fact, a growing concern in road safety in India and the bill tries to address that. Highways are not being built as per safety standards, says Mohan. Death rates are on the rise in states or cities that have been building an extensive network of highways, ring roads and bypasses by expanding road spaces and encouraging the fast movement of traffic.        
	Indias national highways cover a little over 66,000 km while the state highways cover 1,28,000 km. A Tripp study shows that although national highways account for about 2 per cent of Indias total road network, about 40 per cent of the countrys total vehicular traffic ply on them. And it is not just vehicles that are involved in accidents  pedestrians also fall victim to rash driving on the highways.        
	With highways being built through villages, poor villagers have to cross them to reach their workplace from home or vice versa. They often end up being victims of speeding vehicles on highways, says Harman Singh Sidhu who runs a Chandigarh-based NGO called Arrivesafe that deals with road safety issues.        
	The bill also stipulates that the board will suggest minimum standards for trauma and para-medical facilities for traffic related injuries on the national highways. This too was long overdue as up until now the trauma care for crash survivors has been pretty dismal in India. The police as well as ordinary people must know the basic steps to help the injured in road accidents, says Prasad Krishnan, consultant neurosurgeon, National Neuroscience Centre, Peerless Hospital in Calcutta, who also trains city police personnel in road safety and trauma care.        
	It is often said that road deaths and injuries are under-reported in India. The bill seeks to correct that and includes a provision whereby the board will conduct...research in different spheres of road safety and traffic management and publish the findings. It will also establish the procedure and methodology for data collection, transmission and analysis at appropriate levels, and define the role of different agencies involved in the process.         
	Though most experts welcome a legislation to enhance road safety in India, others point out that the measures should be strictly enforced on state highways as well. While any initiative to curb the menace of road accidents at the national level is to be appreciated, there must be corresponding initiatives at the state level as well. Otherwise the bill will fail to achieve its desired effect, says Philip U.J., head of regional transportation division at the Thiruvananthapuram-based National Transportation Planning and Research Centre.         
	Still, the Centre has set the ball rolling, as it were. Only time will tell if the proposed legislation is effective in bringing down road fatalities in India.

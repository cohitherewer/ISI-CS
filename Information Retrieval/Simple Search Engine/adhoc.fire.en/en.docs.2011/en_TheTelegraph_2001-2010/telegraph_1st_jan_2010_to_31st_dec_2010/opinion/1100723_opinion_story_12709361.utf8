	MARADONA: THE HAND OF GOD By JIMMY BURNS, Bloomsbury, 9.9        
	Maradona mesmerizes. Maradona is magic. Maradona the magnificent. These were some of the headlines that attracted attention, drowning the major issues which rattled the world for years. The man himself could not overcome his addiction to women or drinks. He slapped meddlesome photographers and abused corrupt politicians. He quarrelled with millionaires, fought with people who lunged at him, howled when he lost, punched the air in celebration and scored goals with his feet, head and hands. Yes, the charm of Diego Maradona lies in his versatile genius.        
	Pusks and Di Stefano danced with the ball before the age of television. Pele and Garrinchas dribbles mesmerized both defenders and spectators. But when the stocky Argentine dodged past opponents, people stopped in their tracks and wondered whether what they were seeing was real.         
	When the Madrid-born, hard-nosed journalist, Jimmy Burns, set his sights on Maradona, he wanted to understand the psyche of the man. Why was Maradona such a bundle of contradictions? Was he an egotist? Or was he tortured and tormented? Who were his inspirations? Above all, why was he the most popular footballer in the world?        
	To his initial dismay, and eventual surprise, Burns found that Maradona still remains the misunderstood man that he was. Modern tacticians had not been able to stop his marauding raids on goal. Similarly, negative reports in the media failed to diminish his popularity. Even mighty Fifas publicity machinery could not negate the love that the people showered on him. Once, Fifa wanted to present Pele with an award for being the greatest ever footballer. Within hours, people from all over the world began to protest against the decision by casting their votes in favour of Maradona, forcing Fifa to offer the award to both players.        
	Politicians, industrialists, administrators, film stars and sportsmen are known to maintain media agents for publicity. With this man, the opposite is true. He never cared for the press, still less for influential people. Yet, the media and the sponsors hounded him even after his retirement. Maradona loves ordinary people. In return, they love him despite his failings.         
	In keeping with his love for leftist ideology (Maradona adores Fidel Castro), he found time to visit Calcutta recently to open a soccer training school for deprived children. Little did he know then that the project would never take off. During the World Cup in South Africa, when he came to know that the project remained incomplete, he merely shook his head and said, But the youngsters were so keen. This, in a way, is the real Maradona. He has been exploited by club-owners, the media, federation officials and corrupt politicians. Yet, at the end of the day, the man has not deviated from his principles. After that controversial goal during the 1986 World Cup, he was called a cheat. Maradona never denied that he had touched the ball. On the contrary, he was honest enough to admit that he had used his hand to score the goal.        
	Honesty and courage have remained his main traits since childhood. He has never denied his problems with drugs or women. Neither has he tried to hide anything from the public gaze. For instance, he has mentioned that he spent years in poverty, and that he lost his innocence in the hell-hole where he was born. He has also admitted his involvement in petty crimes as a kid. How many of us would have the courage to admit all our failings?

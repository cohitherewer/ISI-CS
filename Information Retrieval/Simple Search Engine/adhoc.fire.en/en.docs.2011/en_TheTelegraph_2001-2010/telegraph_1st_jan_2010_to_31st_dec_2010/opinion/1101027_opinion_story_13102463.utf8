	It is time to be alert when political parties start campaigning for the right to make more noise. A bizarre and tacit agreement of sorts seems to be emerging between the Trinamul Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) over an issue that could affect the lives of ordinary people in West Bengal. The Union minister of state for urban development and senior member of the Trinamul Congress, Sougata Roy, and a CPI(M) legislator, Sujan Chakraborty, are both concerned about the fate of firecracker-makers in Bengal. They are both campaigning (Mr Roy has written to the Central minister for the environment and forests) for the states permissible decibel level for firecrackers to be raised from 90 to 125 decibels. They are doing this for the sake of these small businesses, concentrated mainly in the 24 Parganas, which have suffered owing to the law regarding noise levels in Bengal. Their main argument is that everywhere else in India the permitted level is 125 decibels, and this encourages illegal trafficking in firecrackers, especially around the time of Diwali.        
	This is an absurd situation for several reasons. First, for years, the state government and the police have been trying to decrease noise pollution in the state by regulating the manufacture of firecrackers. This was prompted by a Calcutta High Court ruling of 1996, and since then, police and citizens groups have been trying, more or less successfully, to make certain festivals more bearable for the ears of those who may not wish to take part in more extreme forms of celebration. In this, the Left Front government has seen eye to eye with the citizens groups and has managed to mobilize the police to maintain a certain standard of law-abiding behaviour in the cities and suburbs. Not only would all this be undone by this new, and united, wave of political campaigning to raise the legal noise level, but the state government will also be made to look rather silly if one of its own people suddenly ends up on the side of its political opponent. What it amounts to  and Bengal is more than familiar with this  is a particularly mindless form of populism. Calcuttas pavements, and therefore its pedestrians, have been victims of such politics, when both parties tacitly united over legalizing hawkers, as they did over ruining the Maidan with their rallies.

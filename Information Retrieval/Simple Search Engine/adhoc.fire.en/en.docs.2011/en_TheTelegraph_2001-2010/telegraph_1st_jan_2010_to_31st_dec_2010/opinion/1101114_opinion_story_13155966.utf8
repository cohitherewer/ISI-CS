	Wait until dark                  
	Sir  Engineering students from the United Kingdom have built solar kiosks in remote African villages. They have installed chargers that draw energy from the sun. The villagers have spent a nominal sum on the batteries, which help them light up rooms, run table fans and recharge cellphone batteries. The government of West Bengal can use this innovative concept to brighten up the lives of millions of villagers who live in the dark after sunset. Engineering students from the state should help the government in this regard.          
	Yours faithfully,        Sujit Ghose, Calcutta 
        
	Poor taste          
	Sir  The way the government of West Bengal transgressed the codes of propriety by refusing to give Siddhartha Shankar Ray a ceremonial State funeral is disgraceful (Left prejudice, Nov 9). The government did not honour the former chief minister in the way it had treated Jyoti Basu simply because Ray did not belong to the ruling party. But the Centre has also behaved callously. Ray was not only a former chief minister but also an ex-Union minister, ex-governor and ex-ambassador. The behaviour of the state and Central governments prove that todays leaders have no sense of decency left in them. The Left is famous for its double standards. But what about the Congress? Has the oldest party forgotten its manners as well?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and his Communist Party of India (Marxist) should be condemned by one and all for the way they have conducted themselves after the sad demise of Siddhartha Shankar Ray. As the editorial, Left prejudice, rightly points out, it is most unbecoming of a supposedly culturally inclined chief minister to behave in such a partisan manner. Ray had worked hard for the development of the state. Although he has been criticized for his anti-Naxalite policy, he at least he had the courage to tackle the Naxalites with determination, unlike Bhattacharjee, who has no clue as to how to handle the Maoist menace. Compared to Ray, Jyoti Basu did nothing for the state except nurture a group of party cadres who were later used to terrorize ordinary citizens so that the CPI(M) could remain in power for an absurdly long period of time. Basu had destroyed all that was good in West Bengal, be it in the fields of education, industry or law enforcement. Yet Basu was given a State funeral, which virtually stopped work in Calcutta for nearly three days, in keeping with the work culture promoted by him.          
	To be frank, the state is still suffering the ill effects of poor governance that started with Basu and continued under his able successor, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The latter is now so worried about his governments impending defeat in the next assembly polls that he has no qualms about stooping low. His latest attempt to undermine a former chief ministers memories only proves his pettiness.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Not available           
	Sir  I was scheduled to travel with my family from New Delhi to Howrah on October 23. I sent a peon to book the tickets 90 days in advance in the hope that I would get confirmed tickets. However, I found that we had been allotted numbers 64, 65, 66 and 67 in the waiting list. Ticket counters open at 8 am, and our tickets had been issued at 8.17 pm. How can all the seats get booked within 17 minutes?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayant Kumar Udeshi, Calcutta

	Who would have imagined that Marxs theory of alienation of the worker would one day be played out in Maos China, under the rule of a Communist Party? Why have 12 workers attempted suicide (10 died) in Foxconns massive complex at Shenzhen in the last five months? The resultant outcry prompted its Taiwanese chairman to announce two wage hikes in a month (though the second has been linked to productivity); to get Buddhist monks to counsel workers; to provide a distress room where workers can punch their frustrations on rubber dolls.... But now, its chairman has begun talking tough, announcing that no compensation would be paid for suicides, and that the company was planning to get the government involved in running its factory-towns. In Taiwan, if a worker committed suicide for emotional reasons, he said, the employer wouldnt be held responsible, but we are taken to task in China because they are living in our dormitories.         
	Reporters from two Chinese newspapers went undercover inside the factory that manufactures products for the American giants, Apple and Dell, but could find little. Indeed, Foxconn compares well with other factories run by the Taiwanese. Its 430,000 workers in Shenzhen have their own hospital, swimming pool, restaurants, theatres. Problem is, most cannot use these facilities, for whatever free time they get goes in recovering from work. Overtime makes these young (18-24) migrant workers world go round. Their basic salary of 900 yuan, with meals and dormitory accommodation, is low, given Shenzhens living standards. The reporters found that every worker signs a voluntary overtime affidavit, to get round the legal limit on overtime work  36 hours a month. But not everyone gets to work as much as they want to. Some grumbled about being forced to lie-in on May 1, International Labour Day, when they would rather be working! Leaving the dormitory costs money, even if access to Shenzhens mountains and beaches is free.         
	Few breaks        
	For these workers, every yuan saved is a means to support aged parents and pay for the education of younger siblings back home in the village. They envied those who remained absent due to a work injury, and thus got some rest. One of them longed for someone to give him a kick so he could get a five-minute break.         
	One reporter mentioned the constant sneering, bullying and shouting of company staff, and Foxconn has admitted to one incident of security guards beating up a worker in its Beijing factory last year. But despite the suicides, which the workers didnt talk much about,theres always a long queue of hopefuls waiting outside for a job.        
	Be it in the most professionally run multinationals that follow Chinas labour laws scrupulously, or in the sweatshops run by the Taiwanese, Japanese, or the Chinese from Hong Kong and Macau, overtime is the chief attraction. When its reduced, workers start leaving. Most recently, this happened when, under pressure from the authorities after an adverse report by an American labour organization, a Taiwanese factory making products for Microsoft, HP and Samsung abolished overtime on Sundays and reduced it to legal limits for the rest of the week. The first Sunday off was described by workers as the first meaningful Sunday they have had, but it didnt change their decision to leave  they just could not make do with the basic salary of 920 yuan from which 200 yuan was cut for dormitory accommodation and two meals.         
	This factory gave few breaks; imposed monetary penalties for every lapse; forbade visitors and locked the dormitory gates at 9 pm; the food was awful, the supervisors brutal; yet the workers left when they could no longer work like cogs in a machine, 14 hours every day. They had no choice.

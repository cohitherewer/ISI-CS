	Ugly truth                  
	Sir  Ever since a student of a reputed school in Calcutta committed suicide, there has been a lot of discussion about corporal punishment being practised in educational institutions (A collective failure of duty, June 15). Students can be punished to instil discipline, but they should not be subjected to caning or beatings. Punishments must not humiliate or cause pain to children.          
	Not only the principal but the parents of Rouvanjit Rawla are also responsible for his death. The boys parents have accused some teachers of humiliating Rawla regularly. But why did the parents remain silent? Their timely objection could have saved a precious life. Parents seem to tolerate almost everything if their child is studying in a reputed school. Students are even compelled to perform beyond their capacity. The pressure in school and at home forces some students to take extreme steps.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Raj Bagri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The values of our education system have declined, and learning has taken a backseat. Sunanda K. Datta-Rays article, Recalling an old school (June 12), revealed these facts in a pertinent manner. Nowadays, people are more interested in degrees and jobs than in education. They are ready to pay a high price to get their children admitted to English-medium schools, regardless of the quality of teaching there. This is even more prominent in West Bengal, where the Marxists had once tried to banish English education. Many feel that the English taught in vernacular schools is of an inferior quality. The demand for English education increased in Bengal during the 1980s. As a result, English-medium schools began to flourish here. This new crop of schools compromised on their ethics, as education turned into a lucrative business. Even today, education is nothing but a profitable business that attracts heavy investments.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  While I am totally against corporal punishment, I fail to understand how the parents of Rouvanjit Rawla can absolve themselves of all responsibility. The boy allegedly committed suicide after being caned in school. The experience must have been traumatic for Rawla. There seems to have been a serious communication gap between the child and his parents. Normally, children avoid going to school and complain to their parents if they are punished severely. Assuming this had been the case with Rawla too, his life could have been saved by the timely intervention of his parents. Why has Rawlas father filed a complaint against the teachers of La Martiniere for Boys four months after his sons death? Why did he say at first that it was an accident? It is unfortunate that parents, on some occasions, fail to understand their own children.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Mitali Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Acts of cruelty by teachers can turn fatal. Corporal punishment in schools has become a scourge similar to ragging. The shocking death of Rouvanjit Rawla has jolted Calcuttas conscience. The helplessness of the school education minister, Partha De, sums up the general attitude towards such incidents. The code of conduct that guides disciplinary measures undertaken by teachers against students is almost always breached. Teachers get away with corporal punishment for two reasons: the practice is tacitly condoned and, more often than not, teachers are protected by their political affiliations. A show-cause notice or freeze-on-increments is too feeble a response to curb this kind of barbarism. The West Bengal Board of Secondary Education must come down hard on the erring teachers. If it fails to do so, judicial intervention may be required to address the problem.          
	Yours faithfully,         Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad             
	Sir  The allegation of corporal punishment against the principal of La Martiniere for Boys is not only horrifying but also indicates that school authorities often terrorize students consciously. The charges levelled against the school are a matter of shame for this famous institution. It has been reported that the school has no written policy on admission, detention and the issuing of transfer certificates, and that students cannot voice their concerns. Instead of hushing up the matter, the authorities must ensure that such incidents are never repeated.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Othello Mazoomdaar, Barasat

                
	Sir  La Martiniere for Boys is one of Calcuttas most prestigious schools. It has earned a bad name lately owing to some serious lapses. To revive its lost glory, the school should replace its principal. The media, on the other hand, should stop sensationalizing the matter.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sanjay Agarwal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  I am the mother of a school-going child. I have been shocked by the death of Rouvanjit Rawla, and am disgusted by the news of corporal punishment. The principal of the concerned school has apologized for his brutal act, but his apology has come too late. If he is truly ashamed of his act, he should resign and spare the institution more embarrassment.                     
	Yours faithfully,        Swati Ramanathan,Abu Dhabi

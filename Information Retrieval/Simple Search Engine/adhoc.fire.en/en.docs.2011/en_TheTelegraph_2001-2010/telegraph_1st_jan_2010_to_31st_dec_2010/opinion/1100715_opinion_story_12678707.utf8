The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | neglect all the way
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NEGLECT ALL THE WAY                                  Fifth Column -Sumanta Sen                              
	While the tribal-dominated districts of Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore are at the centre of official attention because of Maoist troubles, another area of conflict involving tribals has developed in the Dooars region of North Bengal. So far, the conflict has not led to law-and-order problems. But the sustained campaign for some measure of self-rule, carried out by the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, has had an impact on tribal minds, particularly on a section of tea-garden workers.        
	Even if the ABAVP does not make common cause with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, as the latter wants it to, it can create problems on its own for the Left parties and the Writers Buildings. There is no certainty that the issue will remain confined to peaceful rallies and submission of memoranda. Also, how can one be sure that the Maoists, who have already entered Murshidabad bordering North Bengal, will not turn their eyes northwards?        
	Development, or vikas, is a common sore point with politicians as well as with ordinary citizens in North Bengal  and for good reason too. Barring the towns of Siliguri and Malda, the other districts present a picture of neglect. Even constituents of the ruling Left Front are unhappy. The Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority has made plans for projects but how many of these have taken off? Not that there is no money floating around, but for that the unguarded borders with Nepal and Bangladesh should be thanked much more than any effort at industrial development without which vikas is not possible. For those living in the interiors, communication with Calcutta continues to be difficult. Matters may improve slightly if the long-delayed air link between Calcutta and Cooch Behar is restored. Why have the small airstrips, which became grazing grounds once private carriers closed shop, not been revived?                
	Thorn in the flesh        
	Broadly speaking, it has been neglect all the way. So the birth of the ABAVP was perhaps natural. Indifference at the top has led to the tribals feeling that their misfortune is related to ethnicity and that their lot can only be improved if they have a say in the conduct of their lives. The Left parties that are active in the Dooars today are having problems finding takers for their philosophy: that the poor must remain united in their struggle. Neglect is posing a threat to tribal identity. No wonder, though relatively better off than the others, tea-garden workers are responding more to such preaching  only those who have tasted a better life are the ones to demand more. The result of the last by-poll in Kalchini in Jalpaiguri shows to what extent the mood of protest has gained ground.        
	Not that tribal leaders among the Left parties lack sincerity. Their problem lies elsewhere. They find it difficult to assert themselves in parties dominated by Bengalis. The ordinary tribal has been seeing this happening for ages and is today increasingly convinced that his salvation lies in an organization entirely his own. Unlike in South Bengal, in the north it is not fear that has forced tribals to walk along an alternative course. They only want to carve out a niche for themselves where they will be the masters of their rights. So all of them are not willing to join hands with the GJM.        
	Elsewhere in North Bengal, there are the movements for a separate Kamtapur or Greater Cooch Behar. These have never flowered and are unlikely to do so as they do not enjoy popular support. But the issue of neglect should strike a chord. Even Left Front constituents have problems shoving it aside. Unhappiness had been building up in the Dooars for some time, but precious little is being done by the powers that be. They face a new problem now. A few months on, the ABAVP may prove to be a thorn on their sides, and not just in Kalchini.

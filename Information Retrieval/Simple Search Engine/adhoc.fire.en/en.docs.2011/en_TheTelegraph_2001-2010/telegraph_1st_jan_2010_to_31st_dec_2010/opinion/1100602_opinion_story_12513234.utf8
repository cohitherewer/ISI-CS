	Q: My father and later my grandfather expired intestate. Neither of them left any will or affidavit. What do I have to do to transfer their shares and bank balance into my account? What will the expenses be like?        
	S. Saraf, via e-mail        
	A: If you are the sole legal heir to your fathers and grandfathers assets you can apply before the district judges court with the appropriate jurisdiction, and obtain a succession certificate as per the provisions of The Indian Succession Act, 1925. Expenses will include court fees, advocates fees and other miscellaneous expenses and it will depend on the valuation of the assets claimed by you.        
	Q: I got married in February, 2009. My husband and his mother soon started abusing me, demanding money and also the gold jewellery given to me by my father. I finally left my husbands home in September, 2009, and returned to my parents. I want a divorce through mutual consent but my husband is not ready to give me a divorce. How should I proceed to get a divorce?        
	Name withheld        
	A: You could file a suit for divorce on grounds of physical and mental cruelty. You could also file an application for maintenance in the same suit. Simultaneously, you could file a criminal case under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code against your husband and mother-in-law, making them liable for punishment.         
	Q: I needed a house tax clearance certificate from the municipality. The municipality asked for tax receipts of 1984-85. Since I could not produce them, it now wants me to pay the taxes afresh with penalty. Is this legal? Is there any other way to check if any municipal tax is outstanding? How long should one preserve the tax receipts? Will I get a refund if it is established that I have been charged twice? The municipality provides unpaid details only from 1996-97.        
	Rita Bakshi, via email        
	A: You can apply to the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) for a no-objection or tax clearance certificate. The KMC will then furnish you with the details of all pending taxes, if any, including penalty charges, if any. You will get a refund if it is established that you have been charged twice. It is extremely important to preserve your tax receipts as municipal records may not be updated.

	Nothings fair in this war                  
	Sir  A lawyer attached to Britains foreign ministry has asserted that the Iraq war was contrary to international law as it had not been authorized by the United Nations security council. The invasion of Iraq was indeed unjustified. But a lot of people had hesitated to speak out because the worlds most powerful countries had teamed up against Iraq, and also because of the lies about the weapons of mass destruction. At last, some people are coming out with the truth about the war.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Mohammed Sadullah Khan, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia           
	Eyes wide shut          
	Sir  The report, Apology after ad showing enemy (Jan 25), was shocking. It is surprising as well as shameful to see the picture of a former Pakistani air force chief in an advertisement by the Indian government. This advertisement is unacceptable to many Indians who consider Pakistan an enemy country.           
	The goof-up reveals the utter carelessness of the women and child development ministry. It is interesting that even after such a huge blunder, the minister in charge of the department, Krishna Tirath, tried to downplay the faux pas initially. The government should be more responsible in the future, and certainly more sensitive to the emotions of the people.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Soumyendu Sekhar Roy, Bongaigaon, Assam 

                
	Sir  One of the reasons behind printing a former Pakistani air force chiefs photograph in an advertisement by the Indian government seems to be the laxity of the concerned authorities in reading the adverts carefully before approving them for publication. Although the prime ministers office has apologized for the mistake and ordered a probe into the matter, it is astonishing that the women and child development minister tried to justify the mistake made by her ministry, saying that the message is more important than the image. It is truly a shame for the nation.          
	The mistake may have been unintended, and it is also true that there is nothing wrong in depicting a foreign official in an ad to promote a humanitarian cause, but the strained relations between India and Pakistan makes this gaffe rather crucial. Tirath should be reprimanded for her comment, and her prime duty should be to find out how such an appalling error crept in.                    
	Yours faithfully,					Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad             
	Sir  The PMO deserves to be complimented for its frank apology to the nation for the blunder made by the ministry for women and child development, which printed the photograph of a former Pakistani air force chief, Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed, in an advertisement to commemorate National Girl Child Day. Krishna Tirath, too, apologized eventually. But at first she tried to justify her ministrys approval of the advertisement, and later, to shift the blame on the directorate of advertising and visual publicity. An impartial enquiry into the case should be conducted. Tiraths conflicting statements raise suspicions about the level of her involvement in the matter. In any case, ministers must own up to the mistakes made by their ministries.          
	It is also unfortunate that the Congress spokesperson, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, said that the media were creating an unnecessary hype over the issue, especially since he is respected as one of the most responsible members of the party. The blunder, no doubt, is a major one, but an admission of the mistake along with an honest apology may help settle matters.                    
	Yours faithfully,

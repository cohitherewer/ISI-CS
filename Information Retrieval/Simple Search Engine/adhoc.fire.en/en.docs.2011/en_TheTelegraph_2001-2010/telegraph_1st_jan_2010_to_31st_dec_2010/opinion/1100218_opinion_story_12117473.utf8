	The verbal assault on Iran launched by Hillary Clinton on her visit to Saudi Arabia indicates that the Obama administration is about to do what is fast becoming a habit with it  abandon the pre-election rhetoric and get realistic. As in Afghanistan, it is the resoluteness of the adversary that seems to be forcing its hand. Ever since the new regime took office, Washington has made a consistent effort to nudge Iran into giving up its belligerent nuclear stance rather than show muscle. There was much talk of mutual respect. Last year, the US joined five nations - the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China  to talk to Iran. Washington maintained a safe distance from Irans post-election troubles and presented it last year, together with the other United Nations members, a bagful of incentives in exchange for an agreement from Iran to have its uranium shifted to some other country for enrichment. Iran offered counter-proposals, hemmed and hawed, and finally reneged on the deadline of December 31, 2009, for the signing of the deal. Days before the 31st anniversary of the Islamic revolution last week, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced that Iran would enrich 20 per cent of its uranium in-house for its nuclear reactor in Tehran. This was clearly termed as an answer to the Wests impertinence  a rhetoric that the Ahmadinejad administration has consistently used to stoke nationalist fervour and, thereby, support for itself. On the eve of a national celebration, this was expected to work again, especially in order to give a decent burial to the anti-Ahmadinejad movement.        
	Irans imperatives behind reviving its nuclear mission are perhaps more obvious than the USs. There is intransigence on Irans part, but it is doubtful if the US would have got on to the war path without the pressure built up on it by Israel, which is feeling as threatened by Irans nuclear policy as by its recent arms build-up. Barring China, most of the international community feel Iran should be threatened with sanctions again. But they ought to keep in mind that Irans vast oil reserves, and the international leverage this gives it, make it less susceptible to pressure than North Korea. Besides, sanctions have always worked wonderfully for hostile governments and terribly for populations, whose interests the world powers swear to be protecting.

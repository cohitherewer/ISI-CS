	A national eligibility test is not a new concept. Those aspiring to teach in colleges and universities have to pass the Net in order to apply for the desired job. The Net was evolved in the 1980s to ensure a certain standard of competence at the entry level of lectureship and research. The same principle is now being activated for lawyers, who could hitherto have applied for their licence immediately after graduation. The Bar Council of India and the Union law ministry seem no longer sure that a good law student makes the best lawyer. It is a little ironical. The BCI grants recognition to the law schools and also approves their syllabi. Yet it has been compelled to recognize, it can be inferred, that the quality of training varies from school to school, even if the institutions have all the requirements for the BCIs recognition.         
	But is ensuring the quality of lawyers the governments job, or even the BCIs, even though the latter is a professional body? Lawyers have to sell their expertise in an open market; even their fees are decided by their competence or success. Lawyers in government positions have in any case to go through the standard procedures of selection, as do corporate lawyers. There are practical issues as well. What will those graduates, barred from taking their licence by failure in the test, then do with their professional training on which they have spent time and money? Vengefully write law notebooks for students and confuse them further? The investment in energy, planning and funds necessary for the national test could have been channelled into clearing the backlog in the courts and ensuring that practices like deliberate postponement of hearings are penalized. Perhaps the test will bring forth a crop of competent lawyers, and that will help in the long run. For lecturers, it is slightly different, for not only does the government pay their salaries, but there is also a real need to prevent the entry of totally incompetent, or unwilling, teachers. This is a pitiful commentary on the varying standards of degree-giving institutions and degree-getting practices, and the BCIs concern becomes understandable. What is not clear is the goal of the test. Now that the health ministry too is pondering such a test for doctors, the effects of the Net may be far-reaching. But the purpose of the test should be fully spelled out, for it will be different for each profession.

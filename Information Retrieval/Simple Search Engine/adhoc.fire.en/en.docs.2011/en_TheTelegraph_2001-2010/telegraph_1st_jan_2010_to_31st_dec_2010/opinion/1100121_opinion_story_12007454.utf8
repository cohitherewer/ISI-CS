The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | deemed unfit
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DEEMED UNFIT                                                    
	The term, deemed university, has always had an enigmatic ring. This phenomenon really took off during Murli Manohar Joshis tenure as human resource development minister, but deemed universities increased spectacularly in number during Arjun Singhs time. Although fairly new, these institutions gained the status of deemed universities by claiming that they needed a certain measure of autonomy to conduct research and teaching in frontier areas. That is, they did not wish to be tied down to the syllabi of the state universities to which they would otherwise be affiliated. To evolve a new tier of educational institutions simply to bypass the limitations of state university syllabi bears the marks of unthinking haste and an unwillingness to address educational reform seriously. Research and teaching that claim to be cutting-edge need no backdoor to enter the educational arena; they should emerge naturally through the development and modernization of the syllabi and teaching methods of all universities.        
	Now that the HRD ministry under Kapil Sibal has derecognized 44 deemed universities in 13 states for not living up to their claims, and for not even attempting to do so, the anomaly at the heart of the idea lies exposed. The ministry has asked a number of other such institutions to demonstrate their fitness for the label within three years if they do not wish to lose their status too. This approach may help clean up some of the laxity and deceit in one sphere of education, especially since the reforms Mr Sibal has promised are likely to do away with the deemed university label altogether. But the real sufferers are the students. What is truly painful is that thoughtless policies and ad hoc measures in the field of education, when backed by callousness and greed, make victims of the young people who come to educational institutions with trust and hope. Two of these institutions have received crores of rupees in grants from the government. It is those who bestowed the deemed university status on institutions unworthy of it, and those who asked for it and did not bother to live up to their commitments once they had acquired the label that are the real culprits. Although Mr Sibal has promised that not a single student will suffer  and perhaps they will not  they are still left with insecurity, devalued degrees and a sense of having been let down.

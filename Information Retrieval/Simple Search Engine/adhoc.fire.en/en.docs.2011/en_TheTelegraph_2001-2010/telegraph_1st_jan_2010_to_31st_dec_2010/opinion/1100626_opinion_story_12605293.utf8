	After four series of Katha Collages (programmes of dramatized short stories), Calcuttas premier Urdu troupe, Little Thespian, held a cumulative festival last week featuring four new stories. Uma Jhunjhunwala, the director of the new works, has gone some length to visually theatricalize them on stage, a technique I favour, unlike some of the earlier exercises in this form that directly narrated the text.        
	Premchands Bade Bhai Sahab, seen in such close proximity to the other three, proves the huge difference between an acknowledged classic and more ordinary material. This famous tale about the respect shown to and lessons learnt from an elder brother in school, though he himself fails academically, has become even more relevant to our educational rat-race today, to the extent that it should be compulsory reading in schools. It is neither preachy nor sentimental, but deep and enormously funny, and the production captures its soul very well, as a full complement of Little Thespians portray the kids racing around the playground and flying kites (picture), while Surendra Kapoor and Abhijeet Majumdar express the brothers relationship ably.        
	The paucity of Urdu drama had also caused the group to turn to Urdu short fiction for the Katha Collage project. Two of the new stories come from the oeuvre of senior Urdu authors, and both have a strong social conscience powering their narratives. Against the colourful picturizing of a Muslim wedding, Muzaffar Hanafis Bajjia Tum Kyon Roti Ho repudiates arranged betrothals to wealthy grooms by describing how one sisters marriage collapses, leading her younger sister (Nandini Panjiyara, a promising recruit) to reject a match with an asthmatic sexagenarian.        
	Iqbal Majids Suyion Wali Bibi bravely takes on Islamic spiritual chicanery. The eponymous preceptress gathers a large following with her exchange offer of a needle for each pair of scissors: she says that scissors represent the snipping of human ties whereas needles stitch them together, so she wants to remove all scissors as symbols of sin. When she dies, her chief disciple, tempted by the prospect of rich takings from the superstitious believers, replaces her by a cunning sleight of hand. Little Thespians main actresses, Uma Jhunjhunwala and Hiena Parwez, enact the leading characters in a room thick with incense and chanting. Ek Vrishchik Ki Diary, written by Sheo Kumar Jhunjhunwala, director of Proscenium, tells of a lady (Uma Jhunjhunwala and Parwez in a joint role) courted by a younger colleague (Surendra Kapoor) who leaves her for a new woman in the office (Nandini Panjiyara). Jealousy makes the Scorpio lady devise cruel revenge. Apart from the relatively simple triangle, the juvenile astrological angle devalues the possibility of seriousness.

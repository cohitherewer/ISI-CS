                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SHADOW OF DOUBT                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	It is embarrassing to see, hear and read about army generals, brigadiers and colonels merrily indulging in extra-curricular activities that merit explanation because they raise doubts about integrity of conduct. I come from an army family, and was brought up with stringent rules of personal behaviour and action, based on values that were formal and impeccable, when operating in the larger public domain. The armed forces were once deemed incorruptible and above degradation. There was a time when the chief of army staff was the symbol of all that is correct and clean. General K. M. Cariappa, General K.S. Thimayya, General P.P. Kumaramangalam, Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw and many others were awesome heroes, and had a special place in the psyche of the nation. Even the cantonments, the habitat of the army, extended and reflected that truth. They were pools of dignity in a fast deteriorating civilian cityscape where mal-governing municipalities had allowed dirt, filth and squalor to overwhelm us all.        
	There was a time when an army chief would have ordered an inquiry immediately had any doubt been raised about the integrity of an officer, regardless of all other factors. It would have been an internal matter, dealt with appropriately, ensuring and protecting the high moral standards of the army establishment. Gradually, the standards began to fall. Cover-ups, closing of ranks each time there was a dubious deal or action or when an officer stepped out of line and serious doubts were raised, reports of kickbacks on defence purchases ranging from specialized military equipment to coffins, boots and other commodities are all polluting the reputation of a force we were once proud of. The Indian army, one of the most reputed in the world with unmatched credentials, is being shrouded in doubt.                 
	Bell the cat        
	Why have our political leaders been lenient when corrupt practices were exposed? Who is going to bell the cat and put our armed forces back on track? As a patriotic citizen, I am appalled every time I hear a serving general, air marshal or admiral participating in a question-answer session on television. These officers, high and low, need to remain silent and do their duty, not indulge in public discourse on all manner of issues, getting into unnecessary verbal exchanges, debates and arguments, holding a brief for themselves, and passing judgment on political realities. Such interventions ought to be made by defence ministry spokespersons, correctly briefed, and no one else. Only elected representatives should be answering tricky probes and spouting their views on television.         
	There was a time, in the not-so-distant past, when bureaucrats were not permitted to attend parties at embassies and at the homes of corporate honchos. They had to abide by a code of conduct. Today, that tribe is constantly grabbing the airwaves to pontificate on this, that and the other, and extending support to their favoured entities.        
	Since the government appears reluctant to push the envelope on fundamental issues, maybe the Congress needs to force the hand of the United Progressive Alliance, as it did to enforce the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the Right to Information Act. These were the two most critical interventions that resonated positively in a moribund system. Sonia Gandhi needs to put pressure on her government and confront a bureaucracy that will vehemently oppose change and reform.        
	Our honourable traditions are being mutilated by a privileged few and ethics have gone out of the window. Ironically, a competent council of ministers is presiding over this dismal truth. Have our insular leaders suffocated in their security blankets, unable to see and hear, look and listen, comprehend and correct?

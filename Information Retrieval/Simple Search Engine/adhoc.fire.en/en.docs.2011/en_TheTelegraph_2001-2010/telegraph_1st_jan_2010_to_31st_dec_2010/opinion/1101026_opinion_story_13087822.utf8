	Pitch dark                  
	Sir  I was in one of the coaches of the Metro Railway that were derailed near Central station last Wednesday (Pride derailed, Oct 21). It was a harrowing experience. Soon after the mishap, we could see sparks flying from beneath the coach, which was filled with smoke. Everyone feared that there would be an explosion and the coach would catch fire. To add to the panic, it was pitch dark. People started shouting and moving in all directions. At that moment, I was convinced that we would not survive.          
	Somehow, one of the doors of the second coach was opened and people from the first few compartments poured out of the train, taking refuge on a small cement platform outside. Eventually, the emergency door in the drivers cabin was thrown open and the passengers were evacuated.           
	What happened in the Metro that day was one of the most frightening experiences I have ever had. It was a miracle that no one was seriously hurt. But it will be some time before I take the Metro again. The nightmarish images are still fresh in my mind.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashish Khatri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Wednesdays derailment has highlighted the magnitude of the problems plaguing the Calcutta Metro. Thankfully, no lives were lost that day. Nevertheless, as a regular commuter of the Metro, I can say that a disaster like this was just waiting to happen all these years. There has absolutely been no work on infrastructure and maintenance in the Metro for quite a while now.           
	Metro services have been extended across the city with much fanfare. However, not a single new rake has been added to the existing fleet to accommodate the added load of passengers. According to reports, the introduction of the new air-conditioned rakes necessitates a complete overhaul of the power system, but nothing seems to have been done in this regard.          
	Scheduled trains are cancelled every day. The compartments are so overcrowded that children and the elderly are often taken ill during trips. Most of the ticket turnstiles have stopped working, which means that people can pass through at will and get away without buying tickets. What used to be Calcuttas pride has now become a source of shame.          
	Perhaps it is time the West Bengal government, especially its chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, intervened in the running of the Metro Railway. Things must be set right before an even bigger disaster occurs. After all, the safety of common people is at stake here.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
P. Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  There is no denying that West Bengals pride has been dashed to the ground. There have been expressions of dismay from all quarters after the Metro coaches got derailed. Fingers have been pointed; Metro Railway officials have been accused of negligence and bad supervision. However, no concrete plan of action seems to have been formulated to address the problems.          
	West Bengal is said to have competent engineers and technicians. The ruling party in the state has been in power for almost 34 years now and, therefore, has had ample time to correct the glitches. Moreover, the state is the home turf of the Union railways minister, Mamata Banerjee. Given these facts, it is mystifying that the Metro Railway, as well as the railways in general in West Bengal, should be in an abysmal condition. Other states, with fewer advantages, manage to run the railways far more smoothly.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Diptimoy De, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The editorial, A city derailed (Oct 22), correctly observes that a combination of technical ignorance, administrative failure, political indifference and civic inertia is a sad and deadly one for a modern city.          
	In her capacity as the Union railways minister, Mamata Banerjee has been callous. She is, however, determined to win the West Bengal assembly elections in 2011. Taking advantage of the current situation, she accused the ruling Left Front government of sabotage, insinuating that it had caused the derailment to create panic. It will be appreciated if Banerjee pays attention to the safety of passengers instead of concocting conspiracy theories. Not just Calcutta but the entire state could be adversely affected by Banerjees immature brand of politics.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Although Mamata Banerjee has dismissed Wednesdays Metro accident as minor, the incident has caused widespread panic among commuters. The Metro in Calcutta has long been the most convenient and affordable mode of transport. However, commuters should realize that like any other system based on technology, the Metro is susceptible to trouble. Even the most sophisticated transport systems can break down at times.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Festive gloom          
	Sir  It was shocking to hear that 30 cobbler families in Gangadhari village in Naoda have not been allowed to take part in the festivities during Durga Puja for decades, just because they belong to a lower caste (Caste bar on Puja festivity, Oct 16).          
	This incident reflects religious bigotry of almost criminal proportions. All people have the right to visit pandals. Denying those 30 families entry is a violation of basic human dignity. Stern action should be taken against the organizers of the Pujas. The caste system is one of the most unfortunate aspects of Hinduism. No effort should be spared in wiping out such shameful practices.                    
	Yours faithfully,

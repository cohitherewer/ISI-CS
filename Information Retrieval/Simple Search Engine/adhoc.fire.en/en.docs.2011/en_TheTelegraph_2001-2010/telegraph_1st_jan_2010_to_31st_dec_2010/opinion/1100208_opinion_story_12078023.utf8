                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GRAIN OF TRUTH                                                    
	A few weeks delay in the onset of the last monsoon set off a sharp spike in rice prices. This accidental event activated a sequence that has been seen many a time but continues to be endlessly repeated. First came the reassurance from the government that inflation will come down. Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a key figure in the post-election policy establishment, even put a date to the decline, namely January. January has come and gone, and there is no respite from inflation. Unfazed, he has repeated his assurance, but postponed the date to the middle of February. In a week we will know whether he will take a further postponement or not.        
	While advisers dilly-dally, politics moves on. When the prime minister invited chief ministers to work with him in controlling prices, what he got instead was an unholy row, led by protectors of the holy cow. The chief minister of Gujarat wanted to know where the grains had gone which he was to be given to sell to his poor at three rupees a kilogram. He was told that he would get it after the drought had passed. While politicians may continue to squabble, the common man will want to know why foodgrain prices should rise while the government is sitting on at least 35 million tons. The politicians will not give him the answer, but they do not keep stocks to stabilize prices. They empty their food banks only to fill vote banks. The present government has single-mindedly used foodgrains to please those whom it considers below the poverty line. As the nation has prospered, the proportion of the poor has shrunk, and so has the number of those who can be pleased. This has put the government in such a panic that it is looking for a new poverty line.        
	But the real reason why the government prefers food rationing to food price stabilization is that rationing creates enormous opportunities for food diversion. An unknown proportion of ration cards is bogus. The foodgrain sold on those ration cards finds its way to the open market; and the profit margin on the diverted grains is enormous. The profits go to middlemen, including political middlemen. This business faces only one threat: if ever there was a food surplus, market prices would crash and profits of diversion would turn into losses. But the rulers have insured themselves against this risk. They have the Food Corporation of India buy up the marketed surplus so that the market will never be overstocked. This is why prices can never come down. When government spokesmen from the prime minister down make a promise, it is not a promise to make food cheaper; it is a promise to make it costlier more slowly. And they do not have to keep that promise; they only have to renew it for a future date.

	The question of Indias claim to be a fitting candidate for a permanent seat on the United Nations security council has resurfaced strongly in media columns in connection with President Barack Obamas forthcoming visit and the less-than-fulsome support of the United States of America to the candidature.        
	Every international organization has to change and adapt if it is to survive. Many, if not most, international organizations are languishing, their utility long exhausted, although their constituent members, for a variety of reasons, decline to kill them off. It may be salutary to remember that even moribund multilateral organizations are rarely formally disbanded as was the League of Nations in 1946  after it had been completely inactive for seven years.        
	But the UN shows versatility, and that is why it is still relevant. No one would have imagined four decades ago that the UN would one day observe elections in many parts of the world, engage in successful conflict resolution in places like Cambodia and East Timor, that there would be as many as 65 peacekeeping operations since 1948, that tribunals would be set up for crimes against humanity, that there would be an International Criminal Court and that the UN would engage in massive relief and rehabilitation efforts in natural disasters like the Pakistan floods or in war-torn countries like Sudan. The UN is the only global organization and its reform and restructure are questions ultimately bearing on global governance. The UN has adapted its mandates and methodologies considerably over the decades and will continue to do so, but changing and adapting is a different matter from fundamental reform and restructuring.              
	The issues raised in the debate on UN reform relate to questions of decision-making, process, transparency and accountability, and with these, the related matters of monitoring and evaluation. These are indeed very difficult issues to resolve when it comes to dealing with sovereign states. Basically, there is a democratic deficit at the international level. In the most serious case, the issue of peace and security, which is in the almost exclusive purview of the UN security council, the UN Charter has all too often been subverted by the influence of one permanent member, thereby damaging the councils credibility.        
	When reform of the UN is discussed, every country will agree that changes are required but no two countries will agree on what those changes should be. The least developed, the developing, the small states, the landlocked, the industrialized and the emerging countries  all have different agendas that serve their own interests. This is what makes it impossible to reach a consensus. The countries making the loudest noise for transparency are the same ones that block the reform process and lobby hardest for their unsuitable candidates to find jobs in the UN system.        
	It is easy to point to waste and inefficiency in many UN agencies and organs, some of which have budgets only big enough to pay for the salaries of their own staff. For example, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan has been in existence from 1949 and is the oldest peace-keeping mission of the UN, though it is not called that. Few people in India and Pakistan are aware of its existence or what it is meant to do.        
	It would obviously be good to eliminate some agencies and set up others with new mandates relevant to the contemporary world. For example, a new UN agency to deal with energy, water and the equitable sharing of our global commons is overdue. It would be a step in the right direction to have a UN economic council to supplement the UN security council, and a new umbrella body called the United Nations Agency for International Development, which could coordinate the development work of the UN and supplement the Bretton Woods financial institutions.        
	The Bretton Woods institutions  the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and now the World Trade Organization  were conceived as part of the UN family. Their governing structure is heavily weighted in favour of the industrialized countries although their clientele has always been almost exclusively from the developing world. Very recently, the voting power of emerging economies like India and China has obtained a slightly higher quota, but both nations combined still total less than 10 per cent. This is clearly anachronistic and requires revision in keeping with the changed world order. The same argument applies to the UN security council.        
	The expansion of the UN security council to include India as a permanent member because of its size, population, democracy and contribution to UN peace-keeping is fully logical. India formally proposed its inclusion as a permanent member for the first time in 1994, when this writer was foreign secretary. It was in the same year that Japan made a similar claim. Both India and Japan were then, not coincidentally, in a competition for a non-permanent seat on the council, and both are still waiting in the wings for permanent membership.        
	The government of India has expended a great deal of time, energy and financial resources on enlisting support throughout the world. When the time comes, it will come because Indias stature as an essential country, whose voice is required and respected, is recognized by everyone. In other words, when India no longer needs to even make a case. For many reasons, most of which have nothing to do with India, that time is not yet ripe. But this matter still obsesses the Indian media, for example, when the Indian president visited China recently and when Chinas response, whatever the media may have reported, was ambiguous, if not discouraging.        
	Restructuring the UN security council will need an amendment of the UN Charter, which is the constitution of the UN. This is a very difficult procedure requiring the approval of two-thirds of the membership of the UN and the consent of all five permanent members of the council, apart from the ratification by due constitutional process of all members. The process for considering amendment to the charter itself requires two-thirds of the general assembly and nine votes of the security council. Therefore, the charter has only been amended a handful of times in its sixty-five-year history, the last time in 1973.              
	Changes in structure without amending the charter have allowed the security council to take decisions even if the permanent members abstained instead of voting in favour. Take the admission of China instead of Taipeh in 1971 and Russia taking the place of the Soviet Union in 1991. The rules of procedure of various UN bodies have been repeatedly modified. But there are no short-cuts to expanding the numbers of permanent or non-permanent members of the council.         
	The fundamental point about Indias prospects for permanent membership is that the outcome will have to be a package deal  one not only about India but also involving many countries covering all the continents. Permanent membership is not in the gift of any one country, however powerful it may be. There will have to be give-and-take, bargains will have to be struck, and no country will get full satisfaction. The reality is that there is no global consensus at present on expanding the council or on which specific countries it should include. The day will undoubtedly come when India will be a permanent member, and there is no need for us to constantly supplicate about this. We should build our own strength and credibility, address our weaknesses, and maintain our dignity. When the time is right, we will be welcomed in. We will not have to try and force the door open.

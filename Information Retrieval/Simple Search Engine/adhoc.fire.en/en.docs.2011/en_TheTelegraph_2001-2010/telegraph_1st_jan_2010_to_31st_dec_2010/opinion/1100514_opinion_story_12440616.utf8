The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time To Clean The Act
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO CLEAN THE ACT                                  Malvika Singh                              
	It would be a most heartening summer gift if the prime minister cracks the whip and makes sure that A. Raja and the other allegedly tainted ministers resign from the cabinet like Shashi Tharoor was made to do. The signal to the people of India will be salutary. If a leader stands apart and emphatically calls for integrity, probity and transparency in governance, this country will support that individual regardless of all else. It is far more appropriate to lead a minority government and openly join the fight against corruption, which has managed to infiltrate every aspect of our lives. If the government has to be dissolved because its leader is opposed to corrupt practices, so be it. India, in its turn, will bring that individual and the party back to power with resounding numbers.        
	The perception that corruption is acceptable because of the need to stay in power is detrimental to civil society and the moral fibre of our country. We have become hopelessly ungovernable because of the selfishness of a few, and also because national laws are regularly broken by the very authority that is mandated to abide by them in an effort to facilitate rapacious, illegal corporate business interests. We have, over the last few decades, managed to corrode our administrative and political systems to a point where it is embarrassing to be associated with the system that regulates the lives of honest Indians.        
	Surely the honourable individuals who lead the United Progressive Alliance and the Congress would want to rectify the breakdown and renew the pledge made at Independence. This is the right moment. The citizens of India are sick and tired of being exploited in some manner, ranging from the growing Naxal protest to upheavals in civil society in our towns and cities. With the exception of the political class and the administrative services, there is no segment of the population that is satisfied with basic governance.                
	Ugly picture        
	In Delhi, ugly elements overwhelm us all. Municipalities are corrupt and demeaning; law enforcement is abysmal as protection is earmarked for those breaking the law and not for the law-abiding citizens; the chief minister is helpless and cannot be made accountable because every department has been divided into sections that are ruled by different institutional heads which perpetuates divisiveness. Moreover, there is no administrative cohesion because of a myriad bosses who live with daggers drawn at our expense; and, elected representatives behave in an uncouth, unacceptable way in Parliament. Never has India been so deeply insulted.        
	The time has come to call a spade a spade. Morality should triumph over the need to sit on the treasury benches and hold India to ransom. It is unethical and unfair to exploit the ethos of this civilization and reduce it to mire because a handful of people need to be protected from the law. It is sad to see how business interests influence government decisions despite stringent regulations. This gross misuse of development has and will continue to destroy our land and rob us of our natural resources. I cannot comprehend why and how parents (ministers too have children) poison the environment for their progeny in return of a few crores.        
	If only our rulers did not isolate themselves in their ivory towers, they would know what the ordinary, honest people of India think of their decisions as well as of the court rulings. Symbolically speaking, the red light on the cars of the men and women who rule, and the clearing of roads for their passage, have alienated them from India. People across all economic and social strata swear when these VIP cars pass them by. What a depressing truth. Do we need a mother goddess to nurture and renew India?

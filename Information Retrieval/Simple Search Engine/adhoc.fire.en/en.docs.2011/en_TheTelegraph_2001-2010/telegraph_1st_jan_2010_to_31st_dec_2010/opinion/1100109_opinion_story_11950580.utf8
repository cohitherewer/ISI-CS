	Dam of contention                  
	Sir  The Mullaperiyar dam stands for life as well as death for the people of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. On the one hand, its water is vital for irrigation, while on the other, several families live under the threat of being washed away in case the dilapidated dam collapses. However, the leaders of the two states are yet to reach a consensus on whether the level of water in the reservoir should be raised. Both states must try and resolve this issue amicably. The two chief ministers must not shy away from their responsibilities and participate in the talks.          
	Yours faithfully,         K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala
                
	Twice unlucky          
	Sir  The death of two research scholars in a fire inside a chemical lab at the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre in Trombay is disturbing (Barc fire kills researchers, Dec 30). It is sad that in the span of a month, two mishaps have taken place in two separate atomic research centres in India  last month, around 50 employees of the Kaiga nuclear power plant drank water spiked with toxic tritium from a cooler, and then a fire took the lives of two budding scientists in Trombay. Sabotage cannot be ruled out in either case because atomic research centres and power stations have been known to be targets for terrorist attacks for a long time now.           
	The government of India should depute the Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the present case, and unveil the truth behind the tragedy.          
	Yours faithfully,        A.K. Chatterjee, Konnagar, Hooghly
      
	Richly spoken  
	Sir  According to several books and yearbooks in circulation, Assamese is the easternmost Indo-European language. But it would be worthwhile to note that this language is also the westernmost of the Tibeto-Burmese languages. The Tibeto-Burmese languages that are spoken among the various ethnic groups in the northeastern region of India have heavily influenced the phonetics and pronunciation of Assamese.          
	The study of Assamese is interesting not only because it is ranked 40th in the world in terms of the number of speakers who use this language, but also because it represents a confluence of Indo-European and Tibeto-Burmese linguistic elements.          
	Usually dictionaries, especially those prepared by persons with a background in Sanskrit literature, ignore the colloquial idiom spoken in the villages of Assam. Therefore, it is quite incredible that Nathan Brown, in his writings in Arunodoi, an Assamese journal he started in 1946, stresses on the words spoken by the common people in their day-to-day conversations. Bikram Baruah also needs to be congratulated for his attempt to preserve some of the Assamese words in their chaste and original form in his online dictionary, Xobdo.org.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Checks and balances  
	Sir  Ruchir Joshis anecdotes in his article, Flight in security (Jan 3), about the stringent airport security measures he had to encounter on his several trips, reminded me of a similar experience I had with the security personnel at the Delhi airport at the height of the Punjab agitation in the country. In Joshis case, it was a tennis ball that did not pass through the security scan, whereas the incriminating object in my case was a bag of chikoos, for which Delhi is famous. I was informed that since the fruit was round in shape, it could not be allowed on the flight, as it could be mistaken for a bomb. In the end, I had to crush the fruits and throw them away because the airport authorities stuck to their ridiculous logic.          
	Yours faithfully,        H.N. Ramakrishna, Bangalore

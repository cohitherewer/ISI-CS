The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | At a new starting line

	A person who has served at very elevated levels in our security apparatus has disclosed that he could never have imagined, 18 months ago, the extent of cooperation that now exists with Bangladesh. But nothing should be taken for granted because the road ahead will neither be straight nor smooth. To illustrate the complexities of Indo-Bangladesh relations, one has only to recall that seven Muslim so-called leaders in West Bengal objected to a Bangladeshi diplomats posting in Calcutta because he denounced the atrocities against Hindus perpetrated in Bangladesh by his fellow Muslims, or the demand by Taslima Nasreen, a Bangladeshi author known for controversial comments on Islamic practices, to be allowed to settle in Calcutta, which she likes to call her spiritual home, as if India is obliged to give her shelter and that in a location of her choice.        
	During the visit of the Bangladesh prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, to New Delhi last January, India extended a line of credit of one billion dollars on Asian Development Bank terms to upgrade Bangladesh infrastructure, showed readiness to construct the Akhaura-Agartala rail link, provide 250 megawatts per day from the Indian power grid, and deferred plans to construct the 1,500 MW Tipaimukh hydroelectric dam on the Barak in Manipur, which, Bangladesh feels, would affect it adversely. It was agreed that border markets would be set up along the Bangladesh-Meghalaya border and land customs posts on the Mizoram border. Forty-seven commodities were removed from the negative list, despite concern about the price of imported raw jute jumping 120 per cent during April-November, 2009, after being allowed into India duty-free.        
	Bangladesh promised India access to the Ashuganj inland port, and India, Nepal and Bhutan access to deep-water ports at Mongla and Chittagong. It was willing to revive old land-border rail transit points, and agreed there would be no hostile activity against India from its soil. An extradition treaty is to be negotiated which might conclude the long-standing case of Anup Chetia, founder of the United Liberation Front of Asom, who was imprisoned in Dhaka with the intention of frustrating his extradition to India. A joint boundary group would address the land border, and a team from Bangladesh would discuss the maritime boundary, although Dhaka has already initiated proceedings for arbitration under the United Nations Law of the Sea.        
	Hasina declared herself cent per cent satisfied with her visit. Since then, Hindus welcomed a Dhaka High Court order that land confiscated by ruling party activists must be returned. The same court has barred educational institutions from enforcing burqas on unwilling women. Dhaka has requested Tatas to resume talks on their proposed investment in steel, fertilizer and power stalled by the previous regime. A Rs 5,000 crore joint venture in Chalna comprising a 1,320 MW coal-based thermal power plant is to be commissioned in two years. Suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed, Jamaatul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Toiba militants, some of them Pakistanis, have been arrested and the founder of the outlawed National Democratic Front of Bodoland has been rendered to India. But there is more to be accomplished here, since dozens of terrorist cells are still operative in Bangladesh.        
	As Hasina commented on the negative mindset among certain Bangladeshi circles: Perhaps that may remain; I cannot change that. But common people want better lives and if results are achieved, these sentiments will not work. The predictable criticisms levelled by Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami, accuse Hasina of surrender and sell-out, and the Dhaka Daily Star editor has expressed deep scepticism whether India has yet moved towards a larger vision of cooperation. It is claimed that Indias biggest concerns were security and connectivity in the Northeast, and while Bangladesh was responsive to both, India was niggardly about Dhakas priorities, such as sharing the Teesta, anxieties downstream of Tipaimukh, reducing the trade imbalance, and the maritime boundary.        
	It is ludicrous, but typical of the profound malaise in South Asia, that any country can regard as a great favour to a neighbour the curbing of agents of trans-border terrorism on its soil. This argument totally lacks both moral and political validity. The grant of facilities for transit for India, Nepal and Bhutan will benefit Bangladesh hugely both in revenue terms and in improving its infrastructure: it is therefore welcome that the first steps have been taken towards new legal frameworks needed for multi-modal connectivity, by which Bangladesh can be a transport service hub for the whole region. Dhaka should also aspire to become the centre for air links with the Northeast, Nepal and Bhutan.        
	Other criticisms have a stronger basis. If India permits duty-free import of Bangladeshi goods, the fiscal loss is estimated variously between $15 million and $50 million, a trifle compared to the goodwill created. Some 480 items continue to remain on the negative list, thanks to the protectionist mindset of Indian bureaucrats and businessmen. However, some 4,700 items are on the duty-free list and the Bangladeshi business community is not exploiting the existing opportunities. The way forward is towards joint ventures with Indian companies for exports to India, such as investment by Bharti Airtel in a Dhaka telecommunications company, and 100 per cent export-oriented projects by Tatas for manufacture of shoes and cycles. Congestion, primitive procedures, lack of financial connectivity and corruption plague the main Benapole-Petrapole land route, and encourage smuggling, the value of which is equivalent to the annual legal trade of $3.5 billion. These obstacles must be removed, but solutions require action on both sides of the border.         
	Firing by the Border Security Force, resulting in Bangladeshi casualties, is a highly sensitive issue and causes grave provocation. Deterrence for a few cattle smugglers and illegal immigrants is not worth the embarrassment caused to Indian sympathizers in Bangladesh nor the revulsion this generates. The BSF director-general must be made accountable, pointedly reminded of the changed political circumstances and of the probability of cooperation on security issues being jeopardized by his indisciplined and trigger-happy subordinates. Such incidents of firing by the BSF must be terminated forthwith on pain of severe chastisement.        
	The lowest flows of the river Teesta are 4,000 cubic feet per second, whereas the canal system in India alone requires 4,400; Bangladesh is asking for nothing less than a 50:50 split of the waters at the border, and West Bengal is a critical third party in this dispute. The joint rivers commission concluded without agreement because actual availability of flow on particular dates is yet to be determined  sadly reminiscent of the interminable Farakka dispute. The Tipaimukh project may cause anxieties downstream, but considering that it is for flood control, irrigation, and run-of-the-river hydroelectricity, any Indian concession to suspend work may be considered on our side of the border as an unwarranted sacrifice. Common rivers require common and constant address if they are not to be contentious, whereas if the two countries can cooperate they could make joint approaches to upper riparians for advantageous uses of Himalayan rivers in China, Nepal and Bhutan.        
	The land and maritime boundaries with Bangladesh should be settled. On the former, only 6.5 kilometres remain, but this task includes the complicated exchange of adverse possessions and enclaves. On the latter, following the example of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we should cooperate on exploration for hydrocarbons on a bilateral or trilateral basis, including Myanmar, even pending a formal settlement.              
	For the first time in nearly 40 years, the ball was in New Delhis court, and Manmohan Singh has risen to the occasion. It can be agreed that the onus is on India to undertake the heavy lifting. New Delhi must make its priorities clear to construct a new type of relationship. As Hasina pertinently said: India is a big, strong country. It should look after neighbouring countries on an equal basis. In other words, she appealed for mutual respect. This was more than evident during her visit, perhaps as much as the current political traffic could bear. If this is regarded as a starting line and not the finishing tape, the prospects are encouraging and the outline of an Indo-Bangladesh roadmap of cooperation until 2018 is visible. It would be good, for its part, if Bangladesh did not appear like Oliver Twist, always asking for more. What is needed now is an empowered bilateral monitoring group to clear away impediments and report on progress directly to both prime ministers. When the gods are smiling, it is time to be extra vigilant.

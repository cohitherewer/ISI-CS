                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        QUITE ABSURD                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	Once upon a time, there was a British hotel company, huge but still family-run, called the Forte Group after its founder, one Charles Forte. Then, in 1996, it was taken over by a conglomerate called Granada. The new owners learnt that in Winchester, a city 70 miles from London, there was also a little place called the Forte Tea Rooms. Though it was no competition whatever, Granada decided to lean on it.        
	They ordered its owner to stop using their name, or else. He refused, pointing out that it wasnt their name he was using, but his: he too was called Forte. Granada huffed and puffed, but then, surprisingly for a group silly and arrogant enough to start this pointless affair, backed off.         
	End of story? Of this example, yes, but not of the topic. For nonsense like this is no rarity. Trade names matter, OK. But how far their owners will go to protect them! When Woolworths, a large British retailer, went bust in 2008, one manager leased her former store, renamed it Wellworths and began selling again. OK, said the eventual new owners of the Woolworths name, but for only one shop. Now she wants to expand. But they use Woolworths for online retailing. So they have leaned on her.         
	Absurdly so. For a start, her shop is indeed a shop, not a website. And even if it were such, no one would access Wellworths by typing in Woolworths, nor vice versa. Because  maybe youve noticed, even if the new owners didnt  the two names are different. That is doubly evident on her shops fascia, utterly unlike the old Woolworths one. Only an idiot could confuse the two businesses. Yet she has had to rename hers, rather than face months of wasted time and lawyers bills. Storms in a British teacup, you may think. Not so. English itself can be in danger when intellectual-property lawyers get to work.         
	Their nightmare is that a trademark may get into generic use. Many have. English-speakers have talked for generations about jeeps and tarmac. More recently theyve learnt to xerox documents, listen to a walkman and now to google words. Western housewives would hoovering their carpets or put hot coffee in a thermos in the 1930s. India is no slouch in this habit. For decades its middle classes have used names like colgate, cutex, flit, fridgidaire, surf and vim as generic terms.         
	Yet all these words are trademarks. So you must never use them generically, any IP lawyer will say. And if you insist, then at least always give them a capital letter: Hoover, not hoover. Fair enough, if youre selling some off-road vehicle as a jeep, or a vacuum cleaner as a hoover; indeed, if it isnt the genuine article youre not just misusing a name but also breaking the law. But except in a sales context, nonsense. Whether or not a trademark, in law, has become generic, for nearly all purposes you may use it as you please. And write it with no initial capital: to obey the lawyers on that point is to trample on the English language.        
	This doesnt stop the lawyers trying  thats their job, after all. Even in Indian newspapers Ive met zealously protected Tarmac used in a purely generic sense yet with a capital T. In Britain thats habitual; any paper that doesnt capitalize the word will be sternly told to do so, and, quite wrongly, will tell its sub-editors accordingly. So I was delighted recently to read of cracked Tarmac. Thatll teach them, I thought. It wont, of course. Still, theres a nice postscript to the Forte tale. The huge hotel group is dead; the little tea-room is still serving, under its old name. Yet theres a twist too. After his fathers empire was taken over, son Rocco Forte, by then its boss, set up a hotel company of his own. But for five years  until the Forte names latest owners, newly demerged from Granada, relented, saying it had no value for them  he couldnt use his own family name for his own company.

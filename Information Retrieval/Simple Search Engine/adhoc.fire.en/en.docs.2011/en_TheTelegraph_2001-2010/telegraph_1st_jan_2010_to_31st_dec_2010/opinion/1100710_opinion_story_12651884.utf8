	Role model                  
	Sir  Nainamvalappu, a village in Kerala, should be hailed as a model for the rest of India  especially West Bengal  to follow (Kerala village defies call, July 6). We always lament about the helplessness of the aam aadmi when it comes to defying bandhs called by political parties. But the people of Nainamvalappu have proved that by remaining united and determined, even ordinary people can disobey such political decisions. I wish that this news item was given more prominence than the one that dealt with Mahendra Singh Dhonis wedding.           
	Yours faithfully,         Manju Mohandas, Calcutta
        
	Shocking exit          
	Sir  The supporters of Brazil and Argentina must have been shocked by their teams early, and unexpected, departure from the World Cup (From studs to duds, big guns face flak, July 5). But the truth behind the debacle must be analysed. The downfall of the two Latin American giants, renowned for their supremacy in world football, was brought about by their own complacency and disdain for their formidable rivals. Germany has a long footballing tradition, and its soccer team is known for its indomitable fighting spirit. Their demolition of Argentina can be attributed to teamwork. The magic of Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona failed against the fast-moving German players. Germany set things rolling by scoring the opening goal. The strike, which came early in the game, demoralized the Argentine team completely.           
	The supremacy of Latin American teams in football may end very soon. The blame must go to their thoughtless strategies and the simultaneous progress made by European nations such as Spain and Holland that have reached the finals of the World Cup.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Dilip Kumar Kar, Pabitrapara, Jalpaiguri            
	Sir  In my opinion, the kind of football that Brazil played during the World Cup was not expected of them. They had an excellent start to the tournament. But in the matches that followed, Brazils showing was not up to the mark. Slowly but surely, Brazil started losing momentum and their poor performance resulted in an early exit.           
	Brazils loss was sad and difficult to bear. It is true that no team plays to lose. But the World Cup has lost its flavour, now that my favourite team has bowed out.          
	Yours faithfully,

	New hope  
	Sir  It is heartening to note that the Planning Commission has decided to pump 14,000 crore to support social and physical infrastructure in all the 35 Maoist-hit districts of India (Rs 14000 crore Maoist balm, July 6).           
	The funds will go a long way in developing these impoverished regions by helping build roads and providing electricity, elementary education and healthcare services. The proposed levy fund will further assist in sustaining these programmes till the time the districts become self-reliant. If implemented properly, the plan will undoubtedly reduce the violence, hatred and mistrust that have inflicted untold misery on the population.          
	Furthermore, the measure will also set a precedent for other neglected regions of the globe where indigenous people are being subjected to the resource curse. In these areas, locals continue to live in abject poverty while the natural resources are being plundered by politicians and entrepreneurs. Hopefully, the plan will become successful soon.           
	Yours faithfully,         Rathindranath Das, Calcutta

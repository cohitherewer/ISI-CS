The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The man behind the ghost
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE MAN BEHIND THE GHOST                          - A nineteen-year-olds prison diary        Politics and Play: Ramachandra Guha                                                                    
	Book release functions tend to be about the living, the famous, and the soon-to-be-famous. Liquor flows freely. Many come not to listen, but to be seen, and hopefully to be photographed. But recently in Bangalore I attended a different kind of book release. For one thing, it was held in the morning. For another, it offered coffee and upma before the event, rather than whisky and chicken sandwiches afterwards. For a third, the author was dead. For a fourth, although the book was undoubtedly written by him, he had no intention of having it published.        
	This posthumous publication was the prison diary of a 19-year-old resident of Mysore who had been arrested for his role in the Quit India movement of 1942. The diarist was H.Y. Sharada Prasad, who was then a student leader in Maharajas College, Mysore, but who in later life became the press adviser to, and speechwriter for, successive prime ministers. In his native Karnataka there has always been an ambivalence about the public career of Sharada Prasad. To be sure, Indira Gandhis speeches were undoubtedly more literate  not to say literary  because of the work he put into them. The prime ministers office would also have been a more humane place for his presence  among the sycophants and intriguers, at least here was one honest, decent, upright and always patriotic man. Still, among his many friends in Bangalore and Mysore there persisted the feeling that he, and we, would have been better off had he written books and essays under his own name. After his retirement, he wrote a most readable column in The Asian Age. But by now he was too old to have the energy to write full-length books.              
	His prison diary, lovingly edited for publication by Sugata Srinivasaraju, offers glimpses of what Sharada Prasad could have contributed to the worlds of literature and scholarship had he not allowed himself to become a speechwriter for prime ministers. He writes here about being torn between communism and Gandhism, the contrasting poles that then, as now, competed for the attentions of the intelligent and sensitive young Indian. He says, in one revealing entry, that I am departing more and more from the sloppish sentimentalism, shallowness and hypocrisy that form the bulk of the Congresss frame of mind. In another entry, written in February 1943 while Mahatma Gandhi was on a fast in prison in Pune, Sharada Prasad remarks that Gandhis life, sacred as it is, unique as it is, is not too great a price to be paid for the independence of our country and for the crumbling of an empire.        
	This was prophetic. Gandhi survived his fast in 1943, but five years later he was murdered by a religious fanatic. His death led to the cessation of Hindu-Muslim conflict and to a reconciliation between his two most important followers, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel, then prime minister and home minister of India respectively. Thus Gandhis life, sacred and unique though it was, was yet not too great a price to be paid for the restoration of communal peace and the building of a united and democratic India.        
	Also perceptive are Sharada Prasads comments on the personality and ideas of Subhas Chandra Bose. He says, of a book of Boses, that the style just manages to keep above the ordinary and the commonplace. There is not much compactness nor an all pervading and relieving idealism. Rambling is the word for Bose Carefully avoiding ethical and theoretical considerations, his writings remind one of the I[ndian] C[ivil] S[ervice] answer paper style. (Boses style is indeed workaday at best, and dull at worst; unlike Gandhi and Nehru, whose prose was so very appealing, albeit in different ways.) Sharada Prasad then says, of Boses political choices: The most amazing part of it all is how on earth Subhas has joined the camp of the rapacious marauders  the Fascist Japanese whose aim is to annihilate China.        
	The 19-year-old diarist writes insightfully about politics and politicians, and about plain humanity. Consider this comparison of prison-mates with travelling companions: Jail friends are like railway friends. The difference is one of degree; you meet them, know them for a while and part at odd times and scatter away. Rarely do you meet again. You retain a few impressions; and outside you recognize them with difficulty. In jail, you are almost equals. Outside, the difference is vast.        
	Sharada Prasad was studying for an honours degree in English literature at the time he was imprisoned. In his diary, he reflects on what life in jail would do for his appreciation of literature and language. While teaching poetry to a fellow prisoner named Venugopal, he realized how soon I had forgotten my Honours learning. I am also getting to feel that my appreciation of poetry now will not be as aesthetic or half as aesthetic as a year ago. Those were days of Arcadian hedonism. But now the consciousness that life is not poetry or music but stomach, stomach and stomach, illiteracy, ignorance, egotism, prejudice, jealousy and envy come home to me.        
	Reading this extraordinary diary, one has to remind oneself again and again that the writer was not yet 20. Fortunately, while jail taught Sharada Prasad that there was more to life than literature, he returned in time to poetry and music, which had perhaps a less important place than economics or politics, but a place nonetheless. Moreover, while (as the young student understood) human behaviour is often characterized by ignorance, egotism, prejudice, jealously and envy, there are a few, very few, individuals who are themselves unmarked by these traits. One such individual was Sharada Prasad himself.              
	I had got to the end of the book when I realized that in these few months in jail, the teenager had been reading works in five languages  English, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, and Sanskrit. (There might also have been a sixth  his mother tongue, Telugu.) This was characteristic. By the time I came to know him, Sharada Prasad was in his seventies  and he still carried his learning very lightly.        
	Along with this love of languages went a very wide range of interests in politics, literature, music, history, even sport. Sharada Prasads father was a notable composer in the Carnatic style, and he himself counted, amongst his close friends the great vocalists, Mallikarjun Mansur and Gangubai Hangal. Also a friend, and perhaps a mentor, was the Kannada polymath Shivarama Karanth, whose autobiography and some of whose stories Sharada Prasad translated into English. For the rest, his extraordinary learning was subsumed within his official duties and, after retirement, in his newspaper columns. This posthumously published diary hints at the kinds of books that he might have written had he not strayed into other professions. It is good to have it in print  and good to know too that there may be more diaries and letters awaiting exhumation and publication. The speeches that Sharada Prasad wrote for Indira and Rajiv Gandhi were of the moment  whereas the words he wrote for himself were quite often for all time.

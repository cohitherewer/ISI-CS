                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STEP OUT OF LINE, PLEASE                                  While India extends special privileges to American passport-holders, Washington pays scant respect even to Indian diplomats, writes Abhijit Bhattacharyya                          Spot the difference                                  
	The USA is doing inefficient and completely redundant airport checks and governments should stop kowtowing to the Americans every time they wanted something done to beef the security on US-bound flights, especially when this involved checks the US did not impose on its own domestic routes. America does not do internally a lot of the things they demand that we do.... We should not stand for that. We should say, we will only do things which we consider to be essential and that you Americans also consider essential.        
	One wonders about the identity of this individual who has been quoted here. Is he/she a Chinese diplomat, criticizing the American security system? An official spokesman of North Korea in the United Nations? A rabble-rouser from al Qaida or an envoy from Tehran? Or was this statement made by a budding Bengali politician before a municipal election?        
	These remarks were made by Martin Broughton, the chairman of British Airways, at the annual conference of the Airport Operators Association in London. Londons airline chief added that the practice of forcing people to take off their shoes and have their laptops checked separately in security lines should be ditched.         
	In fact, the United States of America has already created enough problems by quietly extending security restrictions on air cargo. It has banned household goods on inbound passenger aircraft. As expected, most US carriers have followed suit, and the European airlines are poised to impose similar restrictions. So much for cargo moving up and down Western airports.              
	Strict restrictions on cargo are understandable. But what about restrictions on human beings? The US is so paranoid that it appears to be succumbing helplessly to demands of adhering to specified checking methods and methodology. In the process, US airport security personnel have ended up targeting Indian diplomats as well as ordinary non-white passengers. But why is this so? Is it because of the fact that a majority of Americans have refused to be searched by the full-body airport scanners or undergo the invasive pat-downs?        
	Indeed, according to some reports, full-body airport scanners are just as likely to kill a passenger as a terrorist bomb blasting a passenger plane in the sky. These controversial machines have evoked serious concern that the increased exposure to radiation may raise the chances of contracting cancer. Regretfully, the number of non-white passengers and non-Americans being put through this machine is higher than whites and Americans. This certainly bodes ill for the liberal and cosmopolitan culture in America.         
	One can gauge the rising anger among passengers from the fact that Chesley Sully Sullenberger, the pilot who became a hero after managing to land his bird-hit aircraft on the freezing Hudson river, has refused to pass through the scanners. A sizeable number of Americans have raised objections on the ground that the porno scanners infringe on an individuals privacy.        
	In response, the Transportation Security Administration has ended up tightening the noose. Those refusing to comply with the rules are subjected to enhanced pat-downs that often result in brawls and in allegations of molestation. John Tyner became a hero to millions of passengers when he was forcibly evicted from the San Diego airport for threatening a security guard. At one point, the situation became extremely nasty and some men even planned to arrive at airport checking counters wearing kilts but no underwear.        
	Given the current situation, one can imagine the hazardous experience that Indians face in American airports. In the eyes of American security personnel, every passenger is a suspect till proved otherwise. The American paranoia started after 9/11. Regretfully, the brunt of this security drill is being borne by Indians. Be it cabinet ministers or diplomats, no Indian appears to be harmless in the eyes of American security. This is strange and absurd. The US ambassador to India and his plenipotentiaries enjoy special privileges and exemptions at all airports in India. On the other hand, Indias diplomats have to go through ignominy and insult of the American variety, as if they were the emissaries of the Taliban and al Qaida trying to breach US security. India, on the other hand, allows American diplomats facilities such as a red beacon on top of vehicles, mobile security riders, airport tarmac entry for vehicles, unrestrained access to entry and exit points, and so on. However, the gestures have not been reciprocated by the US. Perhaps, it is time India asserted itself and demanded equal treatment for its diplomats. Of course, it is possible that the government will decide to eschew knee-jerk reactions to remain on the right side of the worlds sole super power.              
	It goes without saying that the US must try and train its airport staff to depend on knowledge and expert human intelligence rather than on formula commands issued by computers. By resorting to this sort of failed technique, America has become the laughing stock of the world. It should be remembered that nothing objectionable was found on George Fernandes and Praful Patel earlier, or on the sari-clad Meera Shankar and the turbaned Hardeep Puri later. Incidentally, how many times has an American diplomat been handed a pat down by India?         
	The case involving David Headley is a pointer to disparity. Headley had unrestricted access in Indias airports because of his American passport. This clearly shows that whereas Indians give more-than-deserving respect to American passport-holders, Washington does not recognize even those holding diplomatic passports from India. India should not grant American officials any of the privileges that its citizens are denied of in the US. Here is another example of the stark contrast in treatment: an Indian diplomat is handed a pat down in an American airport, while an emissary from Washington cuts corners to gain a direct appointment with Indias national security adviser in the name of offering assistance to investigate the recent blast in Varanasi. The emissarys concern may be bona fide; but should not the ambassador of a foreign country go to the Prime Ministers Office through the ministry of foreign affairs? If Meera Shankar approaches the Pentagon after bypassing Hillary Clinton, will it be tolerated by the US?

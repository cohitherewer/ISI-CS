	When Moscow catches a cold, an old joke about Indian communists goes, Calcutta sneezes. With the former Soviet Union and its communist empire now a lost world, Beijing beckons Indian comrades. But communist internationalism can have its moments of embarrassment. Indian comrades face one such moment in the Swedish Academys decision to award this years Nobel Peace Prize to the jailed Chinese human-rights activist, Liu Xiaobo. While they are quick to condemn the politicization of the Nobel award, they seem to be wary of going the Chinese way in order to denounce Mr Liu. Echoing China in this case would expose them to the charge of being undemocratic. Denouncing the land of the Great Helmsman would be an act of sacrilege. But the Indian leftists uneasiness and prevarication can barely hide the true nature of their ideological preference. They would rather have a one-party dictatorship than human rights and other basic freedoms. Their Chinese dilemma can only make their alleged commitment to democracy and the multi-party system a suspicious affair. From the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and of former Czechoslovakia in 1968 to the crackdown on pro-democracy agitators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, Indian communists have repeatedly sought to defend indefensible acts of communist regimes. The Indian communists criticism of the Nobel committee, rather than of the Chinese authorities, shows how little they have changed.        
	However, the free world sees a new hope in the Swedish Academys decision to honour Mr Liu. It also is a warning to the international community that Chinas economic rise does not make its authoritarian regime any less dangerous. If anything, the free world should have higher stakes than ever before in pushing political reform in China. It is time other countries stopped bartering trade for liberty in their dealings with China. Mr Liu is not alone in his fight against Beijings ruthless suppression of its critics. By awarding the Nobel Prize to him, the academy has not only recognized the work of his fellow-travellers but also raised hopes for more such voices in China. Beijing has alleged that the Nobel award to Mr Liu is part of the Wests plot to contain a rising China. The truth is that the rise of a ruthlessly undemocratic power can be a danger for the free world. Chinas rise is not a matter of economics alone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | How fragile is China?
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOW FRAGILE IS CHINA?                          - Chinas reaction to the Nobel peace award is revealing        Ashok Ganguly                                                  
	The 2010 Nobel peace prize is due to be presented to Liu Xiaobo on December 10 in Stockholm. The winners chair will remain empty as Liu Xiaobo is in a Chinese prison, and his wife, who could have represented him, remains under house detention since the Nobel award was announced.        
	The spectacular award ceremony is a grand affair, attended by a list of invitees who are the veritable whos who of the worlds elite and intellectuals. China has condemned the Nobel committees provocative decision to award the 2010 Nobel prize to someone who is considered a dissident in China, dangerous enough to be put away in prison for 11 years. The award is seen as a reward for Chinas enemies, who espouse political liberalization and freedom of speech, and as a blatant affront to China, which is emerging to become the most powerful nation, with its own brand of governance.        
	Besides denying permission to Liu Xiaobo and his wife to travel to Stockholm to receive the worlds most prestigious award  and which a mature China should have rightfully taken pride in  China has gone one step further to write to various countries, warning them not to send their representatives to attend the ceremonies of December 10 in Stockholm. Quite expectedly, Chinas request has been roundly rebuffed by all nations except Russia.              
	No matter what China does it will not be able to prevent the rest of the world from celebrating the award of the Nobel prize to Liu Xiaobo as recognition that the stranglehold of the Chinese Communist Party on the minds and freedom of the Chinese people will not remain unchallenged by many of its own citizens. It is assumed that the vast majority of Chinese citizens has traded freedom of movement and speech for a materially better and wealthier life. However, how long this trade-off will last is a matter of debate.        
	Chinas international behaviour closely follows its domestic dogma. It is in territorial dispute with virtually all its neighbours along the Mekong River. The recent flare-up with Japan was the typical bully reaction which has come to be expected of China. Chinas border dispute with India is longstanding and likely to remain so. Civilized nations, by choice and inclination, pursue unachievable objectives through diplomatic channels, where discussions can go on forever.        
	Everyone is aware that Chinas currency, the renminbi, is grossly undervalued to the great disadvantage of all the nations it trades with and, especially, the United States of America, which is the biggest importer of Chinese goods. Yet, the long-drawn-out negotiations between the two countries are unlikely to reach any satisfactory conclusion until it suits China  which is not likely in the near future. The persuasive powers of the G-20 have failed to move China, whose standard excuse is that any revaluation will lead to mass unemployment and unrest in the country. Eventually the Federal Reserve may be driven to take tough measures to deal with an issue which is hurting the US.        
	The other red rag to China is the Dalai Lama. China keeps warning that any nation which officially welcomes the Tibetan leader and deals with him will have to face the wrath of China and will be punished. Such blatant behaviour on the part of China has now become so de rigueur that, with the passage of time, its impact and shock value are likely to wane.        
	But China has other armouries in the pipeline. It is gradually trying to claim maritime dominance across a spreading geography. In the recent flare-up between South and North Korea, the Chinese have been blunt in their warning regarding the US-South Korea naval exercise. Although in WikiLeaks another story is emerging.        
	The construction of dams by the Chinese on the major Himalayan rivers which flow into north-eastern India from Tibet in order to divert water to the drought-prone regions of China, was officially denied by the Chinese until the construction was almost complete. That this geological piracy will lead to severe shortage of water and affect the flow of the Brahmaputra has been completely ignored and now is being defied by China. This is the stuff of another international dispute triggered by Chinas aggressive nonchalance.              
	One can go on and on with the litany of blatant defiance of the world order by one of its most powerful members. All the facts of this litany are mind-boggling, both in their scope as well as their audacity. What is more beguiling is that the rest of the world continues to believe that China may change its indifference to and defiance of world opinion with the passage of time. This is unlikely to happen.        
	During the days of Zhu Rongji, his actions and words had led the world to hope that, having achieved great heights in economic and human development, China may become a more mature and open society. When a relatively young leader, Hu Jintao, became president and Wen Jiabao the prime minister, it was perceived as a positive development. But what one tends to overlook is the fact that the degree of freedom Chinas top leadership enjoys is tightly fenced in by the constant power struggle within the party hierarchy. The Chinese leadership will continue to remain in constant fear of the genie that Deng Xiaoping released, and which triggered a development momentum  one of the biggest in human history. How long the Chinese people will remain in thrall of their prosperity and global dominance and trade these off against personal freedom and choice is a matter of opinion. But, in the meantime, China will continue to deliver belligerent challenges to any country it is annoyed with. The empty chair in Stockholm on December 10 will become a symbol of the limits to Chinas bullying the world and getting away with it and, ultimately, of its fragility and private fears.

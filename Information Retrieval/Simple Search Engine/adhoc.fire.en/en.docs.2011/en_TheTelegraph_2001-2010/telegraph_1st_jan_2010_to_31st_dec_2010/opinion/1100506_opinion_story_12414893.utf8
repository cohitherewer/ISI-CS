                                                    BASIC RIGHTS                                                    
	The low value accorded to domestic work in India is best illustrated by polite societys peculiar callousness towards the rights of women who work in households for payment. But, however late, something is being done about it. Campaigns for the rights of domestic workers, led chiefly by non-governmental organizations and activists in different parts of the country, contributed much to the inclusion of the domestic workers category in the Unorganized Workers Social Security Act. Following upon its general recommendations, the Centre is evolving a policy with the help of a task force that focuses on the specific needs of domestic workers. The list of recommendations of the draft policy, welcome as it is, also reveals the total lack of rights under which domestic workers suffer. Beginning from something as basic as a weekly day off, minimum wages and fixed working hours, the policy would include employment contracts, conditions for termination of employment, health and insurance benefits, conditions of retirement and so on. Some other issues to be considered are conditions in case of pregnancy and illness. If implemented, the government will need to ensure that domestic workers are first registered at the state, district and panchayat levels, and the machinery for monitoring their work conditions is put in motion. Equally important, the policy has asked for the registration and monitoring of all placement agencies. That would greatly aid the efforts to check trafficking and stop child labour.        
	What the policy is really asking for is a change of mindset. It is only too easy to exploit poor women, who labour both at home and in other peoples houses, and are deprived of rights as women, as workers, and as human beings. Middle- and upper-middle-class society has not only lived on this labour for years, but also has thought nothing of ignoring the workers needs  let alone rights  as human beings. It is heartening that the government is taking notice at last, but there is yet no suggestion of penalties for employers who refuse to comply. Given the breadth and depth of Indias poverty, supply is always greater than demand. But once the machinery for registration and monitoring is put in place, violations may perhaps be dealt with. The awareness of the domestic workers itself could become a deterrent. Now there is at least reason for hope.

	Follow the haunted trail                
	Essays and Letters: Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (Rupa, Rs 295) edited by Brajendra Nath Banerji and Sajani Kanta Das is an important book as it brings together Bankim Chandra Chatterjees miscellaneous writings in English that have been published before but largely forgotten over time. Apart from letters and articles on religion and philosophy, there is a translation of a few chapters of Chatterjees novel, Devi Chaudhurani. His views as expressed in his articles  for instance, on the origin of Hindu festivals or on popular literature in Bengal  are instructive because they reveal the workings of an immensely intelligent mind bent upon proving the superiority of certain values and principles. In A Popular Literature for Bengal he writes, And it would be difficult to conceive a poem more typical than the Gitagovinda of the Bengali character. From the beginning to the end it does not contain a single expression of manly feeling  of womanly feeling there is a great deal  or a single elevated sentiment. Chatterjees English is terse, devoid of the sentimental flourishes that often marked Victorian prose.                                   
	Trekking Guide to the Western Himalayas (Collins, Rs 695) by Depi Chaudhry details treks in the Western Himalayas that are off the beaten path. So you get to know about such little-known trek routes as Darcha to Padum in Ladakh, or Pindari to Milam in Uttarakhand. The overview maps of the routes and the accompanying information regarding the best season to trek, the weather and so on make the book an invaluable guide. The photographs are alluring, as are the snippets of local lore Chaudhry provides. For instance, the trek through the Rupshu Valley in Ladakh will take you to Khar, which is described thus: The ruins of the former kingdom of Khar still stand [there], and the nomads believe it to be haunted. It is said that the Dat nomads are descendants of the Khar people, and for some reason, migrated to the village of Dat a few generations ago. Such stories make the book a delight for armchair trekkers too.                         
	Work Less, Achieve More: Great Ideas to Get Your Life Back (Headline, Rs 225) by Fergus O Connell has a very attractive proposition indeed as its title. OConnells philosophy is simple. For him, the three basic techniques for working less involve saying no nicely, prioritising viciously and the mantra that a little planning is better than a lot of firefighting. He provides charts and statistics to help you attain these noble goals.

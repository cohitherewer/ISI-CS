                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Time to talk                  
	Sir  The proposed peace-talks between the Union government and the Communist Party of India (Maoist) are getting delayed, with both sides setting preconditions and blaming each other (Govt-Maoist skirmish: fax versus phone, Feb 24). This is certainly a matter of concern. Now that the Maoists have named the negotiators on their behalf  an IAS officer, an author and a politician  the government should seize the opportunity to start the talks. With terror attacks from across the border posing a major threat, the government cannot afford to fight more than one battle at a time. Therefore, urgent reconciliation with the Maoists is all the more crucial. The home minister, P. Chidambaram, should lead the efforts instead of leaving it all to the bureaucrats. Eminent citizens acceptable to both sides should be involved to facilitate smooth negotiations. There should also be a clear time frame for concluding the talks, which must be based on well-defined objectives. Meanwhile, both sides should mend their hostile ways to create a favourable environment for the talks. West Bengal, being a border state, needs to solve the Maoist problem expeditiously in order to curb infiltration by terrorists from across the border.          
	The Maoists theory of annihilation, their loyalty to the ideologies of a foreign leader, and their disregard of the Indian Constitution cannot be accepted by Indians. But it has to be acknowledged that Maoists thrive on the frustrations of the tribals and the underprivileged in the rural areas, thanks to the negligence of the state and the Central governments. The Maoists gave these poor people leadership, and promised to empower them. Not only the Maoist menace, but also most of the other problems plaguing the country are the results of poor governance and the lack of enlightened leadership.          
	One wonders why the Maoists disown the Constitution. The Indian Constitution was made with great care. If there are any loopholes, they exist in its implementation. The Constitution may need amendments to cope with the changing society, but there is no reason to reject it altogether. The Maoists should realize this. They should also understand that they wouldnt succeed in their efforts to overthrow the government because violence cannot lead to success. Maoist leaders like Kishenji should join the mainstream instead, and test their popularity among the masses. Time is ripe for these rebel leaders to join parliamentary democracy, as the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which has failed miserably in West Bengal, is no more a force to reckon with. The country needs a new party comprising honest leftist leaders to stand up to the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Maoists can fill this vacuum. If they fail to take advantage of this opportunity, history will never forgive them.          
	Exploitation by corporate houses in the rural areas is a major grievance among the tribals and the poor. The government, in order to boost the tribals confidence in democracy, should address this problem immediately. It should also take other substantive steps to bring the tribals back to the mainstream. The State should ensure the proper implementation of the schemes announced for the welfare of the downtrodden. On the other hand, if the Maoists do not appreciate the new realities and cooperate with the government, they will have nobody to blame for the consequences except themselves.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  One wonders what exactly the Maoist movement aims to achieve. Maoists, it is said, are fighting for their rights as citizens of India. They claim to be fighting on behalf of the deprived tribals, who are supposedly not getting their rightful dues from the State, even though the areas they inhabit are rich in natural wealth. It is sad that after o many years of democracy in India, such widespread dissatisfaction remains in the peoples minds.          
	It is imperative that those protesting on behalf of the deprived make it clear to the government what their demands are, and how they can be met. It should be kept in mind that even if the government accepts the demands, it would take time to fulfil them. For the demands to be examined, mutually agreed upon and implemented, the agitators must sit for a dialogue with the government at the earliest. Meanwhile, the atrocities must cease. Creating pockets where Maoists can block the States administration machinery for some time only adds to the peoples misery.          
	The government should also sincerely hear out the Maoists demands and complaints, and try its best to come up with solutions. Grievances over food, health, education and law-and-order need to be redressed immediately.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Supreme Court passed many orders last year to rehabilitate and compensate adivasis displaced by the governments anti-Maoist campaign in Chhattisgarh. But the government is ignoring these orders as the tribals, being nave and illiterate, are powerless to retaliate. When people like Himanshu Kumar, who has been working for the betterment of the tribals for long, protest against such injustice and exploitation, they are branded as Naxal supporters and are targeted by the police. Who will come to the rescue of the tribals? What stops the government from having an open dialogue with the adivasis?          
	A government elected to power by the people in a democracy should try its best to find out what people want from it. Police atrocities towards tribals are on the rise. First information reports filed against the police in different tribal belts are ignored. Both the judiciary and the government have failed miserably to root out corruption from the police force and to stop the maltreatment of tribals. All the government is interested in are the forest and mineral wealth of the tribal areas.          
	Yours faithfully,

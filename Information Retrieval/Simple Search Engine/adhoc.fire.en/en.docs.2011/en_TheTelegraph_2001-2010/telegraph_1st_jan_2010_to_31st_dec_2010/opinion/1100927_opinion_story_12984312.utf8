	The contest for the leadership of the Labour Party turned out to be far more exciting than the predictable, even boring, general elections that Britain had earlier this year. It has been something of a surprise for Labour supporters, as well as for the nation as a whole, to see the geeky Ed Milibands ascent to prominence, defeating his more charismatic brother, David, by a thin margin. The winds of change that had blown Gordon Brown out of 10 Downing Street seem to have pushed Tony Blairs New Labour in a different direction as well. Mr Blairs brainchild has been divested of its centrist flavour, and under the leadership of Mr Miliband the party is expected to return to its original socialist model that was endorsed by the trade unions. In fact, the support of the latter crucially contributed to Mr Milibands victory, in spite of his less than successful attempt at writing the partys election manifesto that failed to see Mr Brown through yet another term in power. As he takes over the mantle of the leader, Mr Miliband is saddled with two tricky challenges. The first involves having to reconcile the jilted ego of his brother and senior colleagues like Ed Balls, another aspirant for the top job. And the second pertains to delivering the various left-leaning policies he had come up with in order to garner the support of the trade unions.        
	Mr Miliband, although not a political greenhorn, has been far less successful than his elder brother in gathering funds from rich bankers. Rather, the new leaders tax-the-rich approach and his aim of rebuilding British industry have given rise to murmurs that he is anti-business. Although he had distanced himself, commendably if somewhat cunningly, from Mr Blairs Iraq policy, Mr Miliband ended up arguing his case by drawing on some of the nicer legacies of Messrs Blair and Brown. Ironically, most of these Labour achievements  education reform, minimum wage, subsidized renewable energy  would not have been possible without massive public spending. In present-day debt-ridden Britain, the government is contemplating severe expenditure cuts. Priorities have changes radically. Nostalgia for what a State, presuming it was caring enough, could do with a lot of money in its hands is of no practical use to what the country is facing today. To be a successful Opposition leader, let alone the future prime minister, Mr Miliband would have to focus more on reality than on rhetoric.

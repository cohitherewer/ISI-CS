                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        KEEP OUT                                                    
	What is a keep? Dictionaries say that it is, among other things, the strongest or central tower of a castle. But the Supreme Court seems to have a different, less complimentary, idea. For the court, it is necessarily of female gender, and cannot be paid maintenance. Neither feature is complimentary. No doubt a man, who earns nothing or less than a female partner with whom he has been sharing house  and a sexual relationship  for a significant period, is not a keep. For men, in the nature of things, or as a matter of perception, cannot be keeps. It is quite possible that they are never strong enough to be the central tower of the castle, but that does not seem to feature in the courts guidelines regarding which women in live-in relationships can claim maintenance after break-up. The additional solicitor general articulated the process of the courts addition to vocabulary: keep is the simple translation of an ugly Hindi word. And the court provided its own gloss  by suggesting concubine as substitute for keep.        
	There can be no doubt of the judiciarys encouraging intention of forging ahead with the times by giving live-in partners the benefit of the protection from domestic violence law. Only the pull of deep-seated notions about women, sex and submission is sometimes almost visible. Given the suggested parameters of a relationship by virtue of which a woman can claim maintenance, a man might be in trouble if he keeps what was once known as a harem and goes around with a different partner on different occasions or in different social circles as if each were his wife. And when a man does pay maintenance, is the maintained woman a keep? If not, that can only be because the sex is missing. With weekends and one-night stands in the courts remarks, sex seems as undesirable as keep. Strange that sex is the first thing expected of a marriage.

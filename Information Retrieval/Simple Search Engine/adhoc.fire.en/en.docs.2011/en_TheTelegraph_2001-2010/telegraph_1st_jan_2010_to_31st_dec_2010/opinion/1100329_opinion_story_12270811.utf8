	It is not a courts job to bring M.F. Husain back to India. But it is a little bizarre that the Supreme Court should have to waste time saying so. A public interest litigation had requested the court to quash the cases against the artist so that he could return to India and live with dignity. For one, the court said that it could not simply quash cases filed by individuals. And second, Mr Husain could come back to India and live with dignity if he wishes  he can live with dignity wherever he chooses. Neither the court nor the prime minister  whom the PIL asked to intervene  can force Mr Husain to come back, just as no one can force him to stay in Qatar.        
	The absurdity of the PIL raises questions about Indians understanding of law and justice. Undoubtedly, there are some passing thrills to be got from filing a PIL of this sort, demonstrating both an overwhelming concern for Mr Husain as well as a patriotic fervour meant to shame the chauvinists whose depredations drove him to self-exile. But the court is not the place to air such sentiments. Mr Husains return or otherwise does not depend on law. And it would be an injustice to Mr Husain if it is implied that he does not know what is best for himself. The PIL was developed after the Emergency so that civil society groups or concerned citizens could file cases cheaply on behalf of poor or otherwise disadvantaged people whose rights were being violated. Mr Husain does not fit the category. The abuse and frivolous application of this tool had led the Supreme Court to lay down strict guidelines for the filing of PILs. It seems truly strange that the PIL for the quashing of Mr Husains cases should have slipped past those guidelines, for it does not merit PIL status at all. There must be a rigorous screening procedure that would prevent such petitions from reaching the courtroom and wasting the courts time. With Indias enormous and overdue caseload, its courts cannot afford to waste time on the obvious.

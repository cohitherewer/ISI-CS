	A journey to discover a secret      
	 Muskoka Maharani (Penguin, Rs 275) by David McMahon begins with an Australian journalist, Harry Barnsley, being asked by his bosses to deliver the papers biggest scoop to save his job. A helpful colleague provides a lead that takes Barnsley to Muskoka, north of Toronto, to meet Serena, a woman of Indian origin with a secret past. Serena had helped catch a German spy during the second world war, a man who happened to be a priest of some repute. But the world knows nothing about this affair, until Barnsley breaks the story after piecing together corroborating evidence. Barnsley not only saves his job but is also flown to Rome for an audience with the pope. McMahons wistful descriptions of the lives and times of Anglo-Indian families living in another India offers nothing that is not known already about this community and the quaint places they inhabited.                                
	 Braking news: One bus, two girls, 15 thousand kilometres, 715 million votes... (Hachette, Rs 350) by Sunetra Choudhury describes the fascinating journey of a television reporter through the heart of an election-bound India. Even as India went to polls in May 2009, Choudhury and her colleague were put on a bus by one of Indias top news channels and asked to beam live this momentous event through the bylanes and boondocks of Bharat. The result is an intriguing account that not only describes the sounds and smells of the hinterland but also raises questions about a democracy and its people.        
	More than politics, this is a chronicle about an unequal people: the gun-toting Sanskrit teacher of Morena and the film-star-turned-politician belong to the same country but represent two differently empowered communities.                        
	 May I Hebb Your Attention Pliss (HarperCollins, Rs 199) by Arnab Ray is The Great Bongs take on everything that goes by the name of popular culture in post-liberalized India. Nothing escapes Rays hawk eye: politics, weddings, C-grade flicks, reality shows, risqu entertainment, even toilet flushes have been analysed in a tone that is supposedly irreverent and scathingly funny. One can forgive Rays strange grammar (he is a blogger after all), but not his anodyne humour. This one is unlikely to hold your attention for long.

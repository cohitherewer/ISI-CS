The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the time of the heroes
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE TIME OF THE HEROES                                                          
	If selfless dissidence and just outrage are the two crucial criteria expected of a Nobel laureate for literature, then the Peruvian-born writer, Mario Vargas Llosa, exceeds the bill. For, along with these two qualities, he combines a literary flare that is comparable to the genius of Gabriel Garca Mrquez (a fellow Latin American who had won the prize in 1982), and is truly something to reckon with. Mr Vargas Llosa is most certainly not an obscure Chinese writer deploring the atrocities of the State or an East European nobody has ever heard of (or cared to remember) or an elder statesman from Africa whose chief claim to fame is whipping the West into weeping tears of contrition for its imperialist past. Most emphatically, Mr Vargas Llosa is not the redoubtable Harold Pinter, who could hardly be denied the prize after he had spent the last few insipid years of his career spewing fire and brimstone on the United States of America.        
	It is unlikely that the selection committees oversensitive heart had bled for Mr Vargas Llosa, who is not only a political conservative (in fact, a failed politician himself) but also an outspoken critic of Fidel Castro. Mr Vargas Llosas defence of democracy and the free market is so absolute that he reputedly fell out  indeed broke into fisticuffs  with his one-time pal, Mr Garca Mrquez, whose loyalty to the Cuban leader has never faltered. For a change, genuine talent appears to have triumphed over political correctness, even though the awarding committee did add, perhaps a bit cautiously, that Mr Vargas Llosa has been honoured for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individuals resistance, revolt and defeat.        
	Unlike Mr Vargas Llosa, who is as much of a celebrity man of letters as an intellectual rebel, this years peace prize winner is a very different kind of a hero. Liu Xiaobo of China is serving an 11-year term, since 2008, for co-authoring the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms that was accused of trying to subvert State power. Given the stringent isolation in which Mr Xiaobo is held, it is unlikely that the news has travelled to him as yet. In any event, he would not have too many reasons to rejoice. Besides allaying the tormented conscience of the West, the Nobel peace prize has seldom affected the mission of crusaders like Mr Xiaobo, or the circumstances of the people they fight for, in any positive way. For instance, winning a Nobel did very little  in terms of real change  to Aung San Suu Kyis plight in Myanmar, though the same prize did turn Barack Obama into a historical curiosity. Nonetheless, the Swedes have wagered quite a bit while selecting this years peace and literature prize winners. The Chinese have made dire noises about a dip in Sino-Norwegian relations. And the politically-correct brigade is mildly scandalized. But the bookies are probably the happiest. Indeed, Ladbrokes is planning to send out a crate of champagne to the bidder who played 25-1 for Mr Vargas Llosa and helped the firm dodge a massive payout.

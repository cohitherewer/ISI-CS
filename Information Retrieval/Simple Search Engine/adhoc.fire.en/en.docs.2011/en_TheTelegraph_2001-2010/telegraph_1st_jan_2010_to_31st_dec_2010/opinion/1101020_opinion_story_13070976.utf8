JAYAL                                                          
	Even as high-level diplomatic exchanges are taking place in anticipation of the American presidents visit to India, Bob Woodards book, Obamas Wars, hit the stands. Washington Post has run a series of extracts from the book that gives an insiders account of the decision-making process within the national security establishment in the United States of America, warts and all.         
	The focus of the book is on Barack Obamas review of US-Afghan strategy in the latter half of 2009. Seeking options to choose from, he is frustrated that the only advice he receives from the Pentagon establishment is for a surge of some 40,000 additional troops to implement a counter-insurgency strategy. Such is the mistrust between him and the Pentagon that at one stage Obama complains to the vice-president that the military leaders were really cooking this thing in the direction they wanted.        
	Obama had, at the start of the review, indicated that the real pressing interest was Pakistan, a nuclear power with a fragile civilian government, dominant military and an intelligence service that espoused terrorist groups. On Afghanistan, he is reported to have told Hillary Clinton, Im not doing ten years. Im not doing long-term nation-building. Im not spending a trillion dollars. Clearly, the president is worried about the politics, while the Pentagon is focused on the mission. The differences were inevitable. The issue is discussed over many strategy sessions chaired by the president himself involving the whos who of the national security establishment, which includes some senior retired generals as well as those currently in command positions. Interestingly, the president is not averse to even using staffers in the National Security Council secretariat as sounding boards.         
	The internal debate hinges on Obama wanting to authorize additional troops, but fewer than the Pentagons request, and wants an exit strategy in return. The vice-president, Joe Biden, warns the president against the militarys plans and cautions him about another Vietnam suggesting that its not the numbers, but the strategy. The military is non-committal, being at the sharp end of the delivery business.         
	This internal decision-making process is by no means sombre. There is bitter name-calling behind peoples backs and accusations of the different sides using the media to promote their views. In the end, Obama is reported to have arrived at his own strategy, agreeing to an additional 30,000 troops but laying down a six-page document restricting the mission from expanding and reducing any wiggle room to the military.         
	Revealed in the book are other facets of this complex security matrix. At the heart is Pakistan, a US ally known to be playing a double game not too subtly. At one stage, the president states, We need to make clear to people that the cancer is in Pakistan. At another, the vice-president says, We cant lose sight of Pakistan and stability there. The way I understand this  Afghanistan is a means to accomplish our top mission which is to kill al Qaeda and secure Pakistans nuclear weapons. We must be making progress separately against al Qaeda and separately in Pakistan. Also revealed is a little-known fact that the Central Intelligence Agency has a counter-terrorism pursuit team of 3,000, operating secretly within Pakistan territory.        
	After the failed terrorist attack in Times Square in New York, the CIA director, Leon Panetta and the national security adviser, General Jones (retired) visit Pakistan in May, 2010, to share intelligence about Taliban targeting US and Nato forces in Afghanistan and plans by Lashkar-e-Toiba to attack targets in the US and Europe. Pakistan is told that if ever there was a Mumbai-type attack in the US, all bets with Pakistan would be off and that there were in place retribution plans whereby 150 terrorist camps in Pakistan would be subject to a punishing bombing attack. Having failed to get any significant commitments to a change of heart, the team comes back only reinforcing the assessment that there was a gap between the civil and the military in Pakistan, that Pakistan did not share the USs energy in dealing with the Taliban, and that even in the midst of this serious crisis General Kayani insists that his priorities remain India-centric.         
	The team also believes that whilst India may have no choice but to respond to any further Mumbai type attack, Pakistan feels otherwise. One can judge that Pakistans confidence is encouraged by Indias soft approach to Pakistans continual provocations. Yet, it is difficult to fathom why the team thinks otherwise, the US itself counselling restraint on Indias part in the past.        
	As Indias strategic partnership with the US builds up with matching foreign policy and security implications, it is worth reflecting on some of the issues arising out of the above disclosures. One of the more important ones relates to the national security decision-making process. In the US, there are various stakeholders contributing to national security policy. At the end of the day, broad-based strategy sessions are conducted and the president encourages debate and discussion, but the buck stops at his table.        
	Frank and robust discussions speak of the strength of the system. Clearly, within the military, the pros and cons of options are discussed and war-gamed at every level of command right up to the defence secretary. It is only then that the combined weight of this professional knowledge and expertise would have been put up to the president even with the knowledge that it was against his political preference. That the Pentagon, supported by the defence secretary, stood its ground speaks of the professionalism of the institution and needs to be commended rather than condemned. The fact that all were committed to a political direction once it was given, speaks of the soundness of democratic institutions in the US.        
	Our decision-making system with regard to matters of national security, on the other hand, is opaque even internally. The armed forces do not, as a rule, form part of the deliberative decision-making process. No participant can be expected to speak on behalf of the military in any meaningful way especially in todays complex threat environment, where lines between wars, insurgency, terrorism and law and order are getting blurred by the day. Further, even within the three services, there is the lack of an institutional mechanism of arriving at single-point military advice to the political leadership.         
	With this compartmentalized and ad hoc national security decision-making process, the cabinet committee on security is denied first-hand military appreciation, and there is every chance that vested interests will use this to deepen the rifts within the national security system  as, indeed, the recent sterile debate on the Armed Forces Special Powers Act has done. Lessons learnt after the Kargil war and proposed by the Kargil review committee in the context of integrating service headquarters with the ministry of defence and appointing a chief of defence staff continue to linger.        
	There is an added dimension. Currently, the US is victim to Pakistans indispensability as an ally, while being fully conscious of the latters unholy alliance with various terrorist groups and the danger its nuclear weapons pose within this explosive mix. The US is conscious of and managing these contradictions, undoubtedly with contingency plans for worst-case scenarios.With respect to India-Pakistan relations, however, it appears that the Pakistani security establishment, with its decades-old association with the Pentagon and the state department, still sways to sympathetic sentiments within the US security establishment. Hence, the mistaken notion in the US that resolving the Kashmir dispute with India will automatically bring the Pakistan military on the path to good soldiering in a democratic Pakistan.         
	Both the US and India have failed to decode Pakistans DNA. The cancer in Pakistan is its military, which believes that it is the sole custodian of Pakistans integrity. Along the way, it has developed huge economic and other stakes to maintain status quo. Unless this institutional mindset undergoes a tectonic transformation, not only will periodic tremors be felt within the fledgling democracy in Pakistan, but this state will pose a grave security challenge to India and the international community. The Pakistan militarys view of a soft India, its use of terrorism as an instrument of State policy, and the perceived invincibility behind its nuclear arsenal and close partnership with China to keep India on a strategic leash and the US guessing make the Pakistan military leadership adventurous and unpredictable. With such a shaky finger on the nuclear trigger, not just India, but the international community must worry.               
	When Obama and the Indian prime minister sit down together in November, one hopes for introspection on the strategic implications of an imploding Pakistan financed by American largesse, egged on by an expansionist China, and the strategic responsibility this endows on two major democracies of the world.        
	Indias ability to be an equal strategic partner to the US will depend as much on the strength of its democracy and economy as on the integrity of its national security system, the robustness of its decision-making processes, a clear identification of the threats posed to its national security and a wilful determination to counter them. This is the homework we need to do to be taken seriously by the international community.

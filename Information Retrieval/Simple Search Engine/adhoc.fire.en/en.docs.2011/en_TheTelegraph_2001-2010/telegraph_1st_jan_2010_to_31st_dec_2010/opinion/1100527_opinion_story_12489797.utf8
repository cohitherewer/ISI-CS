The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The year of the dragon
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE YEAR OF THE DRAGON                                  A visit to Shanghai before the World Expo opened helped Sekhar Raha understand why China is a step ahead of India                          The crowded Expo                                  
	A recent visit to Shanghai, a fortnight before the opening of the World Expo, apparently the largest in history, showed how China successfully executes large tasks. Unlike the frenetic bandobast that accompanies large functions in India, what I saw was a planned approach to a time-bound objective. Each major road- crossing had a digital display to remind everyone of the number of days remaining before the Expo opened.        
	One morning, a squad of gardeners was at work outside our hotel, digging up two large areas of the adjoining paved market square. By the end of the day, two new earth mounds had appeared, embellished with nursery flowers and skirted by mature trees. Walking back to the hotel in the evening, the gardeners had been replaced a by a group of stone cutters and masons erecting the parapet around each garden. The following morning, two new raised gardens adorned the market square. No residual debris remained, none of the detritus from building activity that you trip over every few yards in any city in India.        
	This is not just a consequence of the Expo. Shanghais urban planning centre, an exhibition spread over five floors, illustrates how the activity I witnessed fits into the overall journey of the citys regeneration. A 30-metre square model of the city spread over one whole floor depicts how Shanghai will look over the next two decades. Large parts of it are already complete, including the stunning river-front areas alongside the old imperialist enclaves of British and French concessions.        
	However, the ruthless determination with which areas were cleared for modernization meant forced evictions and doubtful compensation, similar to what happened in Beijing during the preparation for the olympics. But, as in so many things, perhaps the Chinese are different in this as well. We are reminded that China is not so much a nation state as a civilization state, steeped in its culture of several thousand years, and with its Han-dominated homogeneity and discipline is perhaps better equipped to withstand what other, psychologically softer nations, have been unable to do. There are some paradoxes too. Our guide confessed that property prices in central Shanghai are beyond the capacity of the average salary earner. Our guide lamented that in twenty years time, Shanghai will be a city only for the rich.        
	Given the West Bengal governments consonance with Chinas ideology, which must have resulted in official visits to Shanghai and Beijing, it is surprising that so few of these cities advantages seem to have rubbed off on us. The elegant and raised pedestrian walkways over major roadcrossings in Shanghai do not cost huge sums of money. But they do need initiative and a keen eye for public convenience. Can you imagine how much easier life would be if one could cross the road at Gariahat market with the help of this simple facility and not be herded by a length of rope? Surely, it does not need draconian measures to have an efficient set of sweepers to keep the roads clean. Historically, Calcutta and Shanghai were port cities of equal importance under the British trade influence. Though several officials in Shanghai talked to us of the possibility of twinning with Mumbai, no one mentioned Calcutta.        
	The possibility of international exposure and the expectation of a large number of foreign visitors have led to the desire of being seen to be adhering to global market rules. This meant that, unlike my visit to Shanghai a year earlier, there was little evidence now of copied branded goods being sold openly. The government clean-up drive ahead of the event has had some bizarre consequences. Looking for some English DVDs, I was directed to a DVD library in Shanghais smart shopping street. I was ushered to the back of the showroom where a sliding bookshelf slid open to reveal a library of Chinese film DVDs concealed behind the wall. Since they were of no interest to me, a series of coded knocks on the back wall of this concealed shop resulted in another bookshelf sliding open, leading to a hidden staircase that went upwards to a vast library of pirated English DVDs.        
	What this does is give an insight to the staggering cost-advantage of Chinese-manufactured goods. Unbranded, lookalike sport goods and clothes cost one-sixth of the retail prices elsewhere in the world. If profits can be made along the distribution chain at these prices, the factory-gate cost must be unimaginably low. No wonder then that China is the manufacturing hub of the world, even for the fanciest of branded goods. As wages increase, China realizes that the key to its future competitiveness and growth is innovation. The Chinese have invested heavily in higher education, and have an enviable track record when it comes to patents.        
	During my last visit, Chinese economists primary worry was that the global financial downturn had resulted in fall in exports leading to massive job losses. This was exacerbated by the large number of fresh graduates entering the job market when new jobs were not being created. China had no vibrant domestic market like ours to which it could switch quickly. Fifteen months later, the Chinese seem to have worked their magic. Growth is back at a scorching 11.5 per cent of GDP, so much so that todays anxiety is that the economy may be overheating.              
	The earlier fear of large-scale unemployment led me to write in The Telegraph a year ago of the possibility of underlying disquiet which could lead to public protest. That protest takes place and is suppressed are no secret. But while China bounced back, our democracy, which should have ensured greater harmony, has created threats to internal security. To add insult to injury, they are called Maoists.

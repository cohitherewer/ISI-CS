The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A different contentment
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A DIFFERENT CONTENTMENT                          - For Amlan Datta, defeat and victory belonged elsewhere        GOPALKRISHNA GANDHI                          Amlan Datta, July 2005                                        
	And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle, Has vanished from his lonely hearth.        
	 William Wordsworth              
	To be sure, Amlan Datta was not always the gentle-natured Charles Lamb that Wordsworth has portrayed. His words could frolic, his voice was gentle. But his mind? It was sharper than the sharp blades his clean-shaven face did not use. The uneven stubble, the unironed shirt, the unpolished footwear were the outward marks of an inner unconcern with what most people are so bothered about, the way one appears to others. Amlanbabu was bothered about what one says and does to others.         
	I am alright for my age, he answered my question on the phone a week before crossing over, but how are you? That was the quintessential Amlan Datta. Not allowing the light of attention, his own or that of others, to linger on himself for a moment longer than the context required. He moved on, always, to the other person, the other subject and, literally, the Other.        
	Within touching distance of death, I am told he braved a ride to the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Golpark, Calcutta, to caution his audience about the real danger of war, of ecological collapse, of sectarianism. The gathering at that auditorium must have been more than receptive. But that had not always been the case with Amlanbabus audiences.        
	As a caring teacher with a classroom of diverse, even divided, students, and a public intellectual with a disparate target, Amlanbabu faced a hard dilemma.         
	He put it to me in a letter in March, 2007 thus: Your heart inclines you to love; but there are times when your conscience does not let you stay pretty and polite, uttering simply pleasing words. At such times, the heart must stand and wait. This is the law of pure reason. Love yet converts a defeat into victory when it resolves that it must continue to love all, even those who have withdrawn their earlier positive feelings. That is the law of pure love. It takes much strength to abide by it.              
	In following this principle and procedure, Amlanbabu was being true to the Indian he admired most after the Mahatma, his friend and saha-chintak, Jayaprakash Narayan. And in doing so he was, again with JP, trying to ensure that his defeat was also simultaneously a victory.        
	Whether he convinced his listeners with his reasoning or not, Amlanbabu always convinced them with the calm earnestness and lucidity of his expression. I cannot judge anyones fluency in Bangla but his English, I could see, was arrestingly different.         
	I am not sure if Amlanbabu would have liked to be described as a public intellectual. But, for the sake of convenience, let me call him that in this article.        
	Amlanbabu enjoyed high public esteem. But, for a public intellectual, can the esteem of friends be enough? Can such a persons knowledge that he is a highly respected public figure be a substitute for the knowledge that his intellectual exertions are not quite succeeding?         
	Public intellectuals can be as diverse as the public but two categories of them may be identified. One is the category of those who seek to influence policy through a direct transfusion of ideas to the powers that be. The other category is of those who would prefer to influence public opinion and by the force of that public persuasion seek to change or modify public policy.        
	Amlanbabu knew how to do the first with consummate skill and, very often, did so especially when he served on committees. But he was, essentially, a public intellectual of the second type, comfortable when speaking from public spaces rather than through committees and commissions and through the medium of reports.        
	This mode of speaking to the authorities from, so to say, the maidan, has its highs and its lows. The lows come not just because authority does not listen but because the public too is a changeling and does not always lend its full support to the intellectual who speaks on its behalf, for the public is not an undifferentiated mass.        
	At some level, without a sense of having succeeded intellectually in persuading either a large section of opinion or a select body of policy-formulators, a sense of defeat in that individual would be impossible to escape.        
	I am not sure if Amlanbabus sense of moral victory was sufficient recompense for the intellectual isolation he must have felt. He had some amazingly close and caring friends and, on his 85th birthday, a large gathering came to witness the beautiful film made on him. But his was, like Lambs, a lonely hearth.        
	A friend of his described him recently to me as a very private and a very proud person.        
	Another person to whom that description could be applied died a few days before Amlanbabu.        
	K.N. Raj from the Left in Thiruvanananthapuram did with ideas what Amlanbabu from neither the Left nor the Right but from his own light perch in Calcutta did.        
	Both commanded respect from their students and friends, and from those in high office. Yet, could either of them have been called, if indeed anyone can be, successful in the world of ideas? What is the meaning of success and unsuccess, or victory and defeat, as Amlanbabu put it, in the universe of the intellect? Are these to be measured in the kilogram scales of an ironsmith, such as awards received, public lectures given, multiple editions of masterpieces published and adulatory reviews and, to be more contemporaneous, review-articles? Or are they to be measured in the smaller milligram scales used by the goldsmith, such as the respect of the discerning and the receptivity of authority?        
	I referred to two categories of public intellectuals. It is possible for those in the second category to ripen into something other than a ripe intellectual. And that something other is to become, almost in spite of themselves, social philosophers. Datta and Raj would have protested at suggestions that they were social philosophers. But then they would, I think, have conceded that the human mind, being the common parent of intellection and reflection, cannot but serve both processes.        
	And by that criterion, I think one should be able to see that the public intellectuals victory or defeat depends on what they were striving to do within the world of ideas.         
	Social philosophers must dispense bitter draughts, if they are to be true to their bent. But this medicament is not the dissent one sees edging compulsively towards microphones.        
	Dissent is a headgear that attitudinizers wear. When that object becomes a horn for attack or a helmet for self-fulfilment, it loses its credibility. Neither Raj nor Datta sought to extend the medulla oblongata with such accoutrement. They thought because they felt, they felt because they thought. Intellection, for them, was not a cold procedure performed in the operation theatres of sterile ratiocinating but a warm exercise conducted by one human concerned about another.               
	Amlan Datta and K.N. Raj were intellectual-philosphers in another major and, to my mind, much more abiding sense. They knew that dissenting from the ruling establishment may be important but dissenting from ruling passions, from what may be the majority view, or the fashionable view of the public of the day, is no less important.        
	If there was one thing Datta and Raj, as practical men, knew, it was this, that correction is needed not just where power vests, but also where it proceeds from.        
	In December, 1998, Raj gave a lecture in Thiruvananthapuram called Has Communism a Future? It was addressed not to a State apparat or to any politburo as much as to the thinking public. It dealt with human psychology, human actions and reactions and their social consequences. Amlanbabu, likewise, always veered from the empirical towards the ethical, with social mores and generational choices being his central preoccupation.        
	And that is where, one as an independent thinker and another as an intellectual from the Left, entered that margent of human reflection where intellectual victory and defeat seem to belong elsewhere. And where loneliness can be a form of contentment.

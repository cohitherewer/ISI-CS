	Sick leave                  
	Sir  In the last five decades or more, a number of scams have come to light involving crores of taxpayers money, which has just evaporated into thin air. There is a factor common to all these murky deals. When the incident reaches an uncomfortable pitch, the political heavyweight who has come under cloud invariably falls sick. The former Union telecom minister, A. Raja, who was reportedly unwell when the CBI summoned him in relation to the 2G spectrum scam, seems to be continuing this glorious tradition.          
	Yours faithfully,        Arun Malankar, Mumbai 
        
	Badly hit          
	Sir  The recent hike in the price of petrol would bring windfall profits to some states, which levy high taxes on petrol, making it even more expensive (Petrol prices close to Rs 60 a litre, Dec 15). Car-owners who use petrol will be badly hit, since they have to bear the burden of the rise. They always have to pay more for their cars while owners of even expensive four-wheelers like SUVs, which run on diesel, suffer less. The disparity between the prices of petrol and diesel is unfair. For the sake of justice, the rate of price-hike for petrol and diesel should be the same. Governments should evolve a mechanism to bring about this parity.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  For a stable economic system, prices of petroleum products need to be regularly updated in keeping with global fluctuations in the price of crude oil. But the Union government also needs to take steps that will provide relief to the public by saving on the hidden costs involved in the distribution of petroleum products. The money spent on large overheads and publicity should be curtailed by merging all public sector oil companies into a single unit. Discounts on petrol purchased with credit cards by the affluent should be abolished.          
	A meeting of finance ministers from all Indian states should be convened to bring about uniformity in the net consumer prices of petroleum products sold all over the country. Only branded petrol and diesel should be sold initially in the urban areas, and then throughout India, from all retail outlets. Since the government is the largest consumer of oil products, only small cars with low fuel consumption should be purchased by the public sector.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                          
	Lost ground          
	Sir  The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha is losing its credibility (Morcha resets interim deadline, Dec 21). The hue and cry over the proposed interim set-up has led nowhere, disappointing the people greatly. It is hard to understand why the Morcha activists suddenly dropped the Gorkhaland idea and decided upon having the interim set-up, which is not what the people want.          
	The hill people are at the end of their tethers. Government offices are being shut down time and again by the Morcha. The frequent strikes called by the party cause havoc in peoples lives. Vendors make full use of the strikes by raising prices, thus burning huge holes in the common mans pocket. Tourists must be allowed to come to Darjeeling since tourism is the backbone of the hill economy. At present there is no law and order in the hills. Had there been a semblance of order, Madan Tamang would have been alive.          
	We do not want Darjeeling to become another Kashmir. We want education, jobs, and peace.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Janga Bahadur Sunuwar, Bagrakote, Jalpaiguri

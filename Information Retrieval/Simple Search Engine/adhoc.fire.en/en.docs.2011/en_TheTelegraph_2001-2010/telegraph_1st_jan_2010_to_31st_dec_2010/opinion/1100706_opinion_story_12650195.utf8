                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ALL ARE NOT WELCOME                                                                  
	Even after all these years, I still cannot forget that morning in Jaldapara. A white mist had floated in through the window of the jungle lodge, gently brushing the sleep away from my eyes. Awakened, I stood watching the early light flood the forest that was alive with bird-song. As the mist slowly lifted, I saw a herd of elephants silhouetted against the rising sun on the edge of the forest. A little later, I found myself atop Radha, a kunki (trained) elephant, and heading out towards the gleaming jungle on my first ever safari.        
	Every jungle has its own fragrance, wrote Corbett. Jaldaparas air smelt of wet earth, flowers and decaying vegetation. The mahout, an experienced man, whispered the secrets the forest held even as Radha ambled past a pack of foraging boars, a frightened hog deer and a muddy rhinoceros.        
	Then, I saw a strange species, one of the 50,000 that apparently visit Indias national parks every year. He came riding an elephant like Radha, and was adorned in a red hat and track pants. A walkman dangled from his ears; its thumping beat forced the rhino to leave the mud-pool in disgust. Then, in a tone that momentarily drowned the chirping avians and the screeching monkeys, he demanded, Akta bagh dekhio dao bhai, bari jai (Show me a tiger and I will go home).        
	 Tourists, as was evident from my experience in Jaldapara, can be a nuisance. Ignorant but curious, they are guilty of disturbing animals, littering the jungle, and damaging the fragile environment. The proposal by the National Tiger Conservation Authority to phase out tiger tourism in Indias tiger reserves, therefore, has its merits. It is important to reduce the pressure that tourism brings with it on Indias national parks. To cite just one example, in 2008-09, more than two lakh people, included 8,757 foreigners, visited the Corbett national park in Uttarakhand. But the revenue earned through eco-tourism is crucial to conservation efforts in a nation as impoverished as ours. (In the same period, visitors to the Corbett national park generated a revenue of Rs 306.38 lakh.) The death of tourism would also threaten the survival of local populations that cater to the needs of the visitors.        
	Liberating the jungles from any form of human presence is a complicated issue. Indias indigenous peoples have co-existed peacefully with the forest and its animals. Their rights to the forest and its produce are now recognized by law. But the State continues with its devious efforts to displace local populations in the name of conservation. On some occasions, such measures have been justified because villagers living inside forests have been known to be involved in poaching. Human habitation inside national parks has also intensified man-animal conflicts and denuded the forests of its natural wealth. But in India, like elsewhere in the world, conservation efforts can only succeed if they are based on an inclusive model. The experiments in Periyar and Kaziranga have shown that Indias forests can be protected and managed successfully by utilizing the skills and traditional knowledge of the local people.        
	Perhaps, the government should now think of including tourism as a tool in its conservation plans. The African nations have shown that tourism and conservation need not be mutually exclusive. To ease the tensions underlying the apparently contradictory directions in which tourism and conservation are being pulled, the State must pay serious attention to conservationists. It must limit its role to that of a facilitator and leave the framing of policies to experts.        
	Three things could be looked into. Dividing national parks into separate zones on the basis of ecological importance and then regulating tourist inflow into them. For instance, tourists like the one I had met in Jaldapara can be kept out of the core areas but not the peripheries. Eager, but inconsiderate, visitors may find this harsh, and revenue collections may also drop. Yet, an effective communication mechanism is necessary to change tourists perceptions about environment and nature tourism. More so because the State is capable of neutralizing the monetary loss. It only has to raise the budgetary allocation of Rs 2,129 crore  2 per cent of the total outlay towards Indias environment and forests. Otherwise, the issue of environmental depredation will continue to remain absent from political dialogue and policy. But even a paltry sum has to be spent carefully, and in a transparent manner. And it is not always a good idea to involve global financial institutions in conservation projects. Nagarhole, where the India Ecodevelopment Project, sponsored by the State and the World Bank, failed miserably, is a case in point.        
	But given our muddled policies, and poverty both literal and in terms of ideas  it is possible that populist concerns will be prioritized over those of the environment. I will not be surprised if I get to see that man again, and far fewer rhinos, when I visit Jaldapara next.

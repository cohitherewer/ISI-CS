	The ministers in the United Progressive Alliance government have Pranabda to thank for ending the austerity drive that had been launched late last year. The credit for pushing the finance minister to loosen the strings a bit, however, goes to Farooq Abdullah. At a recent cabinet meeting, Abdullah is supposed to have asked Mukherjee when the drive would end. He added that it was terribly uncomfortable for a man of his physical stature to fit into an economy-class seat. Praful Patel, Dayanidhi Maran and Sharad Pawar joined Abdullah and voiced their concerns. Facing the gang, Pranabda is supposed to have smiled weakly and said that the order was valid for the last fiscal year only. During that time, Mukherjees men in North Block claim to have saved upto Rs 2,000 crore. For the political honchos, the drive was too big a price to pay for the small mercies in public life.                            
	The IPL may be beating all other TV programmes hollow, but Punjabs deputy CM, Sukhbir Singh Badal, insists that attendance at the ongoing kabaddi world cup in Amritsar is no less spectacular. Badal even hit out at cricketer-turned-MP, Navjyot Singh Sidhu, for his absence from the event by saying that few would care to listen to his wisecracks on TV when the real match was being played on the kabaddi turf. The Punjab government has pulled out all the stops for the event: the winner is supposed to get a prize money of one crore. But where the IPL is concerned, the Badals have already lost the game.                        
	 When Shahnawaz Hussain, the Bharatiya Janata Party MP, landed himself in hospital, people thought it was a mark of protest against the work allotment by the new BJP chief, Nitin Gadkari. But Hussain did go under the scalpel. Gadkari has now sent messengers carrying Get Well Soon messages. One senior leaders take on the matter: Mazak mazak mein gaye the, serious ho kar nikal aye (he went casually but returned on a serious note).                            
	 When Congressmen feel bitter, they wear it on their sleeves. The Union health minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and the Jammu and Kashmir state Congress chief, Saifuddin Soz, make no secret of the bad blood between them. Last week, when Azad went to Srinagar on a four-day visit, he went to play at the Royal Spring Golf Course. It so happened that Soz too landed there at the same time. To the dismay of the onlookers, the senior Congress leaders did not exchange a single word or even a customary greeting. The latest stand-off has resulted from Sozs decision to admit Imtiyaz Parrey, son of the late militant leader, Kukka Parrey, in the party fold. Azad, unsurprisingly, is opposing the move tooth and nail.                            
	 Fire outbreaks in Ram Vilas Paswans residence seem to be politically significant. Almost a year back, a fire broke out at Paswans 12 Janpath residence. Immediately afterwards, Sonia Gandhi, who is his neighbour, called up to enquire about the situation and asked him about his and his familys well being. The time was crucial as Paswan was eager to tie up with the Congress for the general elections. But things didnt quite work out. A few days ago, another fire had broken out at his residence. The Bihar elections are round the corner this time. Will another phone call work wonders again?                            
	 First, he made a splash with his book. It was followed by the furore over his expulsion from the BJP. But now, Jaswant Singh seems to have vanished from the public eye. However, the discerning will know that Singh has been doing the rounds of the lecture circuit to push up the sales figures of his book in relatively small towns.      
	The grapevine has it that Singh is even set to make the long-promised promotional visit to Pakistan. Come Wednesday, Singh will be feted by the Pakistani elite in Islamabad at a dinner lined up by his publishers. The previous evening, he is scheduled to speak on Culture, politics and change in South Asia in Karachi. But all minus the shock value, of course.                          
	Dayanidhi Marans associates, apparently, are offering 60-inch flat TVs to politicians to watch IPL Direct to Home without any advertisement breaks. Congress unit chiefs have been complaining about the drop in membership ever since Rahul Gandhis reformist agenda made photographs of ordinary members mandatory. Congress leaders, used to lifting names from electoral rolls, are now finding it difficult to obtain such photographs. Now, Oscar Fernandes has advised free digital cameras for block-level leaders. But unlike Marans DTH, his idea does not have too many takers.

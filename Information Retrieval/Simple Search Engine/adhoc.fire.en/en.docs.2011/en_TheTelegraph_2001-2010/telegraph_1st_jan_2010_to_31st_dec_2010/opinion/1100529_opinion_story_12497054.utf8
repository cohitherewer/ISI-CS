The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | doctoring the past
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DOCTORING THE PAST                                                          
	The word, history, has two different but interconnected meanings: what happened in the past, and how what happened in the past is remembered and narrated in the present. The past stretches interminably behind the present and in the absence of a time machine cannot actually be reached. But the past bequeaths to the present clues  the great French historian, Marc Bloch, called them traces  on the basis of which the past can be accessed and only partially reconstructed and interpreted. These traces could be documents  letters, diaries, memoirs, official records of the government and so on  or archaeological remains such as inscriptions, ruins, coins and artefacts. Historians use these traces and then arrange them to retrieve the past with a certain degree of coherence. Without this act of retrieval and reconstruction, the past would lie unknown, there would be no history. But the historians accounts of the past are critically dependent on the raw material  or traces of the past  that can be found.        
	Among the indispensable resources that a historian uses are accounts of past events written by witnesses, in other words, by contemporaries or even by the actors themselves  diaries, private papers and some records fall into this category. Many question marks hang over such accounts: how truthful were the writers; were they actually there; what were their prejudices; did they have a score to settle and other similar doubts? The writing of history thus becomes a very hazardous process. Actually, how hazardous this can be is revealed very tellingly by the ongoing controversy within the Indian army. It transpires from the proceedings of the Armed Forces Tribunal that a brigadiers reports of operations in a critical sector during the Kargil war of 1999 were doctored and distorted by his superiors. In other words, any history of the war written on the basis of the existing documentation would present a completely wrong picture of the events. It is fortunate that this doctoring of documents has been discovered. But the incident should caution historians about the veracity of documents, which historians often refer to as primary sources.        
	Reports are suggesting that the Indian army is particularly cavalier in its approach to history and documentation. It is alleged that crucial records pertaining to the beginning of the liberation struggle in Bangladesh and to Indias role in it have been destroyed. The Indian army is still unwilling to make public the Henderson Brooks report concerning the Sino-Indian military encounter in 1962. The military is notorious for guarding its records and for its secrecy. Now, it has been revealed under the shroud of security concerns it also falsifies its own history and thereby misleads posterity. Yet, the armed forces are zealous guardians of their own traditions. What is tradition without history?

	Studio 21s ongoing exhibition, The Other Vision (till Feb 12), brings together three artists set apart by style as well as age. They aspire to look beyond the here and now, into the mysteries of memory and perception. With urgent, intense, shocking images, they peel off the film of familiarity, adding strangeness to the seemingly mundane.        
	Goutam Khamaru is the seniormost and better known of the three, although, compared to Sambaran Das and Anup Mondal, his work looks cosily traditional. His Animal Series is the result of complex experiments with colour and form, harking back to a long tradition of bovine icons, from primitive cave paintings to Picassos mythical Minotaur. A curious sense of calm emanates from his work in spite of the fiery colours and strikingly erotic motifs.        
	Mondal, the youngest of the lot, is a sculptor, whose abiding theme is body horror, which has been much tried and tested by now. His lifesize figures in stainless steel, riddled with nails and held together by metal units, seem to be stitched into being. With the hint of a terrible scream lingering on their lips, they look towering and fragile all at once. Somnath Hores skeletal figures come to mind, as do the wildly contorting faces and torsos of Dal, who is alluded to in Persistence of Becoming Numb. The title is cleverly ironic, resonating with the cold stillness of steel as well as with the steeliness of death. In another work, Blakes lamb is displaced from its sylvan setting, and set amidst the urban jungle, its tender fleece giving way to the unyielding crudeness of aluminium and steel.        
	The most sophisticated work comes from Das, whose excellence owes as much to his superb draughtsmanship as to a well-furnished mind. His pen-and-ink drawings are finely executed studies of everyday life, distinguished by powerful strokes and dynamic cross-hatching. A dog, twisting itself with a sudden jerk, a peculiar melange of moving bodies in Crucifix (picture), attest to Dass skilful control of form and perspective. There are fleeting recollections of moments from art and literature that have now become part of the post-modern psyche. In Metamorphosis, a sickly man, with claw-like hands, lies in bed. The work brings to mind Kafkas Gregor Samsa. Strongly reminiscent of van Goghs chair, a wooden seat, in Dass acrylic, is trapped inside what looks like an invisible box, suggested by the shaky white outline (Solitude). Minimalism persists in The Other Piece, in which a piece of wood shimmers with mysterious possibilities. Das is proficient in various idioms. The skewed panorama of a railway station, teeming with life, is a startling exercise in colours and crumbling forms. Grotesque faces suspended in a sea of smog, disparate planes of existence colliding with one another, and the contrast of bright and dark colours recall the dystopic cityscapes of Sudhir Patwardhan and Krishen Khanna.

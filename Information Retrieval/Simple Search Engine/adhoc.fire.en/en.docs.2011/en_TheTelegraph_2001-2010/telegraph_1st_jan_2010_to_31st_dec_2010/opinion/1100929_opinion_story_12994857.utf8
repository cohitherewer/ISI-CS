	Q: I had an arranged marriage in March 2009. I soon discovered that my wife was mentally unstable. She was also incapable of staying away from her parents, and this disrupted our conjugal life frequently. Ultimately, she left in November 2009, and sought a mutual separation. We have neither met nor spoken since. Yet she refuses to sign any divorce document. How can I get out of this situation?        
	Name withheld                
	A: If you have made up your mind to divorce your wife, you can file a suit for divorce against her without her consent, establishing appropriate grounds under the matrimonial laws. But your wife may contest the suit.              
	Q:I want to buy a flat from a person who constructed flats on the land he got by way of gift from the West Bengal government in 1996, on condition that he could not sell it for 10 years. The vendor says he has all the legal papers except the municipal corporations sanction plan. Can I file a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court to make the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) sanction the plan of the flat that I want to buy?        
	R.K. Pilania, Hooghly, West Bengal                
	A: Since you do not own the property, you have no legal right to seek any direction upon the KMC. Besides, the property seems to be a refugee gifted land. Thus the construction of the flat without a sanction plan is illegal and is liable to be demolished by the KMC in the future.              
	Q:I was allotted a plot of land in the Rajarhat area of Calcutta by the Housing and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HIDCO). The deed of registration was duly executed. With a photocopy of the deed we approached HIDCO for the possession letter. But it is now insisting that we furnish the certified copy of the deed instead of a photocopy. Is HIDCO justified in this demand?        
	M.K. Bhattacharyya, via email                
	A: Since the title of the property has already passed in your favour, it makes little sense (unless there is some other issue involved) for HIDCO to demand a certified copy just for the purpose of granting possession. After the registration has taken place, you are entitled to get possession without any hassles.

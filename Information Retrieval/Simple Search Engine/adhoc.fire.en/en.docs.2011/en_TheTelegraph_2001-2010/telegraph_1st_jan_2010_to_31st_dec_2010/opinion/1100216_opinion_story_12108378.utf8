	It has been said that if one tortures statistics enough, they will confess to anything. Given the surprising industrial output numbers for December  the index of industrial production grew by nearly 17 per cent over December 2008, well above the expected 12.4 per cent  it is not unreasonable to ask whether that has happened. Month on month, the IIP in December grew 10.9 per cent over November. Fourteen out of the 17 industry groups within the IIP showed positive growth over the previous year, and some were spectacular. Take transport, machinery and parts (essentially automobiles), which grew at 82.2 per cent; machinery and equipment  code for capital goods  grew at 44.6 per cent. While the December 2009 numbers are offered as proof that the turnaround is real, several analysts are confused about where that additional 4.4 per cent came from. There are a few factors  or changes in factors  that could explain the rather phenomenal numbers. Take the base effect. Much of the output growth is on a very low base: in many sectors, like automobiles, growth was negative in December 2008. Or even consumer durables, where output actually dropped in December from November, but compared to December 2008, it still grew 46 per cent. Consumer non-durables, on the other hand, continue to grow so much more slowly.         
	Second, there could be different impacts from the change in base year. The advance estimates of gross domestic product growth released by the Central Statistical Organisation last month were arrived at with 2004-05 as the base year updated from 1999-2000 (the base year for the IIP). Since advance estimates are based on factors like IIP growth, it may be akin to making orange juice with apple sauce. A change in base year also involves changes to the composition of the IIP; for example, black-and-white televisions are included in the 1999-2000 base, but in 2004-05 they may have been replaced by more advanced variants. True, the overall change in weights assigned to products in the new composition may not have a marked effect on overall output growth, but the more granular the information, the better the decisionmaking.         
	Third, when the December 2009 data are seasonally adjusted  to extract real trends and patterns  the growth momentum is still strong, but not as much as the unadjusted numbers show. For example, seasonally adjusted IIP growth in December was 3.2 per cent over November 2009, compared to the unadjusted 10.9 per cent; adjusted manufacturing growth was 3.4 per cent in December 2009 over November, compared to an unadjusted 11.6 per cent. While the IIP statistics are technically accurate, particular numbers can be misleading. Watch out for them.

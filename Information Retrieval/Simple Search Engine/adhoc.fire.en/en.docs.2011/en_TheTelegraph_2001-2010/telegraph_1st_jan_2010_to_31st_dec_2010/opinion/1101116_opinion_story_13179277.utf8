The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | TIME TO PASS THE BATON
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO PASS THE BATON                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Finally, we have a chief minister of Maharashtra who was among the unpredictable candidates. And thank god for the change. The appointment can, if carefully calibrated, alter the downward trajectory of a state that was once the nerve centre of an emerging nation. The frightening nexus of business, government and politics  operating as one overpowering machine  generated corruption on a scale that continues to destroy all semblance of morality and probity, civil society and humanity. Mumbai symbolizes this degradation. The political-administrative land grab and an aggressive builders lobby have together consolidated corruption and actively nurtured the deviations from the law of the land. Will Prithviraj Chavan have the strength to take on the mafiosi and change course?        
	I have often wondered why our Central leadership does not address the nation on the State-controlled national television channel and talk about the need to cleanse the body politic. We have a clean prime minister and some very corrupt cabinet ministers. The perception among the citizens is that misgovernance, incompetence and corruption have sunk the country to unimaginable depths.         
	Surely, we need some proactive intervention from within the government that would include members of civil society and lead the process of correction. In order to renew their trust in government, the people must be allowed to participate in the exercise of governance.        
	But no easy solution is in sight. This energy of an emerging economic power could easily become lumpen and destroy India further. Sane and civil infrastructure is imperative to nurture this extraordinary vitality. India has become obsessed with its foreign policy for the last few years at the cost of a plethora of dangerous internal realities. The reform of the moribund administration is consciously ignored. Maybe the National Advisory Council needs to push this critical agenda and compel the government to set in motion a radical change.                
	Long sprint        
	The abject neglect of the overwhelming internal problems is bound to have a negative effect on development. Why is one accelerated at the cost of the other? Is the political leadership being held captive by a corrupt bureaucracy that has turned rogue? Is India becoming a banana republic at the hands of men and women who neither have the vision nor the intellectual wherewithal that their predecessors had? Is the education system so deeply flawed that it is merely churning out superficial file pushers and file stallers? Why has politicking and devious manipulation been permitted to run amok? And finally, does the prime minister and his cabinet members see this truth or have they been so isolated from India and its people that they live in an ivory tower?        
	Sonia Gandhi feels the pulse and has been able to rebuild the Congress Party. Rahul Gandhi appears to have a clear idea of what he wants to do to restructure the mess. The sense one gets is that the wheeler-dealers have not managed to get a grip on Rahul Gandhi and his operating system, and have been unable, thus far, to access and corrupt him. Many are hanging fire, not knowing how to enter the realm of the young man in an effort to survive the future.        
	To rebuild, renew and then reinvent the party, it is the long sprint that is important, not the 100-metre dash to the goal for one term. Those in power strive for the short-term we must stay in power policy and, with money and blackmail, often manage to deliver that by the skin of their teeth. The result  India is being steadily brutalized. Maybe we need to pass the baton and discard the baggage we are carrying.

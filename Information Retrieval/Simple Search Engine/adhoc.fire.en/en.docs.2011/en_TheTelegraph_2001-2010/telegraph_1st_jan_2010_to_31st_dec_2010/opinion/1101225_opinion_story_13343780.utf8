The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Hopes raised, then dashed
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOPES RAISED, THEN DASHED                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Nandikars 27th National Theatre Festival, Remembering Rabindranath Tagore, showcased only two new Tagore productions, plus two musical presentations. Ironically, not by design, it featured as many as four Tendulkar dramas, an accurate index of relative popularity on the Indian stage even during this special Tagorean anniversary.        
	Prachyanats Raja  Ebang Anyanya, from Dhaka, enthused us with Azad Abul Kalams novel directorial concept of politically interpreting Raja, but then rapidly slid into a mix of travesty and imposition. Just like the menacing soldiers in the hall who disappear after the play begins, the initial spark dissipates. The problem with the uncut Raja is the inessential plot of battling kings sprawling over the midsection, which Tagore himself edited in Arup Ratan. Kalam tackled this head-on, making the kings relevant to our time by dressing them up as assorted international leaders like Manmohan Singh, an Arab sheikh, a cowboy with a stars-and-stripes scarf (Kanchiraj), and others. In such a context, Sudarshana obviously symbolizes Bangladesh.        
	But inspecting the royal ramp closely, we found one powerful country missing. China. Evidently, Kalam sees no threat there. This blind spot immediately defeats his purpose for, if anything, Tagore attacked all kinds of inhuman State machinery. Moreover, Kalam forces burlesque on the actors in these parts, trivializing Tagores grand spiritual journey. In a feeble attempt to contemporize, he repeatedly screens overused videos ranging from atom bombs to 9/11, as if we cannot make these connections ourselves. Yet, he baulks at Tagores inclusiveness  he excludes his cowboy villain from the enlightenment at the end. On the positive side, the energetic dancing (picture) choreographed by Snata Shahrin attained professional levels, and combined Indian classical with Western innovatively. But Kaartiks music and singing were surprisingly weak, besides leaving out many of the best songs. Much of the impact depends on Sudarshana and Surangama  given flat, cardboard portrayals by Afsana Mimi and Rubaiya Manjur, respectively, while Kalams own voice as the Raja affected the standard Bengali poetic clich. Only Sanjida Anwars Rohini was unusual in her liveliness.         
	In the other production, Gunakar Dev Goswami dramatized the narrative poem, Abhisar, in Assamese for Purbaranga (Guwahati), faithfully rendering one of Tagores many texts in which a woman desires romantic love but learns that the truest love lies elsewhere  like Raja. He directs it in colourful local dance-theatre style, but overly decorative, as a result of which the acting takes a back seat, whether it is Vasavadatta the courtesan or Upagupta the monk.

	Every city gets the politicians it deserves. The campaign for next Sundays civic polls in Calcutta shows why the city is so decadent. This should have been the time for the politicians to tell the citizens what they propose to do in order to make it a more liveable city. They had much to answer for during this campaign. Strangely, the sound and fury that filled the citys air for the past few weeks had little to do with the citizens worries. One would have expected the politicians to explain why the roads are in a perennial state of disrepair, why the pavements are overflowing with an ever-advancing army of hawkers or why air and noise pollution levels are so appallingly high. Instead, what one has seen in Calcutta and the districts, where too civic elections will take place, is an utter lack of seriousness in addressing such issues. A few candidates who have sought to raise environmental and other basic issues have been derided as oddballs. Otherwise, the campaign has been all about the so-called political issues that dominate state assembly or the Lok Sabha polls.         
	If the politicians do not see the absurdity of their actions, it shows how cynical they are to the peoples concerns and expectations. But it also points to the larger problem that has distorted democratic politics in Bengal and caused enormous damage to both its economy and society. Everything in Bengal is reduced to partisan politics. Worse still, this tendency is sought to be justified in the name of a supposed political society. The debates are not about actual work in specific areas, but about airy stuff that generates hot air but no concrete results. Good and evil are sought to be defined in the vicious terms of partisan politics. Recent events in Bengal, especially over the issue of industrialization, have shown that the politicians would think of destroying the states economy in their pursuit of power. Even the government works, when it does at all, as if it is the custodian of the ruling partys, and not the peoples, interests. But if the government and the parties would not learn, the people have no choice but to do so. When they go to vote for these polls, Calcuttans and the people in the districts should do what the politicians have not done. They must take the quality of their civic life into account and make their choices. That would be their only way to call the politicians bluff.

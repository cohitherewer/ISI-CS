	There may or may not be something rotten in the Indian Premier League. For arguments sake, it may be permissible to proceed on the assumption that something is very seriously wrong in the outfit that is responsible for running the most popular form of cricket in India. The assumption can be extended to include the impression that the IPL is riddled with corruption. Even after accepting all this, one all-important question remains: how can what is happening within the IPL, however bad, be the subject of an enquiry conducted by a joint parliamentary committee? The IPL, like its parent body, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, is not a government body; nor does it utilize funds from the States exchequer. Parliament cannot intrude into its affairs. In fact, a JPC on the IPL would be a paradox since it would mean spending public money to investigate the affairs of a private organization. What is well within the purview of the governments jurisdiction is an investigation to find out if any laws of the land have been violated in terms of non-payment of taxes and other financial irregularities. Beyond these investigations, the State should keep the IPL at arms length.        
	It could be asked if the State kept its distance from the IPL, how would the wrongdoings within the IPL be corrected or rectified? The answer is simple. They would be corrected in the same way in which any private body corrects internal errors and lacunae. In other words, the BCCI would have to take the necessary steps to find out what misdeeds were perpetrated by the IPL, what went wrong and who are responsible. Following these, corrective action would have to be taken and the required safeguards put in place to prevent recurrence. Already, voices have been raised from within the governing council of the IPL  by no less a person than Indias former captain, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi  that questions should have been asked earlier. This suggests that adequate safeguards were not followed. It can be expected that the BCCI, even without the States intervention, would take measures to tighten its own administration. This is what any private body would do for its own self-preservation and out of its own self-interest. The BCCI should clean up the IPL and not expect the State to do this.        
	This demand for a JPC made by all the opposition parties is evidence of a mindset that is nothing more than a throwback to the days of socialism. It was believed in those heady days that everything was under the State, and the latter could thus intervene and interfere wherever it wanted. That faith in the all-powerful State lingers on even in the era of liberalization. It is difficult to convince members of parliament who thrive on socialist rhetoric that it is not the business of the State to get into the business of sport. The State should focus on any violations of law and on the established rules and regulations.

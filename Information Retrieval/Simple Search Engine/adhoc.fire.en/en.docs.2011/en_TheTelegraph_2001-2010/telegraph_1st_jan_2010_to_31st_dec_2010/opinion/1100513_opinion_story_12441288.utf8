	Exit New Labour, pursued by New Tory  to all purposes, this, in short, seems to be the outcome of the British general elections. After an agonizing wait, Britain finally got a formal coalition government for the first time since World War II, a truly historic occurrence for more than one reason. A hung parliament after 36 years not only provided Britains grand old party an opportunity to end the 13-year-long Labour rule, but also gave the Liberal Democrats their first real taste of power. A Lib-Lab coalition may have been more compatible, ideologically speaking, but a Lib-Con alliance appeared to have a more realistic chance of survival. Even with the support of the Lib Dems, Labour would have fallen short of majority. Nonetheless, Gordon Brown did bend over backwards to make compromises, but his initial resolve to cling on to power failed to push the negotiations in any fruitful direction. Yet it would be unfair to claim that political exigency cleared the way for David Cameron to emerge as the youngest British prime minister since 1812. Next to Margaret Thatchers aggressive Toryism, Mr Camerons ideals look decidedly benign. He has reformed the Neo-Cons into the New Cons, who have now been forced to reinvent themselves according to the demands of coalition politics.        
	It was expected that the traditionally Left-leaning Lib Dems and the elitist Tories would have a tough time arriving at a mutually acceptable compromise on cuts and tax rises  the two moves that can save the country from imminent disaster. However, while agreeing in principle to Mr Camerons austerity package to reduce fiscal deficit, Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, did not forget the core values of his party. He demanded relief for the poorest taxpayers and a veto on raising the ceiling for inheritance tax. Although Mr Cameron was gracious enough to recognize both these conditions, he has been less enthusiastic about electoral reform, another prized issue for his allies. For their part, the Tories held on to a cap on immigration, an illiberal marriage tax break, and an ambitious welfare reform programme. Both parties ruled out joining the euro  one of the most difficult issues on which the fate of any prospective coalition had hinged from the beginning. In all, Mr Cameron has acted like a genuinely liberal Tory. The centre has finally shifted.

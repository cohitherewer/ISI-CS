                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE LAST STRAW                                  GWYNNE DYER                              
	The remark was originally made about Napoleons decision to kidnap the Duc dEnghien and have him judicially murdered more than two centuries ago: It was worse than a crime; it was a blunder. It is often quoted when a government makes a decision, usually involving violence, that obviously harms its own cause. Like Israels decision to seize the flotilla of ships bringing aid to the besieged Palestinians of the Gaza Strip.        
	Imagine that you are the Israeli official charged with recommending the best course of action for dealing with that flotilla. So what things will you consider while you ponder your recommendation?        
	You are well aware that the purpose of the flotilla is mainly propaganda: to highlight the suffering of ordinary Palestinians as a result of Israels three-year blockade of the Gaza Strip. Some of the organizers doubtless hope that Israel will use violence against the ships, as that would give them more publicity, but theyll settle for just delivering the aid.        
	Israeli intelligence has its agents among the people organizing the flotilla, of course, so you know that there is nothing dangerous in the 10,000 tons of cargo. Most of it is concrete and steel to help in the reconstruction of homes and schools destroyed during Israels Cast Lead operation against Hamas militants in Gaza last year.        
	Anyway, be realistic: there are all sorts of contraband coming into the Gaza Strip through the tunnels on the Egyptian border. Why dont we just wave these ships through as a humanitarian gesture? That will spoil their little propaganda game, and they havent the resources to do it twice.        
	True, our military guys say that they can just arrest all the ships en route and take them to one of our own ports in Israel: no muss, no fuss. But what if it goes wrong? Weve had one propaganda disaster after another recently, and its starting to do real damage.                
	Another disaster        
	Operation Cast Lead itself was not exactly a success: even our own official figures say we killed over 400 Palestinian civilians. Then there was that unfortunate announcement about building more Jewish homes in East Jerusalem while the vice-president of the United States of America, Joe Biden, was in Israel: President Obama hasnt really been speaking to us much since then.        
	Recently, we had a damaging revelation about how Israel offered to sell nuclear weapons to South Africa in the apartheid days. And now we have this flotilla thing, just as Obama has finally invited Prime Minister Netanyahu to Washington for a kiss-and-make-up session. Oh, and most of the people on the flotilla come from Turkey, the one Muslim country that sees Israel as an ally.        
	Do we really want to risk screwing all that up just to starve the Palestinians of an extra 10,000 tons of supplies? Lets just allow the flotilla through, and get the credit for being reasonable and even magnanimous.        
	I presume that the above is a fair representation of what went through the Israeli officials head as he or she considered what to do about the aid flotilla. But in the end, the decision went the other way. Why? Probably just because Israeli reflexes kicked in: an early resort to force has become the governments default mode of problem-solving in recent years.        
	Israeli spin-doctors try to shift the blame to the victims, but they cannot get around the fact that their heavily-armed troops illegally boarded a foreign ship in international waters, and that those troops then killed at least nine foreign civilians and wounded about 30 others.        
	Do Israeli spokespersons even understand that any professional army in the West that carried out such a botched and bloody operation would immediately suspend the commanders responsible and launch a major investigation? No, probably not. They have lost all perspective on themselves.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNHAPPY ARK                                  The Calcutta zoo is now a hushed space housing broken-spirited creatures. What it requires is a thoughtful overhaul                                                
	Of all the despondent creatures in the Alipore zoo, the spoonbills look the most forlorn. The birds, with their drooping eyes and lowered heads, are forever still and silent. This funereal silence has enveloped some of the other inmates as well. A jaguar, no bigger than a dog, lies panting inaudibly; Sundarkant, far away from his home in tide country, sulks in his cramped space, the elephants sniff the breeze noiselessly, while the lions and leopards wear a dazed look. One seldom hears a growl, a roar or even a trumpet. The zoo, a hushed space spread across 45 acres, shelters 1,270 birds, 231 mammals and 66 reptiles whose bodies and spirit lie broken.        
	The only noise that can be heard comes from those who roam free. Children and adults imitate animal and bird calls, beat the cages with sticks to startle the prisoners and, occasionally, tease them. It is just another day in the lives of the prisoners.        
	It is easy to be outraged by the zoo in Calcutta. As if the lack of space, unruly visitors and uncaring staff were not enough, a baby painted stork went missing within nine weeks of the Marmoset theft.         
	A sedated female chimpanzee fell to its death soon after, and the zoo staff, allegedly, had once drugged a rhinoceros so that it relieved itself more frequently. Its urine was then sold as a cure for impotence. Mercifully, the zoos disastrous Panthera Hybrid Programme, which involved the unethical mating between tigers and lions, has now been banned.                        
	The concept of a zoo poses an ethical problem too. Condemning animals to a life in fetters cannot be justified for the sake of public entertainment. Such an unnatural existence also leads to aggressive behaviour, and the frequent attempts by the monkeys and elephants in Alipore to injure their keepers bear evidence of this disturbing trend.         
	Yet, despite its faults, the zoo must remain, and in its present location. Inaugurated in 1876, it is a part of Calcuttas heritage. A change in its present location will also rob the migratory birds of a place to breed and rest during winter. And if the zoo were to be relocated, one shudders to think what is going to happen to this green stretch that lies in one of Calcuttas poshest localities.        
	What the zoo requires is a thoughtful overhaul. If it is managed properly, it can provide Calcuttans with an excellent opportunity to study and learn about wild animals. Such an education is of critical importance in India where poverty and the lack of education have led to a dangerous inclination to destroy the fragile natural world. The zoo authorities are now working on a masterplan to build larger, and more comfortable, enclosures, release the elephants into sanctuaries, and improve the living conditions of the other inmates. While all this is welcome, it has been reported that boating facilities and more ticket booths are a part of the renovation plan.         
	Instead of introducing measures aimed at commercial gain only, why not appoint volunteers who can help visitors discover the joys of observing animal behaviour? Human curiosity about animals is boundless, and a zoo can play a pivotal role in harnessing this interest towards creating a more productive and equitable man-animal relationship. Perhaps the present director, who remains as elusive as some of the animals, should also think of strengthening the infrastructure of the zoos veterinary hospital and its research facilities.         
	But the zoos transformation wont depend only on its management. It will require political will  before threatening pet shops with closure unless they regulated room temperatures, Jairam Ramesh should reflect on the kind of example Indias zoos set when it comes to animal care. The involvement and support of the people and public institutions, such as the judiciary and media, are also required to make the zoo a better place.         
	Until that happens, the zoos spoonbills, along with the other animals, will remain in their death-like trance. The shame of not bringing them to life is for all of us to share.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FLAG AND CLUB                                                    
	Any World Cup final that saw as many as 14 yellow cards given out by the referee cannot claim to have presented top-class football to the 84,000 people present in the stadium on Sunday night and to a few hundred million who watched the game on television across the world. The football was rough and defensive, and the match could easily have gone into a penalty shoot- out. The British referee, Howard Webb, had an unenviable job cooling temperatures and issuing cards. The prize of these went to the Dutch player, Nigel de Jong, who put his boot on the chest of the Spaniard, Xabi Alonso. By any reckoning, the match between Uruguay and Germany, played on Saturday, was better in terms of the skills displayed by the two teams. The World Cup final of 2010 was eminently forgettable since it did not produce a single movement or moment that a genuine football lover would love to cherish and see over and over again. There is nothing wrong with defensive football per se. But a soccer match is decided by the number of goals scored, not by the number of tackles made or the number of players felled. Expectations always run high during a World Cup final; this one failed to fulfil any of these. It was a football final sans football.        
	In spite of the disappointment, it was in the fitness of things that Spain lifted the trophy. Looking at the tournament as a whole, they were by far the better team, which played an exciting brand of soccer. The principal reason for this is the fact that as many as six members of the Spanish team play for the same club, which many experts think is the best club side to have come on to the football pitch in recent memory. The level of understanding among these players, nurtured and trained as they are under the same system, is inevitably superior and so are their skills. The Telegraph argued in these columns on Sunday, on the morning of the finals, that the quality of football at the club level is better than what was on show in the World Cup. Most of the top players are club professionals, and thus, their best performances are reserved for occasions when they wear their clubs colours. The performance of the Spanish team underlines the validity of the argument about the death of the nation state on the football pitch. Notwithstanding this, it needs to be noted that the nation state lives in public support as was evident over the last month. Footballers may not be patriotic, but their supporters are.

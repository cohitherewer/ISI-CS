                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IMPORTANCE OF CRICKET                                                          
	Mohammad Ali Jinnah, from his perch in the vaulted sky, must be wondering whether it was worth creating Pakistan, even though it was moth-eaten when the British gave it to him. It cannot even be said that the present state of affairs in the benighted State of Pakistan is the worst of times and that it shall pass. Since its caeserian birth out of Indias womb, Pakistans history has been tumultuous and tormented. But even in those chequered annals, it will be difficult to locate another period in which a quarter of the country is under water, when people are dying of pestilence and lack of food, when the international community is so suspicious of the political classs integrity that it refuses to be generous with aid, when its cricketers are tainted by corruption and its polity and society are completely overwhelmed by the most pernicious kind of militant Islamic fundamentalism. These are some of the glaring and principal features of contemporary Pakistan. All the clichs about a failed State, a society that moved from feudalism to crony capitalism and so on  the stock-in-trade of two generations of Pakistan watchers  seem too weak and weary to even begin to capture what is going on in Pakistan.        
	There is a clamour, not without justification after the revelations regarding corruption among the Pakistani cricketers now touring England, that Pakistan should be made the pariah of the cricketing community. It should be stopped from playing international tournaments till the Pakistan Cricket Board cleans up its Augean stables. But no one has any prescriptions regarding how this can be done in a country where the society and the polity are riddled with corruption. Evidently, politics and society at the grassroots have been transformed by the penetration of radical Islam. Religious fanaticism threatens the vestiges of civil society; it influences the army and even upsets the daily life of those who are not driven by fundamentalism. Worse, radical Islam makes Pakistan more insular by cutting it off from the forces of modernity.        
	Cricket is the one tenuous link that Pakistan has with the outside world. This point is not to be underestimated, given the games popularity in Pakistan. Cricket in Pakistan is the agent of globalization. To take international cricket away from it would be taking away the one instrument that hinders Pakistan from turning inwards and becoming utterly insular like the Taliban. Cricket may not stop the penetration of radical Islam but it can act as a tempering influence. It can defer Pakistans complete surrender to fundamentalism. The cry to put a ban on Pakistani cricketers ignores the wider context of Pakistans contemporary history. It brings to mind that old saying: what do they know of cricket who only cricket know? There was a time when the British saw their summer game as a civilizing influence. In a different era and in a different context, the point has a resonance.

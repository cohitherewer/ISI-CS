                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        COME CLEAN                                                    
	The B.S. Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka is the new standard-bearer for political morality. In the course of two successive confidence motions in the assembly recently, it defended horse-trading on the grounds that it was a lesser sin than the Oppositions attempt to bring the government down. It has extended this comparison to assess the recent charges of nepotism against the chief minister. The chief minister, Mr Yeddyurappa, has himself volunteered to weigh these charges in relation to what, he insists, were similar deeds committed by his predecessors. He has argued that the denotification of government land and their sale or transfer to his family members and associates do not amount to any serious crime since those in government before him did the same. The chief minister neither attempts to ignore the allegations of nepotism nor deny them. He is brazen enough to defend them on the grounds that they are the perquisites of power available to the holders of political office, who, as expected, make full use of them. He has, therefore, exonerated himself from these charges and sent the ball back to the Oppositions court. The bottom line is that if the Opposition is unable to prove itself any holier than Mr Yeddyurappa, he cannot be touched.         
	There is an undeniable core of truth in Mr Yeddyurappas defence, no matter how ridiculous and dangerous it is. What Karnataka is witnessing is institutionalized corruption, to which the Yeddyurappa government may have contributed rather generously, but which is not entirely of its making. For his crime to be proven, Mr Yeddyurappa wants the Opposition to come spotlessly clean. That, unfortunately, is unlikely to happen, and that knowledge is what gives the Bharatiya Janata Party government the confidence to hedge its bet on the continuation of public support. Unfortunately, it may be getting the timing wrong. The Congress, following the successive resignations of the scandal-tainted in the Central government, has somewhat reclaimed the moral high ground. Unlike before, the Congress may now be able to build up sustained pressure on the BJP government in the state and even capitalize on the eagerness of the Janata Dal (Secular) to see Mr Yeddyurappa go. Perhaps the BJP should follow the Congress in going for a change of face in Karnataka and attempt a makeover in its image.

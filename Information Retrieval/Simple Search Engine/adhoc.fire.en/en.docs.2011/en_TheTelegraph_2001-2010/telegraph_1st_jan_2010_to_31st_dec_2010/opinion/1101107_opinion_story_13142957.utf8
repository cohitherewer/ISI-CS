                              In the lime light        
	 The other day, the former president of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Rajnath Singh, arrived at the party office on Delhis Ashoka Road in the company of his successor, Nitin Gadkari. Naturally, they were trailed by hordes of mediapeople. But this time, the spotlight seemed to be trained on Gadkari, as both print and electronic media went berserk trying to get a sound bite out of him. However, Singh did not seem to mind very much. Instead of sulking for being slighted, he told the scribes that once he, too, had been a rising sun. Then turning to Gadkari, the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh offered a piece of advice: the media, he said, could be a double-edged sword. Under adverse circumstances, they can be lethal. In the mean time, another BJP leader, Sushma Swaraj, reached the spot. The leader of the Opposition was asked about her row with Narendra Modi, and if Gadkari had indeed had a word with her. Swaraj avoided a direct reply but insisted that as a person holding a position of great responsibility, she is well aware of her limits.                              
	 Ram Jethmalanis loss has been Kalraj Mishras gain. The latter, a BJP member of parliament from Uttar Pradesh, is playing host to politicians who are badminton enthusiasts. Jethmalani, at 86, is also a regular player, and has a court at his residence. It is used by the Haryana chief minister, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, whenever he is in Delhi (which is, on an average, thrice a week), Prithviraj Chavan, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Sandeep Dikshit and others. Jethmalanis house is currently being renovated, so his badminton buddies, cutting across party lines, have moved over to Mishras place. It is rumoured that the new host has become a part-time storyteller with so many of the high and mighty listening to him in rapt attention.                            
	 The Union human resource development and minority affairs ministries are constantly at loggerheads. The latest squabble to break out between Kapil Sibal and Salman Khurshid pertains to the opening of a big public school for minorities under the Maulana Azad Education Foundation, a wing of the minority affairs ministry. Sibal does not relish another government agency rolling out schools with sarkari funds. In the past, Sibal and Khurshid have also agreed to disagree on a number of issues. Does this have anything to do with the fact that Khurshid had once been, in a private capacity, the head of a major public school chain?                            
	 The latest joke in Maharashtra goes: No politician wants to be adarsh (ideal). Leaders are, no wonder, feeling all shaken up ever since the housing scam came out in the open. Many believe this may be only the tip of the iceberg. Meanwhile, the scandal has kept Pranab Mukherjee, the Congresss trusted crisis manager, busy. Pranabda has been suddenly called upon to play a major role again, as he so memorably did during the crisis over the Indo-US nuclear deal. In those days, when the Left parties were threatening to pull out support from the Manmohan Singh government, the media used to gather at Mukherjees residence on Talkatora Road. And after every meeting, Pranabda would get up on a chair to round up the session. This time, too, the media is expecting a replay of similar scenes.                            
	 It may be sheer coincidence, but curious nonetheless. A few months ago, the moment it was known that the Nationalist Congress Party chief, Sharad Pawar, would have to undergo a surgery, the entire controversy surrounding the Indian Premier League, in which he was implicated among others, suddenly seemed to have died down. There was a lot of speculation  more so after he was chosen to head the International Cricket Council  that since Pawar was too involved in the cricket business, some of the ministries under him would be taken away to facilitate the running of the government. The campaign against him gained momentum at the peak of the inflation and the agricultural crisis. Although the inflation has still not gone down, the criticism against Pawar seems to have vanished abruptly  a fact that he realizes all too well. At a recent press conference in the capital, he took pleasure in reminding the media that despite the excited conjecture, he continues to retain all the ministries that had been entrusted to him.

	 After Ratan Tata and Amitabh Bachchan, it is now Sachin Tendulkars turn to look towards Gujarat. The master blaster is planning to own a residential address in the state and has apparently booked a plot of land in an upcoming township in the Bavla taluka of Ahmedabad. But, unlike Bachchans politically motivated move, Sachins plan seems to have no ulterior motive.      
	The cricketers plot is located in a township planned around the 700-acre Kensville Golf and Country Club in Bavla, some 40 km from the state capital. Incidentally, the Kensville Golf Club is the only functional 18-hole golf course in Gujarat. The course has been already warmly endorsed by the renowned golfer, Jeev Milkha Singh, who had visited it last year.

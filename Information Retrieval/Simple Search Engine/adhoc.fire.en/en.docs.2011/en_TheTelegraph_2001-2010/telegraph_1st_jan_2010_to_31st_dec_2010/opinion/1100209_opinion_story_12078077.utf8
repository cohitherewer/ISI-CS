The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The rule of fear
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE RULE OF FEAR                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Fear is something that disables democratic functioning, and allows for arbitrary pronouncements by self-styled potentates to assault individual freedoms enshrined in modern, democratic constitutions and rule books. The Shiv Sena has held Mumbai to ransom using this tool, with the rich and privileged in that city falling prey to this constantly used tactic. They have succumbed to the blackmailing, have disgraced professionals and creative individuals by knuckling under pressure and have set wrong standards by surrendering to illegal demands by politicians who are defying the Constitution. Rahul Gandhi has defied Shiv Senas diktat. He entered Mumbai, did what he had to, spoke about what he believes in, and left for the next city in his travel schedule. Three cheers!        
	The present government, led by the Congress, has been dithering over the many issues that have been raised vociferously by the Sena. The chief minister, Ashok Chavan, made some rather ridiculously partisan statements about who should have the right and the first option to be taxi drivers in Mumbai. The invisible support given by the ruling coalition to Raj Thackeray in the belief that the act would split the Sena vote and benefit the Congress was another foolish move, which helped create yet another raging bull that the party could not tame. Are we setting the conditions for the creation of another Bhindranwale-type political persona?        
	With the straight-talking Rahul Gandhi asserting himself and the ideology of the Congress of today and the future, the leaders, exposed with gracious subtlety, will have to rethink their positions and reinvent themselves as quickly as possible if they want to add value to a party that is modernizing itself. They will have to disentangle themselves from the political shenanigans of the past and look for new mentors.                
	New leadership        
	The All India Youth Congress has a new chief and he is from Maharashtra. He will soon be responsible for galvanizing young Indians to join his party, and to work for a better, more egalitarian future. The young men and women we heard on television responding to Rahul Gandhi and his mission were an enthused lot and spoke of hope. Rahul Gandhi has no airs about himself. He symbolizes the opposite of that ghastly breed of VVIPs. He comes across as sincere, and has the strength of character to listen and hear, to look and see. In contrast, the other sycophantic leaders in the party come across as unthinking and archaic robots from another era.        
	The senior Bachchan has been silent, fearful of repercussions or whatever else that motivated the silence, but his son has twittered against the Shiv Senas onslaught. Likewise, others are garnering bits of strength to speak out in modulated tones, not quite sure whether they want to be heard loud and clear. Where are the emphatic statements from the film industry, corporates, Congress members, from the Left, Right and professionals? Why has Mumbai become intellectually and morally limp? Do Maharashtrians want to become an insular people and sacrifice a life of collective purpose? A progressive people will not tolerate any of this, except for a short while under the sceptre of fear.        
	If all the non-Maharashtrians in the state were to cease work for 48 hours, Mumbai would come to a standstill. Young India does not carry the baggage of Partition or colonization, and does not want to live in a world that is fragmented and governed by dogmatic and authoritarian regimes. They have aspirations that transcend parochial diktats. They are looking for open-minded leaders who will change the course and navigate them through a difficult transition by being inclusive and straightforward, without greed or malice.

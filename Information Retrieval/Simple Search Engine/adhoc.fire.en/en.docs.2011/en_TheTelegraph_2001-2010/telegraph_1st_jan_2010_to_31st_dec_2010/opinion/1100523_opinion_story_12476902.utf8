                On the same boat        
	After the latest Maoist strike in Chhattisgarh, an angry home minister had gone on record saying that he has a limited mandate from the cabinet committee on security when it comes to tackling the red menace. Expectedly, his comment handed the Bharatiya Janata Party a broom to beat the government with. Senior leader, Arun Jaitley, held a press conference at the party headquarters and criticized the home ministers remarks to his hearts content. But soon, the assembled scribes started asking Jaitley questions related to the developments in Jharkhand where the BJP is having a tough time forming a government with the wily Shibu Soren. Jaitley chose to duck the missiles that were hurled his way by saying that he too has a limited mandate from the party as far as answering such questions is concerned. He added that he has been instructed to brief the media on the Maoist problem, and that someone else has been entrusted with the responsibility of enlightening scribes on the situation in Jharkhand. Journalists, who had witnessed Jaitley put the home minister to the sword moments back, could not suppress a smile after coming to know of the BJP leaders predicament.                              
	 It looks like it is appraisal time for the government. UPA II has completed one year in office and friends and foes alike have busied themselves in analysing Team Manmohans performance. Plenty of heated exchanges have taken place. While supporters of the Congress have highlighted the governments achievements  for instance, the programmes meant to uplift the aam aadmi  the Opposition has gone to town complaining about price rise and Maoist violence. But how does the captain of the team look at his teams form? The country, especially the media, is eager to know the prime ministers own analysis, and it seems that the wishes are going to be fulfilled soon in the form of a press conference that the PM is expected to address. Incidentally, Manmohan Singh had given a rating of six out of ten when a similar exercise had taken place during UPA Is tenure. The score had irked many people within and outside the party. This time, Singh, who has matured considerably as a politician, is likely to be more cautious. The Prime Ministers Office is reportedly busy preparing possible questions that the PM would have to address and supplying the answers as well. If sources are to be believed, the PM may avoid giving a direct answer to the queries. On hearing this, some of Singhs detractors have been heard admitting grudgingly that he has mastered the traits of a true politician.                            
	 Will it, or wont it? These seem to be the two most popular questions that are being asked of the BJP, given the current crisis in Jharkhand. On some days, Jharkhand Mukti Morchas Shibu Soren warms up to the idea of sharing power with the BJP in the state, and Nitin Gadkaris face lights up. But soon, after yet another somersault by Guruji, there are talks of the BJP withdrawing its support. Amidst the confusion, it is LK Advani who is seen smiling frequently. It is well know that Advani, who is said to be sceptical of Sorens pledges of friendship, was against an alliance with Sorens party. But Gadkari, who was keen to add one more state to the BJPs kitty and hence establish his stamp of authority, gave the green signal for a tie-up. Now, Gadkari has been left wearing a frown while Advani chuckles quietly.                            
	 Not just Advani, but also some other BJP leaders seem to be miffed with Nitin Gadkari. The reason? The BJP chiefs 10-day European tour with his family. Questions are being raised as to whether it was necessary for Gadkari to go on a holiday at a time when the party seems to be running around in circles while attempting to form the government in Jharkhand. But Gadkari had informed partymen about his travel plans before he left. So what is the point of raising the hackles now? The news is that BJP workers are unhappy that while they toil in Delhis heat, their boss cools his heels in Europe.                            
	 Hollywood has Brangelina, and now copy-cat Bollywood has Shoelina. Celina Jaitley, who has over 1,400 pairs of shoes, has been rechristened thus. Now Jaitley insists that her collection is smaller, and that all her footwear, unlike Imelda Marcoss, has been bought with her hard-earned money. But trust the wicked world to go by its own assumptions.                        
	 Come summer and it is time for the netas to have a bite of the king of fruits. Chief ministers, prime ministers and presidents are gifted mangoes by the dozen by those placed lower in the pecking order. This time, the Bihar CM, Nitish Kumar, has ordered his officials to send zardalus  a special variety of mangoes from Bhagalpur  to the PM, president and other VVIPs. An orchard in Maheshi village in the Sultanganj block of Bhagalpur has been identified, and the district administration has placed orders for 425 packets of the juicy fruit. The officials have also been instructed to taste the mangoes before they are sent to the high profile guests. The recipients will, undoubtedly, be pleased with the gift. The officials are equally happy, having got an opportunity to taste the juicy delicacy for free.

	Hope rises                  
	Sir  It is heartening to learn that the Calcutta High Court has ordered a fresh probe into the Rizwanur Rahman case. It seems that the state government had backed the tainted cops earlier. That is why a fair inquiry had not been possible. The court has taken the right step in rendering the previous probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation null and void. However, the death of two key witnesses will make it difficult for the CBI to proceed with the new investigation. One hopes it will be able to nail the culprits this time.          
	Yours faithfully,        A.S. Mehta, Calcutta
                  
	Forgotten treasures          
	Sir  Considering the callous attitude and the slipshod work culture that India has, it is better to allow the paintings of Rabindranath Tagore to remain where they are (To bid or not to bid, May 23). In that case, the paintings will, at least, be looked after and not get stolen. The Indian authorities stir into action at the last minute whenever the belongings or works of a national hero are about to be auctioned. This was seen on an earlier occasion as well when some of the belongings of Mahatma Gandhi were put on auction in New York.          
	We are so irresponsible that we could not even safeguard the Nobel Prize received by Tagore. The invaluable medallion was lost because of sheer negligence on the part of the concerned authorities. Therefore, unless the government undertakes a firm resolution to bring back Tagores paintings and arranges for their proper conservation, it would be prudent to let them remain with the Sothebys.          
	Yours faithfully,         Ranjit Sinha, Calcutta
      
	Sir  The editorial, To bid or not to bid, rightly states, A visit to any government museum/gallery in India will show how badly the Indian masterpieces are displayed and preserved. This is true not only of government museums and galleries, but also of heritage buildings that need to be preserved. The Nritya Gopal Smriti Mandir in Chandernagore, for example, is in need of proper care and maintenance. However, the state government has done little to conserve buildings such as this one. These heritage sites lie neglected, and will be damaged and demolished in due course.          
	It is unfortunate that the people choose to remain mute spectators to the governments apathy, We have refrained from protesting against the auction of Tagores paintings as the works are privately owned. We seem to be content with the idea that the works of Tagore are perhaps better off in a gallery abroad. At least they will be looked after there. The government can spend huge sums on weapons, but is reluctant to use a small amount to bring back the creations of a great Indian artist.          
	Yours faithfully,        R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly            
	Reaching out  
	Sir  The United Progressive Alliance governments efforts to end the alienation of the tribal people are praiseworthy (New deal, May 26). The finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, has emphasized the urgency of development work in the Maoist-dominated areas across the country. This is the only way to stop rebellion among the deprived communities. But the governments venture to build schools, roads, health centres and other infrastructure in tribal-majority areas will only bear fruit if it is a genuine attempt to improve the condition of the tribals and not a ploy to secure vote banks before the approaching elections.          
	Yours faithfully,         Dilip Kumar Kar, Jalpaiguri

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | remains of the past
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        REMAINS OF THE PAST                                  Malvika Singh                              
	If there is a semblance of propriety and integrity that survives in the India of 2010, then it is to be found in the Supreme Court, the Election Commission and the National Advisory Council, to name three institutions that come to mind. They have a substantial role to play at this moment in our history when fresh fundamentals with a new set of rules for the future are to be set down. One exercise would be to make the Central Bureau of Investigation an autonomous, statutory body, much like the EC, and thus rid us of the constant sniping between the Opposition and the ruling dispensation. Frankly, each of these combinations and individual parties that has been in power in the past has been accused of using the CBI to deal with personalized agendas. These charges brought much discredit to the CBI and to those who work for it. If the Congress were to deliver this one major change, it would be salutary.        
	It is amusing to see groups of blood brothers ruling the many worlds of big business, politics and government services. The Patel brothers, the Bellary brothers, the Satyam brothers are all in the private domain of the traditional family structure. All corporate houses in the private sector have a family member either on the board or in a non-executive position or at the helm running the show. In our administration too, the baton was passed, in a manner of speaking, from father to son, in the earlier decades after Independence, till such time that other professions became more lucrative in a rapidly changing, unrestrictive marketplace.         
	I remember parents in the Indian Civil Services and Indian Administrative Services actively encouraging their sons and daughters to sit for the exam. The reason being that if you were in government, you were safe. You got a free roof over your head and almost everything else free as well. You could not be sacked even if you were incompetent, corrupt or conniving. Fathers, mothers, mistresses, lovers, aunties, uncles, brothers, sisters, children and grandchildren continue to stab one another in the back to take on the mantle from a retiring member of the family who is in politics.                
	Broken pillars        
	These professions and their octopus-like arms  the military, the paramilitary, the police, the revenue service and suchlike  dominate life in this nation, overwhelming and suffocating all other endeavours, be they disciplines and skills of the mind or of the spirit. But the times are changing, and the shrinking marketplace of the world has put those who were second citizens in their own country till not so long ago onto a stage that is competitive and highly rewarding, both in monetary terms and for uplifting the soul. This has led to a redefinition of what was once seen as an elite service. A profound insecurity has invaded those mighty portals and a mean and envious strain has mutated within the body of the service. To redeem itself of the growing misery, members of the service have merged with the most privileged caste of all on the national list of castes, the political caste. From being a non-partisan institution, the civil services now take sides and have become terminally politicized. That fungus has attached itself to the pillars of our democracy, gnawing at the fabric of India.        
	The best and brightest elements of our much tried and tested civilization have been crushed to virtual death. People, skills, ideas, alternatives have been neglected and destroyed over the last 60 years. However, there were brief moments of sanity and exuberance when proactive national leaders, senior bureaucrats of high intellectual repute and fine businessmen took on challenges and put India on the international map as standing apart from its third world counterparts. We are living off those remains.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	All talk                  
	Sir  Every time India and Pakistan hold talks, the dialogue receives a lot of media coverage and there is a fresh wave of optimism. In retrospect, the media hype around the Indian foreign secretarys visit to Pakistan was unnecessary (Eye on Chidambaram at Pak talks, June 24). No concrete steps have been taken by either country yet. The democratically elected government in Pakistan is constantly at the mercy of the countrys army and the Inter-Services Intelligence. There can be no meaningful dialogue with Pakistan unless the army and the ISI also participate in the talks. The Indian government has never raised this issue. Indias recent offer to hold talks with Kashmiri separatists is not sufficient to address the situation. Moreover, it is important that the interests of Kashmiri Pandits are also taken into account.          
	Separatist leaders often incite violence in pursuit of their demands but expect to be treated humanely in return. It is also ironic that the Indian government has spent crores on the security of offenders like Afzal Guru and Ajmal Kasab, who have been convicted for terrorist activities. Meanwhile, the common man in India does not feel secure, neither is any of his demands met. The country is riddled with security problems posed by terrorism and the Maoist menace, as well as with economic problems like inflation. The government, however, seems powerless to address the situation.          
	It is important that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his administration take decisive action to solve the problems. India must not be mistaken for a toothless giant.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S.P. Sharma, Mumbai 

      
	Sir  The apparent success of the foreign-secretary-level talks held in Islamabad may well go a long way towards ensuring that another peace pact is signed between India and Pakistan. This one would probably be called the Singh-Gilani Agreement. The new agreement would, no doubt, be a worthy successor of the previous ones: between Jawaharlal Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan, Lal Bahadur Shastri and Ayub Khan in Tashkent, Indira Gandhi and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in Simla, and even the one between Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf in Lahore. Like all the others, this latest agreement will probably be consigned to the archives of history before long.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Malankar, Mumbai 

                
	Cruel sport          
	Sir  At a time when the world is absorbed in the euphoria of the Fifa World Cup, Ruchir Joshis article, Bursting the balloon (June 27), caught the readers attention. With the style of an accomplished raconteur, Joshi recounted one of the many stories that exist in the shadow of the World Cup fever.          
	The actual battle is being fought among rival teams in faraway South Africa. But miniature versions of it are being played out all over the world, not least on the streets of Calcutta. In a city that is known for its love for football, different teams have been formed in various localities. Hence, Brazil, Germany, England and Argentina are battling one another on the citys streets at present.          
	But there are other bleaker battles being fought as well. Joshi tells the story of a small child selling balloons on Free School Street in order to make a living. With revellers out on the streets after football matches, the child had probably thought it would be a good opportunity to sell more balloons. When the boy offered his wares to a wealthy man coming out of a restaurant, the latter did not think twice before bursting the boys balloons. The man then proceeded to drive off in his SUV.          
	The incident is full of pathos, and is a stinging indictment of the citys rich and their cruelty towards street urchins. The gesture was not just an example of callous fun on the part of the rich man; it was deliberately cruel, and aimed at humiliating someone who is at ones mercy. As pointed out by Joshi, the boy was not even begging, he was merely trying to earn a living. The concern shown by the rich for the poor in our country is little more than cosmetic. The expressions of outrage at these incidents by the saner sections of society have no impact whatsoever.          
	It is the right of every human being to live with a basic sense of dignity even in the face of great material want. Joshi seems to seek solace in the fact that if incidents like this were to take place in Mumbai or Delhi, they would have incited a furious backlash. There is, however, little difference between circumstances in Calcutta and in the two other cities. Resistance to such unpardonable acts of cruelty by the rich and the privileged should ideally be the same everywhere.                    
	Yours faithfully,

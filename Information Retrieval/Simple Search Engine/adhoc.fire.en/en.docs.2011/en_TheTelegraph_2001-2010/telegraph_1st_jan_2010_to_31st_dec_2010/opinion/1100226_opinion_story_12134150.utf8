                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Discordant notes                  
	Sir  I have closely followed the copyright amendment committees recent moves (Quite a song and dance, Feb 21). The committee, comprising musicians, lyricists, producers and actors, was instituted by the ministry of human resource development to deliberate on issues such as original artistic work and copyright.          
	The government should also have included lawyers and experts on intellectual property rights in the committee. The panel may suggest amendments but it is unlikely that any of its members is fully aware of the intricacies of IPR laws and the guidelines laid down by the World Intellectual Property Organization. Without belittling the committee, it is to be noted that copyright amendments cannot be based on amateurish decisions.          
	For example, under the existing law in India, singers do not have copyright, although they play a significant role in popularizing a song. Aamir Khan, however, would bypass lyricists and musicians in favour of the actors, who only provide the visuals to songs, and that too under the choreographers instructions. IPR experts should be able to arbitrate on such matters.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Anwesha Banerjee, Calcutta               
	Sir  Recent reports on the fight between two Bollywood greats, Aamir Khan and Javed Akhtar, have proved to be shocking (Aamir quits panel after Akhtar spat, Feb 18). An actor of Khans calibre should realize that song sequences are an integral part of a Bollywood film. The Indian film industry is not like Hollywood, where music is usually used only as background score.          
	Choreographed song and dance sequences in Bollywood films have been a major attraction for decades. Poor music can cause a film to flop despite excellent acting from the cast. Music directors and lyricists are therefore entitled to a share of the royalties earned.          
	The HRD ministrys move to set up a committee is laudable, since it seeks to address generations of discrimination against certain kinds of artists. It is unfortunate that the egos of superstars should come in the way of resolving such issues.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Anirvan Sengupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The squabble between Javed Akhtar and Aamir Khan over the apportioning of royalties is evidently dictated by partisan interests on both sides.          
	Akhtar, an eminent lyricist, has justifiably demanded due recognition for the creators of songs. Music companies and producers should not monopolize box office collections. Songs are a major attraction for the youth, and can make or break a film.          
	Looking at the issue from Khans point of view, it is true that the picturization of a track, with all its attendant glamour, is a major factor in the appeal of a song. Actors make a large contribution here.          
	Both sides have a point. Akhtar might be thinking of former times, when songs were known by their legendary composers and musical sequences could not be viewed outside movie halls. With the advent of television, such sequences are played over and over again, until viewers associate the actors with the song. Khan seems to have this contemporary situation in mind. Actors as well as lyricists and composers are integral to the popularity of a song today.          
	Yours faithfully,        Ahana Sengupta, Calcutta              
	Right turn          
	Sir  Nitin Gadkari has correctly gauged that young Indias aspirations must find reflection in the Bharatiya Janata Partys programmes and policies (Voice Gadkaris, line Sonias, Feb 18). The party chief has done well in grounding the partys political priorities in people-centric policies. He has, however, stayed within the familiar parameters of rhetoric and gesture.          
	This may not, however, be enough to steer the party out of the dire straits it has been in ever since the debacle of the Lok Sabha polls in 2004. The party accepted the defeat of 2009 with resignation. The silver lining for the BJP is that it still retains power in several states, on its own as well as with allies.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  Nitin Gadkari is to be commended for asking party members to desist from touching the feet of major party leaders (Nitin slips into Rahuls boot, Dec 25, 2009). Political leaders often want people to touch their feet, even if they are younger than those showing them obedience. It is shameful that officers on duty are made to pay their respects to political leaders in this manner in public. The Union government should issue guidelines prohibiting this practice among government employees at the Centre as well as in the states. It would be ideal if all party bosses issued directives banning such obsequious behaviour.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Madhu Agrawal, Delhi

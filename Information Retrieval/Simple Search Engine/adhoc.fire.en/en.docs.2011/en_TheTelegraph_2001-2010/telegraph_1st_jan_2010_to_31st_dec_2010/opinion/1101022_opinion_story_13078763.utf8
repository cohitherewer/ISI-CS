The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Denied a legal cure
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DENIED A LEGAL CURE                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	The vibrant and electric grapevine in Delhi has many true stories to tell. Such stories often escape the lazy eyes and ears of the exhausted media that follow the sensational at the cost of the real. Our tried-and-tested oral tradition disseminates information very effectively. But, sadly, much of it that can damage the reputation of those who dispense both governance and order gets pooh-poohed by the establishment because it does not appear in cold print. Indians know well who is making what and at whose cost. The shenanigans of the tainted are the contemporary tales that are discussed ad nauseam by all and sundry. Nothing is secret within the large sieve that is India.        
	One such story is that the recent demand by the Chief Justice of India for a special purpose vehicle with an allocation of Rs 3,000 crore to repair and refurbish the judicial infrastructure across all the states, to make the process of justice smooth, efficient and timely, has been rejected by the finance ministry. The brazen neglect of the judicial infrastructure has weakened this edifice, which protects our democracy from corruption, illegalities and wrongdoings. When a legitimate and hugely important demand such as this is rejected by citing the paucity of funds as an excuse, Indians get angry and feel betrayed.        
	Monies were allocated under the instruction of mighty leaders to the departments and organizing committees that bungled the Commonwealth Games and shamed us all beyond belief. A last-minute and desperate effort to cover up the many misdemeanours and illegal money-making practices was also organized to maintain a flimsy veneer for the world at large. All the government bodies involved made huge, unnecessary holes in the exchequer. An inquiry has been ordered, but it will not nail any individual, institution or department because they are all either government-operated or quasi-government agencies. It makes one sick to realize that where allocations are necessary to restore civil society and civil dignity, they get rejected.                 
	Costly silence        
	The Games should have epitomized excellence. The processes shamed us. Warring agencies, contractors, individuals, political rivals  everyone came together to destroy and demean what could have been a symbol of the energy of an emergent nation. We were insulted by our own people, and our government bailed out the failed and the inept by releasing more and more money to prevent the wholesale squandering of resources. The Indian people see the truth for what it is and are disgusted by such processes and delivery systems. By allowing the judiciary and its arms to wallow in neglect, the government is seen to be perpetuating and endorsing the deviations from the laws and strengthening the corrupt practices that come with a failing and defective system of governance.        
	Veerappa Moily happens to be the law minister. Prior to his present position, he had led the recommendations for urgent administrative reforms. Why is he silent? If his government is not responding wholeheartedly to the recommendations that can reinvent and cleanse an India that is struggling to avoid being sucked into the prevailing quagmire, why does he not resign and make it a national issue? Why do cabinet ministers not force the issue of radical change in delivery systems? Is our political class fearful of being exposed?        
	The nation needs a real and tangible Diwali present and not a jugaad, with bits and pieces glued together. We need a commitment from the top, with a time frame and no excuses whatsoever. India is tired of excuses, explanations and the ongoing status quo that nurtures only those in power.

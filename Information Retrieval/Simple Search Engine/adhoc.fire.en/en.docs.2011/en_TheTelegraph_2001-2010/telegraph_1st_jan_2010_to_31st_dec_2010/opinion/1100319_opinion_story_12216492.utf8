                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Prime time                   
	Sir  In a nation like India, where cricket is considered to be a religion, the Indian Premier League has not only been a huge commercial success, but has also generated plenty of young talent. Much of its fan-following is drawn from the countrys youth.          
	This year, the IPL matches kicked off from the middle of March, around the same time as the board examinations for standards X and XII. These examinations are crucial to the students future prospects. However, with the IPL matches going on, they find it difficult to concentrate on their studies. It is recommended that from next year the league be held after central and state board examinations are over.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Snehasish Choudhury, Calcutta                     
	Sir  The construction of the temporary gallery at the Eden Gardens for IPL 2010 raked up a controversy when a first information report was filed against the Cricket Association of Bengal for flouting fire-safety rules. The incident has been damaging for the images of cricket in India and of Eden Gardens. The controversy will disappoint the fans of Kolkata Knight Riders and Sourav Ganguly. There must have been some kind of miscommunication among the CAB, the KKR management and the state government. The matter needs to be sorted out through dialogue. The message that an incident like this sends out is that Calcutta cannot be considered a safe enough venue for matches on such a large scale.          
	The KKR management and the CAB have had to face brickbats from the authorities, although they reportedly received permission to set up the temporary structure. It is well known that the IPL is a commercial venture. A few months back, a fortune was spent on hosting an A.R. Rahman concert at the Salt Lake Stadium and on bringing the legendary Diego Maradona to Calcutta. It is only when it comes to cricketing events that the authorities have their hackles raised. As cricket lovers, we want to see good matches, we want to see Dada hitting sixes and Shah Rukh Khan shaking a leg at the stadium. Is that too much to ask?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhabrata Roy, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As a team, the Kolkata Knight Riders lacks consistency. The side also has some major weaknesses (Last four overs did us in: Sourav, March 17). Although it has the best foreign players in the IPL, only four of them will be allowed to play in the final XI. The seven Indian players will, therefore, determine the outcome of most matches in the tournament. Unfortunately, there are no Indian batsmen of repute in KKR, not even Sourav Ganguly. Moreover, cricketers like Cheteshwar Pujara are better suited for the longer version of the game. The team lacks good all-rounders, and has little expertise in seam or swing bowling. In the matches played so far, Ganguly has looked lost while batting; his lack of practice seems to be taking a toll. At 37, one needs to put in a lot of effort if one is to face bowlers like Dale Steyn or Muttiah Muralitharan. Unless players like Pujara, Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha and Iqbal Abdullah rise to the occasion, KKR might end up near the bottom of the table, once again.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In these times ruled by the IPL, Ruchir Joshis article, The master touch (Feb 28), provided a refreshing change. The piece offered an excellent commentary on Sachin Tendulkars stupendous performance during the one-day international between India and South Africa at Gwalior.           
	During the historic match, Tendulkar pulverised the South African bowling attack. Dale Steyn, who, when he had started out, was dubbed as Glenn McGraths rightful successor, was reduced to someone of the stature Matthew Hoggard. Yousuf Pathan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, emboldened by Tendulkars destructive innings, made short work of the opponents bowling.          
	Strangely enough, no other batsman apart from Tendulkar has managed to reach the milestone of a double-century in an ODI, although several players have come close to scoring one in the last few decades. Even a younger, fitter Tendulkar, playing against much less experienced bowling attacks, had failed on this count. Joshis description of Tendulkars reaction after scoring 200 was apt enough  he writes it was that of a man who had finally tidied up a drawer from which a pesky bit of paper has been sticking out for a long time. The cricketing fraternity agrees that the accolades for breaking the record could not have gone to a more deserving batsman.Tendulkar set Gwaliors Roop Singh Stadium on fire as he effortlessly pulled off three sixes and 25 boundaries in just 147 balls. A double-century in an ODI is a mind-boggling achievement. The ace batsman has played for over 20 years for India. His role has changed from time to time in the course of his career. Nevertheless, he has always proved his detractors wrong, scaling new heights just when he is criticized the most. Even at 37, Tendulkar shows no signs of slowing down.                    
	Yours faithfully,

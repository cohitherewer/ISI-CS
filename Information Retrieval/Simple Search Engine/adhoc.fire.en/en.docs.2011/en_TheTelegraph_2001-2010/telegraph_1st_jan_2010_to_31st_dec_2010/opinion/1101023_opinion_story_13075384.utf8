	Difficult day                  
	Sir  October 18, 2010, was a rare day  a day without newspapers. There are three types of people who read newspapers. The first group consists of those who scan the headlines while sipping their morning cuppa. Then there were those  politicians, for example  who pour over every page to find out if their names have appeared. The third group includes people who read the editorial page to see if their letters have been published. October 18 disappointed all three groups. For those addicted to the newspaper, such days are hard to spend.          
	Yours faithfully,         Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad 
        
	Off the track          
	Sir  I had a terrible experience while travelling from Guwahati to New Delhi on the Rajdhani Express. I have been taking this train for the past 16 years, but this time I was shocked to find that the bed sheets and pillow covers had not been washed. After several rounds of cajoling, I managed to convince the attendants to change the dirty linen. I learnt later that several of my co-passengers had faced the same problem. Do we need to remind the railways that such unhygienic practices spread skin diseases and respiratory problems? Is this some kind of cost-cutting measure? If the railways does not have the money to provide clean linen, it should make a public announcement to this effect. This will help passengers make their own arrangements and spare them the horror of having to use linen that has been used by others.          
	As for the blankets, they had not been cleaned for at least a couple of weeks. Instead of providing two sheets, would it not make more sense to provide passengers with a sheet and a detachable cover for the blanket?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I would like to draw the attention of the Union railways minister to a couple of issues. The old and the infirm face a problem while detraining at Katpadi on their way to the Christian Medical College, Vellore. The exit is quite a distance away from where the Howrah-Yeshwantpur Express stops. As a result, elderly patients are forced to cover this long stretch by foot. It will be extremely considerate of the railways if the distance to the exit is minimized. My other plea has to do with identity proof. Such documents often get misplaced. Incidentally, when this happens, an e-ticket becomes worthless. Perhaps the railways should start accepting photocopies of relevant documents.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Himanish Biswas, Durgapur

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Durga Puja has come to an end, and the organizers are busy counting the prizes that they have won or discussing the footfalls registered at the various venues. The real progress that was made this Puja was evident in the swift but safe movement of Calcuttas traffic on the crowded roads.           
	It was truly satisfying to see the Calcutta Police live up to the expectations that it had set for itself. The men in uniform were present in good numbers in every nook and corner of the city, controlling the crowd and the traffic in an efficient manner. They also helped senior citizens and took special care of children.          
	I would like to salute Calcuttas policemen for sacrificing their Puja to ensure a better one for the people of Calcutta. The police should be congratulated for doing a commendable job, and I hope that they continue to render such excellent service throughout the year.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Chowdhury, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Where early the sweet birds sang
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHERE EARLY THE SWEET BIRDS SANG                                                                  
	Singing classes with Mrs M in junior school were a mix of dreariness and release, and on days Miss P dropped in to do a special check on our voices, they would take on an added note of Jesuitical, sadomasochistic thrill, so wonderfully captured by Almodvar in his film, Bad Education. Yet, today, I look back on all of it as entirely good, indeed delicious, education. Bad in the best sense.         
	We would stand in rows in a dark, airless room, singing our scales to Mrs Ms phlegmatic jalopy of a piano. Miss P slowly went down each row, bending forward to bring her ear close to our mouths. She would pause an extra second in front of anyone singing out of tune, who would then feel the smart of a perfectly aimed slap before she moved on. I remember the sting of her perfume as she approached, the tilt of her painted eyebrow and the hard glitter of her earring. I sang well, so there was nothing to fear. As she heard my upper C, the shadow of a smile would flit across her face.        
	One day, Miss P stopped for longer than usual in front of me, her smile hardened into something more purposive, and my fate was sealed. Snow White, the operatic Disney version, was going to be our next school-play and I would have to play the title role. This was followed by months of practice, together with slaps, shakings and lessons in cross-dressing conducted by Mrs M and Miss P and supervised by the priests. The fruit of these efforts were two glorious evenings on stage in Miss Ps wedding dress, wig and innerwear stuffed with socks to make up for the missing curves. My only brush with diva-hood.        
	Two other things were going on while I was learning to be Snow White. First, Miss Ps lessons in reading aloud in class. She taught us a precise skill: how to look ahead in a sentence while reading, so that as we read the words aloud, we also silently prepared ourselves for the ones that followed. We learnt to combine memory and fore-reading to maintain continuity of attention. But paying attention also meant listening to the others. She would stop a reader mid-sentence and ask another boy to carry on from exactly that point. If he missed the cue, a slap or rap on the palm with a ruler.        
	Second, my ensemble classes at the School of Music with Mr D. Apart from my individual lessons, I had to play second, and sometimes first, violin in a chamber orchestra. We played Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Bartk, among others, and this too involved equally terrifying lessons in multiple attentiveness. We learnt simultaneously to read the music in front of us (using the skills taught by Miss P), listen to our own playing, listen to the others in the orchestra and keep an eye on Mr Ds baton and face. This was my first, but not the only, brush with complexity and with what I was later taught to call, as an undergraduate in Professor Cs Saussure classes, the synchronic and the diachronic, meaning structures that grow both in and out of time.        
	Thank you, Mrs M, Miss P, Mr D and Prof C, for teaching us that we never quite sing alone. Snow White must learn to harmonize with the seven dwarfs. Our melodies become more and more complex and difficult and beautiful as we learn to read and look and listen plurally, paying attention as much to others as to ourselves, opening our lives to the mysteries of dissonance, harmony and time.

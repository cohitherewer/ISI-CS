                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WASTED LOVE                                                    
	There will always be a debate about Jyoti Basus greatest gift to West Bengal. Some would argue that he made none. What is beyond dispute is the almost unbelievable, but very apt, present he has made to the people of the state he laid to waste by dying on Sunday morning. Monday was declared a holiday; today large parts of the city, most certainly all government offices, for all practical purposes will not be working; and Wednesday is a holiday because of Saraswati Puja. Basu has thus given to the people of West Bengal four consecutive days on which they do not have to work. What better gift could a chief minister whose politics destroyed the work culture of the state give to its people? The inexplicable part is the decision of the government of West Bengal to declare Monday a holiday. Basu is a former chief minister, why should his death merit a holiday? There is another former chief minister alive; will there be a holiday when the maker also gathers him in? It is telling that the one way the government of West Bengal can think of honouring Basu is by declaring a holiday on the day after his death. This is an indicator of this governments attitude to work. It is a mindset that Basu helped to perpetuate by doing nothing to stem the rot of decline that had been started by his partys agitational politics and proneness to street violence and terror.        
	There are some difficult questions that the people of West Bengal will have to face regarding Basu. One of these is whether Basu deserves to be honoured in any way at the expense of the taxpayer. His party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), is free to honour him in any way it likes from its own coffers. Basus contribution to the development of West Bengal makes a sad catalogue. Under his chief ministership capital fled; at least two generations had their futures jeopardized because they were not allowed to learn English; health services plummeted; and muscle power of the cadre thrived. The CPI(M) and the Left Front flourished, but always at the cost of the state. Unless the extreme hypothesis, that the people of Bengal love the process of decline, is accepted, there is no reason why Basu should be loved and honoured. The people of West Bengal treated Basu as a hero, first when he was an Opposition leader, then as chief minister, and now in the aftermath of his death. They should be aware of what this hero worship says about them.

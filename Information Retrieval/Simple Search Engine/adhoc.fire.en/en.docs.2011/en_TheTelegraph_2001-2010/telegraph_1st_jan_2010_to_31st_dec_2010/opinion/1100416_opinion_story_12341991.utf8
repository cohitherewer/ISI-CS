The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | what ails the system
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHAT AILS THE SYSTEM                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The failure of the Indian State to govern with honesty, integrity and compassion, and to ensure that the laws of the land prevail, has led to a situation that is volatile and explosive. For decades, particularly since the early 1960s, every arm of the administration has steadily corroded its delivery systems, forcing India into abysmal anarchy in every realm of social activity including the denial of minimal rights to food, shelter, health, education and, most important, human dignity. An all-pervasive babudom, led by men and women operating within the parameters of what the colonial rulers had carved out for the administration of India, has suffocated the citizen and society, post Independence, with unacceptable corruption and ineptitude.        
	Nothing works for the ordinary citizen. The babus serve themselves and the select few who are the inmates of either Houses of Parliament and the legislative assemblies. A sprawling administrative service delivers for a small, albeit powerful, coterie of rulers and their Opposition colleagues. These are individuals who have risen out of the mire, leaving their voters to wallow in the cesspool. Our privileged representatives live off the land, on a substantial dole provided by the men and women who work and generate wealth for India despite the treacherous hurdles they have to cross to do so. Even honest entrepreneurs are compelled by the unreasonable demands of this bizarre class of people to become corrupt in order to continue doing business.        
	This state of affairs is truly shameful. We are no longer a developing country that can be pitied for being so crude and incompetent. We are an emerging economic power in spite of the horrors of hugely faulty governance that prompted all in the workplace to deviate from the legal norms prescribed to protect the citizen. This gross malfunctioning has pushed the neglected citizens to take up arms to fight for their fundamental rights. No one listened to them for years. Today, because the State stands threatened, it is listening. However, a military-type assault on these people will trigger an escalation of the problem in other poverty-ridden parts.                
	Sad truth        
	A sad truth, and a scary price to pay for the selfish manipulation of India and its resources by a privileged set which was mandated to deliver dignity to the citizen. There is not an Indian outside of this specially privileged group that has not been a victim of State corruption. This self-serving class, having grabbed homes in districts, towns and cities, ensured regular supply of power and water for themselves that tax-paying citizens down the road do not have access to. They buzz about breaking traffic rules with red lights and sirens announcing their irredeemable status, and have discredited their profession in a profound way.         
	They have been far more exploitative than the erstwhile royals, who, when they opt to stand for election from their thikanas and kingdoms in 2010, defeat their nearest rivals with outstanding majorities. Surely, that reality, in the life of a 63-year-old federal democracy, has a lesson worth hearing.        
	A few simple questions constantly pop up but are never answered by the ruling dispensation. Why are the police reforms not being implemented? P. Chidambaram is an astute lawyer with a fine mind. Surely, he can move this imperative into becoming a tangible reality. Why has the prime minister not ordered the implementation of administrative reforms? Is it because the bureaucrats are scared of being exposed for their malpractice of decades resulting in Maoist upheavals? Do babus rule India or do the elected politicians direct governance? What delays the structural changes that could deliver a sharing of the pie, security and peace?

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SNAKEPIT                          - India seems to be turning into a Sweat Equity Incorporated        Cutting Corners - Ashok Mitra                          The emerging civilization                                              
	Oldtimers will remember an advertisement splashed across the pages of luxury magazines exhorting imbibers of the good life not to be vague; they must insist on a particular brand of Scotch whiskey. But corporate bodies do not opt for such explicitness where their balance sheets are concerned. They turn coy, sometimes almost charmingly so. The Enron Corporation, that celebrated transnational den of accountancy-savvy crooks, had elevated the art of financial dissembling to an ethereal level. It had lobbied for a power plant project at Dabhol in Maharashtra. Greasing the palm of politicians in the state as well as at the Centre was, it concluded, called for to win the contract. What needed to be done was done. The money spent for the purpose had, however, to be listed while preparing the balance sheet. Enron had no problem. An entry under the column of expenditure was described as outlay on educational programmes. Enron could not be accused of being altogether wrong. It had used the amount to educate politicians  and perhaps some civil servants too  on the merit of straying from the straight and narrow path.         
	The incident happened barely 15 years ago. Enron grabbed the contract, the politicians concerned made a few hundred crore of rupees, but the transnational firms gains were many times more. The moment the contract was signed, funds flowed for the project as low interest loans from government sources, apart from credit from international financial institutions that carried guarantee of repayment initialled by the state and Union governments. Within a couple of years though, Enron, weighed down by the burden of its various deeds, collapsed at its home base in the United States of America. The power plant at Dabhol disappeared into thin air; all its liabilities were now the burden of the administrations in New Delhi and Mumbai. Some of the firms top officials had to go to prison for the skulduggery they had indulged in over the years. Politicians over here went scot-free. Everybody around talks freely of the mammoth quantity of wealth and assets they have accumulated through devious means. That does not stop them from being elected to key political positions year after year.              
	Time present is an echo of time past: the Indian Premier League obscenity is a blatant reminder of that essential truth. There is nonetheless such a thing as historical progress. The span of a decade-and-a-half since the Enron scandal has added to the treasury of terms that could aid in concealing the starkness of the reality underlying shady financial transactions. Bribes to swing a deal need no longer be referred to as outlay on educational programmes. The mod term apparently is facilitation fee, or one still better, provision for sweat equity. Both these new modalities suggest a whiff of righteousness wrapped inside. Facilitation is very much in the nature of event management. To assist someone in winning a contract or a franchise in the IPL is, in every sense of the word, akin to managing an event. Facilitation, it could even be claimed, is a form of social service; there should be no feeling of discomfort or guilt in rendering a service which has a market demand and for which one is offered a fee. If the fee runs into several hundred crore of rupees, well, it only reflects market reality with respect to demand and supply; it is conceivably peanuts compared to what the beneficiary is going to reap. For instance, some money which had been laundered out of the country via the hazardous hawala route will now be enabled to come back as respectable investment flow from Mauritius or the Cayman Islands. Besides, there is the occasional nuisance of tax liability. It is therefore bread-and-butter prudence to channel the payment and acceptance of the facilitation fee through a number of proxy entities. The larger the number of such phantom intermediaries, so much the better; there is, after all, safety in numbers.         
	But the vote should really go to that other new concept, sweat equity. A deal is struck, X satisfies Y and Y returns the compliment by satisfying X in accordance with terms mutually agreed upon. The deal is struck in the proverbial back room; the back room is no longer stuffy or suffocating, no longer smoke-filled either ever since the day smoking was officially notified to be dangerous for ones health. Cosy, cool surroundings, X is represented by a proxy; Y too has sent a trusted factotum to negotiate on his or her behalf; X wins a fabulous contract or a luscious franchise because Y pulls the strings, and is in return gifted a substantial equity in the venture that is at the core of the deal. Although politely described as sweat equity, it is in fact non-sweat equity. An almost invisible nod of the head on the part of someone while closeted in a penthouse apartment in a five-star hotel in Singapore or Dubai does not induce the shedding of any sweat. But such is the code of the emerging civilization, if you belong to a certain stratum of society, you get paid for doing nothing or, to be more precise, for doing something which the nave majority in society would be incapable of believing you would do or be ever allowed to do.         
	Does it not appear that the country is gradually being reduced to one huge Sweat Equity Incorporated where the luckier ones, a handful of them, come to grab, at zero cost, very nearly the entire equity of its wealth and assets? This lot takes it for granted that it owns the country and can indulge in debauchery of the vilest description. The masses, who do all the actual sweating, are expected to watch in innocence these goings-on in high places.         
	But, as the IPL affair proves, accidents occur. The debauches have now fallen out among themselves. As a sequel, plenty of dirty linen is being washed in the open. It will be asinine to assume that officialdom  including the political bigwigs  was unaware of the lurid things that were happening behind the smokescreen of the baseball-ized version of cricket nomenclatured Twenty20. For the past decades have spawned a strikingly new development. In the olden days, the media were wont to differentiate the contents of Page One from those of Page Three. Page One would concentrate on grave current issues the nation and the world were embroiled in. Page Three was set aside for lighter purposes, space for perhaps screen and sports events, for pictures of skimpily attired starlets, for society gossipmongers and suchlike. The cultural revolution ushered in by what is termed economic liberalization has obliterated the distinction between Page One and Page Three, or, rather, Page Three has usurped Page One. The impulse for money-making induced by free market economics has been a great leveller. Politicians suddenly find themselves in the same compartment with film and sports persons, industry tycoons, liquor barons, stockbrokers, public relations smarties, and similar other species, each with an eye on the main chance: how to make money and even more money.               
	This has meant a widening of the horizon of opportunities for racketeers of all varieties. A common goal unites politicians, film stars, real estate speculators, contractors, cricket bosses and commission agents. Franchises are up for sale, and not just for the Indian Premier League. The whole system is up for sale, including a vote on a cut motion in Parliament, a seat in a medical college, an allotment for the second generation spectrum; even the judiciary, rumour goes, wants to be a part of the fun and games.         
	The snooty ones may describe this lurid set-up as a snakepit; those single-minded in their devotion to make money will shrug off the invectives. For them, it is a world of choices. They can be educated in a particular manner, they can accept facilitation fees, or they may be gifted with some sweat equity. Statisticians who do the national income accounts are a conscientious, competent lot, the amount involved in these give-and-take transactions are placed in the slot of income from services. Growth of the gross domestic product thereby gets further accelerated.   
	A statistical correlation seemingly exists between such GDP growth and the growth of insurgency in different parts of the country. Revellers lolling inside the snakepit are inured to the implications of this datum.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE REAL AND THE ORNAMENTAL                                  VISUAL ARTS: Soumitra Das                                                  
	The work of the artist couple from Bangladesh, Mahbubur Rahman and Tayeba Begum Lipi, who held an exhibition titled Parables of Our Times (September 13-27) at Akar Prakar stemmed from an awareness of the political realities in what was once known as the Indian subcontinent, and, quite predictably in the case of the latter, of gender politics as well. Many women artists find the feminist label irresistible. Both artists have another thing in common  they are well trained in figurative drawing, and this was quite obvious from this exhibition where the human body occupied a good part of the canvas. But whereas for Tayeba it is only a means of exploring the issues that provoke her, Mahbubur does so in a manner that at times may strike one as being dull and hackneyed.        
	This is particularly true of the three works on give peace a chance, featuring the portraits of the three fathers of the three nations that once belonged to the Indian subcontinent before they split up. Mahbubur appropriates icons and imagery from Hindu and Buddhist religious paintings and the famous, much-abused portrait of Che Guevara. Unfortunately, there is a stamp of crudity in whatever he touches. The problem is that he does not know where to stop, and his paintings end up looking like gewgaws. One of Mahbuburs concerns seems to be terrorism, but he goes little beyond depicting sinister heads and the bodies of torture victims. His works are crammed with so many decorative elements and with a hotchpotch of others that they look quite muddle-headed at times. He certainly bites more than he can chew.        
	Tayebas works are more in-your-face, and there is a certain freshness in the way she thinks. Without beating about the bush, she depicts the specific body parts that are stock-in-trade of pornographers. But the similarity ends here as these pieces of flesh are built up with safety pins, while a womans face is composed of innumerable safety razors. Swimming around these depictions of the female anatomy are thousands of spermatozoa like schools of tadpole. They may not be layered images but the sight of a womans epidermis, every inch of which is pierced with pins, is not a pleasurable one. In fact, one does not need to be particularly sensitive to feel queasy .        
	Some of Tayebas portraits are realistic enough to be mistaken for photographs. She takes this one step further by making them resemble digital photographs in which the subjects movement is documented. Occasionally, she too betrays a certain predilection for the ornamental which could well have been avoided. This, however, does not take away from the power of certain images like that of the pins-and-blades lady.

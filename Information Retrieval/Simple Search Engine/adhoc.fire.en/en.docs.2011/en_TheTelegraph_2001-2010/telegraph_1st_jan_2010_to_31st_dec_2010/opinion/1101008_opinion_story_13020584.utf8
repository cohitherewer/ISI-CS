The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Animal spirit raring to go
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ANIMAL SPIRIT RARING TO GO                          - India has always been ambivalent towards money-making        CUTTING CORNERS -   ASHOK MITRA                          Bottled up                                              
	The expression, animal spirit, packs layers of meaning. For one, it is nearly synonymous with the fierce combativeness that marks the animal world; survival depends on outsmarting other carnivorous animals in grabbing quarry. It is merciless competition, with no quarter given to rival predators.        
	There is nothing particularly unusual if, charged with such animal spirit, the Indian psyche is all keyed up to perform better than neighbouring countries in different spheres of activity. In the years immediately following Independence, Pakistan was the preferred opponent to score over. The country born out of Indias own limbs however soon proved small fry. Except where the issue of Kashmir crops up, Pakistan has dropped out of Indias list of qualifying rivals. Encouraged partly by cheerleaders from the sidelines, such as the Americans, this country has now chosen China as its preferred adversary. In a feverishly competitive climate, frenzy often displaces reason. To equal or outpace China in every respect becomes the single-minded objective. It gets reflected even in matters that are puerile. The Indian media, for instance, are full of glee that in the seating arrangements on the day the president of the United States of America was addressing the current session of the United Nations general assembly, Indias external affairs minister was placed on the front row; Chinas representative was assigned a seat somewhere in the rear. This piffling thing has been trumpeted about as a great diplomatic victory!        
	Once the animal spirit captures the imagination, occupying the front row becomes the only criterion by which to judge someones credentials. There was much heart-burn that while China is already the worlds second-largest economy, India is yet far from being even a distant third. Achieving success in some alternative direction was set as a goal to assuage that hurt. An opportunity was soon opened up. China organized, with utmost competence, the Olympic Games a couple of years ago. Why could not India provide evidence that it was not any less competent? The authorities jumped at the offer to organize this years Commonwealth Games, never mind if these Games are a poor relation of the Olympics. The challenge involved organizing gigantic construction works which called for intricate planning, very close coordination among different executing agencies and meticulous attention to detail. The buzzwords were India could do it; the underlying unstated theme was India could do it better than China.        
	Aspiring to surpass China  or, for the matter, the US  in organizing an event, even a mega event, need not be taken to be akin to asking for the moon. Problems however arose because of a factor which too is sourced in the unleashing of the animal spirit. A corollary of the philosophy extolling free play of the animal spirit is that, at both the individual and corporate levels, the effort must be to maximize the rate of profit. Organizing the Commonwealth Games, a challenge to the authorities, was also at the same time occasion for parties called in to participate in the construction activities to make as much money as they could. The vast network presided over by the organizing committee involved doling out contracts and subcontracts. The Games budget was reported to be around Rs 70,000 crore, not an altogether paltry sum. Contractors naturally made a beeline, competition between them was intense. The process of winning the contracts was almost like jungle warfare. Some palms, it is entirely conceivable, were therefore needed to be greased. The successful bidders had to shell out funds for the purpose as well as to make outlays for engaging labour and procurement of material. Since the contracts were for a lump sum, to maximize profit, contractors tended to economize on the wage bill by employing either sweat labour or workers not quite equipped to do the assigned tasks. They tried to pare costs in other ways too, for instance, by lowering the quality of material used. The animal spirit is supposed to breed efficiency. It can evidently also lead to corruption and inefficient performance. For an initial act of corruption sets in motion a chain of consequences that are equally tinted: subcontractors who are chosen have to grease, in their turn, the palms of contractors. Since the subcontracts, too, are of the turn-key type with fixed payments, the effort to maximize returns at the level of subcontractors contributes additionally to sloppiness and deterioration in the quality of work. Small wonder that completion of the total work gets delayed, some ceilings and footbridges collapse, or washroom facilities fail to reach international standards.        
	It is a weird world though  a lobby actually exists overtly supportive of the cause of palm greasing. A theory started circulating some decades ago in certain sections of the academia in praise of the role of corruption towards accelerating economic growth in the poorer economies. One or two doctoral dissertations advocating the theme were in fact successfully defended in American universities. The argument proffered was simplicity itself. In developing countries, the government generally plays a key role in the initial stages of the growth process. Any governmental system is featured by a hierarchy of bureaucratic functioning which is time-consuming and therefore cuts athwart the objective of speedy development. Entrepreneurs and contractors responsible on the field for executing projects are the real promoters of growth. They, however, feel helpless, dependent as they are upon the sweet will of bureaucrats and politicians for key approvals. In this situation, they could, the theory suggests, do worse than pay speed-money to officials, big and small. Such payments will help release files and hasten decisions. Corruption in the form of offer and acceptance of bribe is therefore a necessary input which accelerates the development process.         
	It was patronizing theorization with strong colonial overtones, given the underlying assumption of bureaucrats and politicians in underdeveloped countries being not only addle-headed but corruptible too. Proponents of the theory again set at work. This time they thought they had come up trumps. Corruption indeed has magic power that helps promote economic growth; why, even American economic history is replete with instances of how development of the US in the 19th and early 20th centuries was greatly facilitated by daredevil initiatives on the part of specimens such as the Rockefellers and the Harrisons, who bribed their way through the bureaucratic maze to win crucial oil and railroad construction concessions that transformed the economy.               
	Since corruption made its contributions towards American economic growth and at least one former prime minister went on record that, after all, the vice was an international phenomenon and there was nothing particularly unusual about it, those advocating the cutting of corners in public life in due course did gain some ground on our shores too. This nation has actually always had an ambivalent attitude towards money-making. The emphasis on austere living that permeated the nationalist movement on the insistence of Mahatma Gandhi was a temporary aberration. The dictum preaching the dominance of mind over matter has been usually for the birds. Activists fighting the cause of money-making, whatever the means, even dared to draw lessons from Gandhis enduring relationship with one or two big industrial houses. Such relationships, it was said, proved that the Mahatma too had recognized the social necessity of profit-gathering.         
	Any way, the regulatory system introduced in the country in the post-Independence period provided ample opportunity to adventurous entrepreneurs to corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. The native impulse to cut a few corners in the quest for money meshed with the economic doctrine which described corruption as an effective engine to speed up development. Now the other side of the coin: the mess visiting the arrangements for the Commonwealth Games is a prize example of the kind of mishap that the zeal for money-making might lead to.        
	The animal spirit goads one to be efficient in order to beat competition. It however also opens the door for corruption which in turn breeds inefficiency. Why not bottle up the animal spirit for a while?

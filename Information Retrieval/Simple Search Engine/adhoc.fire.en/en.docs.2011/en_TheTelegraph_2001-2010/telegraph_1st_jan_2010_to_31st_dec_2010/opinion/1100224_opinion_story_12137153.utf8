                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN THE EYE OF THE EVIL                                  ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA                              
	With the court martial ordered against the four army generals involved in the Sukna land scam, speculations about whether the rule of law applies to the armed forces should be put to rest, albeit temporarily. But a niggling irritation continues. It takes two to fight a war; it also takes two to hatch a conspiracy or to commit a crime.        
	Assuming that the generals were involved in a scam, what about their civil partners? Who will probe into their role in the game? Will the income tax, customs, central excise, service tax, state sales tax and other concerned departments investigate the circumstances leading to the tripping of senior generals in a sensitive area bordering foreign countries?        
	Apparently, the Siliguri realtor, who hatched the plan to set up a school, had to send his daughters to boarding schools. So he wanted to build a good school near Sukna. But now he has decided to look for land elsewhere. He does not realize that admission to schools is a problem across India, not faced by his daughters alone. The incident shows that the education system in India is more influenced by money power than by quality teaching.        
	A section of Indias trading class prefers to use money to get any job done. One suspects that in future, only a few officials are likely to control themselves when faced with an offer of money. The rot in the civil bureaucracy is rising alarmingly. The Sukna incident shows that the upper echelons of the military bureaucracy too are being slowly poisoned by the lure of money.        
	Billions in India will always be desperate for education and quality healthcare. With an insatiable demand curve and restricted supply line comes the usual paucity of funds and a lamentable lack of governance in the delivery end. Thus corrupt entrepreneurs come into play with devastating effect  and Sukna is a case in point.                
	Chain reaction        
	How far this minuscule yet deadly class of entrepreneurs can go will be clear if one looks at one of the numerous government schemes to promote trade and tourism. The export promotion capital goods is one such scheme, which was systematically violated by corrupt stakeholders. Under the EPCG scheme, the state allows import of capital goods at concessional/ nil rate of customs duty subject to an export obligation. Under it, import of motor cars, sports utility/ all-purpose vehicles are allowed only to hotels, travel agents and tour transport operators. The idea is simple. The government gives duty exemption to the importer of the vehicle, so that he can use the vehicle for the purposes specified above and fetch foreign currency for the state exchequer. Unfortunately, this purpose was repeatedly defeated, as instead of earning foreign exchange for the state coffer, hundreds of traders brazenly flouted the law of the land by defaulting on customs duty to the tune of hundreds of millions of rupees on imported vehicles after acquiring them for private use. These unscrupulous traders show no regret or remorse even after being caught in high-profile cases by the customs department.        
	Recently, there was news of several high-ranking IAS officers being caught in scams worth crores by the income tax department in Madhya Pradesh. Look at the paradox. Senior army generals are court-martialled before they succeed in making money, but when it comes to senior IAS officers none within the state government takes any action. It is left to a Central agency to catch the officers.        
	With corrupt traders and babus making money in whatever manner they can, it would be ridiculous to expect senior generals to lead a Spartan life. Do punish the generals, but first punish the traders who are giving money, and then the babus who are taking it, and breaking India.

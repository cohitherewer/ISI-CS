	With more and more aspiring authors being rejected, what must one do to get noticed? One of the reasons for rejection is that writers fail to see the considerable change in reading habits over the last decade and that mergers and acquisitions have compelled bigger companies to demand more from authors. Also, the progress of communication technology and the entertainment industry has brought more competition to the publishing industry. Notwithstanding what the cultural pundits say, the typical book-buyer today no longer looks for great insights into the human condition; it is entertainment that pushes up sales.        
	So what should be the starting point for an author in the making? There are four key points: Study the market; read what has made other authors successful; what do they offer that you may be missing out? Will buyers pay about Rs 150 to read what you have to say? In other words, if the book has marketing potential, which is the crucial word. Literary excellence may still matter to some publishers, but the first line that a publisher looks at is the bottom line.        
	So how do you go about it? First, find the publisher who focuses on your areas of interest. Not every publisher handles every subject now. Aspiring authors would be wasting time and money submitting proposals that dont suit a publishers list. Second, resist the urge to go only for leading publishers. They dont give much attention to unsolicited material. And, in India at least, celebrity status takes an author a long way: writers with easily recognizable profiles are preferred because publishers dont have to invest in order to tell readers who the authors are.        
	So, smaller publishers are more receptive to newcomers. These publishers are keen on good and well-produced books. Marketing these books aggressively is an essential part of their game-plan. Mainstream publishers can wait for later, when the authors market appeal has been established.        
	Also, authors, when they are corresponding with publishers, must remember that the latter do not want to read anything more than is strictly necessary. All that is required at the approach stage is a synopsis, a sample chapter and a letter of introduction. The synopsis is the most important of these. It should contain the unique selling point: who is likely to buy the book, and why? Each book has a central appeal on which the sales potential would be judged. The intended size of the book should be specified, and also whether the author would provide an electronic copy of the finished book if it is accepted for publication. This has an important bearing on the production costs and thus on the sales forecast.        
	The approach has to be business-like: brief and to-the-point. The rest depends on luck and matters less.       RAVI VYAS

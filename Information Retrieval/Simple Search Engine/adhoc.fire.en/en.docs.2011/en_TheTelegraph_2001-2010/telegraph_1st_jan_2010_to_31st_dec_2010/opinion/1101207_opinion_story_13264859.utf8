The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Pleasure, not pain
                      5                                                                                        PLEASURE, NOT PAIN                                  - FORBIDDEN TERRITORY      India needs to accept that pleasure without guilt makes sex safer                                                  
	Condom advertisements in India are curious. The print ads either feature righteous-looking couples with guilty expressions, or models with overtly erotic and contrived gestures. Television ads are equally mystifying. Characters in them either seem to be doing something illicit, or pretending that condoms are a desperate precaution against HIV or too many children  but have nothing to do with sex. Ad-film makers here are hardly imaginative with condom ads. They stick to popular psychological constructs and design advertisements around the embarrassment of having sex. Rarely does one come across a condom ad that shows sex as a perfectly acceptable and enjoyable phenomenon.        
	Companies selling condoms face a strange dilemma. They seem confused about what they are trying to sell  pleasure or protection. Condoms can provide both, but while selling them one has to be careful about which of the two advantages should be highlighted in promotional campaigns. Indian governments have a tendency to ban condom ads if the latter looks or sounds as though they are actually trying to encourage people to enjoy sex. Sometime back, an advertisement of flavoured condoms was banned by the Advertising Standards Council of India following an objection from the censor board, which claimed that the ad was indirectly trying to promote fruit-flavoured oral sex. The ASCI called it vulgar and removed it.        
	If one were to take a holistic view of the matter, blaming the government alone would be unfair. In India, people and their representatives seem to be equally against condoms that promise to make sex a little more exciting. In this land of the Kama Sutra, once a government-owned company called Hindustan Latex tried to sell vibrating condoms. Some politicians instantly demanded that this sex toy be banned as it went against the countrys culture (probably of never, ever enjoying sex); a minister from Madhya Pradesh wrote a letter to the prime minister, bitterly accusing the government of promoting sex for pleasure. According to this minister, condoms should only be used as a birth-control method and as protection against sexual infection. Having an add-on in them meant they were allowing people to have a good time, which was plain unacceptable.        
	Are we, then, saying that safe sex is synonymous with sex without pleasure? That, theoretically, means that any pleasurable experience in sex deserves to be punished by the denial of protection.        
	HIV is a real threat. Overpopulation is an issue as well. Distributing free condoms is seen as a politically correct and socially relevant activity. We have the formidable Buladi, imploring us to use condoms in all circumstances  virtuous or immoral, legal or illegal. We have the government coming up with the smart, taboo-breaking TV advertisement where people are rewarded with applause if they are courageous enough to pronounce the word condom publicly and without reservation. But all this necessarily avoids certain pertinent questions related to sexual pleasure in the use of condoms. That is still forbidden territory, for us and for our nation.        
	It might not be wrong to suggest that the duality in our attitude towards condoms, and towards sex, is at the root of our vulnerability to sexual infection and overpopulation. Most in India still believe that sex is enjoyable only when it is promiscuous, and hence sinful, and that it is acceptable as a legitimate activity only when it occurs in a socially endorsed relationship and is meant for procreation. We will fail to promote safe sex successfully as long as we deny that protection and pleasure are not mutually exclusive, or that pleasure without guilt makes sex safer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Too little, too late
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE                                  The HIV/AIDS Bill that is to be tabled in Parliament soon fails to deliver on several key counts, says Saheli Mitra                          UNFAIR DEAL: A protest against the new HIV/AIDS Bill in New Delhi                                   
	Nalini and Shuvam (names changed on request) were denied medical treatment in government hospitals in Calcutta on the pretext that none had the facility to accommodate HIV-positive patients. The duo had no place to go to for redressal either as there is no law as yet to ensure emergency medical treatment to HIV/AIDS patients.        
	With a population of more than 2.3 million HIV-positive people (according to statistics provided by the National AIDS Control Organisation), India is in urgent need of formulating a law to end discrimination against and guarantee proper medical care to HIV-positive persons. The HIV/AIDS Bill, which is to be tabled in the next session of Parliament, is aimed at addressing the critical problems faced by people living with HIV and AIDS (PLHA). However, legal experts and AIDS activists point out that the Bill fails to deliver on several important counts.        
	Thirty-nine key provisions proposed in the original draft Bill have been dropped or changed by the Union law ministry, reveals Raman Chawla of Lawyers Collective, the organisation that formulated the original draft of the Bill along with the Union health ministry.        
	Daisy David of World Vision, a non governmental organisation (NGO) that works closely with PLHA, points out that clauses to ensure emergency free medical treatment to HIV/AIDS patients have been dropped in the new Bill. These clauses were vital, she feels, given that PLHA are frequently denied treatment because of social prejudice. There are cases where mothers are forced to deliver all by themselves, cases where surgery is denied, or those who need dialysis are turned down, all because they are HIV-positive.        
	To put an end to such medical discrimination, the original version of the draft Bill had a provision for setting up a health ombudsman, who would ensure that healthcare is not denied to HIV-positive people. He was also empowered to order free medical treatment for patients within 24 hours in case of an emergency. The ombudsman could be someone from an NGO with experience in this field and his office was to have been overseen by a senior government official not lower than the rank of a gazetted officer. These provisions are needed to ensure that people like Nalini and Shubham are not left at the mercy of unfeeling hospitals, says city-based pathologist Dr Papia Mazumdar.        
	But surprisingly, the law ministry has scrapped the provision for the emergency power of the ombudsman.        
	The Bill has also done away with provisions for awarding penalties to health workers who violate the ombudsmans orders. Shivaji Mitra, criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court, feels that such penalties are needed to make sure that health officials give proper attention to HIV-positive people. Every criminal act is punishable under Indian law. Ostracising an HIV-positive individual is also a crime and should be punished accordingly, says Mitra.        
	Whats more, the draft Bill does not make any effort to safeguard the property rights of the children of those who die of AIDS. Children of PLHA are often denied the right to family property. Sometimes they are even denied admission to schools. So a legal clause safeguarding their interests is absolutely essential, feels city-based AIDS activist Kallol Ghosh, who runs a home for AIDS-affected children.              
	Ghosh also points out that foster homes and NGOs taking care of AIDS orphans are often not given the power of a de facto guardian and hence cannot do much to help them. If a guardianship clause is added under the care of a third party, then the chances of the child being deprived of his inheritance can be minimised, agrees Mitra.        
	Though activists feel that the HIV/AIDS Bill does not do enough, there are those who say that it does have some positive features. For instance, the Bill makes a serious effort to do away with discrimination against AIDS victims in the workplace. Since 90 per cent of infections that are reported are in the most productive age group, it is important that we protect this sizeable Indian working population from facing loss of employment and ostracism, says David.        
	The Bill specifies that those with HIV/AIDS should be able to work in an organisation as long as they are medically fit to work. It makes employers  both in the public and private sectors  liable for any discrimination meted out to them. Another good feature is the proposed inclusion of HIV/AIDS victims in insurance schemes.        
	A key problem of the Bill, experts say, is the way it has tweaked the confidentiality clause of the earlier drafts. Across the globe, maintaining the confidentiality of a persons HIV status is considered to be of supreme importance. Leaving the option of disclosure to the patients helps to build up confidence in the medical system and encourages people to come forward and undergo tests, says David.        
	The original draft Bill had stated that no person shall be compelled to disclose the HIV-related information of another, without the informed consent of that person. But the new Bill says that no person shall disclose or be compelled to disclose HIV-related information without the informed consent of the person making such disclosure. This makes no sense as it requires the informed consent of the person making the disclosure, and not of the person the information relates to, says David.        
	Another problem is the disclosure of a persons HIV status to his or her partner. While the earlier version of the Bill did not make it mandatory, the new Bill says healthcare providers shall make such disclosure to the partner. While it can certainly be argued that the partner has every right to know, since he or she is most at risk of infection, some activists feel that mandatory disclosure to the partner could have disastrous consequences. People may not come forward to test themselves as they will be afraid that the confidentiality of the test results will not be maintained. And the argument goes that this could drive the AIDS epidemic underground, making it even more difficult to control.        
	So why has the law ministry done away with so many key clauses in the new Bill, especially those related to ensuring free emergency medical services to AIDS patients? One theory  and nobody wishes to be quoted on this  is that the government is dragging its feet over this simply because free emergency medical treatment implies a huge cost burden for it.        
	That may or may not be true. But the law ministry certainly needs to come up with an HIV/AIDS Bill that effectively addresses the myriad medical and social problems that people who live with the disease face daily.

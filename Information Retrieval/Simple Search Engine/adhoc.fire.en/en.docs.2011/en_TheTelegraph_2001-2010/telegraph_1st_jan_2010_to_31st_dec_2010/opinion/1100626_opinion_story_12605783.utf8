	Football reflects history, albeit with a time lag. The decline of Europe has been a favourite theme of historians at least since the end of World War II. There have been historians though who have argued that Europe went into decline with the onset of the First World War in 1914 and the beginning of the Bolshevik Revolution three years later. Historians may continue to debate about the date when Europes grandeur and dominance ended, but lovers of football will have no hesitation in agreeing that European football lost its scoring abilities in the World Cup of 2010. The record of the major European teams is difficult to believe. France and Italy are out, and out rather ignominiously. England is struggling and so are Germany and Spain. This must be seen in the context of the fact that Western Europe has produced the winners of six of the past 10 World Cups. In this World Cup, two of the major countries of Western Europe are out before the knockout rounds, and either England or Germany will be out by Sunday night. If that is not a dismal performance, it is tough to think of a worse one.        
	It is not just the results of the matches that are astounding  England held to a draw by the United States of America and Algeria; Spain going down one-nil to Switzerland; Germany losing to Serbia; France crushed 2-0 by Mexico; and Italy held to a one goal tie by New Zealand  it is the way these big teams have played that appears almost incredible. Their ball play, shooting and teamwork have all seemed lacklustre and jaded. One common explanation for this is the shadow of expectation: pressure is apparently inhibiting the players. This is hardly convincing. Brazil and Argentina, to take two immediate examples, are also under the pressure of too much expectation but these teams have not wilted. One reason could be the apparent collapse of the famous discipline and organization that lay behind the triumph of Western European soccer. In South Africa, the French players were in open rebellion against the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka. Englands captain, John Terry, publicly criticized the coach and had to step down; his replacement suffered a knee injury before the World Cup. Similarly, Germanys captain, Michael Ballack, was rendered hors de combat before the World Cup. There are other examples of organizational lapses and bad luck coming together.        
	The sun has set on English football, as it did on the British Empire, perhaps because there are too many ordinary players who, when they play with their foreign colleagues in their clubs, look above average. It is significant that in the continent while the teams of Western Europe are faltering, the new nations  products of the break-up of the Soviet Empire and freed from totalitarianism  are definitely playing more dynamic and challenging football. It is possible that the 2010 World Cup is witnessing the emergence of a new Europe. History might then echo soccer with a time lag.

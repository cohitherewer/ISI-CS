                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET                                  SLOW AND UNSTEADY      For the people of the developing world, the recovery from recession has meant very little                                                  
	An economic recovery has taken place in terms of growth from the worst recession since the Great Depression. Developing nations, such as the ones in Asia, were the first to emerge from the crisis. Recently, the United States of America and the United Kingdom declared that they have come out of recession. For 2010, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has forecast a global recovery, but it is going to be a tale of two worlds.         
	While the G-8 nations are likely to register an average growth of 1.7 per cent and Europe 0.9 per cent, four Asian countries  China, India, South Korea and Indonesia  along with Australia and New Zealand are set to enjoy an average growth of 6.7 per cent.        
	But there are two serious problems: first, the recovery in the US which is expected to keep the wheels of global industry moving and, second, the widespread unemployment and under-employment across the continents. The growth in the US economy in the last quarter was caused by an inventory bounce. When an economy slumps, industries find themselves with large stocks of unsold goods. To get rid of the excess inventories, they slash production. Once the excess is disposed of, they raise production, which shows up as a burst in growth in the gross domestic product. Growth caused by an inventory bounce cannot be sustained unless consumer spending or long-term investment picks up.        
	House prices have increased marginally and the banks are saddled with these low-value assets. American consumers, who are now $11 trillion poorer, are unlikely to return to their buy-now-save-never habit. Thus, the main engine of growth  consumer spending  has lost steam. Consequently, industry is afflicted with excess capacity and commercial rents are plunging due to the huge oversupply of office space.        
	High-to-moderately-high levels of unemployment are prevailing across the globe. According to the OECDs forecast, Europe is going to have high unemployment levels in 2010, except for Norway and the Netherlands. The average unemployment level forecast for the 15 countries of the European Union is 9.6 per cent.         
	According to the International Labour Organisation, total employment fell in 2009 vis--vis 2008 in both developed and developing countries, but more sharply in the former. Some recovery took place in both the groups, but it is likely to have been concentrated in the sphere of self-employment which indicates the lack of social security and unemployment protection. The ILO data also show that in developing countries, both total and paid employment in manufacturing had fallen sharply in 2009 as compared to 2008.        
	Even the countries showing high growth rates like China or India are saddled with surging unemployment and massive under-employment. Labour markets across the world are being increasingly characterized by casual, non-formal contracts and the growth of various forms of self-employment.         
	For most people in the world, this implies higher risks of unemployment and reduced incomes. This will affect potential growth through reduced demand because people will tend to spend less fearing bad days ahead. Thus for the masses, specially in the developing countries, the present recovery has meant little, at least for now.                    DIPANKAR BOSE

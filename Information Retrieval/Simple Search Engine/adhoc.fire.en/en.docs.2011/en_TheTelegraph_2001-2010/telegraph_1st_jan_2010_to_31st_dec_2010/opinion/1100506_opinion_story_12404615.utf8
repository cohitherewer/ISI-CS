	Unfair share                  
	Sir  There has been a lot of hue and cry over the West Bengal governments decision to legalize hawkers on Calcuttas pavements by issuing identity cards to them (Wayward, April 23). It is important to note that unlike in other major cities of India, hawkers in Calcutta erect illegal structures on pavements. These structures eat into a good part of the walking space on pavements, leaving very little room for pedestrians; sometimes they take up the entire pavement. Many of these structures remain on the pavements during the night. Even parts of certain main roads of the city and intersections of some important roads have been taken over by hawkers. This phenomenon is gradually spreading to all parts of Calcutta. It is to be kept in mind that Calcutta has only six per cent road space vis--vis population density, compared to 23 per cent in Delhi and 17 per cent in Mumbai. So it is more important to keep the roads and pavements of Calcutta clear to facilitate the movement of pedestrians and vehicles.          
	Legalizing hawkers will lead to further encroachment, and more illegal structures will come up on pavements and roads, causing immense inconvenience to citizens and visitors. There have already been a number of fatal accidents owing to pedestrians not being able to use the footpath. Traffic is also often held up unnecessarily for this reason. With the legalization of hawkers, the situation will be further aggravated. The state government should give a second thought to its decision.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The hawkers on Calcuttas pavements have now become the pride and one of the main attractions of the city. They occupy entire pavements and even major crossings, and consider themselves the de facto owners of these spaces. After the West Bengal governments decision to legalize their trade, hawkers will now become the de jure owners of the spaces they use illegally. With the civic elections drawing near, it is not difficult to guess the reason behind the state governments haste to legalize hawkers. However, I feel that the Left Front government has displayed its lack of political wisdom by doing this. It is wrong if it presumes that it can take the citizens of Calcutta for a ride simply by issuing identity cards to hawkers. Even if this step helps the government acquire the votes of the over three lakh hawkers of Calcutta, the gain will be marginal. Moreover, a fairly big section of the hawkers still owes allegiance to the Trinamul Congress, which has stood by them on many occasions.          
	Political support and socio-economic needs boosted the proliferation of hawkers in Calcutta. The onus to solve this problem rests with the state government, but, unfortunately, it has come up with a shoddy solution. The Left Fronts earlier attempts to evict hawkers with Operation Sunshine in 1996 had failed miserably. Kanti Ganguly, who had once spearheaded Operation Sunshine along with Subhas Chakraborty, has recently admitted that there is a lack of consensus within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) on the issue of hawkers. This only adds to the long list of failures of the Left Front government in the three decades of its rule.           
	The Left Front has cited the Centres national policy on urban street vendors in support of its decision in order to cover up its desperation. Its current policy amounts to making hawkers the rightful owners of the places they occupy. This preposterous strategy does not have any semblance to the Centres provisions. The governments decision seems to have been prompted by the fact that it has become almost impossible for it to evict hawkers from the pavements now, and also by the apprehension regarding the upcoming civic polls. There must be a strong outcry against the governments policy along with a number of public interest litigations against it. The Calcutta High Court must deal sternly with the hawkers flouting the law whose numbers are bound to increase with the legalization drive.          
	One wonders whether the government will now issue a directive to pedestrians to walk on the pavements at their own risk. Perhaps it wants the pedestrians to walk on the roads instead. Given the efficient traffic-control system in the city, this should not pose much of a problem. Accidents, when they occur, can always be explained away with the logic that they happen in all big cities. Maybe the government will now prioritize the construction of pavements over the construction of flyovers to accommodate more hawkers. Even if no industrial growth takes place in the state, the government will be happy in the thought that it has provided hawkers with an incentive to flourish. But it should also reflect on whether this initiative can prevent its electoral decline.          
	Yours faithfully,

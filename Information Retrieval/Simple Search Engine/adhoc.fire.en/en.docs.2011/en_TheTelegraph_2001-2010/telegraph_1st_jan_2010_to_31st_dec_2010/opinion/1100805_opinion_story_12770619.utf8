	West Bengal has made quite a habit of generating bad news. It has managed to come third in the race for the state most unsafe for women. That is quite a fall  or should it be called a climb?  from its rank of 22 in 2000. Since decline and failure have begun to mark West Bengal in almost every sphere, practice has made the chief minister cue-perfect. Unacquainted with shame or sensitivity, he has quickly pointed out that there has been a marginal rise in crimes against women all over the country, so there is nothing to worry about. This cosy little evasion ignores the fact that Bengal has risen to third place, just after Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh in such crimes. Last years figures showed that the state led the country in the number of recorded rapes, and was second only to Andhra Pradesh in the number of tortured women, presumably including both victims of routine domestic violence and women victimized for dowry. It is only recently, after years of repeated warnings from various non-governmental agencies, that West Bengal is trying to look proactive in its measures against trafficking. But that crime has grown to such enormous proportions that checking it would not be easy for any state.        
	West Bengals decline demonstrates the consequences of lax, or even deliberately perverse, administration and the flourishing of a culture of political patronage. But it is necessary to examine the causes of the countrywide rise in crimes against women too, with a distinct space given to organized crime, such as trafficking. Maybe both women and crimes are more visible. Not only are the traditional barriers between the home and its surroundings breaking down in the face of economic and educational compulsions  thus widening the space for criminal acts  but women are also more vocal about crime, more willing to risk the public gaze, while the media are more responsive. But the actual increase in crime cannot be wished away. Does this inevitably accompany a countrys growth, as it creates larger gaps, however temporary, between different social units, and a culture of increasing impatience and greed? Whatever the reasons, something is seriously wrong if a country going from strength to strength keeps weakening its women. The West Bengal chief minister may choose to snuggle deeper into comfortable indifference; other states, it is hoped, will have more sense. They usually do.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A day in wonderland
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A DAY IN WONDERLAND                                  A year after Aila, the State wants the Sunderbans to become the new seventh wonder. Is that what the islanders want as well? asks Uddalak Mukherjee                                            
	To understand how the State has, over the years, failed the Sunderbans people and environment, it is necessary to visit the islands as many times as possible. I had gone to Satjelia and Lahiripur last August  three months after Aila  and witnessed the marks of devastation. Last week, almost a year after the storm, I returned on another visit. This time, I had not one, but two objectives. First, I wanted to see for myself the tardy pace of government rehabilitation. And I also wanted to talk to the people to find out what they knew about the States plan to organize a joint vote with Bangladesh to get the Sunderbans declared the seventh wonder of the world.        
	This time, I had decided to travel mostly by land. Last year, the vast rivers and the thick vegetation on the shore had made it difficult for me to ascertain the damage in the villages that stood guarded by puny bunds. I reached Gosaba after crossing, once again, the sullen Vidya. On the two-hour-long journey to Lahiripur on a cycle-van, I passed through Jatirampur and Sukumari, crossed the quiet Magar, and then took the land route again that connected Satjelia with Luxbagan in Lahiripur. Around me, seemingly stretched till the point where the river touched the skies, were swathes of barren, saline land. I saw clusters of empty, broken hamlets whose occupants had migrated in search of livelihood. (Kanti Ganguly, the minister in charge of the Sunderbans, admitted recently that 80 per cent of the youth there now work as migrant labourers.) I saw stunted trees, and the embankments, still made of mud, remained vulnerable. Only the rivers that circled the land looked stronger, and meaner.        
	In Luxbagan, I was met by my host, Kanailal Sarkar, a project-organizer with the Tagore Society for Rural Development. Using Lahiripur as an example, he elaborated on the incomplete rehabilitation work and the magnitude of government indifference. Since May 25, 2008, the day of the storm, of the estimated 5,000 households in Lahiripur (2001 census), only 900 have received full or partial compensation. Government aid, which reached Satjelia-Lahiripur days after the deluge, was limited to one tarpaulin, four kilograms of rice and 300 grams of pulses. The people survived because non-governmental organizations brought drinking water, dry food, medicines and mosquito nets at a much quicker pace.        
	The repair work of the embankments has been equally shoddy. In the Sunderbans, the embankments measure 3,500 kilometres, of which 778 kms are in need of urgent repair. The two sluice gates at Rajatjubileepur and Annepur, near Luxbagan, had been strengthened recently, but during bhara kotal (high tide at full moon), the one in Annepur had been damaged again. Significantly, Bangladesh, arguably much poorer than India, had concretized river embankments as early as 1952. In India, even six decades after Independence, successive Central and state governments have not shown the political will to rescue the people from their plight. Predictably, the state irrigation minister, Subhash Naskar, has absolved himself of all responsibility this time as well and blamed the Centre for its failure to provide Rs 5,000 crore. Let down by the Centre, the state government has now decided to act on its own. A sum of Rs 50 crore has been allotted, and the work, originally scheduled to begin last December, is now expected to commence nearly 48 weeks after the disaster. It is not as if the government cannot act swiftly. Some years ago, it had pounced on a proposal to build an eco-tourism centre along with the Sahara Group in the heart of this fragile environment. There was also some talk of a private lease on the Matla. The apex court and an unwilling people saved the Sunderbans on that occasion.        
	Calcuttans, who have been jolted by the Sunderbans recent plight, need to know that the story of State apathy does not begin with Aila. The mounting agrarian crisis is as much the result of natures depredations as of faulty government policies. After liberalization, local varieties of rice were replaced with supposedly high-yielding seeds that have been decimated by the saline soil. The Sunderbans have, approximately, 310,561 hectares of cultivable land, but it is not enough to feed 43 lakh people. Yet, land reclamation schemes are unheard of. Nearly 40 per cent of the population are landless labourers, but the government has not managed to provide other means of livelihood. The islands receive 1,700-1,900 millimetres of rainfall, annually, but rainwater-harvesting, which could have helped save much-needed sweet water, is not available widely. There is only one government soil-testing laboratory in the whole of South 24 Parganas, and its branch at Canning remains underutilized.        
	The dismal picture is not complete unless one mentions the poor roads, the lack of electricity and the far-flung health centres. The mutilated path that connects Satjelia to Lahiripur falls under the prime ministers road development programme, and is now in a shambles. The nearest government hospital from Lahiripur is two hours away at Gosaba. At Sukumari, I saw a dubious health advertisement that promised to cure all illnesses for Rs 100. Satjelia and Lahiripur have no electricity. The two power centres at Gosaba and Chotomollahkhali can produce 500 kilowatts, but they often operate well below their capacity. I saw at least five primary schools in and around Lahiripur, many of which served as flood centres. I was told that the drop-out rate after Aila had climbed to nearly seven per cent. In Lahiripur, the supply of kerosene was intermittent and firewood equally scarce. Meen chash  the catching of prawn hatchlings  had fallen by 80 per cent, and trafficking of women is on the rise.        
	It is this wonderland that the State is now trying to peddle to the world through a vote. But its efforts in this respect have been equally slipshod. None of the panchayat members in Satjelia and Lahiripur knew about the contest. Some NGO workers mentioned that they had been informed about the initiative in a recent conclave that was attended by the ministers of forests of India and Bangladesh. But a blueprint to raise awareness levels is yet to be prepared. But can there be anything more perverse than the idea of goading an impoverished, defenceless people to vote in order to win international recognition? The State wants the Sunderbans to become the seventh wonder of the world. So the people of the islands must vote, even though what they would like, ideally, is to elect a government that would repair embankments and provide food and fresh water. The vote, supposedly a symbol of a healthy democracy, has been corrupted to force upon a people choices and needs that are alien and unnecessary.        
	But then, Indias democracy is inherently elitist. Be it in the Sunderbans or the forests of Bastar, marginalized voices and their needs are seldom represented. In Sunderbans case, this is also reflected in the conservation efforts. For instance, the peoples pleas to raise awareness about the disappearing baine, a mangrove species that strengthens soil and grows at a faster clip, have been ignored.               
	Wilful exclusion breeds anger. At night, my host and I chatted with a village school-teacher. The river lapped in the dark, and the eerie forest, lit up by fireflies, loomed nearby. The two men said, matter-of-factly, that blood would spill if the bunds were breached again. Their words, and not the river or the forest, chilled my bones. Apathy also brings with it unimaginable despair. The following morning, on my way back to Gosaba, I saw a mad man throwing stones into the river. The van driver said that the man had lost his family, and his mind, to the storm. He now spends his days tossing pebbles and stones, hoping that the waters will not rise again. Of all the unforgettable men and women in the islands, I remember him the most.

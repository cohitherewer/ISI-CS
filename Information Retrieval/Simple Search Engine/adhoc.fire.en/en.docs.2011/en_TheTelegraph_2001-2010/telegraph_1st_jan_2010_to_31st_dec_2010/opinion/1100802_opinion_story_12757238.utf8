                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SLIVER OF HOPE                                                    
	Chinas exchange controller has announced that its gross domestic product at purchasing power parity has exceeded that of Japan. This is only the last of a series of calculations relating to China that has announced its rise in various fields. In March, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization had declared that Chinas share of world manufacturing output in 2009 had reached 15.6 per cent, 0.2 per cent higher than Japans share. Later in the same month, a report of Retail Banking Research announced that China had attained the second largest number of automatic teller machines, again beating Japan. Chinas overall growth played a part, but so did the innovative model it adopted: it organized the setting up of ATMs by agents  virtually shopkeepers  in return for a service fee and a commission on ATM transactions.        
	That was an instance of a specific innovation. But Chinas rapid productivity growth is itself the result of widespread innovation, for people cannot produce more unless they improve products and methods of production. China has virtually invented a new growth model, which has given it such high growth rates; no other country has yet discovered the secret of this model. Not that people have not tried. Many foreigners have visited China to find the key; a good few of them have written about it, making Chinese economics a growth industry in the Western world. But for all their trying, the formula has not been revealed; no other country has been able to attain growth rates equal to Chinas. That includes India; and Indians have not even tried to discover the secret, for they think they know the answer. Their stock response is that India is a democracy and has a more robust political system that is better at resolving social tensions and conflicts, and is therefore less likely to run into a crisis. To those who bask in this comfortable belief, it is immaterial that China has not run into the predicted crisis till now. Their belief that it will is a matter of faith, and like all faith, not subject to questioning.        
	The faithful are unlikely to learn; but there is a sliver of hope. Pronab Sen has just been removed from the post of chief statistician, and been reclaimed by the Planning Commission. The deputy chairman of the commission must get the 12th five-year plan drafted, and he could think of none better than Mr Sen. Mr Sen could take the easy way out, take out the last plan and change the years and the figures. No one will notice, because traditionally the plan is a 1,000-page document designed to reduce earnest people to tears and to put the rest to sleep. Mr Sen could change that. He should devote himself to asking how India can better Chinas growth record in five years and call his answer the 12th five-year plan.

	 For those who walk the corridors of power, it is important to remember the size of their boots. That is one message clearly emanating from the swift moves in the hallowed corridors that saw the all-powerful former national security advisor, MK Narayanan, being quietly relegated to the sidelines with the foisting of a gubernatorial position on him. The apparent objective was to give the Union home minister, P Chidambaram, a free hand. The growing distance between Narayanan and PC had become too apparent of late to not have something done about it. But there is another suspicion. Party insiders believe that the open support shown for Chidambaram by the PM may also have to do with the checkmating of Pranab Mukherjee, finance minister and clearly No. 2 in the government. For some reason, the party leadership has tried to ensure that Mukherjee remains at a safe distance from power. The pruning of wings, of course, is a healthy habit when done periodically. Who knows, PC himself might be going in for a trim sooner than he thinks.                
	 That P Chidambaram enjoys the confidence of his bosses is apparent. But what is not so apparent is the confidence he inspires in others. This was made evident by the minister of state for home, Ajay Maken. At the meeting between ministers of state and the PM, while most voiced their dissatisfaction with their seniors, Maken struck a different note. Not only did he not raise a finger against PC, but he also issued a press release to say he was more than happy with his senior. Maken said that he had enough work and also insisted that the best way of getting work was to instil confidence in the senior minister by proving ones ability and integrity. That obviously hasnt made Maken popular among some of his colleagues.                            
	 The AICC gen-sec in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, and the UPCC chief, Rita Bahuguna, have lodged a complaint with the EC. They alleged that Mayavati rigged the legislative council elections in the state in which she won 31of the 33 seats. Their grouse is that helpers were used to cast fake votes. It is being said that 800 to 1,000 fake votes were cast in each council and behenjis party ensured that the helpers accompanied the bona fide voters, most of whom were illiterate and did not know how to operate the voting machine. All this makes us wonder what the poll officers were up to during this time.                            
	 When you are in the eye of the storm, it helps to deflect some pressure. Take RK Pachauri, for instance, the long-time head of The Energy and Resources Institute, whose glacier theory has come under fire recently. The controversy that has attracted the attention of the international media was followed by the news of his literary achievements. Pachauris novel, Return to Almora, is being promoted as a tale of love, passion and reincarnation among other things. In the capital, the book was released by Shashi Tharoor and in Mumbai by Mukesh Ambani. Some positive publicity to counter the negative?                            
	 The Union minister for agriculture, Sharad Pawar, is busy working at his image of being a true follower of Indira Gandhi. Pawar has earned this rare distinction because of his ability to put the blame for all adverse circumstances on either the foreign hand or the global phenomenon. Mrs Gandhi, too, is said to have described everything, including corruption, as a universal phenomenon. Any setback or failure, including the fickle weather, was attributed to the ubiquitous CIA. With sugar prices touching an unprecedented high, Pawar seems to have taken a leaf out of Mrs Gandhis survival kit. He has found the time-honoured alibi of the global phenomenon on which he blames the sky-high prices. Congressmen say he could as well have blamed the erstwhile British colonizers.                            
	 Never before has the number of retired police officers and bureaucrats occupying Raj Bhavans been so large. This means that politicians eyeing gubernatorial posts now find themselves rebuffed. Among them is the former Union minister, Santosh Mohan Dev. Having lost the Lok Sabha elections, he has been lobbying hard for rehabilitation. But the Congress president is said to have struck off his name from the rolls fearing renewed controversy over the sale of the Bailadila mines when Mohan Dev was the minister for steel and mines. Better luck next time.

	 Amar Singh is now history for the Samajwadi Party, and as it is with history, this thakur leader has left a legacy. Mulayam Singh Yadavs son, Akhilesh, is now addressed as Kunwar Sahib, a title which Rajput leaders love to adorn. Akhileshs supporters give a different spin to this. They argue that Mulayams son has married a Rajput girl and Akhileshs in-laws, reportedly, have been addressing him as Kunwar Sahib much before he joined politics or Singh left the party. Meanwhile, Akhileshs detractors have moved on. There are indications that Sanjay Dutt is in touch with the Congress and Singh is in the process of forming his own outfit with the help of former socialist leader, Raghu Thakur, currently heading the Loktantrik Samajwadi Party. A battle between fake and real Thakurs seems to be on the cards.

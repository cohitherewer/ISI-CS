V. Kumara Swamy finds out why                          raquo; Veg rage: A recent protest against Bt brinjal in Bangalore                                   
	The controversy over Bt brinjal may have been laid to rest with the ministry of environment and forests announcing a moratorium on its commercial introduction, but activists across the country are gearing up for a long fight over a new Bill on biotechnology.         
	The Biotechnology Regulatory Authority Bill, 2009, which the government plans to table in Parliament during the Budget session, proposes to regulate the research, transport, import, manufacture and use of organisms and products of modern biotechnology...in order to promote the safe use of modern biotechnology by enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of regulatory procedures.        
	Under the Bill, a three-member body, called the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI), will be set up and it will replace the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC), currently the apex body regulating genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the country. Incidentally, it was the GEAC that had approved Bt brinjal.         
	But activists feel that the Bill will open the floodgates to genetically modified crops. First of all, they dislike the idea that unlike the GEAC, which comes under the environment ministry, BRAI will be set up by the department of biotechnology, under the ministry of science and technology.         
	Its a wrong Bill by the wrong people and for the wrong reasons, says Kavitha Kuruganti of Kheti Virasat Mission, an organisation campaigning for sustainable agriculture. The department of biotechnology is involved in the research and promotion of GMOs in the country. How can you expect it to draft a Bill without bias? BRAI will act more like a clearing house than as a regulator, she says.         
	According to those opposed to BRAI, the body should have been called national biosafety protection authority and should be placed either under the ministry of environment and forests or the ministry of health and family welfare.         
	In 2004, a task force on agricultural biotechnology headed by M.S. Swaminathan had called for a biotechnology regulatory policy aimed at ensuring the safety of the environment, the well-being of farming families, the ecological and economic sustainability of farming systems...and the biosecurity of the nation. Although the government accepted the recommendations of the task force, activists accuse it of not implementing them in the draft Bill.         
	The new law does not deal with the weaknesses of the current regime like the lack of transparency and public participation, says Suman Sahai of Gene Campaign, a research and advocacy group working in the field of rural development.         
	However, a former member of the department of biotechnology and the GEAC says that activists are being unnecessarily negative about the Bill. Theyve been shifting goalposts when it comes to opposition to GMOs. The same people were once opposed to Bt cotton. Now that the cultivation of the crop has increased by leaps and bounds, there does not seem to be a problem. The scientific communitys decisions should be respected, he says.         
	But critics of GMOs say that the public cannot be expected to accept unquestioningly what the scientific community says. In fact, they point out, the Bill seems to want them to do just that by including a provision to penalise misinformation. According to Section 63 of the proposed law, Whoever, without any evidence or scientific record, misleads the public about the safety of the organisms and products... shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to one year and with a fine which may extend to Rs 2 lakh or with both.         
	This strikes at the very root of scientific enquiry. Science is about questioning and two scientists can have two differing opinions. This provision is aimed at stifling opposition, says Shalini Bhutani of GRAIN, a non-profit international organisation working in the field of agriculture.         
	But Malathi Lakshmikumaran, an intellectual property rights consultant based in Delhi and a supporter of GMOs, says that there is a need for such a provision. Too many people with too little knowledge held forth on Bt brinjal and it was responsible for a lot of misinformation, she says. Adds G. Padmanaban, department of biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Quite a few GMO crops are waiting to be approved and India cannot drag its feet because of pressure from various quarters. An independent authority with maximum transparency is the need of the hour.                
	However, activists point out that the Bill is not very transparent either. For instance, Section 27 (1) of the Bill says that notwithstanding anything contained in the Right to Information Act, 2005, (information can) be retained as confidential by the Authority and not be disclosed to any other party.         
	This is an outright violation of the Right to Information Act and also several Supreme Court rulings. An authority cannot decide what outweighs public interest, asserts Jai Krishna of Greenpeace, the international environment organisation.         
	In yet another contentious move, the Bill proposes to set up a Biotech Regulatory Appellate Tribunal with jurisdiction over all civil cases related to modern biotechnology. This would result in several pending cases against GMOs getting transferred to the tribunal, which, say activists, may not deal with them in an unbiased manner. Critics also take issue with the fact that cases can be filed at the tribunal only up to two years from the time the cause of the complaint first occurred. But GM crops can have devastating effects after many years. This two-year limit favours industry lobbies, says Kuruganti.         
	Others feel that the Bill should have made monitoring the effects of GM crops on human health and environment over the long term mandatory. If you look at countries like the US, their environmental protection agency conducts surveys to check if there have been any harmful effects of GM crops. We should also carry out similar studies from time to time, says Padmanaban.         
	The Bill does have some features that have been praised by all. The tough rule on conflict of interest is one of them. Section 10 states that the chairperson or a member of BRAI cannot be employed in any organisation involved in the research, transport or import of organisms or products or manufacture or use of organisms and products. Nor can he take up the post if he had been associated with such an organisation in the last two years.         
	But the sceptics are continuing to breathe fire. The Bill has far too many drawbacks. If the government goes ahead and tables this Bill, we will oppose it strongly, says Bhutani.         
	Clearly, the government has a tough fight on its hands.

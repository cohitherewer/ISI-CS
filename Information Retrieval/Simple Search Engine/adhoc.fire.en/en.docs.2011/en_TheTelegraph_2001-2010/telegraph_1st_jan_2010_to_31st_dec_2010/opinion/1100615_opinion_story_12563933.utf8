	The scale, swiftness, agony and hideousness of the Bhopal gas tragedy make it unforgettable. Yet the verdict in the case has come almost after a quarter of a century, arousing deep unhappiness, discontent and anger. But many of the causes of this discontent spring from particular conditions in India. The delay in the delivery of justice is hardly unusual; every case drags on for years. Delay blunts justice. The pity is that it may have blunted the edge of the Bhopal case too, yet that is, ultimately, a separate problem. The upsurge of emotion over the sentence passed on seven former officials, however, ignores the logic of the law. It is a sentence fitting the charge against them, changed from culpable homicide to causing death by negligence by order of the Supreme Court in 1996. Also, the demand for the arrest of Warren Anderson, the Union Carbide chief in 1984, is charged with emotion  and blinded by habit. India allows arrests at the drop of a hat, violating its own laws, especially when the arrest is in the interest of a powerful person or party. Had a direct connection been proven between the chief and the gas leak, or had the Central Bureau of Investigation been able to prove that he was responsible for a flawed design in the factory in order to cut costs, the matter would have been different. But law has its due process; the outcome depends on what has been brought to it.        
	The issue of compensation, too, remains a raw and sad one. Passionate activism over the years has no doubt helped the victims cause, but merely protesting that the compensation is inadequate is not enough. That may well be the case, but it has to be properly established to hold water in a court of law. Moreover, the logical way to penalize the company would have been to ensure earlier that it was stopped by the courts from selling its assets in India to pay off compensation claims. And that it would not be able to sell its assets elsewhere either, before it had recompensed the victims of Bhopal. That India does not have a system of class action suits as the United States of America does, or even laws to deal specifically with corporate negligence, is something that also affects the amount of compensation. Without changes in this sphere, with a lessening of political interference and a strengthening of investigative agencies, victims of corporate negligence or industrial disasters will continue to feel despair.

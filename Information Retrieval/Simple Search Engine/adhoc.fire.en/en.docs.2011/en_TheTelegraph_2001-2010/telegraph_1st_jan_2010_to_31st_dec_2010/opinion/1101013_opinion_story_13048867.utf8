The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | clean it up
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CLEAN IT UP                                                    
	It does not need a lawyer or any kind of special investigation to arrive at the conclusion that something is rotten in the affairs of the Indian Premier League. The fact that two teams have been thrown out of the IPL only confirms the general impression. The two teams are the Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab. The official reason for this decision by the IPL governing council was that both teams or their owners had breached the franchise agreement. But there may be other reasons behind the drastic decision. Whatever these may be, it is evident that the Board of Control for Cricket in India is taking steps to clean up affairs within the IPL and remove the stains left on the tournament by the shenanigans of Lalit Modi, the former IPL commissioner who is now under a cloud. Many of the IPL teams, including the two teams that have been thrown out, have celebrities, like Hollywood stars, as their owners. It is feared that the removal of such teams will result in a reduction of the glamour quotient of the IPL. The governing council of the tournament has rightly chosen cleanliness and probity over glamour. The governing council justifiably prefers to suffer some short-term losses to build up the long-term credibility of the IPL. It deserves to be applauded for this attitude.        
	What is undeniable is that the IPL, from its conception to its presentation, represents a unique entertainment package. It conjured up a form of cricket, punched it with the presence of film stars and cheerleaders, and thus presented a heady cocktail which was an immediate bestseller. But success cannot escape scrutiny. The more the affairs of the IPL came under the scanner, the bigger became the shadows looming over it. Now it is no exaggeration to suggest that scandal and the IPL are almost synonymous. The situation was worse confounded by the involvement of politicians and of persons linked with powerful politicians. In spite of this and the presence of monetary stakes, no scheme to cover up the matter succeeded. This by itself is remarkable in India. The first steps of the cleaning-up process are already visible. The protestations of film stars, lately turned cricket fans and owners of cricket teams, should not deter the BCCI from completing the good work it has started. Cricket is much more important than the IPL and film stars, and it should remain so.

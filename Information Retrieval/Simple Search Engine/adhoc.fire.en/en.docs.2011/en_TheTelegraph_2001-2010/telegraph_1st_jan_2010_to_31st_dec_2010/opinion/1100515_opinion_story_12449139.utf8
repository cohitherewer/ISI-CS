	Boredom and blessing        
	For Bengali theatre, May means two big birthdays: Tagores and Bohurupees. The oldest surviving Bengali group marked its 62nd anniversary sorrowfully, bereaved of its leader since 1979, the great Kumar Roy. The customary festival on the occasion, dedicated to his memory, featured a Bangladeshi production, Ami Nai, by Nagarik Natyangan Ensemble (Dhaka). Manjure Maolas whodunit depicted a man convinced of his own murder, but existentialism was its real theme. Both the supposedly poetic script and Jamal-uddin Hosens watery direction bored us out of our minds, so that we felt no pangs whatsoever about the heros death. On the contrary, we felt like killing him ourselves, to hasten the ending. Roy would not have approved of this play.         
	At Jadavpur Universitys Tagore sesquicentenary celebrations, Anya Desh, comprising blind and otherwise-abled youth, presented an unusual one-hour condensation of Rakta-karabi. Demarcating the area with ropes conveyed the characters entrapment, while functionally indicating to the cast the stage limits. Three girls took turns to enact Nandini, one with a wonderful singing voice. Director Subhasish Ganguli interpolated some Rabindrasangeet from elsewhere. That aside, Tagore would have blessed this endeavour.        
	Ananda Lal                
	Name in vain        
	The tribute to Rabindranath Tagore in Rabi O Chhabi (May 6-12) at the Academy of Fine Arts was so only in name. It was a run-of-the-mill show of four artists, who did not seem to have a passing familiarity with Tagores art. One black-and-white picture of Tagore is so bad it does not deserve to be featured even in a school wall magazine. Worse is the picture of Ashokmanjari Shyama in a red peignoir. The artists probably imagined that they will get away with these atrocities simply by invoking the icons name.        
	Coming Together (April 28-May 4), at the same venue, fares somwhat better. Going by the unremarkable ceramics of Gargee Ghosh and Swarup Nandy, one can say that they are trained if unimaginative artists. Som Kumar Debs bronze pieces are better conceived. Bappa Haldars canvas is a lift from the images of some successful realistic artists. Suman Choudhurys pastels, with their scratched surface and the juxtaposition of dull and bright colours, at least, have the virtue of being vague.        
	Soumitra Das

	Across a private universe                      
	Valmikis daughter (Penguin, Rs 299) by Shani Mootoo weaves together vignettes that are seemingly borrowed from life itself. Set in Trinidad, the book revolves around a prosperous family made up, among others, by Valmiki  a successful physician and caring father  and his feisty daughter, Viveka  an intelligent girl desperate to set herself free from her gilded existence. Although Mootoo examines the complicated ties that make, and often break, families, the novel is not merely a skilful exploration of inner, private worlds, and of the ways in which they are shaped by extraneous forces. Trinidad, with its myriad sounds and smells, occupies centre stage as well, and Mootoo excels in identifying its social and cultural moorings that are often at odds with the values that guide family behaviour. The opening sequence in which Mootoo goes about describing the town and then leads us gently into the world of the protagonist conveys the power of her prose.                             
	Words of freedom: Ideas of a nation (Penguin, Rs 99) is yet another offering from the series that brings together important speeches and writings of some of Indias greatest leaders whose vision and thought have shaped the countrys political destiny. This volume includes three historic speeches and an essay by B.R. Ambedkar, in which he shares his views on a number of critical issues  the fate of Dalits in a yet-to-be free nation, communalism, proportional representation in the constituent assembly and government service, and so on. The speeches reflect Ambedkars deep-rooted concern for and commitment towards the Dalit cause. They also bear evidence of the fact that apart from being a skilled politician, Ambedkar was also a dexterous writer.                        
	 Mind warriors: winning strategies with NLP (Penguin, Rs 299) by Dipankar Khanna is meant to decode the mysteries surrounding the concept of Neuro-Linguistic Programming. NLP includes techniques that enhance ones emotional excellence. Khanna claims that his book, written in an easy to understand manner, will help practitioners master the art of NLP. But the mystery only deepens as one encounters terms such as New Behaviour Generator, Swish Pattern and Six-Step Reframing every step on the way.

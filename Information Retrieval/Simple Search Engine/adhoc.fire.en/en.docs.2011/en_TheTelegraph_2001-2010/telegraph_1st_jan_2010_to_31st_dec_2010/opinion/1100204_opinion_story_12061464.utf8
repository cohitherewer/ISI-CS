                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SLIVER OF SILVER                                                    
	In his State of Union address to the American Congress  at which he also presented his 2010 budget  President Barack Obama talked about responsibility and sacrifice, saying it was time to save what we can, spend what we must and live within our means once again. He then presented the largest budget deficit in the history of the United States of America: $1.6 trillion, or 10.6 per cent of the gross domestic product, the highest it has ever been since World War II, and on top of a budget deficit of $1.4 trillion in 2009. Irony, as one commentator noted, is lost on politicians. The budget includes a freeze on spending  which is where the sacrifice presumably comes in  but that has been called a fig leaf by several observers. It also proposes a few tax increases on the very, very rich. The only other area where there could be some tightening is for several of the tax cuts announced during the Bush administrations tenure to expire.        
	For this administration, the budget is more about the economy and jobs being a bigger priority than reining in public debt  which finances the deficit  at least for this year. The public debt is a serious concern not just for US citizens, but also for the rest of the world: fully 45 per cent of all sovereign debt issuances in 2010 from around the world will be from the US (India and China account for three per cent each). The big question: who will finance this debt? Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, raised this question, but failed to answer it. Of the $1,743 billion in debt issued by the US treasury in 2009, nearly $800 billion was funded by foreigners.        
	It is not clear at this point that the economic stimulus and massive public spending have done anything to improve the unemployment situation. Many economists worry about the possibility of a double dip or W-shaped recession. The only way that massive deficits such as this years can be reduced is if revenues grow, and grow at a faster rate than expenditure. The Clinton years, 1993-2001, offer a good illustration: revenues grew at 7.1 per cent each year, while spending grew 3.6 per cent. In the Bush years, revenue grew at just 3.6 per cent year on year, while spending grew at 8.3; defence spending grew at over 10 per cent each year (compared to one per cent in the Clinton years). Mr Obamas budget says that the sum of all deficits for the next 10 years will be around $8.5 trillion. Estimates from the trend of 16 years put that figure at almost double, between $15 and $18 trillion. This year, the military budget is nearly $900 billion and exempt from the spending freeze, as are other areas, like homeland security, accounting for another $520 billion. Writing in The New York Times, James Galbraith said that 10-year forecasts have no credibility, a sliver of a silver lining on a very big and dark cloud.

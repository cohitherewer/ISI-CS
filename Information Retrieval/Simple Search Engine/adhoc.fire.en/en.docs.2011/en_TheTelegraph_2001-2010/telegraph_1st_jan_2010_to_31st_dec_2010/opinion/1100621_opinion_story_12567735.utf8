The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Eye on the main chance
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EYE ON THE MAIN CHANCE                          - Indias prosperous classes just want to get richer         ASHOK MITRA                          US Marine Corps air station, Futenma, in Ginowan on Okinawa                                        
	The Japanese island of Okinawa was occupied by the United States of Americas troops towards the tail end of World War II. The Americans set up a major marine base there. The marines, an integral element of the conquering power, romped all over the island. Apart from plundering prize fish hauled in from the East China Sea by hard-working fishing folk, their particular target was nubile girls, with whom they misbehaved with impunity. The Japanese authorities, defeated in war, shell-shocked by the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and with an economy struggling to get back on its feet, had to lump the indignities.        
	The US decided to transfer the sovereignty of Okinawa back to Japan in 1972, but with a catch: the marine base at Okinawa was to stay. The nightmarish days of the islanders therefore did not end. Young girls continued to be annoyed by the marines. Resentment against the marines built up; bit by bit; it turned into no less than a mass upsurge, initially centred in Okinawa but gradually sweeping across all of Japan. The Liberal Democratic Part of japan, which had ruled the country uninterruptedly since General MacArthurs departure, was however keen to play down the problem. Industrial oligarchs who dominated the party knew which side their bread was buttered; it would not do to pick a quarrel with the US on the skimpy issue of the occasional raping of fetching damsels by bored marines. The Americans were, after all, Japans most important trade partners.        
	The attitude of the national government added to the frustration of Okinawans even as it irked a wide cross section of democratic-minded people in mainland Japan. The frequency of incidents of skirmish between the marines and the local population kept multiplying. Several rape cases were filed in the civil courts against the American ratings, but dispute regarding the jurisdiction over inmates of a foreign military base proved intractable.               
	The long reign of the LDP came to an end last year in the country when the Democratic Party of Japan vanquished it in the polls. Two factors were at work to render possible what till then had been considered impossible: economic woes brought about by the global recession and, equally important, the DPJs pledge to close the American naval base in Okinawa. This pledge touched an emotional chord in huge sections of the electorate. It was almost a vote for the liberation of Okinawa.        
	The DPJ has had limited success in its battle against recession; the unemployment rate is still disturbingly high, but exports have slowly picked up. Getting rid of the American base in Okinawa has turned out to be a different story. Japan is, if no longer the second, at least the third largest industrial economy in the world; it is a valued member of the elite G-8 group of nations, its clout in both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund is much greater than that of China or India, it has never strayed in international discourse away from toeing the American line. And yet, on the demand for removing the US naval base in Okinawa, neither its economic prowess nor its formal political sovereignty has been of any avail. At the height of the anti-draft agitation in the 1960s, American youth, reluctant to go to Vietnam, would rent the sky with the full-throated chant, Hell, no,/ We wont go. The US response to the notice served on them by the new Japanese administration to quit Okinawa has been identical: no, the United States will not oblige; Okinawa may be Japanese territory, Japan may be a fully independent and an economically powerful nation, the Americans could not care less; never mind the electoral verdict of the Japanese people, Okinawa will remain an American naval base, maybe for eternity, just like the one at Guantanamo in communist Cuba.        
	It has been a terrible loss of face for the Japanese people. Their sovereignty, they have realized, is putty clay in the hands of the worlds mightiest power. Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the DPJ and the prime minister who had entered office with such pride and confidence last year, has resigned, acknowledging failure to keep his pledge.        
	The Okinawa episode has obviously wider implications. Is a sovereign nation not entitled to have the fullest ambit of authority over its own territory, or is that too subject to American benediction? Globalized India has of late entered into a strategic alliance with the US. Indians, bathing in the luxury of a number of economic windfalls globalization and proximity to the US have gifted, are loving every moment of it. Are they, however, ready to admit that there could be issues in international involvement which go beyond crass economic gains? For instance, should not the Okinawa affair, leading to the fall of a countrys prime minister and raising disturbing questions on the limits of sovereignty of a formally independent and economically advanced country be a matter of some concern for Indians too? The treatment meted out to Japan by the US ought to send a shiver down the spine of other countries which have agreed, or are being pressurized into agreeing, to the setting up of American military bases purportedly for fighting more effectively the war against global terror. India, everybody knows, is in this context already on the American radar. Indian indifference to studying the implications of the Okinawa affair cannot, therefore, be alarmingly baffling. A small item tucked in an obscure corner of the newspaper, that is all. No ponderous editorial article, no agitated discussion on the television channels, silence on the part of politicians and political parties, the urban literati who get worked up on such themes as environmental pollution and animal rights are mum. The shape of the argument appears to be as follows: Okinawa does not directly  and immediately  concern us; we may be global citizens, we are however a choosy lot, we are global only to the extent our own economic interests  and that too, short-term interests  are involved; the philosophy that coming events cast their shadow before does not detain us.        
	The same attitude is revealed with regard to the Israeli attack on a Turkish flotilla carrying food and medicine for Palestinians blockaded in the Gaza strip for weeks on end. This atrocious act, causing an unknown number of deaths, has evoked anger across the continents. But apart from a small official press note issued in New Delhi regretting the excesses committed by the Israeli navy, there has been hardly a flutter in India. What Israel has done may be a heinous crime, but we better keep quiet, we have struck some profitable defence deals with Israel, why jeopardize those? The Indian media have by and large gone along with this official view. Some sections of the press have actually poked fun at the protest rallies the Left parties organized against the Israeli government.               
	Or consider the attitude of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The Asiad is a miniature, Asian version of the Olympics, which is being held this year in Beijing; countries in the continent compete in various events. Cricket has been included for the first time; every other cricket-playing country in the continent is participating, but not India. The BCCI will instead send the Indian team elsewhere, pursuant to its commitments to the International Cricket Council. Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh too are members of the ICC, but they have no trouble accommodating participation in the Asiad in their schedule. India is different: for its cricket team and those who guide it Asiad has no attraction. Following Olympic rules, it offers only some junk medals, no hard cash in the manner of the bonanza of the ICC fixtures.        
	The Indian establishment and its mainstay, the upper and upper middle classes  have globalized themselves, but only to the extent it helps them to gather pelf. And they know whom to pick as global friends. Multinational corporations with bases in the US  in the genre of the Union Carbide Corporation  are loaded with money, several windows of opportunity to amass extra wealth will open up if these corporations decide to invest in India. So go easy on the Bhopal calamity, no foolish talk of trying to extradite Warren Anderson; 15,000 and some more had perished at the altar of Union Carbide, but they were poor people, their deaths do not matter, the prospect of getting rich and still richer, in case foreign investors come gushing in, does. The nuclear liability bill, ruling out criminal liability of foreign suppliers and trivializing the extent of civil liability, is drafted with similar lofty thoughts in mind. Globalized India has its eye only on the main chance.

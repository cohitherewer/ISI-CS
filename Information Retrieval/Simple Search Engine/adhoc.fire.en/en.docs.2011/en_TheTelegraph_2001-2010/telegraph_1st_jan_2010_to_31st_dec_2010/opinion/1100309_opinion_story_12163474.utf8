                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Hope again                  
	Sir  The government seems to have its heart in the right place if it has passed the law that will enable children and their parents to legally demand schooling (Children can demand education from April 1, Feb 23). However, the implementation of the law is likely to be a Herculean task for the government. Laws routinely fail to outline a definite strategy for delivering their benefits to the target population. In a country such as India, where many people find it difficult get two square meals a day, it would be difficult to persuade poor families to send their wards to school rather than to work. Moreover, the notification states that the government will take care of kids in the 6-14 years age group. What will become of them after that?          
	Teaching children simply to sign their names or to pronounce the names of a few national leaders is not education. We need to have a system where, along with lessons, children will also be taught some basic skills so that they do not join the huge army of the educated unemployed. Children must be evaluated and given incentives according to their performance. Yet our human resource development minister is busy replacing examination systems.          
	Politicians have little sense of the countrys reality. Simply creating reservations for sections of the people will not achieve anything worthwhile, but will inspire vote-bank politics. Recently, schools and colleges have been set up in remote areas to enable people to have easy access to education. This practice should have started right after Independence. But, instead of trying to grant all citizens equal rights, some shrewd leaders have segregated people into majority and minority groups. It is shameful that even after more than 60 years of Independence, the country cannot do away with the reservation system, which fosters discrimination among the people in the name of language, religion, caste or creed.          
	The available infrastructure in the education sector is sadly inadequate. There is a dearth of school buildings as well as of dedicated and qualified teachers to impart education to poor children. The recent law allows people to sue governments if the latter fail to provide basic education to children. But unless people are properly educated, how can they move court?          
	A non-political committee consisting of retired educationists and eminent social workers must be set up in every state, so that the process of utilization of funds is monitored. Hopefully, our policy-makers will make the right decisions and hand over some tangible benefit to the people.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Alokananda Bhattacharyya, Guwahati

                
	Sir  The recent notification by the HRD ministry regarding the right to education is an important step towards further development of the country. Without education, progress is impossible. However, doubt remains as to whether educational institutions across the country are in a position to support the implementation of the law right from the forthcoming session. To accommodate a larger number of students, it is essential that the machinery and infrastructure of schools be immediately upgraded. Can the various management boards of schools do that quickly? We cannot be too optimistic if we go by the general history of this country, where the court verdict of even such a momentous case as the Bombay blasts took years to be delivered.           
	The bigger question, however, is how many people will actually come up and ask for their right. A large percentage of the population remains illiterate. Even if children, especially girls from the backward areas of the country, ask their parents to send them to school, how many families will actually listen? Though it is encouraging to read about the occasional braveheart conquering all odds to educate himself or herself, the fact remains that only few students are able to reach high school.          
	However, despite all the hurdles, the HRD ministrys step is a positive one. This measure needs the helping hand of the privileged in order to succeed. Institutes should utilize the opportunity offered by government to upgrade themselves. It would be foolish to think that changes would occur overnight. Of all legislations, at least this particular one should be given all the time it needs to deliver its full potential.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Anirvan Sengupta, Calcutta

                
	Who cares?    
	Sir  Although pages have been written about the tendency of Calcuttas taxi-drivers to refuse to go to destinations not to their liking, not much has changed. Leaders of the taxi unions are fully aware of the situation. Yet, whenever they are asked to explain the drivers arrogant attitude, they come up with an evasive promise to look into the matter. The union leaders do not seem to have the intention or the authority to discipline their members. For some curious reason, the police are also reluctant to involve themselves even if passengers are refused by taxi-drivers right before their eyes.          
	Very few people have the tenacity or the time to lodge complaints against errant drivers and to follow them up. Lodging a complaint will not, in any case, redress their immediate problem of getting a taxi. The taxiwallas know this, and take full advantage of the knowledge to harass helpless commuters, particularly after 8 pm. When the taxi-drivers demand for an increase in fares is promptly taken care of in case of a rise in fuel price, should they not heed the passengers requests?          
	Yours faithfully,      
Adhip Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The problems faced by both citizens of Calcutta and visitors from outside while travelling by taxis need to be highlighted. Nearly 80 per cent of the taxis plying the streets of Calcutta are probably more than 15 years old, and are consequently in a dangerous condition. There is no agency to check the road-worthiness of these vehicles since the Motor Vehicles Department usually issues certificates under political pressure. Such a lack of accountability leads to accidents in which not only passengers but also pedestrians get injured or killed.          
	I have escaped death twice when the taxis I was travelling in developed technical snags midway. On February 16, the suspension gear of my taxi (WB25/9337) broke in the middle of the road, and I had to take another cab to reach the AMRI hospital. The state government must punish those taxi-owners who do not maintain their vehicles properly.           
	 Yours faithfully,
  Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

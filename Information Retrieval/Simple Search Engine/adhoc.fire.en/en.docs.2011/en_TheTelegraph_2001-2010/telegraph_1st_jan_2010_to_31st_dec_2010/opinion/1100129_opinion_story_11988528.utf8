	It is pretty pointless to try to discover a structure of rationality in social mores. A person may be a crook and a thief and guilty of a thousand other offenses, but as long he remains successful in politics and occupies one electoral office after another, the media will treat him with awesome regard. And in this era, the media, everyone knows, represent society. There is a proviso though. The person has to be careful: he must not get caught in sexual escapades. In the event of such a mishap, he will be immediately cast aside, the media will howl for his blood. It is no different for bureaucrats or policemen either. A police officer, corrupt to the core, may have piled up a fortune, acquired prize estate in more than one metropolitan city and even opened numbered Swiss bank accounts, and all such exploits are generally known. He will yet be able to prance around as cock of the road and get elevated to prestigious social positions. But should he, maybe in a slightly inebriated condition in a party, pass his palm across the rump of an unwary lady, that will be the end of the road for him.        
	Or perhaps not. For there is an almost religious respect in the community for power and wealth. Money matters, not how one makes it. Nobody stops to ask how a politician or a civil servant or a police officer could come to the huge wealth he had amassed; his background was so nondescript. Everyone already knows the answer to the mystery, which, however, is not going to be openly discussed. Once the person has acquired power or financial resources or both, these become his social legal tender, the chain of skulduggeries through which he has come to his money will not be mentioned. Money buys influence, it also buys silence.              
	This tribe of politicians and their hangers-on is generally a careful lot. It is only the greatest nincompoops amongst them who get caught. And, even when caught in a sexual peccadillo, they know the ropes of how to get out of it. If a politically powerful person is threatened with grave embroilment in a sex scandal, in 99 cases out of a hundred, the judicious deployment of resources in the right places will extricate him. Some innuendoes will float in the air for a while  so what?  he will be safe from public exposure.         
	It was no different in the pre-freedom days. The British ruled, they wielded near absolute power. Indigenous politicians, known as nationalists, formed a raucous crowd, but they did not rule and had no real power. Quite a few amongst them found sublimation in the unending power games taking place within the precincts of the Indian National Congress. The Congress was a curious animal. Idealists, honest and self-sacrificing to the core, would join it in large numbers and constitute its foot soldiers. But rich landlords and successful doctors or lawyers would join it too. The humble ones stuck to their spinning wheel and khadi apparel. The affluent set were of a different mould. They loved to establish control over the partys organization and engage in factional fights to achieve that goal. Intrigues were common and so were betrayals and double-dealings. In many cities, group rivalries within the Congress reached absurd heights. Persons swore allegiance to the same party, the Congress, which was leading the nations fight for freedom. They were nonetheless constantly engaged in plots and conspiracies to do down their rivals in the organization. Each faction would be on the lookout to catch off-guard their enemies. They would even go to the length of manufacturing evidence which could damn their arch-enemies in the party. Most of them were moneyed people and were prepared to spend money like water for such high-minded purposes. At one point, Congress politics, particularly in Bengal, was reduced to exertions to discover the moral depravity of the opposing factions.         
	Thereby hangs a tale. Exactly three-quarters of a century ago, a girl in her late teens, who had done her matriculation from a mofussil school, Sujata Sarkar, took admission in a Calcutta girls college that was founded by Keshub Chunder Sen. A wide-eyed, fresh faced young woman, Sujata immediately fell in love with the big city with its glitter and glamour. She wanted a good time here and sought advice regarding how to go about it. The city, though, had its flip side. She was soon ensnared in a racket she could not get out of. A close group of successful lawyers, doctors and businessmen  all confirmed bachelors  had formed a coterie within the provincial organization of the Congress. Their ardours for factional squabbles in the party apart, this group of bachelors had a weakness for clandestine evening meets, where there would be fun and food and drinks would be plenty. To make things livelier for the bachelor eminences, a bevy of comely girls would be there to provide company. The girls were chosen with some care to cater to the taste of the sophisticated and rich bachelors. One or two city colleges were targeted for recruitment. The prospect of meeting well-known people excited the girls. The lure of an expensive shawl or a gold necklace or an evening bag imported from Paris and perhaps the offer of some cash too: the girls succumbed. A number of them became regulars at these evening occasions; Sujata Sarkar was one. With Sujata, however, what began as an innocent romp ended in a tragedy. The gaiety went too far one evening, she did not realize what was happening to her, she was in the family way. Members of the bachelors coterie  affluent, influential people, social celebrities so to say  panicked. A hurried abortion was arranged in a private nursing home. The surgery went awry and Sujata Sarkar died on the operation table. All hell let loose. Someone from the opposing camp in the Congress got scent of the matter, an anonymous telephone call reached the police. Men of law arrived on the scene, seized the body of the dead girl and gave the management of the nursing home a harrowing time. A case was registered and investigations were on. An elder brother of Sujata, a bit of a scoundrel, turned up and started blackmailing the group of eminent bachelors who constituted a big chunk of Calcuttas social register. Since they were all big shots in the Congress too, it would be catastrophic if their names appeared in the newspapers. Money began to flow like water. About everybody with proximate or not so proximate knowledge about what had exactly happened made money: doctors and nurses attached to the nursing home, managers and staff of hotels where the exotic evening parties used to take place, bearers, porters and gatekeepers, lawyers, journalists, and, of course, members of the police. The Sujata Sarkar case was the talk of the town. Given the pressure of public opinion, the police had to chargesheet the management of the nursing home. Hearing started in a city court. Newspapers, and not just the Bengali rags, reported the daily proceedings, including every word of the examination and the cross-examination of witnesses, spread across four or six pages. But no names got dropped. Salacious gossip was, of course, conducted in offices, marketplaces, buses, streetcars and trains. Such gossip did indeed whisper names, but the newspapers behaved, they did not stray beyond dropping innuendoes.              
	All is well that ends well. No names were mentioned in the open court either. The bounder of the elder brother disappeared with his stash of money. Newspaper editors wrote stentorian editorials full of indignation at the debauchery in high places and expressing disappointment with the unsatisfactory conclusion of the case. But no names were named, and the management of the nursing home got off with a light sentence. Quite a few of doctors, lawyers and policemen built imposing palaces in south Calcutta with their earnings from the Sujata Sarkar case.        
	Now that the epoch of management education has arrived, the file of the Sujata Sarkar story, if re-assembled, would make a first-rate case study in scandal management. Money talks. Money also silences. Politicians with money can silence the truth today; they did the same thing three-quarters of a century ago. Sujata Sarkar, poor girl, she perhaps only wanted to own a Murshidabad  not even a Benarasi  silk sari. For that avarice, she had to pay with her life. One or two of those responsible for her death went on to hold important political positions in post-independence India.

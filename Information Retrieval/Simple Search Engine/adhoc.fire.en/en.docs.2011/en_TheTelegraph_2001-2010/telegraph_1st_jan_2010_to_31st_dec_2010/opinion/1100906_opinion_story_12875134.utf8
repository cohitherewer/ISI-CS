	Stark difference                  
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas article about two kinds of globalization made for an interesting read (The best and the worst, Aug 28). One cannot deny that an entrepreneurs primary objective is to make money. But if it is at the cost of the environment, this becomes unacceptable. The Bellary mineowners are ruining the environment without facing problems from the government.           
	It is true that software engineers in Bangalore are in a lucrative profession, which in turn ensures that they are motivated to contribute to the countrys technological progress. The decision of the chief executive officer of Infosys, N.R. Narayana Murthy, to ensure a healthy working environment for his employees while keeping his children uninvolved in the companys affairs has proved to be a sound move. One only has to look at the bitter disputes within the Ambani and Birla families to be convinced of the soundness of Murthys decision.           
	While Bangalores major software companies have consistently kept their workforces well, the Bellary mineowners have exploited the labourers and indiscriminately destroyed the environment. These minelords are mainly associated with political parties like the Congress or the Bharatiya Janata Party, which are constantly struggling for power in Karnataka. This is part of the problem.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas article talks about the environmental, social and economic atrocities being committed by the greedy Bellary minelords while Bangalores information technology industry flourishes.I do feel, though, that Guha may have overstated the contribution of the IT entrepreneurs when he says that they spend a small fraction on themselves, and a larger fraction on various charitable and philanthropic causes.           
	However, these entrepreneurs have enriched society in terms of wealth and knowledge. Also, they have earned a huge amount of money in a short time through hard work, whereas the Bellary minelords have made their fortunes only through unscrupulous means. One hopes to see evidence of their foul play in Paranjoy Guha Thakurtas forthcoming documentary film on Bellary.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ramachandra Guha correctly observes that we have two broad categories of businessmen  the traditional business families and the modern entrepreneurs who work their way up. I think I can safely say that most of the latter have been good corporates who have regularly contributed to social causes such as education, health and environmental sustenance, Satyam notwithstanding. It is the exclusive family businesses that are often found to be exploitative.          
	I disagree with Guhas claim that globalization is responsible for the ways in which these two groups act. A sociologist may be able to analyse the reasons behind the differing behavioural patterns, but an economist will find this claim hard to accept. It is true that globalization has enabled Indian businessmen to carry on trade without any third-party interference. But this does not mean that external factors determine the behaviour of our business classes.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  While Ramachandra Guha has spoken mainly of the condition of his home state, Karnataka, the same scenario prevails elsewhere in India. Also, the IT and mining sectors are so different from each other that one wonders whether they can be compared at all.           
	The pros and cons of globalization for India can be debated, but such arguments cannot reform the power-hungry minelords of Bellary in the near future. Guha, with his noble vision, may have to settle for the way things are at present.

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Driving to the airport one evening, my colleague and I got stuck in a terrible traffic jam ahead of Kaikhali. Usually there are no policemen there, but that evening some suddenly appeared and began wielding lathis. One of them damaged the bonnet of my car, and when my colleague protested, he said that he was in charge of the airport police station, and we could complain to anybody we liked. Policemen, who are supposed to protect the citizens, are now damaging property. They are no different from ruffians.          
	Yours faithfully,

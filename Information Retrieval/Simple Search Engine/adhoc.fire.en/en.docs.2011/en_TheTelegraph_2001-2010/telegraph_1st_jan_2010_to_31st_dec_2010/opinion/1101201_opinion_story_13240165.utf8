                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LEAKING TRUTHS                                                    
	Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, the father of modern diplomacy, must be having a quiet laugh in the Valhalla for diplomats. His 20th century apostle, the redoubtable Henry Kissinger, one can be certain, is also hugely amused. The reason for their mirth is not difficult to fathom. It relates to the discovery that in the course of diplomacy, some people said one thing in public and another in private and that the actions and words of diplomats often did not match. This discovery follows the revelations of what in the parlance has come to be known as WikiLeaks. The principal victim of the coming to light of a treasure trove of secret diplomatic despatches emanating from Washington DC is said to be the world of diplomacy and the trust embedded in it. Historians would have had to wait 30 years to read these despatches but thanks to information technology (some would say from its abuse), contemporary history can be written from current archives. That apart, it appears to be a brouhaha over a trifle. What the leaks reveal is that diplomats by and large were doing exactly what they are supposed to do, what they are trained to do: finding out about officers in the diplomatic corps of other countries and advancing the interests of their own countries. When have diplomats done more or less than this? Since when have diplomatic exchanges become transactions based on trust? Economy with the truth has always been an integral part of the delicate art of diplomacy; to speak the truth is to be undiplomatic.        
	It could be argued, of course, that even in diplomatic circles or in statesmanship, matters need not be conducted under the shroud of lies and half truths. It could even be said that most diplomatic endeavours tend to end as failures or fiascos because they tinker too much with facts and the reality. Perhaps the lesson from WikiLeaks is that in todays world, where very little remains secret  where important and confidential files can be accessed by a computer whizkid  it is best to be truthful and upfront. Diplomacy would stand a better chance of success if all the cards were put face up on the negotiating table. This might sound utopian but that is better than being made to look ridiculous and untruthful, and then to bemoan the passing of trust in diplomacy. The world has changed but diplomacy hasnt; the leaks might force diplomats to be more in line with present reality.

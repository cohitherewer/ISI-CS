	No one would have worried if the Left Front kept digging its own grave ever deeper when faced with the possibility of defeat. But with the crooked destructiveness of a baffled monster, it seeks also to sabotage the future of youngsters when threatened. The West Bengal panchayat board of education bill, in spite of being referred to a standing committee after protests in July, is apparently unstoppable. It has been passed with the state governments usual aggressive lan. If it becomes a law, the state panchayat department will be running close to 20,000 rural schools with 18 lakh students in a system parallel to that of the states Madhyamik board. The Centre had directed that rural schools under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan be looked after jointly by the state school boards and panchayats, to ensure that children studied till they were 14. So these shiksha kendras end at Class VIII. Other states have solved the problem of bottlenecks at the entrance of Class IX by building more schools. The Left Front government pleads an empty treasury as excuse not to build new schools. Instead, the proposed law will let the panchayat department just add two classes to the kendras. The parallel system would ease the Madhyamik board of its heavy burden, runs another pious excuse.        
	But no excuse will do. To condemn one group of children in the state to an education system not overlooked by experts and not run by teachers recruited under the state education board rules is criminal irresponsibility. If rural children cannot make it to Madhyamik schools that is probably because the Left Fronts bone-headed experimentation with English has left thousands of students, who are now teachers in villages, bereft of some essential teaching tools. Is West Bengal really the only state too poor to build new schools? Or are the children being condemned to inferior education because the Left Front needs the votes of 55,000 teachers whose jobs will be regularized and pay-scales revised under the new board? A new board with two new classes in every school, all under the auspices of the panchayat department, would mean jobs for friends of the Left, if not the return of some who have changed sides. It is terrifying to think what rural children will learn henceforth, and how ruthlessly they will be pushed out of the Indian mainstream. The Left Front has always used education as a vote-getting tool; this time the front may have struck it a death-blow.

	Sensible plan                  
	Sir  Kapil Sibal seems to have brought some sanity to Indias wayward system of education. A common syllabus in mathematics and the sciences at the secondary level, and an all-India entrance test for professional courses are crucial for our times (Task cut out for single test, Feb 17). But it would have been even better if there was a common syllabus for the professional courses as well. The ministry of human resource development can perhaps persuade the Central, state and deemed universities to outline a uniform course for streams such as medicine, engineering and management at the undergraduate level. For specialized training, some leeway can be given to each university so that it may offer its students elective subjects in the final year.          
	Also, each of the courses should have a common name applicable throughout India. A uniform grading system for both external and internal assessments could be evolved. Not just academics but also professionals in the fields of science, engineering and so on must be called upon to set the syllabus, which must be reviewed after every three or four years. Unscrupulous people, who masquerade as educationalists and ruin the formative years of our youth, should be barred from offering degrees to students.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune

                
	Sir  The Medical Council of India had mooted the idea of a common entrance test for MBBS aspirants all over India some time back. Prestigious institutes like the IIMs and the IITs already hold common entrance examinations. Such tests ensure that the process of admission to all engineering and medical courses remains free of malpractices, which are often reported in private medical and dental colleges.          
	While a common entrance test and a core curriculum for science and mathematics will ensure uniform evaluation, an effort must also be made to improve the quality of the curriculum. Welfare of the students should be foremost in the mind of the members of the taskforce that would be responsible for implementing Kapil Sibals plans. Merit must be rewarded. To make this initiative truly a milestone in the history of education, as Sibal has described his recent set of proposals, all problems must be sorted out at the state level. Implementing changes of such magnitude require both will and resources.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Padmini Raghavendra, Secunderabad

                
	Health hazards          
	Sir  The controversy over Bt brinjal continues and its fate remains uncertain, as Malvika Singh points out in Return to roots (Feb 19). The Congress is supporting Jairam Rameshs decision to withhold the introduction of Bt brinjal in the market despite the fact that politicians such as Sharad Pawar and Prithviraj Chavan have rooted for genetically modified crops. Ramesh must be congratulated for taking a cautious and principled approach by imposing a moratorium on the release of the transgenic brinjal hybrid developed by Mahyco, a subsidiary of the global seed giant, Monsanto. This decision comes after months of public consultations in seven cities, and after the widespread protests against the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, which gave the clearance to Bt brinjal in October 2009.          
	Members of the scientific community are yet to decide whether or not it is viable to produce Bt brinjal commercially. Their confusions stem from the fact that 10 major brinjal-producing states opposed the move to introduce Bt brinjal in India. Apart from this, the safety and testing processes are still under a shadow of doubt. The lack of a global precedent for this product has made it even more difficult to take a call on this matter.          
	While debating the pros and cons of introducing Bt brinjal, we should be mindful of the untold damage GM crops can do to health, and of American multinational companies that are eager to tap the Indian market. Wide varieties of brinjal are produced in India, and the problem is often of plenty rather than of shortage. Any new move should be aimed at protecting the indigenous seed varieties.           
	As Singh says, people who are supporting Bt brinjal are precisely those who buy organic products because it is fashionable to do so. They do not pause to ponder before imposing inorganic crops such as Bt brinjal on unsuspecting citizens.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir It is unfortunate that Siripuram Yadagiri, the student of Osmania University who tried to immolate himself for the cause of a separate Telangana, succumbed to his burn injuries in a hospital in Hyderabad (Osmania student sets himself on fire, Feb 21). Politicians have unnecessarily dragged the student community into their agitation. Students are least likely to benefit if a separate state of Telangana is carved out of Andhra Pradesh. The political community, on the other hand, has much to gain.          
	The Telangana issue has taken an ugly turn. A few days ago, some members of the Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly had resigned from their posts in protest against the Centres recommendation to consider a united Andhra. Why not impose presidents rule in the state till the situation improves?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	Erratum          
	In the review, In deaths other kingdom (Feb 19), the publisher of the book, A Great Ball in China and My Little Taizhou, was inadvertently named Tranquebar. Tranquebar is not associated with the book. The error is regretted.           
	 The Editor

	It never rains but it pours when it comes to Tagore songs celebrating the monsoon. A clich? Yes, if ever there was one. Come the months of Ashadh and Shravan  the period feted as the bringer of life into the parched summer earth  and the songster in every Bengali comes forth with the zest, if not the inspiration, of a dancing peacock. Not a bad thing in itself, considering Tagores rain songs are wonderfully evocative of the rhythm, beauty and varied moods of the season. In fact, in seasons such as the current one, when the monsoon has decidedly come a cropper, they keep the spirit up. Only, many of the songs, worn out by over-use, fatigue the senses instead of bringing ecstasy and longing into the arid heart.        
	Fortunately, Samarohas Barsha Utsab at Madhusudan Mancha was not an assault on the ears the way many such events are. Which is not to say that the evening didnt have its lows. Sathi Dasguptas Aaji godhuli lagoney and Megher koley koley jaye re choley, for instance, left plenty to be desired. Arunava Biswass recitation of the poem, Durdin, lacked the verve it demanded.        
	It was left to people like Achin Mukhopadhyay to liven up the proceedings. While his renditions of Esho go jwele diye jao and Kichhu bolbo bole eshechhilem were appropriately romantic, Mukhopadhyay infused Jetey jetey ekla pothey with the energy and drama it called for. Although oft-heard, the last acquired freshness in his engaging interpretation. Somdatta Bandopadhyays Badol meghey madol baajey might have been better, although she recovered sufficiently in the wonderfully atmospheric Chhaya ghanaichhey bonay bonay to make it one of the high points of the evening. Suchhana Ghoshs Shyamal chhaya naiba geley and Aamar din phuralo were rendered with practised ease. Her gayaki would certainly please purists.        
	Arjun Chakraborty, who took the stage with his mentor, Swagatalakshmi Dasgupta (picture), was distinctly out of his depth in Badolo diner prothom kadam phul. One wishes he wouldnt pronounce the ph in phul rather jarringly like the English f, for theres no f sound in the Bengali language! However, Chakraborty salvaged his performance in Bohu juger opaar hotey ashadh, singing it with the utmost confidence and feeling. His pronunciation of the last consonant in ashadh was commendable.        
	Swagatalakshmis Shrabaner paboney aakul bishonno shandhyay, a not-so-oft-heard number, was tonally rich and introspective, while her Krishnakali ami taarei boli highlighted the striking imagery of the incomparable ballad. It was left to Sriradha Bandopadhyay to conclude the programme. Not a pedigreed singer of Rabindrasangeet  Bengali adhunik numbers being her forte  Sriradha sang tunefully but without insight. And not all her numbers were rain-songs either. A more fitting ending might have raised the bar of the evening.

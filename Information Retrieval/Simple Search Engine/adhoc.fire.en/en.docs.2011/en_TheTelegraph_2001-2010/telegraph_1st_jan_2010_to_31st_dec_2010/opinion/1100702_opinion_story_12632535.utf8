                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME UP                                                    
	Mountains of dusty old files with the babu nodding off in their midst is the official image of the Indian bureaucracys eternal lunch-hour. Time stands still in the great halls of state and so does the business of life for most ordinary Indians, causing varying degrees of bother, from the annoying to the fatal. All this is now set to change with the rigours of e-governance, which promises to be at once swish and stern. The new file tracking system is web-based and will record, beyond tweaking, the exact dates and times when files are sent and received from one department to another. This does not bode well for slowness and siestas, and what is most alarming is that all bureaucrats would have to take examinations on operating this system. If they fail to get the minimum marks they will be officially told off in their reports.        
	There is a happy vengefulness with which the ordinary Indian, and hapless victim of post-lunch babudom, would receive this piece of news. What is unfortunate is how it reduces everybody  babus and victims  to a schoolboy-like juvenility. It is unpleasant, and vaguely humiliating, to have to sit tests, fail or pass, and get rapped on the knuckles for failing, after the end of natural studenthood. And it is sad when a mature nations qualified bureaucrats have to be disciplined by such regressive means. The question remains, though, whether such a yoke will radically alter a slothful disposition (and sloth is not the only problem), and whether the test itself will become part of a new babudom. Perhaps the government will have to go beyond its schoolroom tactics, however understandable and even amusing they might be, and think more self-critically and from first principles. Perhaps a more substantial answer lies in trimming down the paraphernalia (some of it human and some infrastructural) of babudom. The endless labyrinths and hierarchies of bureaucracy  Dickenss Circumlocution Office many times over  is best treated like a bad colonial practical joke. The time has come for a more strict and spare system that would reduce the coils and clutter of bureaucracy, and automatically make its members sit up and get things going. This should be a human, rather than a cyber, solution. And it must strike more than fear in the babus hearts. It is not a very happy democracy that is run by a set of frightened schoolchildren.

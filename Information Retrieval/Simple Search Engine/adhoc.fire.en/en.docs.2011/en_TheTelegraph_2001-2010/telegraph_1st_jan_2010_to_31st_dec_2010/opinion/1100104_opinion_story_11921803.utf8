                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Absent hour                  
	Sir  It is a matter of shame that our elected representatives not only attend Parliament irregularly but also remain absent during question hour (Sonia sends show-up signal to truant MPs, Dec 2). Such absenteeism is a slap on the face of our democracy. However, it is heartening to note that the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, has expressed her strong displeasure and directed partymen to be present during question hour in Parliament. Her directive is a fitting response, and she deserves to be lauded by the people of India. Every political party should take strong measures to check this malpractice for the sake of our democracy.          
	On some occasions, as a result of mass absenteeism, the Speaker has been forced to adjourn a session for the want of quorum. Political parties should earmark at least 70 per cent attendance for a sitting MP for him to be eligible for tickets to future elections. Such a rule should also be applicable to the nominated members of both the Houses.The period of absence should be recorded, and it should be taken into consideration while deciding whether an MP deserves to be given a party ticket. The people of India will remain grateful not only to Sonia Gandhi but also to the other political leaders if they were to take the necessary steps to maintain the sanctity of Parliament.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  In an unprecedented incident, question hour was suspended recently due to the absence of a large number of parliamentarians. This is certainly a mockery of parliamentary etiquette. This colossal waste of precious time by the elected representatives of the people is undesirable. It is imperative that a provision be made to penalize a parliamentarian for skipping question hour. The penalty may be in the form of the deduction of his daily-allowance for that day. The errant member of parliament can also be barred from asking questions for the rest of his elected term. In the absence of such measures, it will be impossible to prevent such occurrences from taking place in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Close ties          
	Sir  Russia should feature more prominently on India s foreign policy map (Gorshkov deal buzz, Dec 7). The civilian nuclear deal that was signed recently is a step towards further cementing the close ties between the two nations. India should look to carve out a niche in the Indian Ocean region by developing strong ties with the other Asian nations as well. The West, of late, has shown some interest in entering into an alliance with India. India has not rebutted its offer either. There is also a case for India to strengthen its ties with the European Union, especially as the United States of America has shown repeatedly that it tends to put its own interests over and above those of bilateralism. Indias joint trade account with Russia is quite impressive. When it comes to military cooperation, no other country is suited to serve Indias interests better than Russia.          
	However, it is time that the Indian diplomats in the foreign policy establishment attached some importance to Japan. India and Japan have signed security treaties in the recent past, and the latter can be counted upon as a reliable ally if India is to stamp its authority in the Indian Ocean region.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Ugly truth          
	Sir  In the last three decades, I have travelled extensively across all major cities in India . During this time, I have noticed that roads are being widened in most of these places. For example, Hyderabad did not have broad stretches earlier, but today narrow roads are a thing of the past in that city. In Calcutta, however, the opposite seems to be true. Over the years, VIP Road has become narrow as a result of encroachment, and The Telegraph has been reporting on this growing menace. The ills that have been plaguing VIP Road have now befallen the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. Recently, I saw a diameter pipeline being laid along the eastern side of the Bypass. Some structures resembling bridges had also been erected at some places on the Bypass. The nature of these constructions made it evident that the authorities do not envisage broadening the road. The huge contraptions are ugly to look at. Besides, they also prohibit travellers from having an unrestricted view of the wide open spaces on the Bypass. In the future, if new roads are planned on the Bypass, these structures are likely to adversely affect their layout.          
	Unfortunately, there is no master plan for Calcutta yet. Instead of making the city appear beautiful, the authorities are busy building unattractive flyovers, such as the one near Chingrighata, that add to the prevailing chaos. The city can only improve with the help of dedicated efforts that aim at managing existing resources in a more profitable manner.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Bravehearts          
	Sir  Even as we sit soaking in the warmth of a new year, our thoughts go out to the soldiers deployed in inhospitable terrains to repulse the threat of terrorism. Indians should gratefully acknowledge the services being rendered by the defence personnel, who are unrelenting in their strict vigil, be it on land, on water or from the skies.          
	The gallant personnel of the army, air force and navy should be recognized as people who have dedicated their lives to secure the lives and the honour of their countrymen. May they return home, in good time, to a joyous reunion with their family members. Indians should justifiably be proud of every defence personnel.          
	Yours faithfully,

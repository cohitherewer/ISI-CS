	From the moment it was approved by the United States of Americas Food and Drug Administration in May 1960, no one called it Enovid; it was always the pill. Half-a-century later, altered in dosage and various in name, it is still the pill, evoking in its monosyllabic generality all the expectant magic associated with apparently miraculous modern medicine. The naming is also reticent, befitting its use. It was not polite, even in the 1960s, to talk publicly about the means married women may take to space out their pregnancies. This was why the pill was initially approved, with an eye on means to check a burgeoning population. But with such a magical tool to hand, single women were not about to wait. What was truly miraculous about the pill was that it opened up for women a route to sexual and reproductive autonomy, giving them a taste of freedom that accorded perfectly with the feminist movement of the time.        
	But in so doing, the pill affected social attitudes, conventional ideas of morality, religion and culture in unprecedented ways. Only women felt its real magic, although many had to pay. The percentage of hormones in the earliest pill could be dangerous to health, and did cause blood clots, high pressure and worse. The dosage has changed over the years, but certain risks to health do crop up from time to time, resulting in court cases. Yet, today, women whose religions do not forbid contraception cannot imagine life without the pill (although there is a vast section to whom this easy way out of misery is still not accessible). The pill, now in its third generation, has been spawning variants, all as controversial as the pill once was. Much in the news now is the morning after pill. To the horror of those who were convinced that the pill would encourage women to be promiscuous, the morning after pill seems to be reassuring those who are not just promiscuous but careless as well. But no amount of condemnation will dent the gratitude of thousands of women who have been able to control, sometimes secretly, their own fertility, have had their menstruation regulated, have been able to work and enjoy themselves, and to expand their space in arenas such as sports because of the pill.        
	But magic has its darker sides. With the coming of the pill, the woman became saddled with the entire responsibility of contraception, while the man happily gave up the condom. Freedom with responsibility is perfectly justified, but in the context of skewed gender relations, the responsibility could become a new burden. It was only with a rude and painful shock, the coming of HIV and AIDS, that the need for the condom was again acknowledged. But as the pill turns 50 on Mothers Day, it may be beginning to lose its sheen, as more women start looking for non-hormonal means of contraception.

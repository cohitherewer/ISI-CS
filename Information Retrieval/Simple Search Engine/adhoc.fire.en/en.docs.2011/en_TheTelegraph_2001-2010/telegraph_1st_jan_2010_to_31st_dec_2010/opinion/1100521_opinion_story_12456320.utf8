	Firm friends                  
	Sir  The Pakistani connection in the case of the attempted attack on New Yorks Times Square has become increasingly evident (US delivers blunt message to Pak, May 10). With Pakistan-born Faisal Shahzad implicated in the attack, the Pentagon should lose no time in sending emergency supplies of advanced and sophisticated arms to the beleaguered rulers of the theocratic State. This would be perfectly in keeping with the oft-repeated stand of White House mandarins that the Islamic country badly requires military aid to fight the scourge of terrorism on its soil.          
	If the need arises, Washington could even consider transferring nuclear-weapons technology to Indias peace-loving neighbour in the subcontinent. Such a revolutionary step on the part of the superpower would surely serve as a deterrent to future terror strikes.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In the wake of the recent unsuccessful terror attack in New York, the secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has warned Pakistan of severe consequences if it failed to contain terror. However, if Pakistan chooses not to take heed of the warning, what steps does the United States of America propose to take against its most trusted ally in Asia? Is it possible that they will consider operations similar to those undertaken in Afghanistan? The government might even order the US air force to intensify aerial strikes on terrorist hideouts in the country.          
	The terrorist camps, run by Islamic militants, are being covertly funded to the tune of billions of dollars. These funds are received not only from the oil-rich Arab countries, but probably also siphoned off from the military aid given to Pakistan by the Americans themselves.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	End of an era          
	Sir  The death of the former vice-president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, at the age of 87, marked the end of an era in Indian politics (Limitless ambition, limited liberal thrust, May 16). He was one of the founding pillars of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, which later became the Bharatiya Janata Party. In his distinguished career, Shekhawat headed three governments in Rajasthan, between 1977-1980, 1990-1992 and 1993-1998. He then went on to become vice-president of the country.           
	As Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pointed out, it was Shekhawats exceptional courage of conviction which led him to condemn the 1982 Deorala incident of Sati at a time when few in his party and State were willing to speak out against it. I once met the vice-president at his residence in New Delhi, accompanied by a friend from Rajasthan. His simplicity and plainspeaking made an indelible impression on me. His death has been a great loss for the nation, especially for its poverty-stricken millions.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  The nation recently lost a distinguished personality who commanded respect and influenced leaders from various political parties. This became evident when he was voted to the position of vice-president with an overwhelming majority by the electoral college in 2002. However, Shekhawat was also persistent in his efforts to become president and insisted on standing for the post in the year 2007, when he lost to his rival candidate, the current president of India, Pratibha Patil.          
	Yours faithfully,        Subhash Chandra Agrawal,Dariba, Delhi                    
	Good job          
	Sir  Nitish Kumars reign seems to have heralded the return of peace and order to Bihar (Gamble on new Bihari card, May 10). Public memory might be short, but it is not easy to forget the Bihar that existed even five years ago. In those chaotic times, corporate concerns were reluctant to do business in Bihar or set up bases there. Mob attacks were a matter of routine. When Nitish Kumar came to power in 2005, he signalled the start of a new era. The economic condition of the state has also improved, with more entrepreneurs willing to invest in Bihar. Destructive tactics of caste politics seem to have been set aside. Under the preceding governments, many projects were not completed for years, prompting the misappropriation of funds allotted to them. These problems have been addressed. Given the wonders he has worked for the state, it is only right that Nitish Kumar should be voted to power for a second tenure.                    
	Yours faithfully,

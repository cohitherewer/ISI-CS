The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Return to Misery
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RETURN TO MISERY                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	There was a time when homecoming was joyous, but circa 2010, when the rulers of India are chasing a mythical rate of growth, a return to the homeland is traumatic, to say the least. There are no norms, no set standards, no enforcement of laws, nothing. A passenger bus that should be banned from appearing on any tarmac, anywhere, arrives to ferry those returning on an international flight. It rattles and shakes, stops and brakes, much like a remnant from the 1940s. This is something our leaders never ever experience since all rules and norms are broken with impunity by the cohorts of that strange breed called VIPs. Frankly, all the VIPs of New Delhi should be put in similar buses and taken for an eight-hour drive around the capital city of this supposedly emerging power.         
	It was a theatre of the absurd at its best when the Left and the Bharatiya Janata Party held hands firmly  dancing to the same tune  to paralyse the country in the belief that prices will fall as the tune plays out and the song is sung through the symbolic gesture of courting arrest. The predictable cast of one woman in a carefully selected handloom sari and a larger-than-life bindi  signifying a married Indian housewife burdened with spiralling prices, living in a posh Delhi colony  and endless men leading the charge left ordinary Indians gaping in disbelief. It is tragic that this lot continues to operate in a complete vacuum, with no interest at all in solving the crisis that confronts this nation. Their staid, token protests in the form of bandhs, adjournments of Parliament and suchlike are becoming difficult to accept. The protests reflect their ineptitude and inability to come up with real solutions. Our collective leadership is utterly uninspired and intellectually incompetent.                
	Without shame        
	The disappearance of ethics and integrity, the unending violation of laws, and the non-enforcement of the prevailing rules by administrators are becoming permanent boulders on the path of growth. Ironically, rate of growth is the excuse that is cited to break the law as the other gains are large and lucrative. The natural environment is being ravaged ruthlessly because of unprecedented avarice. The people cannot be fooled any longer.         
	Construction takes place without environmental clearances, and when it is stalled because of that, those wanting to observe the law are attacked. Someone has to bell the corrupt cat, and although we can see the beginnings of change in this realm, the existence of a political will is necessary to alter the course of the river of corruption. Both the government and the party need to speak emphatically in the same language and demand adherence to ethics and to the law.         
	In India, politics is not about service but about making money. In the administrative service, the babu, who is becoming increasingly insecure within the growing reality of specialized professionalism, only stalls change and growth in an effort to protect his immediate domain. When you have the opportunity to meet the chairman of the Victoria and Albert Museum and are able to compare him with the senior-most official in Indias culture ministry, you realize how desperately unlucky we are to have culture ruled by the babu. We are crippling the sensitivity and humane commitment of Indians to their civilization.         
	Social disorder has also raised its ugly head. It always does, when careless governance gets embedded in the landscape. The top leaders of India must forcefully denounce the khap panchayats diktats. These inexplicable scandals are being ignored by the enforcement authorities and have reduced India to the base level of a shameless society.

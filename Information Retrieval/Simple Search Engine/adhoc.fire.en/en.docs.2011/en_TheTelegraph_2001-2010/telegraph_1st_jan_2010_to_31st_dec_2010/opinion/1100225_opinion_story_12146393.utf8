	A peace process is rarely a smooth affair, but right intentions can take care of the rough edges. It may be too early to hope for an end to the United Liberation Front of Asoms 30-year-old insurgency. But a real opportunity for peace in Assam seems to be emerging with the government and the rebel group moving closer to peace talks. The Assam governments decision to allow two top Ulfa leaders, Pradip Gogoi and Mithinga Daimary, to be released on bail is a welcome move that could help set the stage for fresh peace talks. The move comes close on the heels of the governments other decision to shift the outfits political advisor, Bhimkanta Buragohain, from Tezpur jail to Guwahati central jail. The idea, apparently, was to facilitate meetings among the Ulfas senior leaders. It may be some time before the Ulfa leaders sort out differences among themselves about resuming the talks.        
	The chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, has rightly argued that the government cannot wait forever. But the important thing is not to lose the initiative and the opportunity. The biggest hurdle to the peace process is the continued opposition to it by Paresh Barua, the chief of the Ulfas armed wing, who remains elusive. His defiance increasingly looks like an act of desperation. The Ulfa faces serious challenges to its organizational network after several of its leaders were arrested in Bangladesh and its shelters in that country exposed. Its support among the people has also dropped as never before. It may still spark some violence, but that is now no measure of its power or popular appeal. If this is the worst time for the Ulfa to make war, this is also the best opportunity for it to make peace.

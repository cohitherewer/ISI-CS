	Since the age of European expansion, Europe has been the continent with which Indians are most familiar. The European Union, a transnational decentralized federal construct of 27 nations and nearly 500 million people, making great progress towards a common space for goods, people and services, common standards, a common currency, and espousing values such as democracy and the rule of law, was a role model for other organizations around the world. With a combined gross domestic product of $18 trillion, it ranks above the United States of America and is our leading economic partner. Yet, at this time of Europes greatest crisis, there is no attention given to it by the Indian media.        
	Even before the global recession, Europeans had begun contemplating the adjustments that would be needed in this century owing to the rise of Asia. With the largest concentration of world population, concerns over terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, unsolvable inter-state and would-be state problems and imminent conflicts, abject poverty, food shortages and climate change, the phrase Asian century is a misnomer for a continent that enjoys neither political nor commercial unity, and neither does it have any common security agenda. Its few multilateral structures are weak, and governance varies from dystopia and communism to liberal democracy. Nevertheless, internationalists must note the spectacular economic growth in certain parts of Asia, with the benefits of low-cost labour, large territory and resources and rapidly growing infrastructure and technology. The locus of new demand and spending power will shift to the emerging economies, especially in Asia, and per capita disparity will imply exceptional price sensitivity in the Asian market with its fallout on production, outsourcing, investment, pricing and marketing influencing the future shape of European industry.              
	The EUs ambitions for an innovative dynamic economy necessitate the establishment of internal economic reforms and new decision-making structures to pursue appropriate policies at a time when it is beset by other multiple preoccupations: ageing populations, fiscal problems including the extent of regulation, economic slowdown, ailing health services, failing pension schemes, and debating the vaguely-defined European social model as opposed to so-called Anglo-Saxon forms of global competitive capitalism. Other challenges are the need for coherent internal governance, further rounds of enlargement, financial solidarity in an asymmetric economy, the political and military profile, immigration issues, management of diversity, use of biofuels, and normative and moral issues like biotechnology. When the current economic crisis is over, those concerns will remain and, despite being the most powerful and unified association of independent states ever devised, the EU confronts multiple dilemmas.        
	EU governments have been living on loans representing large percentages of the national GDP. The amortization of these borrowings will add to the burden of public services that are too large a proportion of the total economy, which has reduced the incentives for responsible consumption. Funding the welfare state at these levels will no longer be possible unless the economy grows bigger. Despite stringent rules in principle, fiscal discipline has not always been achieved even in good times, and the next generation of governments will have to face their electorates with these realities.        
	Recession can no longer be considered an exclusively American problem, and the EUs recovery is extremely fragile. The euro zone was established after countries like Germany and France abandoned currencies that were expressions of their national identity, but there is now acute stress on the euro system, focused on Greece, which, after a decade of low interest rates, wage inflation and spending and property booms, needs to raise 50 billion euros in public debt this year with a budget deficit of 13 per cent of GDP (the euro zone limit is three per cent) and a national debt of 120 per cent of GDP. It is guilty of falsifying its eligibility criteria data to join the euro and of widespread tax-evasion, but warnings are also out on Ireland, Spain, and Portugal. Iceland, not in the EU, is already a declared defaulter. California, with a bigger economy than Greece, has long been living beyond its means, but its deficit is underwritten by the US federal government and the taxpayer. Unless the euro zone taxpayer is willing to bite a similar bullet, the EU will be revealed as having no economic or fiscal strategy. The crisis shaking Greece and driving down the value of the euro shows how solidarity still stops at national borders as public opposition to rescuing Greece mounts  including as many as two-thirds of the German population, which has recently undergone Lutheran-austerity salary freezes and reduction of welfare benefits. But the chaos that would occur in financial markets if Greece were to be expelled from the euro zone is more frightening than the wrath of voters. If Greece defaults, it will make lenders wary of lending to any government, and all of them need to borrow. So when Greece gets bailed out by member states, it must undergo a period of economic reforms and monitored belt-tightening that has already triggered social and industrial unrest.        
	It is the political dimension that will define the EU as a meaningful international player. Its experience in Iraq and Afghanistan shows that, while it may be respected for conflict resolution and peace building within Europe, it is neither an actual nor potential political or military force with geo-strategic capabilities outside Europe. Operations in Afghanistan are hugely controversial domestically, and apart from Britain, coalition members have taken pains to provide the minimum contingents deployed as far away as possible from the front line. Even so, the Dutch government has fallen on the issue of extending its Afghan commitment, and others will be anxiously watching their voting public for signs of greater unease.        
	In terms of hard economic or military power, Europe cannot aspire to a major role in shaping world events, and the abundance of soft power generated by its various constituents has been impossible to replicate at the pan-EU level. It will have to compete in an ever-stiffer contest for raw materials in the coming decades. Its present dependence on energy imports make it vulnerable, as the extent of its self-sufficiency is steeply declining. By 2030, the production of oil and gas within the EU is expected to decline by 73 per cent and 59 per cent respectively, and at least two-thirds of its requirements will thereafter have to be met by imports.        
	The EUs fertility rate is expected to continue falling with a drop in working age population, and no member country has the 2.1 birth-rate per female that is needed to keep the population stable. One- third of the population will be 65 or above by 2050. By 2050, average EU GDP growth is likely to be around 1.25 per cent and its share of world product is expected to fall from about 30 per cent now to 10 per cent. Contrary to current public opinion in Europe, a strategically calculated enlargement, more legal immigration, and increased flexibility in the workplace including an increase in the retirement age, may prove essential for future economic competitiveness.              
	The labour pool in the Arab world will increase by over 100 million in two decades and that of sub-Saharan Africa by 250 million. The consequences of these demographics are causes of great concern to Europe, though it will require a measure of controlled immigration to enhance productivity. Many migrant communities in Europe remain marginalized, and despite the rousing speeches of politicians extolling tolerance, are considered a burden rather than a source of positive contribution. The problem concerns the authority of the secular state and its impact on religious minorities in general and Muslims in particular. The latter number 16 million or three per cent of the EU population. Only a new settlement between the member states and religion can successfully incorporate the growing religious minorities in Europe. The EU has to redefine its attitude to Islam, the Arab world and Muslim immigration, since Islam has become Europes second largest religion.        
	Many nations have enjoyed rising living standards despite budget deficits, appreciating currencies, high interest rates, high wages, periods of labour shortage and limited natural resources: the stock of factors at any time is less important than the way in which they are created and upgraded. Whether the recovery is V- or W-shaped, the EU will eventually emerge from recession to remain a major contributor to world economy, with its external relations based on normative values. But it has a packed and controversial domestic agenda to deal with first, and its biggest challenge will be to stay united.

	Many years ago, after a sleepless night in Rome, I took shelter along the Spanish Steps to doze off while soaking in the drama of the city  its bustle, noise and smell. Going down the Steps, as one turns left, a small tablet stares at you, stating simply that John Keats died in that dingy room. The web of our Life is of mingled Yarn, wrote the young poet, quoting Shakespeare, in a letter to Benjamin Bailey in 1817. I became a solitary seeker of the webs of lives of the three great 19th-century Romantic poets, Byron, Keats and Shelley. The webs are made of delicate threads, about to snap any moment, yet somehow managing to survive.  
	Their stories are well known. Daisy Hay does not make the mistake of writing a biography of the poets  this has been done many times. Instead, she explores the interlinked, sometimes even interlocked, lives of these poets. All of them died beyond the shores of England  Byron in Greece, Shelley drowned tragically in Italy, and Keats died of tuberculosis in Rome. The first two had to flee England after charges of immorality were brought against them. Keats was relatively sober.        
	The younger generation of Romantic poets loved one another as much they loved their women. They lived intensely not only for their ideals but also for romance, blood, sex  sympathetic yet often cruel, kind but fiercely competitive. And so they created their own brand of English, timeless and ageless.        
	Lord Byron always had a pose; legend has it that he used to bathe in the Trinity College fountain with his pet bear, since dogs were not allowed. Restrictions or not, Byron would never have settled for such a middle class pet as a dog. Shelleys boat  the one that capsized, resulting in his death  probably had the name, Don Juan, painted on the mainsail as a tribute to Byron.         
	The common bond between the poets was the journalist, Leigh Hunt. Hay splendidly depicts Hunts role in bringing the three Romantics closer. Hunt was a man of great character, a sort of Cyril Conolly of the early 19th century. He was never a creative writer but a collector of the greatest poets of the time, whom he proceeded to examine in the columns of his journal, The Examiner.        
	Hays book is full of spicy gossip  gossips about intrigues, entangled love affairs, and at times, deceit. Here is one description of the kind of life the poets led in Italy: The men rode and shot, gathered for dinner parties at Byrons Palazzo Lanfranchi. Byron, usually getting up after midday, breakfasted with Shelley, and both galloped to day-long shoots with silver coins as targets. They dined together and talked late into the nights. When Shelley retired, Byron, armed with a bottle of wine, proceeded to work till four in the morning. Shelleys Queen Mab and Byrons Don Juan came out of these hedonistic sessions.         
	One might ask how this reviewer, a scientist by profession, can dare to comment on the Romantics. The answer is Shelley. Shelleys attitude to science was the very opposite of that of Wordsworth. He loved science, and never tired of incorporating it in his poetry. It symbolized joy, peace and enlightenment for him, as the poem, Cloud, or the play, Prometheus Unbound, would prove. When I came first across the extraordinarily powerful and beautiful Cloud, I immediately fell for it.        
	Young Romantics is a treat. If not moving, it is inspiring. But in the end, one simply drowns oneself in limitless melancholia  Byronic?                    BIKASH SINHA

	Q: I had taken a housing loan from a bank in 2006. Subsequently, I was diagnosed with cancer and, at present, I am undergoing chemotherapy. Since I am not earning now, I requested a waiver of interest on the loan, but to no avail. I had insured the loan amount too. With a three-year-old child and a dependent wife, I am in acute financial trouble. What options do I have now?  
	Sanjay Gupta, Calcutta  
	A: Since you have insured the loan amount, after your demise your heirs will be able to pay off the principal loan amount to the bank, making your property freehold. But as of now you have no choice but to keep paying the EMIs unless you can somehow pay off the remaining principal loan amount.  
	Q:When I booked a flat, the plan showed one meter room, one guards room and an open space. Later, the promoter converted all these spaces into garages and sold them. He is also refusing to give us any drainage and water connection papers. He maintains that we do not need them. Is he right? If not, what should we do?  
	Ashwini, Calcutta  
	A: Any deviation from the original sanctioned plan would require the permission of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. If the promoter had revised the original plan to convert the rooms and open space to garages, then he has acted legally. Drainage and water connection papers are not required to be kept by you, but you must insist that the promoter gives you at least a copy of the completion certificate of the building.
    
	Q:I know that a member of a co-operative housing society may nominate any person from his or her family to the property. If a widow has a major son and a married daughter and she names the latter as her nominee, what share/interest/ value of the flat will the son have a right to after the mothers death?        
	Nilmani Mitra, Calcutta  
	A: The married daughter, being the nominee to the widow rsquo;s property, will inherit the entire property as well as the membership to the co-operative   society exclusively and absolutely after her   mother rsquo;s demise. The son will have no share whatsoever in the property since the co-operative laws in Bengal supersede the law relating to succession in this respect.

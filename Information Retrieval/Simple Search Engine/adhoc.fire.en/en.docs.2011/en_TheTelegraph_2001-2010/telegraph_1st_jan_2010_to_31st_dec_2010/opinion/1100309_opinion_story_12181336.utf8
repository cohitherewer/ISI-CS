                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        QUESTION OF HONOUR                                  MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The master painter, M.F. Husain, remains humiliated as a man, an artist, a creative spirit who cannot be contained within the stifling and parochial confines of a faulty process of what is supposed to be one of the worlds most vibrant democracies. The supreme tragedy is that the system in India only wakes up when slapped on the face in full public view. The State has, over the decades, become soft, and incompetent to protect the rights enshrined in the Constitution. The politicization of the arms of the government, the corrosion of ethics and values, the overwhelming corruption of the mind and soul are all symbolized in the recent life and times of M.F. Husain. We have behaved abominably, shamefully.        
	In the first place, there should have been no tolerance for the lumpens on the streets, and the barbaric attack on galleries and exhibitions. Destruction of property, and threats and assaults on individuals must be dealt with severely, and immediately controlled. This, unfortunately, has not been the case in India. Violence seems to be condoned by the administrative authorities, and frankly, their inability to be out in the field, in full control, without the congenital ambiguity because of untenable assumptions or illegal orders, is inappropriate and unacceptable in a federal, secular democracy. The government is mandated to deal with destructive elements in the harshest manner and it has failed to do so in this case as well as in endless others. This ineptitude in dealing with anarchic actions leaves much to be desired.                
	Head held high        
	Husain epitomizes a synthesis of Indian tradition, culture and compassion. Had he been Hindu, none of these insults would have been hurled at him. But no one wants to say so and call a spade a spade. It is the Hindu activists who are all het up, not the Hindus. Our great treatises, and the manifestations of our diverse cultures as represented in our paintings, sculpture and philosophies, cannot be vandalized by a small group with parochial agendas. Such polarized groups, which are unable to absorb the civilizational truths of this subcontinent, must be kept at bay. By allowing this destruction, the government has failed in its commitment to the Indian people. This phenomenon, which seems to have enveloped us in recent times, can be easily removed from the public domain if there is a will to do so.        
	Why, then, should an artist in his mid-nineties, who was born in India, then booted out of the country, return to this danger zone? Husain put modern Indian art on the map of the world as Ravi Shankar did with our musical traditions. How is it that Ravi Shankars experiments with Western musicians and styles did not merit similar anger? Husain has given up his Indian citizenship because he has transcended the limitations of belonging superficially, via a passport, to a civilization. His roots are here, his spirit reflects India, he is Indian. The passport is merely a document that allows a citizen of that country to cross man-made borders and enter other nations. The soul does not change.        
	The sad thing is that the Indians who left for a better life abroad, the NRIs  the Non Required Indians, in my vocabulary  are welcomed with open arms, given special status and more. They are honoured by the prime minister, ministers of the cabinet, civil servants and corporate leaders, desperately wooed with national awards for being liaison men and lobbyists, or even doctors attending to the high and the mighty. Husain stands apart from that pampered lot. He is not protected and honoured in the same way. What has triumphed in this muddle is Husain the person, the painter and his unique spirit. Three cheers to him for holding his head high and keeping his pride.

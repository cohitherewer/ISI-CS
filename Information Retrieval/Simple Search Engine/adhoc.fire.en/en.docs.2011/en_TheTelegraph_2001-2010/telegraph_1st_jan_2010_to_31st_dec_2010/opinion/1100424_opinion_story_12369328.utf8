	Owned and abused                  
	Sir  Women have always been seen as property (Inexplicable, April 19). They are the victims of the worst forms of abuse. But the news that a 26-year-old woman was burnt to death by her husband and in-laws because of obesity sends a chill down the spine. Although it seems that women have advanced a lot, actually, they are still puppets in the hands of men. The womens reservation bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha amidst a lot of hue and cry. It is to be seen whether this bill is able to end gender discrimination.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Paromita Jana, Calcutta

                
	Hidden intentions          
	Sir  The whimsical Kabir Suman seems to be up to a mischievous game. He continues to embarrass the Trinamul Congress (Suman complains to Speaker about party, April 20). Suman has lodged a complaint against the party with the Lok Sabha Speaker, Meira Kumar, alleging that the party has kept him in the dark about its plans. He has accused the party of neglecting him, and of not letting him express his views freely. But he owes his Lok Sabha victory to the TMC. The party is now confused about how to deal with its unruly member of parliament.          
	A while back, in an interview to a television channel, Suman had said that his party leaders had insulted him. He had declared in the same interview that he would like to resign from the post of an MP. But afterwards, he not only backtracked on his decision and refused to hand in a formal resignation, but also challenged Mamata Banerjee to take any action she pleases against him. Meanwhile, he continues to vent his feelings against the partys policies in public. Given this situation, how can Suman still expect Banerjee to take the risk of keeping him in the party? There are a few ways in which the party can deal with him. Since he is not in the mood to resign, one way out for the TMC might be to expel him and let him remain as an independent MP. It cannot be denied that Suman has lost much of his charisma and has fewer followers now. One wonders why Banerjee is delaying his expulsion. The longer he remains in the party, the more he will tarnish its image.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Adhip Kumar Bose, Calcutta  
	Sir  Kabir Suman should make his stand clear to his followers and to his party. After what he has said, repeatedly and in public, against the TMC, especially on corruption within the party and about the TMC insulting him, he cannot justify his continued association with it. He should resign from the party on the basis of the allegations he has made against it, without giving a chance to his supporters to think that he has a hidden agenda. Or else, he should withdraw his allegations against the TMC, and declare publicly that he was wrong. If he fails to do that, he would give the impression that he does not mind staying in the party despite the corruption and the insults.          
	Suman had said in an interview that he is not interested in being an MP anymore, and that he would like to detach himself from politics. Then what prevents him from resigning? One suspects that he is trying to take advantage of his position and tactfully retain his seat in Parliament as an independent member even if the TMC expels him. Suman has always been very vocal about his stand against the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He had even assured his supporters that he will protect them from the CPI(M)s injustices under all circumstances. Probably, this anti-CPI(M) stand is the only thread that still keeps him attached to the TMC.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Dhrubo Gupto, Mumbai

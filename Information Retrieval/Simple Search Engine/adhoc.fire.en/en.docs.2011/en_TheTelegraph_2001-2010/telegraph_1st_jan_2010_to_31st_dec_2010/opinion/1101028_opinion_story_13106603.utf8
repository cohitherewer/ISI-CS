                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MAO AND HIS USES                                  NEHA SAHAY                              
	Imagine a police commissioner in India bowing down in apology on national television! Last week, viewers saw Li Gang, the district deputy police chief of a city bordering Beijing, break down and bow low to atone for his sons misdeed. The CCTV interviewer had to help him back to his seat and give him a tissue to blow his nose.        
	What was the misdeed? Common enough in China  and in India. The drunk 22-year-old, driving a fancy car, had injured two roller-skating students, one fatally, on the campus of Hebei University, and then simply drove on to drop his girlfriend to her dormitory. However, on his way out, his car was stopped by students and security guards. He first objected to his car being scratched by the skaters, then yelled out words now commonly heard in China: Sue me if you dare! My father is Li Gang, and drove off.        
	Almost immediately, the entire episode was posted on the net. The resultant outcry probably made Li Gang appear on CCTV, promising not to shield his son. As a father, I failed. I am very sad, very guilty, very ashamed, he said. The son was arrested, a week after the incident, and charged with vehicular manslaughter, which has a maximum sentence of three years. He, too, was interviewed by CCTV in detention and broke down saying sorry.        
	The tears and the apology are being seen as a drama in which CCTV played no small part; an attempt by the father to keep his job. But even as drama, would any senior Indian policeman bow down before TV cameras? Would his son be behind bars within eight days, let alone apologize?        
	However, then onwards, the incident took a path similar to what happens in India. The Hebei University president reportedly forbade students from speaking to the police. Online forums report that he was simply returning a favour. He had been accused of plagiarizing academic papers, and Li Gang had investigated the allegation. The students, naturally, are angry, but afraid to disobey the university head.                
	Mass line        
	Meanwhile, on the net, the sentence My name is Li Gang has became a hot favourite. Three-hundred and fifty poems have been written around it. One longish one goes: The vehicle flies in the middle of the road/ My powerful parents are offsprings (sic) of this yellow earthland/ I have an ordinary face, but my father is the head of a bureau/ He is a big tree and can cover the sky with his hand, he also has mysterious power/ My father is Li Gang, the deputy head of Public Security/ A person has died and so what?/ God let my father head a bureau, my father is Li Gang.        
	Most of the poems are take-offs from the classic Thoughts in a Still Night, by the 8th-century poet, Li Bai, which everyone learns in school. The luminous moonshine before my bed/ Is thought to be the frost fallen on the ground/ I lift my head and look at the bright moon/ I lower my head and think of home. The last two lines have been changed to: I lift my head to yell at the security guard/ My father is Li Gang. Others have designed advertisements: Government official father for sale.        
	Netizens have found out that Li Gang owns five houses. They are now waiting for CCTV to interview him about them, to dig into the plagiarism charges against the university president, and finally, to give the victims parents the same space given to Li Gang.        
	Ten days after it occurred, the official news agency, Xinhua, decided to take note of the incident. It quoted one of its regular experts, a professor at the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, reminding public officials of the partys mass line: all for the masses and all relying on the masses. Mao, it seems, still has his uses.

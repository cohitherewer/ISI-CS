The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Out of the woods
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OUT OF THE WOODS                                                          
	Tiger Woods is an extraordinarily gifted golfer and athlete. He also has, from all accounts, an extraordinary private life. These two aspects should not necessarily be in conflict but for the fact that Mr Woods, thanks to his achievements on the golf course and his image makers, became an icon and an exemplar. His personality and image had a moral sheen. That polish disappeared once stories of Mr Woodss colourful private life came tumbling out of the closet. It is not as if Mr Woods is the first to have his public image tarnished by his private peccadilloes. In the sporting arena, the scandals associated with the cricketer, Shane Warne, and the footballer, David Beckham, are well known and well documented. In politics, both Bill Clinton, the former president of the United States of America, and Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, have had their philandering splashed all over the media. These revelations did not in any way hinder any of the personalities mentioned above from excelling in their chosen fields  sports or politics.        
	Mr Woods is an exception. As soon as his indiscretions and their consequences were in the public domain, he decided to withdraw from the fairway and the green and to concentrate on rebuilding his family life and his relationship with his wife. This could not have been an easy choice, since it involved giving up, albeit temporarily, the game he loves, the income he derives from that game and also the limelight that had become so much a part of his life. The fact that he was willing to sacrifice all this for his family shows that Mr Woods is a caring human being. He did not, even in these cynical times, put his ambition and money-making above his family. He recognized the pain and anguish he had caused his wife and family because of his serial deceptions. This aspect of Mr Woodss personality should not become obfuscated in the pursuit of the sordid details of his sexual activities. Mr Woods as a penitent husband and family man is also a part of his extraordinary private life.        
	This is a perspective that should be borne in mind as Mr Woods returns to the golf course. This is perhaps the best news for the game of golf, golfers and the many admirers of Mr Woods. To say that his presence on the greens has been missed would be an understatement. The game has suffered materially and otherwise. Witness the drop in viewer ratings for golf on television. The return of Mr Woods will be good for golf and for him too. Whatever has happened off the golf course cannot take away from the fact that Mr Woods is at his best when he has a club or a putter in his hands. He has already overcome his short-term setbacks. It is now appropriate that he concentrates on the long game. There is nothing that a few below the par outings will not cure. His minders and advisers should ensure that the focus remains on Mr Woods, the golfer par excellence, rather than on his larger-than-life, squeaky clean image.

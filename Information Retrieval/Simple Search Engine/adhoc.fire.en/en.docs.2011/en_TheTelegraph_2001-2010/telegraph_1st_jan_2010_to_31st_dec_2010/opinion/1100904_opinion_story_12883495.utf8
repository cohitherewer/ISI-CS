                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Still alive                  
	Sir  White paper on tribal languages (Aug 29) was startling as well as illuminating. I do not know how many languages are spoken in India, especially in the Northeast. The Unesco report states that five Indian languages have become extinct. But this is being contested by a professor of linguistics, who has pointed out that these languages are still spoken by communities that are not too large. There is no denying the fact that the report will generate considerable interest, and The Telegraph must be thanked for publishing such an important news.           
	Yours faithfully,         Dilip Kumar Kar, Jalpaiguri
                  
	Fix the game          
	Sir  One hopes that the editorial, Spoil sport (Aug 31 ), will have an impact on some sections of the population. We in India have been so infatuated with cricket that a cricketer  howsoever ill-mannered or corrupt  is treated like a demi god. Mohammed Azharuddin is a case in point. Shouldnt he have been allowed to languish in the doghouse where he lay? Today, he is an honourable member of parliament. What message has been conveyed to the people of India by this? But then, the august House is already home to quite a few others who are accused of more serious crimes.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
D.B. Chhetry, Guwahati

                
	Sir The critical comments on corrupt players, bookies and high-handed officials were most welcome. Yes, cricket was once a noble game. But today, it has been transformed into a money-making machine. South Asian cricketers are the most corrupt, and the game is nothing more than an easy conduit to unaccountable wealth. In India, we are more enthusiastic about cricket than about other games. The time has come to give other sports their due. India will prosper once the authorities and the public turn their attention to tennis, badminton, hockey, athletics and so on. Meanwhile, the cricketers who are connected with the scourge of match-fixing must be meted out exemplary punishment. If spectators start avoiding this once-noble game, it will signify the end of cricket, especially one-day cricket.           
	Yours faithfully,       
A.K. Chakraborty, Guwahati 

      
	Sir  The International Cricket Council must take preventive measure against match-fixing and spot-fixing. Such phenomena tarnish the image of the game. The ICC must also probe why Pakistani cricketers have been repeatedly involved in such malpractices. This only goes to show the poor state of affairs in the Pakistan Cricket Board. However, there is no point in banning Pakistan from international cricket.           
	The fate that befell Hansie Cronje and Mohammed Azharuddin is well known. Yet cricketers are unwilling to learn their lessons. The bookies, who lure cricketers into fixing matches, should be handed out strict punishment. Similarly, players involved in spot-fixing should be banned for life.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Pakistani cricketers are once again in the news for the wrong reason. It is quite astonishing that South Asian cricketers, who are adequately remunerated, become easy prey to the lure of money. If cricket is not exorcised of match-fixing, cricket-lovers will turn away from the game. It has long been suspected that Pakistani cricketers are involved in match-fixing. The England tour has yielded proof of their culpability. The ICC and PCB must now take steps to redeem cricket in Pakistan.          
	Yours faithfully,         Bichu Muttathara, Pune

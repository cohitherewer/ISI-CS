	Health matters                  
	SirThe Central health ministry plans to introduce a Bachelor of Rural Medicine and Surgery programme  a drastically truncated medical course which will churn out healthcare providers in just three-and-a-half years (Battle brews over barefoot doctors, Feb 3). The concept of barefoot doctors was created in communist China during the Cultural Revolution. But even China has long discarded this scheme. All over the world, a minimum of five-and-a-half years medical training is mandatory. The government claims that introducing a short-term course would generate more doctors and improve the standards of healthcare in Indian villages.          
	Meenakshi Gautham, a public health specialist, has filed a public interest litigation demanding an alternative healthcare system, arguing that all that village patients need are doctors who can treat such ailments as respiratory infections and malaria. Does she think that bona fide doctors learn to diagnose and treat common diseases without any background knowledge of anatomy, physiology and pathology? These subjects are generally taught in the first years of a medical course to build a strong foundation before the students take up their chosen areas. Lack of adequate knowledge of one or more areas of medicine in a healer can have lethal consequences for patients. The standard of medical education must not be compromised with under any circumstances.          
	The Medical Council of India supports the scheme on the ground that regular doctors refuse to work in rural areas after getting their degrees. The Indian Medical Association has vehemently opposed the idea saying that the introduction of the BRMS course would only lead to the creation of substandard doctors. Of course, one can argue that the IMA is not likely to welcome any move to increase the number of doctors as that would entail greater competing claims for the financial profits made by its members.          
	The proposed scheme is based on a misapprehension that the number of doctors is the chief criterion for maintaining a high standard of healthcare. But apart from the doctor-patient ratio, a number of other factors, including the presence of healthcare personnel and the level of infrastructure in the hospitals, determine the overall standard of medical care.          
	Healthcare in rural as well as urban India is substandard when compared with that of other developing nations. There are almost daily reports of medical negligence in hospitals and nursing homes in urban areas. Errant medical staff in India rarely face disciplinary or punitive action. Merely increasing the number of doctors will not solve the problems of this inherently flawed medical system.          
	Although the government has claimed that the new BRMS doctors would be restricted to the rural areas, one wonders how it plans to monitor the movements of the new medical personnel and prevent them from migrating to urban areas. The proposal to launch the BRMS course also reflects blatant discrimination on the part of the government against people living in villages. Article 14 of the Indian Constitution guarantees equal treatment of all citizens under the law. However, BRMS doctors, who are deemed qualified to treat patients in rural areas, will not be allowed to treat urban patients.          
	There should be incentives for qualified doctors to work in rural areas. There is no system to enforce rural healthcare service for medical graduates. Anbumani Ramadoss, the last health minister, had wanted to implement compulsory rural postings for MBBS doctors. This proposal was stalled under pressure from political groups with vested interests. Undoubtedly, the BRMS programme is a mindless political gimmick, and is likely to bring more harm than good to Indias hapless rural population.

	SirIt is a matter of concern that after 62 years of independence, a large number of villages are still bereft of basic necessities such as drinking water, roads, electricity and primary healthcare. Instead of producing swarms of half-baked doctors, the government must make it mandatory for graduating medical students to serve for a year in rural health centres. This would save patients from wrong diagnosis and wrong treatment that may prove to be fatal.          
	It is imperative that the government drops the idea of the BRMS programme immediately. Instead of holding the Commonwealth Games 2010, which will cost thousands of crores, the government could have utilized the funds for rural development and for ensuring better healthcare. The vast amount spent on the Commonwealth Games is another classic instance of the government squandering the taxpayers hard-earned money.                     
	Yours faithfully,																															A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                              Hidden passion        
	 Rahulbaba reportedly kept his date with the FIFA finals. No surprise there. During his recent visit to India, the South African president, Jacob Zuma, had invited Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to attend the finals and the closing ceremony. So Rahul was present in Johannesburg on July 11 to witness his favourite, Spain, take on the Netherlands. Accompanying him were his brother-in-law, Robert Vadra, and nephew, Raihan (Priyankas son). For some reason, the Indian embassy in Johannesburg was asked to keep this visit a secret. In Delhi, too, Rahuls office declined to comment on his South African sojourn while refusing to deny it. Apparently, a section of his think-tank felt that with the Bihar assembly polls and other political exigencies around, the young politicians love for sports, particularly for football, was not something worth flaunting. The Union civil aviation minister, Praful Patel, was at the finals as well. Having replaced the ailing Priya Ranjan Das Munshi as president of the All India Football Federation and being a member of the FIFA executive committee, Patel had better reasons to be around. He even insisted that he has attended the last five World Cup finals.                        
	 Nitin Gadkari may have been using harsh language now and then, but some leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party have not lost their sense of humour as yet. At a breakfast meeting between the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) in Patna, a senior BJP leader asked his party colleagues, Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Ravi Shankar Prasad, where they live in the city. As luck would have it, both live on Boring Road. Everyone had a good laugh. The senior leader quickly added that the name of the street had little to do with the men in question as both are reputed to be lively and witty.                            
	 Atal Bihari Vajpayees nephew, Anup Mishra, has turned highly religious. He is temple-hopping and seeking blessings from saints and seers. Until recently, he was a powerful minister in the Madhya Pradesh cabinet. But a violent incident involving some of his relatives forced him to step down. So this Vajpayee kin, with a reputation of being a fabulous host and holding court every evening, gets up early nowadays to go to the temple. Then he gets busy with long puja sessions. Even the afternoon siesta has been replaced by intense audiences with holy men. Mishra, keen to get back his job, is indeed desperately seeking the hand of god.                            
	 Another kin of a former prime minister is facing upheavals as well. Anil Shastri, son of the late Lal Bahadur Shastri, is in a defiant mood. Shastri junior, who heads the editorial board of the Congress Sandesh, the mouthpiece of the grand old party, is busy finding faults with Manmohan Singhs government on several counts. His complaints are wide-ranging: from issues such as the hike in fuel prices to the Planning Commissions interference in the infrastructure ministries. In his heart of hearts, Shastri is believed to be nursing an ambition to become the lieutenant governor of Delhi, but the current United Progressive Alliance regime is not even considering him for gubernatorial positions in any of the union territories, let alone the states. Insiders claims that Sonia Gandhi is unhappy with the way the Sandesh is being produced and is considering a complete overhaul, including the editors exit. No wonder Shastri is so restless.                            
	 Not everyone, it seems, is behaving in a wayward fashion. Take, for instance, Mayavatis health minister, Anant Kumar Mishra. Now, it is generally acknowledged that Behenji happens to be the last word in the Bahujan Samaj Party. However, the extent of her hypnotic influence was scarcely known until recently. At a meeting between state chief ministers and the Union finance minister, Mayavati had, as usual, not turned up. She sent along Mishra as her emissary, with a letter issued under her name to be read out to the assembly verbatim. Poor Mishra had no option but to follow his leaders instructions to the last detail. Accordingly, he read out every bit of the letter, including the full stops and the commas. The drama is supposed to have reached ridiculous heights when he started aping Behenjis accent, pronouncing every word in a falsetto, as though they were spoken by a feisty female.                        
	 With a 100 per cent strike rate, Paul the Octopus is the new hero that the world is looking up to. India is no exception. Paul is supposed to be in high demand with Indian politicians, who want to bring him to this country and treasure him as the resident soothsayer. Too many questions need to be answered: Will Rahul Gandhi be the next prime minister? Or perhaps Manmohan Singh will continue? Or will Congress at all retain power at the Centre after the next general elections? Political leaders have already started taking Pauls name to attack Opposition parties. At a recent rally, when Jayalalithaa predicted the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagams ruin in the next assembly polls, the DMK was quick to respond that Jaya is not Paul the Octopus, so she cannot read the future correctly.

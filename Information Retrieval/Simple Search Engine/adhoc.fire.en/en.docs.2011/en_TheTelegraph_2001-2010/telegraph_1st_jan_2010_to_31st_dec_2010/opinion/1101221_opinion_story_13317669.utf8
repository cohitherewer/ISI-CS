	Trust deficit                  
	Sir  Premier Wen Jiabaos recent visit to India might help improve ties and alleviate tensions between India and China (Terms of estrangement, Dec 18). But the visit seems to have been focused more on trade than on addressing the geopolitical issues that plague the two Asian giants. Pragmatic diplomacy appears to govern relations between the two countries, pushing contentious issues to the background. The unresolved bilateral issues include the border dispute, Chinas resistance to a permanent seat for India in the United Nations security council, the formers stance on such matters as the war on terror and its issuing of stapled visas to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir.          
	Nevertheless, the current economic situation would indicate that conditions are in Indias favour. China cannot afford to ignore the huge Indian market and the growing purchasing power of Indians. This economic advantage is bound to give India more leverage in all its negotiations with China.          
	In contrast, the unstable Pakistan, which is Chinas ally in the region, does not offer much potential for trade. China is using Pakistan to isolate India and extend its own control over the region. Meanwhile, Pakistan is bent on extracting maximum benefit from China in exchange for its allegiance. Ties with India could be much more productive for China.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Chinese premiers State visit to India is over. According to reports, no progress has been made towards a resolution of the disputes between the two countries. With every visit, hopes are raised that these points will be discussed. But China refuses to comply (Bhai and bhai with a dash of reality, Dec 17). Chinese incursions into Arunachal Pradesh continue to threaten the Indian borders. Moreover, China still occupies the Aksai Chin region.          
	All talks between the two countries focus on bilateral trade and its volume. Even here, circumstances seem to favour China. The lower cost of labour there means that Chinese goods are sold at extremely low prices. Indian industries cannot compete with the prices of Chinese goods since wages are higher in India.          
	China appears hostile on other issues as well. It is not keen on Indias inclusion in the UN security council, does not recognize Kashmir as an integral part of India, and chooses to turn a blind eye to the terrorists training camps based in Pakistan.          
	India will have to plan its course of action according to Chinas next move. But it is very difficult to deal with such an unpredictable nation. The myth of Hindi-Chini Bhai-Bhai had proved to be misleading in the 1960s, when Jawaharlal Nehru was the prime minister. The Indo-China war of 1962 had broken out soon after.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Diptimoy De, Calcutta 

              
	Sir  Indias decision to attend the ceremony where the Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, was praiseworthy. China had been trying to put pressure on India to boycott the event. Indias presence in Oslo might have cast a shadow over Wen Jiabaos visit to India only a few days after the ceremony. But China should recognize the fact that Indias attendance was not a question of just bilateral issues.          
	Chinas recent assertions on the need for border demarcation were welcomed by India. But it is impossible to ignore that Chinese activities in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal have been detrimental to Indias interests.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad
                
	Sir  One wonders whether Wen Jiabaos visit banks on the belief that public memory is short. It was after Chinas then premier, Zhou Enlai, visited India that an emotional Jawaharlal Nehru coined and propagated the phrase, Hindi-Chini Bhai-Bhai. Soon afterwards, China threw all brotherhood to the winds. Indians will find Chinas betrayal hard to forget. Over the years, China has done nothing to repair the broken ties. As the editorial, Terms of estrangement, observes, India has to be more vigilant about Beijings moves and motives. If China is to earn Indias trust, it must prove itself through concrete actions. Better ties between the two will be beneficial for the people of both the countries.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Suman Sankar Dasgupta, Calcutta

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Unhealthy drink                  
	Sir  The government should ban advertisements of aerated drinks. These popular drinks pose health hazards and can make children diabetic. Also, the manufacturers should be made to print the contents of their products in detail. Some time back, the Centre for Science and Environment had reportedly found traces of pesticides in soft drinks made by two leading brands. Printing the ingredients of aerated drinks on bottles should be made mandatory to clear doubts about soft drinks containing harmful chemicals.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Just a show          
	Sir  In the article, Chidambarams fantasy (Jan 6), K.P. Nayar has missed an important point regarding Indias attitude towards terrorism. India does not need to imitate the United States of America in combating terrorism as it has adequate resources at its command to fight terrorism.          
	Pakistan launched an irregular war on India by supporting militancy. But successive Indian governments have rejected every single mandate recommended by the counter-terrorism doctrine that has been framed by Indias own security experts. Even basic reforms such as the modernization of the police force have been held up. So, the home ministers visit to Washington was merely an act to convince ordinary Indians that something is being done to counter terror.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Stress factor          
	Sir  It is shocking to learn that an 11 year old schoolgirl committed suicide in Mumbai for not being allowed to take part in a reality show (Ire on TV after death, Jan 6). A ban should be enforced on such shows immediately.          
	It is important to discover talent in a child, and children must also be encouraged to make successful careers out of their talents. But putting a child in a rat race is not acceptable. Childhood is not about competitions and achievements, but about learning and enjoying life. Children should be kept away from stressful activities that may have a negative impact on their health.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The recent suicides by three students in Mumbai have shown how students are not being able to cope with the fear of failure. It has been suggested by many that the film, 3 Idiots, could have induced the teenagers to commit suicide. I do not think it is appropriate to blame one particular movie for these incidents. Students suicides before examinations or the publication of results have been a matter of concern for a long time. They need to be taught to handle failure as well as to manage pressure. For this purpose, schools should conduct counselling sessions. Students should also be encouraged to take up sports or creative exercises to de-stress themselves.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  It is high time the Goa government tightens security in the state, especially for foreign tourists (Russians plead, Goa doors shut, Dec 27). It is important to take this step in order to encourage tourists to visit not only Goa but other parts of the country as well. After all, foreign tourists are key contributors to the economy. The Goa police should take immediate action to provide proper security for the visitors and make sure that the offenders who attempted to rape the two Russian girls are brought to book as soon as possible.

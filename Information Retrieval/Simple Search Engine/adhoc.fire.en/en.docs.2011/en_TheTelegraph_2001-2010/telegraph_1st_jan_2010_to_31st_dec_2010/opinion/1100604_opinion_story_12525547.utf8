	JANGALNAMA: TRAVELS IN A MAOIST GUERILLA ZONE (Penguin, Rs 250) by Satnam is a detailed account of the authors experience of living in Maoists camps for two months in the remote jungles of Bastar. Translated from the original Punjabi by Vishav Bharti, this is not just a chronicle of adventures but also an inventory of important facts and figures that have been obscured by the belligerent rhetoric of Operation Greenhunt. Alongside the daily details of life in Maoist camps, Satnam includes a potted history of guerilla movements in the country, which puts the present crisis in a certain perspective. The human drama and the natural beauty of the landscape are described movingly. Satnams narrative heightens the disjunction between mainstream urban society and the marginalized rural poor. Without endorsing violence, Satnam makes a fervent appeal to recognize the principles behind the Maoist rebellion. In the process, he sometimes ends up painting too rosy a picture, singing paeans to the Maoist dream of a world free of exploitation.                                  
	STRIKER STOPPER (Hachette, Rs 250) by Moti Nandy includes two novellas by the acclaimed writer who focused mainly on fiction centred on sports. The stories in this volume have been translated competently from the Bengali by Arunava Sinha. Nandy was especially moved by the plight of poor players from the suburban areas trying to make a career in the fiercely competitive Calcutta sports scene. As with Koni, which describes the trials of an aspiring swimmer, in Striker, we read about the dreams of a young football player. In Stopper, a veteran sportsman tries to make a memorable exit from the game he has eclectically played for years.                        
	SAROJINI NAIDU: SELECTED POETRY AND PROSE (Rupa, Rs 295) edited by Makarand R. Paranjape is an anthology of works by one of the most important Indian writers in English. Although primarily known for her poetry, Naidu was also an entertaining storyteller, as her witty little tales attest. Apart from her literary career, she was also active in the independence movement and went on to become the president of the Indian National Congress. Her repertoire of experiences, thanks to her political career, was rich and diverse, and contributed significantly to her life as a writer. The volume is prefaced by an excellent introduction by the editor.

	Escape routes                  
	Sir  In response to Mukul Kesavans article, Pigs dont fly (April 29), I would like to say that in the 21st century, which is an age of cut-throat competition, I do not think one can find fault with the mickey-mouse version of cricket. People have little time or patience to watch a five-day test match, or even a one-day game for that matter. Twenty-20 is a serious form of cricket where a player can never be successful without adequate skills. There is a general perception among people that T20 suits only those players who can play the big strokes, hitting fours and sixes at will, without getting the technique right. But IPL 3 has proved that this idea is wrong as some of the players who are technically sound, such as Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis or Sourav Ganguly, have been the most successful in this series.          
	As far as the commercialization is concerned, I fully agree with Kesavan. Commercial breaks that tend to go on and on at crucial junctures of the match can truly get on the viewers nerves. Being an avid watcher of cricket, I expected that at least the stalwarts like Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri, all of whom are part of the IPL governing council, would do much more than just nod to whatever Lalit Modi had to say. They should have helped maintain the sanctity of this game because at the end of the day, it is cricket above all the glamour, glitz and the cheerleaders.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Chirag Mandal, Howrah

                
	Sir  In his frank and forthright article, Mukul Kesavan has argued that the large amount of money that is being poured into cricket can only be justified if the game is managed more professionally. However, what has caused ripples both within and outside the country recently, centred around the just-concluded IPL, is exactly the opposite of what Kesavan had expected of this mega event.          
	Recent events have shown that Lalit Modi is in deep trouble. No less bruised are the Board of Control for Cricket in India and its exalted policy-makers. No wonder they are busy finding escape routes, making scapegoats of the sponsors and the franchisees, in order to keep their transparent image intact. In India, such shifting of blame happens to be the rule of the game. The IPLs governing council has now unanimously appointed Chirayu Amin, head of the Baroda Cricket Association, as the interim chairman of the league, in place of Modi. The council has also slapped as many as 22 charges of impropriety against the latter, including acceptance of kickbacks while assigning the telecast rights for the IPL matches. Do these steps indicate any practical solution to the imbroglio?          
	Kesavan compares the quality of broadcast of cricket with that of tennis, football or golf. While a football telecast pays heed to the nature of the game, that of cricket follows no such norms. Those who decide upon these matters are so liberal that they have no qualms about giving the broadcaster a commercial break as frequently as he wants. The breaks make the experience of watching cricket exasperating in the extreme.          
	The BCCIs chief administrative officer has been entrusted with the task of looking into the records of the IPL. But to ensure transparency, an inquiry should be conducted by people who are not involved with the BCCI. Kesavan has rightly suggested that a Grand Inquisitor be appointed to pressurize the BCCI to cleanse itself of the evil that has eaten into its vital framework. After all, no cricket-lover wants this game to be stigmatized in the way it has been, thanks to a group of corrupt money-launderers and inept organizers.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Plum job          
	Sir  The Central government must go ahead with the proposed disinvestment of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, the protests from the trade unions notwithstanding (BSNL strike from today, April 20). The members of these unions must realize that it is not the responsibility of the Indian taxpayer to keep them under the safe umbrella of a government job. A vast majority of people in India is employed in the private and the unorganized sectors. This lot has to work hard to keep the jobs. Why should the public sector unit employees be given extra benefits? If providing job security to a certain section of people is the rationale behind running the PSUs, then these units deserve to be disbanded immediately.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Good news          
	Sir  It is nice to know that co-scholastic activities such as dance, drama, music, arts, debate, creative writing and the like are set to become mandatory for Madhyamik examinees. This is a laudable effort on the part of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education. And it makes for very good news, especially in the year that celebrates the 150th birth anniversary of Bengals beloved poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Once training in the arts is made compulsory, schools will get an opportunity to instil the values of Tagore as expressed in his plays and dance dramas in students. Perhaps it will give birth to a new reality show, which can reform the weaknesses of the education system.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly

	In any other place, a largish stretch of green in the heart of a city would have been something to be preserved and to be proud of. In Calcutta, it becomes a bone of contention and a monument to negligence. The petition submitted by the army to the Calcutta High Court highlights the plight of the Maidan and the complete lack of any kind of accountability. Who is responsible for the upkeep and the maintenance of the Maidan is a million-dollar question with no clear answers. The army is officially the custodian but it is clear that its writ is not allowed to run on the greens. The police and the public works department of the government of West Bengal have claims on it. The principal despoiler of the Maidan are the political parties who use the Brigade Parade Ground, a large chunk of the greens, to hold rallies with scant regard to the damage that these cause. Till very recently, fairs were allowed on the Maidan. Appeals to repair the damage and to clean up the garbage have always  and predictably  fallen on deaf ears. The army has for many years stood by and seen the Maidan being destroyed, even though historically it has the first claim on the stretch that once used to be described as the lungs of the city.        
	When in the second half of the 18th century, the English East India Company decided to build a new Fort William, they chose the spot where the fort now stands. On one side of the fort was the river Hooghly and all its other sides were left open as the forts line of fire. Within a few years, it became obvious that Calcutta would never face a land or even a water invasion. The open spaces around the fort then came to be used for other purposes. Avenues were laid out, a race course built, a cathedral consecrated and, of course, a memorial erected for Queen Victoria. Sporting clubs with small tents were allowed to dot the green space. Thus the Calcutta Maidan acquired its unique character: a place to play in, to stroll around and for lovers trysts. There was no threat to the Maidan till the political parties discovered it as a convenient spot to bring in the crowds they rented. The green space shrunk as reckless politicians gave away chunks of it to various organizations without a thought for the environment.        
	There has to be a shift from the mental attitude that sees the Maidan as a place to be used. It has to be seen as a precious gift, to be preserved and enjoyed. The answer to the question to whom does the Maidan belong is actually simple. It belongs to all the citizens of Calcutta. Unfortunately, civic awareness is not one of the virtues of the people who live in Calcutta. Handing over the Maidan to the army may not be a solution since in a democracy one cannot expect the military to maintain law and order or even the environment. Until the people of Calcutta learn to respect their own environment, the Maidan will remain in the mess it is in.

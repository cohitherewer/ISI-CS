                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RETURN TO ROOTS                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	As the battle continues around Bt brinjal and its unpredictable fate, the Congress has put its weight behind Jairam Ramesh. This means that Prithviraj Chavan, who has spoken against the party and the government, is unafraid of the reaction of Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi  which only proves that there is no grovelling in the Grand Old Party! Sharad Pawar and Chavan are clearly rooting for Bt products and have, willy-nilly, become the spokespeople for that end of the debate. It is ironic and sad to see the proponents of Bt products buying organic food for themselves because it is fashionable to do so, while they want to inflict the inorganic stuff on the vast mass of unsuspecting citizens.        
	India has, through the millennia, known how to live organically and in a sustainable manner. The colonial period killed that formidable reality, and initiated the destruction of the great civilizational strengths of Bharat. We had tried and tested technologies for agriculture, for medicinal remedies, for building habitats, for life and living. Alien influences from Western domination, unused to our climatic conditions as well as to our diverse cultures and traditions, suppressed the extraordinary strengths of the India they invaded. Like termites, they ate into the foundations and made the edifice wobbly. Post Independence, the government moved towards an equally alien model based on systems operating in the erstwhile Soviet Union. Both were disasters.        
	Today India needs to extricate itself from the illnesses of both the residue of colonial exploitation and the boxed-in governance of socialist/left regimes. We have been a diverse and creative civilization and our people continue to be rooted even though the faade has taken on a foreign and uncomfortable avatar.                
	Dynamic leaders        
	We need to respect our roots and work contemporary processes into them to make our inherent strengths the real makers of change, growth and modernization. Robotization and standardization, both markers of the last century, lead to the lack of creative thinking and of real growth or change. No new idea has come from such standardization that is invariably manipulated by dictatorial leaders who call themselves democratic. India is stuck in that rut at the moment. To emerge from that subservient position, leaders have to be creative and dynamic.        
	Governance, at this time, is alas at its least innovative. Ineptitude and corruption have created a termite hill as high as the Himalayas. The leaders seem unconcerned about delivering a decent civil society to those who elect them to power. No government has made any concerted commitment to restructuring the machine that governs us all. It is disgraceful. The blatant manner in which leaders of all hues strut about like little potentates across the landscape of this great country makes one sick. As a privileged class, they should be ashamed of their betrayal to a long-suffering people. The Naxal movement did not emerge from a collective imagination. Things went out of control due to no governance at all in some parts of the country which were abjectly ignored over the decades.        
	The cabinet needs to be proactive in the business of reinventing processes for radical change, and to actively correct corrupt procedures. The prime minister needs to take strong action against non-performing ministries, particularly against the babus therein. India is looking for action across the board, not merely in foreign policy, which seems to be on the front-burner as against internal rectification. Intellectual energy and political passion will propel India out of the lethargy of status-quo governance. An escalating rate of growth without inclusive and transparent governance will trigger anarchy.

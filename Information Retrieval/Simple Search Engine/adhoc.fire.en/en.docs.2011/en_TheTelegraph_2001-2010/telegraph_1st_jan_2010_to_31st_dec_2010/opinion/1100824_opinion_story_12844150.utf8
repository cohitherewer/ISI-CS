	One year is an ambitious time frame for settling a dispute that has stubbornly resisted all attempts at resolution for decades. However, George Mitchell, the Middle East envoy of the United States of America, considers this to be a realistic deadline for resolving the core differences that have plagued Israel and Palestine since the fruitless Oslo Accords of 1993. A seasoned diplomat who played a major role as a peace broker in Northern Ireland, Mr Mitchell may have his reasons for optimism. But the ground reality does not give much assurance on this regard. The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, have both made solemn pledges to facilitate the peace process, though the stakes involved, in each case, are tremendous. It is one thing to envision a two-state solution and quite another to implement it in a way so that the interests of each side remain sacrosanct. The challenge is compounded by the persistence of territories, best described as no-mans land, over which both Israel and Palestine refuse to relinquish one bit of their claim. Add to this the plight of several million refugees, forcible construction of settlements in East Jerusalem, and the blocking of humanitarian aid into Gaza  and the entire scenario looks quite irremediably bleak.        
	The solitary ray of hope in the midst of such gloomy foreboding is the consistency with which the US president, Barack Obama, has kept up the pressure on Israel. Apart from his intrinsic sense of fairness, this strategy also reflects Mr Obamas maturity as a statesman. From the very start of his term in office, he has maintained that ensuring some form of stability, if not total peace, in the Middle East, is in the interest of his own nations security as well. So, if Mr Obama is able to offer at least a workable blueprint for peace in the Middle East  in the way that he did to Iraq and Afghanistan by announcing the plan for a phased withdrawal of troops  he would earn much credibility with the rest of the Islamic world. By roping in Egypt and Jordan for the upcoming talks, he has already amended the big-brotherly attitude of his predecessors. A sincere mediator, Mr Obama has acknowledged the fact that the impasse cannot be lifted without actively involving the local players. It remains to be seen how Syria and Iran figure in his scheme.

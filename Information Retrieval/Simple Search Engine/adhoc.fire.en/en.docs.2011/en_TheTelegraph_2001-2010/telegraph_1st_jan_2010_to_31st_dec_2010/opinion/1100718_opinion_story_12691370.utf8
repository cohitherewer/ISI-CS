	Money is a curious animal. It is, at once, real and virtual, material and abstract, literal and symbolic. To hold a 500-rupee note in ones hand is not only to hold a piece of paper that has almost no value in itself, but also to possess the ability to buy a decent meal or a set of clothes, a pleasant train-ride or a bit of sex with a stranger of ones choice. What turns paper into promise or pleasure is that elusive and unstable thing called value. And the value of the Indian rupee  its actual buying power as well as its international prestige  has now officially acquired a neat little visual form. It has become a mark on the page or screen, a sign. Once the mandatory legal and technological processes are complete, it can be used easily and recognized instantly not only in India but, it is hoped, all over the world. In the global lexicon of the eye, the rupee will flash with as much allure as the dollar, euro, pound or yen. So the new sign for the rupee is a symbol many times over. It symbolizes a currency (which is already a symbolic entity) as well as what the State wants to proclaim as the nations achievement  a place in the world.        
	With its use of Devanagari and the tricolour, and by allowing only a ghost of the English R, the rupee symbol makes the nation integral to its design. (The Chinese and the Japanese created their currency symbols by abbreviating the English phonetic transcription of a Chinese character.) For the Union minister of information and broadcasting, the Devanagari distinguishes the rupee from other currencies, turning it into a symbol of nothing less than identity. So a strong currency means not just value, power or prestige but an assertion of identity as well, and with this, the Indian rupee becomes part of the peculiar double-bind or paradox of globalization. India wants to be recognized as Indian even as it demands its place in the world. The larger the web of relations and perceptions a nation becomes part of, the more simplified the image by which it wants to be identified, even at the expense of reducing the nations diverse character to an invented unity.         
	That Devanagari letter would signify India to the world, even when vast swathes of the Indian population do not use the script at all. As a new word, euro had created endless problems with spelling, grammar and the formation of plurals when it started being used by the different languages of the European Union, from Asturian to Welsh. And look what is happening to the economy of Greece  the cradle of European civilization, according to the European Commission  from whose alphabet the euro took its symbolic epsilon.        
	As the master chameleon, money becomes more money precisely when it begins to lose its identity, its fixed place in the world  and symbols, whatever be the glories they signal, are not to be taken for the real thing.

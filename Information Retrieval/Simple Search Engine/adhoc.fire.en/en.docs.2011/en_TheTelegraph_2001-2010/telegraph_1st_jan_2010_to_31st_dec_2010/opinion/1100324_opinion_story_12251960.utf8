	It is perhaps futile to look for sound economic logic in an election-wary governments annual budget. Few will be surprised, therefore, that the budget that West Bengals finance minister, Asim Dasgupta, presented was more a political than an economic exercise. Checking the erosion in the Lefts vote bank, rather than setting an economic agenda, seems to be his overriding concern. Several polls in the last two years have seen the Left losing support among its traditional supporters such as the Muslims and backward classes. The lack of employment opportunities has alienated the urban poor too from the Left. Hence the attempt in the budget to win back their support with liberal allocations for schemes meant for these sections. The politics of the exercise is evident as much in what the budget provides as in what it ignores. Almost forgotten, therefore, is the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments new zeal for industrialization. The governments messy handling of the issue of acquiring agricultural land for industrialization has been at the heart of the Lefts recent political reverses. Mr Bhattacharjee still argues that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the governments industrialization policy. He is right on this because only a determined push for new, modern industries can make a substantive change to the states economy. But the budget suggests that the government has now developed cold feet on the industrialization drive.         
	Ironically, even the governments decision to finally accept a fiscal regimen appears to be more a political move than a real change of heart. West Bengal may not be the only state to carry a heavy debt burden. But Mr Dasguptas persistent refusal to submit to the basic norms of fiscal discipline has worsened the states debt crisis. His 24 years as finance minister is a bizarre record that perhaps shows why things have changed so little for West Bengal. Given this record of profligacy, it is difficult to take Mr Dasguptas sudden awakening to the virtues of deficit reduction at face value. It is perhaps more likely that he now wants to force the hands of the next government in the event of the Left losing power in next years assembly polls. Yet, what West Bengal needs most is to free its budgets and overall economic planning from the compulsions of electoral politics. But then, Mr Dasguptas budgets were never known for inspiring great hope.

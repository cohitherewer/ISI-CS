	Parrot and Olivier in America By Peter Carey, 
  Faber, Rs 550        
	Peter Careys ambitious and richly imagined new novel is based on Alexis de Tocquevilles journey from Paris to New York in 1831 to study the prisons and penitentiaries of America. After his two years in the New World, Tocqueville ended up writing a treatise on democracy. Careys aristocrat, Olivier-Jean-Baptiste de Clarel de Barfleur de Garmont, who is something of a French nancy boy, achieves no less, though not before his romantic vision of democracy has soured into a bitter nightmare.        
	The malodorous galit of America induces in the delicate Olivier  hailed as Lord Migraine by his quirky companion, Parrot  a curious churning of the soul. He discovers democracy to be the ideal meeting ground of liberty and equality, but also becomes aware, to quote Tocqueville, that one also finds in the human heart a depraved taste for equality, which impels the weak to want to bring down the strong to their level. Shifting between grim scepticism and raucous celebration, and told in the voices of Olivier and Parrot, Careys narrative crackles with a hilariously schizophrenic wit.        
	Perhaps the chief charm of Careys plot is its elegant suppleness. It keeps reinventing itself at every turn of the page, twisting itself through the labyrinths of history, picaresque fiction, travel-writing and even Enlightenment philosophy. The result is a delectable shapelessness, and there is something for every taste: maudlin Dickensian little boys flogged by vicious taskmasters, Rabelaisian feasts and farts, a one-armed soldier-cum-spy straight out of Swift, and an ancient, witch-like, patois-speaking Maman reminiscent of the old woman with one buttock in Candide. In a feat of mimicry, Carey affects the manner of Prousts young narrator as he chronicles Lord Migraines intensely Oedipal childhood. There are endless episodes of allergies, nosebleed and asthma, of maternal cruelty punctuated by giddy adventures with dear Maman (such as the time when Olivier sipped soda water in her company and was reminded of his old tutor, Bb, farting in his sleep).        
	In contrast to this exquisite portrait of childhood, Carey gives us the life and times of John Larrit aka Parrot, bruised and battered as a boy, blundering his way through a foreign jungle of the soul. Like the bird that was a great favourite among nubile beauties in the Middle Ages, the eponymous Parrot grows up to be something of a ladies man, always ready for a tumble in the hay, and quite the opposite of the lily-livered Lord Migraine to whom he is appointed scretaire. Larrit truly has the gift of tongues. Like the Parrot in Skeltons lyric, he is an expert imitator, which makes him revered as well as risible. His life spans the desolate plains of Dartmouth (where he and his itinerant printer father worked unwittingly for a group of anarchists and forgers), the wilds of Woollahra in the Australian outback (where he is mistakenly shipped as a convict), and finally, the bustle of New York City (where he ends his life as an art dealer).        
	Democracy reaches an apotheosis of sorts in the figure of Larrit: he is the missing link between strangers, forging unlikely bonds between noblemen and nobodies, salvaging meaning from the babel of voices that swell through the heart of the republic. As an ardent but failed artist, Larrit is the perfect foil to the mercenary and unscrupulous painter, Mathilde, with whom he is besotted. Always anxious to do the right thing, Larrit may seem too idealized a figure  democracy with all its rough edges ironed out. At the end of his story, Careys anxiety to establish Larrit as incorruptible becomes palpable. Carey may even have been tempted to portray Larrit as a reformer of sinners, though thankfully the suggestion is not pushed too far. Yet, it is precisely this sort of a rose-tinted vision of democracy that Olivier, and Tocqueville himself, had disdained. If anything, Tocquevilles notion of natural justice, emanating from the fount of libert, galit and fraternit, was always spiked with a generous pinch of salt.         
	Ordinary American citizens, as Tocqueville noted wryly, had a little too much say in public life. Such a preponderance of public will, he argued, no doubt led to an obvious deepening of equality, but also induced a levelling mediocrity among the people. As the member of a blue-blooded gentry raised in the shadow of murderous revolutions wrought by the force of ideas, Olivier bemoans the intellectual vacuity of America. In Europe, under the ancien rgime, the lower classes aspired no farther than to scrape together a living. However, in democratic America, the same lot wanted to amass land and wealth through hard work, which often amounted to low cunning and cheap tricks. After a lifetime of near-debauchery and amorality, Parrots refusal to lead innocent citizens down the garden path, his pious adherence to decorum, may appear a little far-fetched. Although sensitive to the imperfections of democracy, Carey is reluctant to give up on its fabled power to surprise its beneficiaries.        
	Perhaps the finest, and final, charm of democracy that Carey brings alive is its ability to shake up the traditional master-servant relationship. Although not quite a pair like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, or Don Giovanni and Leporello, Olivier and Parrot begin on two ends of the social spectrum, only to find themselves levelled by the maze of this peculiar foreign life. Ultimately, a rare empathy for the masses helps them reach out to each other beyond the barriers of class. You can go mad that way, Parrot explains, imagining the lives of others, all crowded in like a universe of stars all murmuring and crying with their dreadful want.        
	Democracys greatest gift, Carey seems to suggest through his grand ending, is this terrible privilege of being able to transgress the bounds of the imagination, so that the tragic life of a nobleman gains true meaning only in the eyes of a nobody. As Larrit tells Olivier in the end, I was your servant and became your friend. I was your employee and am now truly your progenitor, by which I mean that you were honestly MADE IN NEW YORK by a footman and a rogue.

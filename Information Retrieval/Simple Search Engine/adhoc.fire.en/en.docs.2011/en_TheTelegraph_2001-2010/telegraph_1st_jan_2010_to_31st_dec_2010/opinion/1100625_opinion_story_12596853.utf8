	Birth of a new faith                 
	Sikhism (Yoda, Rs 350) by Hew McLeod offers a comprehensive account of Sikhism, its history, religious tenets and the features of Sikh society. Significantly, apart from postulating his views on the faith, McLeod also underlines the methodological challenges he faced in the course of his research. The problems, McLeod states in this new and revised edition, are primarily related to the authenticity of sources, their correct interpretation and notions of sanctity. The book can be broadly divided into three parts. The first delves on the formative years of the religion; the second examines the Sikh doctrine as well as customs, rituals and modes of worship along with sacred theological writings; the final bit explores the relationship of Sikhism with social entities such as gender and caste. McLeods research also breaks new ground by offering fresh insights. For instance, he challenges the popular notion that Sikh philosophy can be regarded as an amalgamation of Hindu and Islamic teachings. This scholarly work will be of considerable importance to those interested in Sikhism and in its proponents.                        
	The Mythologist: a novel (Penguin, Rs 299) by Vamsee Juluri is a story centred on the themes of belief, deception and delusion. As a child, the protagonist, P. Parashuram, dreamt of playing the role of the blue god in a biopic directed by Big Grandfather, an influential and subversive filmmaker in Madras. But the film industry turns its back on Big Grandfather, leaving a disillusioned Parashuram clinging to the world full of myths that inspired his grandfathers films. After a disastrous spell at a boarding school, a weary Parashuram decides to settle down to a life of ignominy. But soon, his life takes a different turn as a vivacious woman, AK, rescues him from despair and packs him off to America with a job. Just as things start looking up for Parashuram, the Twin Towers crash, bringing down with them the hopes of finding redemption. In the end, after having fully experienced the drudgery and the pain of life, Parashuram decides to return to the refuge provided by his beloved world of fantasy. Juluris book has an unusual theme and is richly imaginative in parts, but it is unlikely to cast a strong spell on readers.                        
	Eagle spotted, message decoded (Frog, Rs 295) by Siddhartha Choudhary chronicles the various existential crises in the life of an engineering graduate who is awkward, nervous, and who considers himself to be a good-for-nothing bloke. Fresh out of college, he is forced to choose one of the toughest professions that the world has to offer, and, expectedly, is reduced to a nervous wreck. He seeks help from a batty senior, a troubled colleague and from the love of his life, but isnt sure who exactly is going to bail him out of the mess. More worryingly, there are chances that he will make the same mistakes once again. This is another of those dreary coming-of-age stories that seem to be a favourite with Bollywood scriptwriters.                                  
	The Apple Elusionist (Virgin Leaf, Rs 200) by Avrina Jos tells the story of Nadine Parkman, who has been blessed with a perfect life. A caring father, a kind mother and a supportive sister help Parkman lead a fairy-tale existence, which, however, is ruined one fine day because of her own fault. Standing alone, amidst the debris of her life, Parkman seeks and receives a gift that will help her escape her troubles. But soon, she realizes that there is a price that one pays for every wish that is answered. Corny and supremely puerile, this work by a teenage debutante will hopefully find an audience among anguished teens.

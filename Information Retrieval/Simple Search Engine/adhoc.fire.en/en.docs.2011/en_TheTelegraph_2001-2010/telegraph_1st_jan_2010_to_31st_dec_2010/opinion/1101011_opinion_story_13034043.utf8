	Many voices                  
	Sir  In Not the time for bigotry (Oct 1), Swapan Dasgupta rightly says that the Allahabad High Courts verdict on the land dispute in Ayodhya should signal the end of a troubled chapter in Indias history, as this was a politically-required, legal decision. The verdict has proved to be a touchstone for Indias identity as a secular nation.          
	The decades-old Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute was finally placed within the purview of Indias legal system. Any further step now will involve compromises. An invitation to reach an agreement, extended by the Hindu religious leadership to the Muslim community, is bound to be appreciated by sections of the minority community. One of the litigants has retained possession of the garva griha, which was at the centre of the dispute. Thus there ought to be no objection to the construction of a mosque alongside a temple on the disputed land.           
	The verdict should not be viewed as a defeat for any of the concerned parties. It should put an end to the lingering dispute instead of brewing fresh discord. The nation needs to move on to a future free of such grievances. Political parties and religious groups must maintain peace in the face of fundamentalist forces seeking to cause communal unrest.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai,

	Sir  The verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute has been received with great maturity by the nation. It is not clear why a third of the land has been given to the Sunni Waqf Board, since it is clear, as per the report of the Archaeological Survey of India, that the disputed structure was built on a site where a temple once stood. It will be a welcome gesture if the Sunni Waqf Board hands over this land to the Ramjanmabhoomi Trust. A gesture like this will also bridge the religious divide and promote communal harmony in the country.  
	Yours faithfully,      
J.N. Mahanty,

	Sir The manner in which the Bharatiya Janata Party has misled the Hindu population of India, with regard to the building of a temple on the disputed land in Ayodhya where the Babri Masjid once stood, is extremely offensive. The BJPs propaganda has been especially shocking as there are already clear directives sanctioned by the Hindu scriptures with regard to the construction of temples.          
	The scriptures say that the land upon which a temple is to be built must be unclaimed or be donated by the owner of the land for the purpose of building a temple. Moreover, the process of building should not involve any violence or bloodshed, and the labour required for the construction should be rendered willingly.           
	Any temple that has been constructed violating one or more of these norms shall not be used for worship or have any idol placed within it. The Konark temple in Orissa is an example of a religious Hindu structure where no worship takes place because its construction involved violence. On these grounds, a Ram temple built in Ayodhya will be nothing more than a structure.          
	The Supreme Court should take a just decision and return the land to the Sunni Waqf Board. People of different faiths should help to rebuild the mosque on the disputed land.          
	Yours faithfully,        Smritilekha Chakraborty, 
Calcutta     
	Sir  The verdict of the Allahabad High Court on the Ayodhya dispute has set a curious precedent by taking religious beliefs into account, rather than focusing entirely on scientific evidence. One hopes that the Supreme Court will have a different take on the matter.           
	Carbon-dating tests conducted during previous investigations had revealed that the artefacts reportedly discovered during excavations were of very recent origin, bringing into question the existence of a temple on the site prior to the construction of the Babri Masjid. However, the ASI report tells a different tale, causing further confusion.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Ziyaullah Khan, 
  Nagpur     
	Sir  The verdict on the Ayodhya issue has left a section of the minority community of the country shocked and disappointed. The judgment is something of a black mark in the history of the Indian democracy, perhaps even deeper than the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. For the first time, the minorities are feeling the urge to question the judiciary. Not only was the title suit of the Sunni Waqf Board dismissed by the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, but the existence of the birthplace of Lord Ram in the disputed site was also legitimized on the basis of popular belief. If the judgment had not turned out as it did, I wonder if leaders of the BJP and their associates would have been on television appealing for peace. The same people had failed to maintain peace 18 years ago, in spite of repeated appeals by the court to practice restraint in a matter that was still sub judice.           
	However, the minority community should accept the verdict with the grace and generosity that Islam upholds. It should facilitate the construction of a temple and a mosque together for the sake of national integration.          
	Yours faithfully,         Md. Ayub Ansari, Jagatdal,
North 24 Parganas     
	Sir  During the wait before the announcement of the verdict on the Ayodhya dispute, the Centre and the government of Uttar Pradesh kept trying to put the onus for the maintenance of law and order on each other. This left the common people wondering who would have to take responsibility in the event of a breakdown of essential services in the largest state in India.  
	Yours faithfully,

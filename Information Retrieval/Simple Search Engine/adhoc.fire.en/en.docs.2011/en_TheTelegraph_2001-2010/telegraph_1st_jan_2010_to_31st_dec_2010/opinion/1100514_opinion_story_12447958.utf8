	James Waterhouse (1842-1922) was pre-eminent among British photographers who spent long years in the subcontinent documenting the lives and times of kings, queens and natives in vivid detail. An outstanding innovator, he was equally enchanted by the splendour of ruins. THE WATERHOUSE ALBUMS: CENTRAL INDIAN PROVINCES (Mapin with The Alkazi Collection of Photography, Rs 3,250), edited by John Falconer, with excellent essays by Rosemary Crill, Michael Gray and Shaharyar M. Khan, brings together an amazing collection of photographs (some of them inadvertently funny) taken by Waterhouse in and around Bhopal in the 1860s and beyond. Top left are the Bheelalahs, inhabitants of a village near Sehore, noted for their mix of Bheel and Rajput features. Below it is a group portrait of the Begum of Bhopal with her daughter and Bibi Doolan. Right is Her Highness the Nawab Secunder Begum, K.S.I.

	Terror returns                  
	Sir  One expected terror strikes to recur after the announcement that talks will resume between India and Pakistan. But one didnt expect these attacks to take place so soon. A day after the announcement, blasts destroyed Punes German Bakery (Blast breaks lull, Feb 14). There was a temporary lull after 26/11 because India had put pressure on Pakistan and threatened military action in case of further attacks. This confirms, once again, that terror attacks on India are being sponsored directly by our neighbour.          
	Militants in Pakistan were determined to launch strikes on India to derail the talks that are scheduled to resume between the two countries. The Indian government is now in a soup. It is difficult for India to blame Pakistan for the attacks. If it does so, India will be criticized for offering to resume talks with Pakistan and not confronting the latter militarily. It is also difficult for India to cancel the talks at this point, since it had offered to hold the talks on its own. Pakistan has taken full advantage of the situation to turn the tables on India.          
	However, there is still time to rectify the blunder and fight the threat of terrorism that looms ahead. India should not hesitate to blame elements in Pakistan for the Pune blast. It should also cancel the talks immediately, not just postpone them.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The recent bomb blast in Pune that claimed several lives is a clear indicator that Indias security apparatus is still vulnerable to terror attacks. The blast took place in a metropolitan city, and in a bakery that was frequently visited by foreigners. It is interesting that during 26/11, terrorists had also targeted foreigners. This is the reason why the attackers chose the Taj Hotel in Mumbai.          
	It is also important to note that the terror attack happened days after the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, stated that although there had been no major attacks on India since 26/11, it did not mean that the country was not vulnerable to such violence. It is time for the Indian government to realize the seriousness of the threat that faces the country. The government should strengthen security checks at entry points to all metropolitan cities as well as sanitize public places like bus-stands and railway stations that are considered to be soft targets for terror strikes.          
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  India has been hoisted with its own petard after the militants targeted Pune. One wonders what New Delhi plans to do now: turn the other cheek so that the talks  or whatever that term means  with Islamabad are not scrapped? Pakistan is a much smaller country but is more aggressive in its intent than India. It also seems to know that there can be no threat of retaliation from our country.           
	To stand up to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, India needs strong-willed leaders. Politicians, whose primary concern is to protect their vote banks instead of the citizens of this country, will just not do.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Pune blast not only exposed the weaknesses in Indias security system but also the truth behind its much-hyped policy of zero tolerance to terrorism. It is clear that the terrorists took advantage of the security forces preoccupation with the release of Shah Rukh Khans film. The Maharashtra government went overboard to provide security to theatres before the release of the film, ignoring the security needs of the common man.          
	Meanwhile, Afzal Guru continues to be the States guest. A sum of 30 crore has allegedly been spent from the public exchequer on Ajmal Kasab so far. Such facts only go to show the governments zero tolerance policy in a poor light. It is imperative that the government starts acting against terrorists without further delay.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.N. Mahanty, Puri 

                
	Sir  The news about the Pune blast came as a shock. But even more shocking was the Union home ministers statement that the blast took place as a result of intelligence failure. This is the first major terror strike on India since 26/11. Despite the possibility of more attacks after the Mumbai incident, security was not tightened adequately. Indias intelligence network and security forces have failed miserably in combating terrorism time and again.          
	The United Progressive Alliance government has been too soft in this respect. It is yet to take action against terrorists like Afzal Guru and Ajmal Kasab. The Prevention of Terrorism Act has also been repealed. The new anti-terror law lacks teeth. It is also distressing to note that the blast in Pune took place just when India had made an attempt to revive the dialogue with Pakistan.          
	India should now suspend all talks with Pakistan since the situation is not conducive for such gestures. India is supposed to host the Indian Premier League next month, and the Commonwealth Games are round the corner too. Many foreigners are likely to visit India for these events. If we do not take the security situation in the country seriously, India may be seen as an unsafe destination. If foreigners and foreign teams consider cancelling their visits to India, it will be a matter of great shame. The home minister should step up the vigil, and ask intelligence personnel to be more alert in order to avoid any such incidents in the future.           
	Yours faithfully,       
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	Sir  The bomb explosion in Pune has shown India to be a nation that does not have the power to protect its citizens. Not a single terror strike has taken place in America since 9/11. Yet, successive governments in India have not been able to draw up an effective national security policy, nor implemented the suggestions put forward to correct the mistakes committed in the past. The present governments reactions to such killings have always been limited to expressions of sorrow and condemnation of terrorists. Indias expectations of American help to contain Islamic terrorism are unrealistic. By arming Pakistan to the teeth, America has demonstrated that it does not care about Indias concerns. People in power in India should do something to protect lives and property as well as values such as secularism and democracy. Otherwise, Indias aspirations of becoming a superpower will be jeopardized by big and small nations in the subcontinent.          
	Yours faithfully,

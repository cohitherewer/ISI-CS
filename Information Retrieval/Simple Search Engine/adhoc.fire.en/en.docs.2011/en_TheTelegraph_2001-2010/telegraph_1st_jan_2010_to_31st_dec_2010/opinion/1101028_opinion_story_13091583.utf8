	More problems                  
	Sir  This letter refers to the Supreme Courts judgment on live-in relationships (One-night stand cant be live-in: Court, Oct 22). Live-in relationships are a new-age concept, introduced in society as a deviation from the archaic institution of marriage. Such relationships are preferred essentially because they enable partners to co-habit without the legal and social obligations of marriage. Ironically, those upholding the cause of live-in relationships now want these spontaneous arrangements to be brought under the scope of law. That would make living-in almost the same as getting married. Partners will be bound by compulsions similar to those imposed by matrimony.           
	It would not be an exaggeration to suggest that the law has shown a gender bias regarding live-in relationships. If one is to go by the courts position on this issue, the male partner might have to take on greater responsibility than the woman. As far as the question of two people cohabiting under the same roof with dignity and freedom is concerned, one feels that the interference of law in live-in arrangements will gradually make such relationships as overbearing and socially redundant as marriage seems to have become. One also wonders if it is absolutely necessary to share a house in a relationship. Could people not live separately and have a relationship? That would solve a lot of problems.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  On an earlier occasion, the apex court had said that if two adults want to live together with mutual consent, one cannot call it an offence. Now, the court is giving legal rights to live-in couples. Such leniency can bring about moral degradation. People should not breach social norms easily. The laws pertaining to live-in arrangements are likely to make relationships more confusing and complicated.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The verdict of the apex court on live-in relationships is a balanced one. The judges have taken into account all the aspects of a new trend in modern society. But one feels that the law is tilted in favour of women in live-in arrangements. There are loopholes in the law that might allow people to misuse it.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Raising a furore over the use of the word, keep, by the apex court will not make the realities vanish (Fury in court on use of keep, Oct 23). In various parts of India, women are exploited and ill-treated by their male partners. Hindi still has a number of derogatory words to describe a mistress. What is needed is a concerted effort to end the oppression of women, especially in the rural belts. Mere protests will not be of much help.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Imperfect sympathies          
	Sir  One feels that Ashok Mitra has gone a bit overboard with a 60-year-old dispute that has already been the subject of too many debates (Once belief is evidence, Oct 22). The leaders of India have argued over the Kashmir problem with logic and clarity on more than one occasion, and certain insights have been achieved in this case. But by no stretch of the imagination can the Kashmir controversy be compared to the Ayodhya dispute.          
	Regarding Ayodhya, it seems that Mitra is rather keen to prove that Ram is not a historical figure. But it is already common knowledge that he is not. He features in an epic and is, of course, a mythical character. Most other religions have such icons. People love their deities and like to believe that they are real. There is obviously no logic in trying to dig up and establish the origins of gods and goddesses.          
	The disputed land in Ayodhya has been believed to be the birthplace of Ram by Hindus since many years. Sensitivity and a sympathetic understanding of the emotions of the litigants should accompany court verdicts in such cases. The court should try to make litigants see reason, and a conclusion should be arrived at only after careful discussion. One feels that the Allahabad High Court judges have done just that regarding the Ayodhya dispute. There could not have been a better way to resolve this sensitive issue with fairness. The judgment has opened up a new avenue for the dissenting parties: it has given them the option to solve their differences by means of dialogue.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sumitra De, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has rightly expressed concern about the procedure the Allahabad High Court followed in arriving at the verdict in the Ayodhya case. He laments that instead of stressing on facts and logic, the judges have depended more on a belief system based on feudal values. His arguments provide much food for thought. But if one decides to support the verdict, then it is hard to think of any other method the court might have followed to reach that conclusion. The demolition of the Babri mosque was the result of a long-standing and futile clash between two blind faiths. The most convenient way out would have been to reject the claims of all the parties.           
	But the Babri Masjid does not even fall under the purview of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act. So it was difficult for the court to remain strictly secular. However, in the battle between blind faith and reason, the latter should always be given precedence by the law. The case was nothing but a title suit over a piece of land. It may not have much socio-political significance in the 21st century.                    
	Yours faithfully,

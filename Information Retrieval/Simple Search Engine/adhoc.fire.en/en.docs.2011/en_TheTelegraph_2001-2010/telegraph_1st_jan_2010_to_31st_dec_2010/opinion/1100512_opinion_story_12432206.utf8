	Nobody is quite sure exactly what it is a governor does in India. Positioned somewhat like the president who stands at the head of the nations government, he or she is in a ceremonial post. But unlike the president, who is elected by a special method, the governor is nominated by the Union home ministry, and has no executive powers. Only when there is a total breakdown of governance within the state, which is rare, does the governor have a role in first, reporting it to the Centre and then, if need be, carrying out the dictates of Central rule. The idea may have been to replicate the presidents apolitical position in the governors, but it does not work that way. The governor is seen, in polite terms, as a bridge between the Centre and the states, and the convention of changing governors every time a different party comes to power at the Centre is almost as old as the ideal itself.        
	But the Supreme Court has ruled that governors cannot be removed on grounds of lack of confidence or conflict of political and ideological opinions by the party in power at the Centre. The ruling was made in response to a petition challenging the removal of the governors of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Goa in 2004 by the United Progressive Alliance government when it came to power in its first stint by defeating the National Democratic Alliance. The ruling exposes the machinery behind the appointment and removal of governors, which has been called arbitrary. Yet it is a pity that such a matter should be brought to court at all. Not only has the convention governing these appointments always been premised on reigning political dynamics, but governors are also appointees of the home ministry. As such, it is up to the home ministry, which is inevitably guided by whichever government is in power, to decide whether a governor should go or stay. In a polity that is built of competing political parties, the logic cannot be anything but political. And any post that is not an elected one would be subject to these ups and downs. Petitioning the court in such a matter is an attempt to impose one category of values on a completely different system of logic.

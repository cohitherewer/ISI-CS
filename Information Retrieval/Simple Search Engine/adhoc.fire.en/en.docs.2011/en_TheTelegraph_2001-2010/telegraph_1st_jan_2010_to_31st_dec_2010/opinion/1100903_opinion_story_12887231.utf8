The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A surface scratched, a truth revealed
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A SURFACE SCRATCHED, A TRUTH REVEALED                                                                  
	THE THING ABOUT THUGS By Tabish Khair, Fourth Estate, Rs 399        
	A fairly simplistic interpretation of the concept of the heathen thug prevalent in mid-19th century England was adequately employed to satisfy the British thirst for romantic notions with a difference. This romance lay in embellished descriptions of the cult of the Thuggee, a movement associated with dangerous conmen from the mystical Orient, armed with rumaals, who would lie in wait to befriend unsuspecting travellers, only to loot and murder them at the opportune moment before disappearing into the night. Such, the West believed, was the mystique of the devotees of the goddess, Kali.        
	The deceptive casualness in the title of Tabish Khairs book, The Thing About Thugs, is followed through into the opening pages of the narrative by the relaxed yet strangely unfathomable tone of the narrator, who sits in his late grandfathers whitewashed ancestral house in Phansa, Bihar, and reads. He reads a myriad manuscripts and books, spanning lifetimes and languages; he reads Captain William T. Meadowss Notes on a Thug: Character and Circumstances, chronicling the life of the thug, Amir Ali, as it was related to the captain; he reads Farsi manuscripts, written in Amir Alis own hand, letters addressed to Alis jaanam, Jenny, refuting the facts about his brutal past as recorded in the captains work, and telling a very different story. The narrator reads, while his reality intersects with theirs, across centuries and lands.        
	The casting of India and its image into a few particular moulds and then popularizing these often-misleading notions had been practices of the imperial powers in colonial and post-colonial India. Khair appears to be attempting to address and do away with some part of the problematic West European ways of viewing Eastern and African cultural mores in a one-dimensional and stereotypical manner. The character of Amir Ali begins, in the captains chronicles, by saying all the right self-deprecating things and behaving in a servile manner befitting a mere colonial subject. But the character of the eminent phrenologist, Lord Batterstone, is made to project an (initial) gravitas that is but natural to the superior ruling power. As the narrative progresses, however, Khair deftly makes incisions into the tough fabric of popular belief and reveals the multi-faceted, composite actuality that the Thuggee movement was. Amir Ali intrigues the reader, while Lord Batterstone remains an unevolved entity  very visible, despite the masks he wears, but nevertheless an unfortunate stock character. Khairs skill lies in the way he projects these parallel character narratives and records their collisions without making them look like mere games of one-upmanship.        
	A sense of enormity of the happenings in the novel belies the casual title and the seemingly light tone that the narrator adopts. It is as though the seriousness that lies beneath is straining to break through and take over  and yet, without ever managing to do that, it makes its presence felt among the wide range of realities, recollections and personalities that dot the landscape of the book  sometimes lingering, often disappearing, only to reappear sometime later, or never again. Khair adeptly juxtaposes Meadowss chronicles of Amir Alis life with Alis letters to his beloved, Jenny  a strategy that works perfectly to set questioning minds to investigate the contrast between the two. A perceptible rawness, however, does creep into the narrative while one is almost galloping through it, for the author struggles a little to make a number of dissimilar stories and voices converge into an interconnected entity (not a homogeneous one, for such a work cannot be homogeneous). Be it the dreadful tasks carried out by the resurrectionists, John May and Shields, the curiously empty life of Lady Batterstone or the twisted yet tragic life led by the old woman in the opium den, Khair attempts to afford importance to all that he creates, but is unable to do them equal justice.        
	Lord Batterstones ambitious plan to travel down the Congo river into the heart of Africa in search of uniquely shaped, non-white human skulls to add to his phrenological (and sometimes just plain creepy) collection and to prove to the world the infallibility of his research is somewhat reminiscent of Joseph Conrads Heart of Darkness. The latter work attempted to explore the concept, image and reality of imperialism in a detailed manner. The deep-rooted belief in the darkness that was Africa lies at the heart of Conrads novella, dealt with strategically in a way that is sympathetic to West European imperial constructs. It is, however, the darkness of Kurtzs fear of obliteration and his existential crises that remained with me as the true darkness in the book. Like Kurtz, Lord Batterstone too can be situated in the context of a larger imperialistic convention that sought both to marginalize and condescend to inferior cultures, the difference being that Batterstone is single-minded in his murderous intent, instead of also patronizingly undertaking the uplift of other races.        
	Batterstone, Daniel Oates, and to a certain degree Major Grayper, are archetypally imperialistic in their varying degrees of malevolence. Amir Ali, too, does not deviate considerably from the notion of a wronged hero. He demonstrates the traits that one would associate with a man in his misunderstood position  he is resilient, strong, flawed and very human. He learnt to believe that he had to be like the grass, for unlike the upright trees that storms can uproot, grass is always wavy and green, unaffected by the storm. Khair does not have to create radical misfits or extraordinary characters to illustrate his point. Characters within recognizable conventions work quite well for him.        
	For example, the tender moments that Ali shares with Jenny, mainly spoken of in his letters to her, are clichd. Yet they are an unconventional pair, given the time and space in which their relationship blossomed. But there is an underlying melancholy and a strange longing in the records of their time together  a sense that, irrespective of how close the two are, an endless distance separates them.                          NAYANTARA MAZUMDER

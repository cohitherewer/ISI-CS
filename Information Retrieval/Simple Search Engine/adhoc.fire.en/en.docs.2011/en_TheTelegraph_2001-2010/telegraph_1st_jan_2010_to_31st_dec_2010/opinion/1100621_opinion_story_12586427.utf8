                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EASY WAY OUT                                                    
	Soon after trading on stock markets ceased on June 4, the finance ministry made an announcement that public limited companies would have to raise the share of the public in their equity to 25 per cent over the next five years, at least five per cent each year. Translated into English, the reasons for the decision are three. First, the ministry thinks that greater dispersal of equity will lead to more stock market transactions; that will make the market more capable of absorbing large transactions and prices less volatile. Second, more trading will lead to fairer prices, meaning prices which are somehow more consistent with all available information. Finally, a larger number of shareholders will make price manipulation more difficult. The punishment for not complying with the ministrys diktat will be delisting.        
	As is usual with official commands, this one also has its escape clauses. Suppose that after a company has complied, it finds that its public holding has fallen below the floor. That is nothing to worry about; it can take a year to raise the holding to 25 per cent again. If, therefore, a crafty operator related to a promoter wants to manipulate prices, he should arrange to reduce the public float; he will then have a year to complete his manipulations. And companies whose initial public offer is over Rs 4,000 crore do not have to comply immediately. They can issue 10 per cent to the public, and then raise the public share by five per cent each year until it reaches 25 per cent. A third escape clause is unstated. If the share of the public falls below 25 per cent, nothing will happen immediately. Stock exchanges may write to the company asking for an explanation; the department of company affairs may issue a dire threat to the company. Then the company chairman can write an abject letter of apology giving plausible reasons for the default; when the manipulation is over, the company can comply with the rule again.         
	However, the biggest loophole in the rule is that public holding remains undefined. A negative definition is imaginable; for example, holdings of promoters or qualified institutional investors would not be deemed public holdings. If a promoter wants to increase public holding, all he will have to do is to find some friends and well-wishers whom the government considers public. So if the government is serious, it should manipulate the definition of the public. It should create a new genre of public mutual funds which cannot hold more than one per cent of a companys shares, invest more than one per cent of their assets in a company, or sell more than one per cent of their equity to a single investor. Alternatively, it should create a new genre of company in which promoters and QIIs holdings are always kept below 40 per cent.

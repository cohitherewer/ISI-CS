	Q: At the annual general meeting of our co-operative housing society, a majority of members passed a motion of no-confidence against the board, dissolved it and constituted a new board as per its Acts and rules. Since the erstwhile board did not hand over charge, the deputy registrar of co-operative societies has been approached in writing to intervene in this regard. But nothing has been done so far. What should we do now?        
	Himansu Kumar Patra, Calcutta                
	A: Members of a co-operative society are neither empowered to dissolve nor reconstitute the board, leave alone pass any verdict on this. Section 29 of the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Act, 1983, empowers the registrar (of co-operative societies) to call a special general meeting to dissolve and reconstitute the board if he is satisfied that the board has mismanaged the societys affairs. The order shall be in writing, citing the reasons, and shall be made only after the board has been issued a showcause notice and given an opportunity of being heard.              
	Q:Can the absence of an advocate for his or her personal reasons be a valid ground for seeking adjournment of a case by a litigant in a court of law? Is there any enactment or decision by any high court or the Supreme Court on this?        
	R.C. Shah, Calcutta                
	A: Though such adjournments are often granted in a court of law, the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2002, does impose certain restrictions as provided in Order XVII Rule 1 Clause 2(d) of the Act.         
	Q:We have let out the first floor of our building under a leave and licence agreement. The agreement was for 11 months and renewable for another two cycles of the same duration. After these 33 months the agreement could be renewed but with a 10 per cent increase in the licence fee. Though the licencee increased the rent after 33 months, this time around he is not willing to increase the fee. Can we ask the licencee to vacate the premises? How should we proceed?        
	Amir Merchant, Calcutta                
	A: If the licence tenure of your licencee is over, you could send him a notice to quit the premises. If the tenure is still in existence, you cannot ask him to vacate the premises on the sole ground of his refusal to increase the fee.

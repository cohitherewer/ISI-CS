	Sixty years ago, India decided to leap into the unknown. The founders of the Indian Republic decided that the fledgling democracy would be based on full adult franchise. Most people then thought that this was a very courageous decision  which indeed it was  and an experiment that would fail  which it did not. Elections since the time they were first held in 1952 have been an object of wonder to most observers. This is because of their sheer scale in terms of both geography and demography. That the elections are held successfully and more or less peacefully is due to the work of the Election Commission, a body created by the Constitution and thus currently celebrating its diamond jubilee. The work of the first election commissioner, Sukumar Sen, has become the stuff of history since he supervised the operation among a population that hardly knew what it meant to vote and participate in the democratic process. Through the last six decades, the extent of the participation by the people in elections has both broadened and deepened. More and more sections of the population, who were previously ignorant of their rights, have become aware of the power of the ballot paper. This has been Indias quiet revolution under the aegis of the EC.        
	This revolution, like all other similar transformations, violent or otherwise, was not without serious problems. Individuals and political parties, unfamiliar with the niceties of democratic practice, often abused the system. Booth capturing, false voting, intimidation, tampering with voters lists  all these emerged as regular blots on the copybook of Indian democracy. From the 1980s, such abuses were so widespread that people began to question the very validity of elections since they were marred by these evils. Again the EC tried, especially when it was under the leadership of T.N. Seshan (1990-1996), to bring elections in India back on the rails. The EC devised and imposed very strict codes of conduct for political parties and candidates. The abuses that had once plagued elections in India have now by and large disappeared. One fallout of this has been the decision to hold elections across the country in different phases. To counteract this drawn-out process, counting has been made swifter by the arrival of the electronic voting machine. The EC deserves the plaudits it receives.

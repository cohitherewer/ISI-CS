                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GONE UP TO HALF                                                    
	Women certainly have their uses. One of these is their function as a pretext for other people to feel virtuous. The whole country is busy feeling virtuous over the passage in the Upper House of the bill for the reservation of one-third seats for women in legislative bodies. Among politicians, there are some who are feeling more virtuous than others, having opposed the bill because it would cheat underprivileged women by the implementation of a general one-third quota. The Union government has not stopped at that. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance would like to see 50 per cent reservations for women in panchayats and urban local bodies. States are falling over each other to grant this new quota; for example, Tripura has already made the necessary amendments to make this happen, Orissa is ready too, and Karnataka had gone up to 40 per cent long ago. After all, it was at the panchayats that the one-third reservations took off. Local governments provide a useful space for testing the waters: will anyone notice the slow overtaking of democratic principles by undemocratic gender-quotas or will it simply make the government more popular?        
	No state government, and no political party would like to lose out on popularity  in case that is to be the outcome  but few come close to the Left Front government in West Bengal in the matter of feeling virtuous while doing exactly nothing. It has announced that the policy of 50 per cent quota for women will be implemented in the 2013 panchayat elections. But 2013 will come after the assembly elections in 2011  of course the state government knows how to count. So it is the new government that will have to see that the policy is carried out. In other words, the present government need not do a thing but merely announce the policy intention to get brownie points. Amending the necessary law can be done later  the panchayat minister is hoping there will be time for that. Meanwhile, there has been no mention of the imminent municipal elections. Neither has there been a reference to the fact that this change is taking place countrywide. The idea is to harvest popularity and a virtuous air with spectacular moves that will obscure the fact that real efforts to secure justice and ensure empowerment for women are decreasing rather than growing. India believes that quotas are the panacea for all ills.

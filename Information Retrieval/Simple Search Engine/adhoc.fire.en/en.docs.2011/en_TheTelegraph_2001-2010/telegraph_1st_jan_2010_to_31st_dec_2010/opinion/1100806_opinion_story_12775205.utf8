	The ways of the bureaucracy in India can be an investors nightmare. The Posco project in Orissa may have been delayed by people opposing the acquisition of their land. But now, a committee of the Union environment ministry wants all work at the site to be stopped immediately. The committee has accused the Orissa government of deliberately withholding information relating to the land. It has also charged the Centre with giving a green signal to the project in violation of its own rules. At the centre of the committees objections is the Forest Rights Act. Its findings dispute the Orissa governments claim that the people did not have any forest rights to the land to be acquired for the project. Bhubaneswar has also been accused of suppressing the fact that two of the three villages, where the land has to be acquired, have passed resolutions claiming their rights under the FRA. Both the Centre and the state governments have their own versions of the issues. But there is no escape from the fact that the environment ministrys latest directive casts another shadow on the Posco project. Clearly, the bureaucracies in New Delhi and Bhubaneswar have not done their homework properly.        
	It would be unfortunate for Orissa and the countrys economy as a whole if the bureaucratic bungling delayed the Posco project even further. A set of new laws, especially those on mining, forests and the rights of the tribal people, is likely to change the rules of business in some key areas of the economy. It could worsen investors worries if governments and bureaucracies fail to move in step with the changing business climate. The acquisition of land for new industries has triggered political backlashes in several states over the past few years. More such protests are likely as investments in the mining sector increase. It is absolutely crucial that the Union and state governments understand the implications of the new laws and do enough to implement them. More important, the governments steps must be  and also appear to be  transparent. Much of the problem in land acquisition for new industries is due to inept handling of the issue by the administration. It was so in Singur in West Bengal and it has partly been the case with the land chosen for the Posco site. Orissa could learn from its neighbours mistakes.

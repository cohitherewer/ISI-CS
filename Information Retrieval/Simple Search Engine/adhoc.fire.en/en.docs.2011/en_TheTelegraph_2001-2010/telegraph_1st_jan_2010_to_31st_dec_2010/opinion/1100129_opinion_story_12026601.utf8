	Play fair                  
	Sir  There were no bidders for Pakistani players at the Indian Premier League auctions (Cold Pak ties cast a cloud on IPL auction, Jan 19). This is because of the fear of trouble at matches, given the strained relations between India and Pakistan at the moment. Pakistan has not taken concrete steps to prevent terrorism against India. The matches in IPL are purely commercial ventures and its sponsors want to safeguard the league from any kind of obstruction, including political trouble.          
	Pressure is now being applied to induct Pakistani cricketers into the league. All this while, the Pakistan government acted in an expected manner by exploiting the situation in its favour. Pakistani cricketers may not be responsible for the troubled Indo-Pak ties but they are suffering for their governments failure to repair the rift. Had Indian cricketers suffered in the same way, it is unlikely that the Indian government would have reacted in a similar manner.          
	Too many cricket matches are played through the year. It is better to abandon the IPL matches as they are straining Indias ties further with Pakistan. We cannot change our neighbours, but we must do all we can to maintain cordial ties with them. In the past, Indo-Pak matches have been held to strengthen bilateral ties. By the same logic, the IPL tournament should be called off to improve Indias relations with Pakistan.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Not a game (Jan 22), raised some points in favour of including Pakistani players in IPL 2010. But these arguments can be considered valid only under normal circumstances. The IPL is about minting money. The franchisees are big business houses that are ready to pay astronomical sums for valuable players. But they are unlikely to put their money on a player whose availability looked far from certain at one point of time. The Indian government has declared that another attack like that of 26/11 would be dealt with firmly, perhaps even with military action. Despite this, Pakistan-based terrorists have threatened more attacks on India. The Indian government recently put some cities on alert to thwart such attacks. Even in the case of a small-scale terror strike, the Indian government is likely to restrict the entry of Pakistani citizens, including cricketers, into India. No wonder Indian sponsors are unwilling to bid for players who might not be allowed to play in India.The internal security of the country is far more important than the IPL. The security of Pakistani players might be threatened by Hindu fundamentalists. The government will then be blamed for allowing them to participate. Terrorists might deliberately target Pakistani players to vitiate ties between India and Pakistan. Therefore, it is better not to mix sport and politics, literally.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The relationship between Pakistan and India is very fragile at the moment. Hence, it would be wise for both countries to be careful about sensitive issues such as sporting ties.          
	It is difficult to believe that not a single Pakistani cricketer was considered by bidders at the IPL auction. The Pakistan Cricket Board and that countrys sports minister cannot be expected to take this lying down. It is recommended that the Board of Control for Cricket in India constitute an enquiry committee to find out the truth about the matter. Any misunderstanding should be cleared at the earliest.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sumitra De, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It appears that an unnecessary controversy has been created as a result of the exclusion of Pakistani players from the forthcoming IPL. The Pakistan government has accused India of doctoring the selection process of players. It should be pointed out that neither the BCCI nor the home ministry has any role in selecting cricketers for the league. The selection process is based on performance and the bidding is done by the team-owners.           
	It is possible that after 26/11 and the overwhelming evidence of Pakistans involvement in it, certain political outfits in this country will call for a boycott of the IPL if Pakistani players are allowed to participate. The sponsors will not want to risk that. The security of Pakistani players remains a major concern as well.          
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  Shah Rukh Khan is reported to have said that Pakistani players should have been selected for IPL. As the owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders, the actor was in a position to select Pakistani players for his team. One wonders what stopped him from doing so. It is surprising to see him playing to the gallery in this way.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S.K. Raychaudhuri, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It should be noted that players from several nations, besides Pakistan, have not been selected for the IPL. Pakistans anger over the matter is unwarranted. Singers, musicians and other skilled persons from Pakistan are still welcomed in India. It is unfortunate that the international image of Pakistani players has eroded over the last few years, prompting businessmen to stay away.          
	The Indian government has negligible control over the IPL series. It is the Pakistani government that is trying to divert international attention from the Taliban attacks that are taking place regularly in that country.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Agartala

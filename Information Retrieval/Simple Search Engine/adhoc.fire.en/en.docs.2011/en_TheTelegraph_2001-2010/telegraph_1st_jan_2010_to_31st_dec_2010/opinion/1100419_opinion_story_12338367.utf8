	First, a tragedy that almost sinks beneath the weight of a huge historical coincidence: a plane carrying the political and military elite of Polish society crashes, killing everybody aboard, on its way to Katyn to commemorate the murder of a previous generation of the same elite by Stalins secret police in 1940.        
	Then the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, whose early career was spent in a tamer version of that same secret police, does something remarkable. He tells a Russian television channel to show Andrzej Wajdas 2007 film, Katyn, in prime time. Its more than an apology. Its a national act of penance.        
	Polands historic tragedy is that it is located between Germany and Russia. Twice the country vanished entirely, partitioned between its more powerful neighbours  the enduring symbol of the second partition being the Katyn massacre. In 1939, when Hitler and Stalin invaded Poland, 22,000 Polish officers fell into the hands of the Soviet Union. Some were professional soldiers, but most were reserve officers, who comprised the countrys intellectual elite. Stalin had them all murdered by a bullet in the back of the head.        
	Stalins aim was to decapitate the Polish intelligentsia and make the absorption of eastern Poland into the Soviet Union easier, but Hitler betrayed and attacked his ally in 1941. When the invading German troops reached Katyn, they found the mass graves of the Polish officers and invited international observers to examine the site. That was when the Great Lie was launched.        
	Moscow insisted that it was the Germans who had massacred the officers. The American and British governments backed the Soviet story because Stalin was now their ally in the war against Hitler. Only after 1945 did they question it.        
	So, the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre was a fraught event. Prime Minister Putin invited his Polish equivalent, Donald Tusk, to a memorial ceremony in Katyn, but President Lech Kaczynski was not invited. Tusk would settle for a vague expression of regret, but Kaczynski was an old-fashioned nationalist who wanted the Russians to apologize on their knees.                
	Fresh start        
	Tusk came, and Putin duly expressed his sorrow for the victims of Stalinist terror, but he didnt even mention the word Poles. Great states never really apologize, you know. Kaczynski, enraged, invited himself to another ceremony three days later, and brought half of Polands political, military and journalistic elite with him.         
	Putin showed up at Katyn again to meet him. When the news of Kaczynskis plane crash came in, he looked utterly stricken. Finally, the grim reality of the place and the occasion got through to him. Now, the apology was real and specific. Now, Wajdas harrowing film on Katyn, previously only seen on a specialty channel, got a prime-time broadcast. Now, the Russians finally got why the Poles dont trust them.        
	The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, has announced that he is going to Poland for Kaczynskis funeral. Before he goes, he should look at one photograph. It was taken in 1984 on the World War I battlefield of Verdun, where a quarter million French and German soldiers died in 1916. By 1984, France and Germany were in the European Union and Nato together, but they were still not really friends.        
	Then, President Franois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany commemorated the 70th anniversary of World War I. Looking out over the killing fields, they did the only thing they could. They held hands  and Franco-German relations changed for good. If Medvedev can find a way to do something as simple but powerful as that, he could start a new chapter in Russian-Polish history. The people are ready for that.

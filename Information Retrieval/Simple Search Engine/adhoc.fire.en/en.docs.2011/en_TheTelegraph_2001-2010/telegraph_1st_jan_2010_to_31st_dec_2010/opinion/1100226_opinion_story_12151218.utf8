	The prime minister of India should not allow the holder of one of his most important ministries to become the object of ridicule. Yet, this is precisely what has happened to Mamata Banerjee, the minister of railways, after she presented her budget. There is ample evidence that she was allowed to give a free rein to her whims and fancies in the budget. Any form of prime ministerial intervention was conspicuous by its absence. It is not that the present prime minister does not intervene in the workings of other important ministries. He has left his indelible mark on Indian foreign policy  by any reckoning the sacred preserve of the minister of external affairs  by being the architect of the Indo-US nuclear deal. But he allowed the railways minister, responsible for an important portfolio in terms of the work the railways does, the employment it provides and the revenue it earns, to completely run amok. Manmohan Singh could not have been unaware of Ms Banerjees propensities since her reputation preceded her. She need not have been given as critical a portfolio as the railways. The railways, in essence nothing more than a vast business enterprise, should not be left in the hands of a politician. It was open to Mr Singh to bring in a professional through the Rajya Sabha route to head the railways. This has been tried before with resounding success in the finance ministry.        
	Mr Singh should cast his reforming eye on not just the ministry of railways but also on all the various ministries that cover the various modes of transport  road, shipping and civil aviation. There is no logic behind having so many ministries covering the various forms of transport. So many portfolios, in fact, only serve to create disparate vested interests. There exists a strong case for bringing them all under the general rubric of transport, for placing them under a professional reporting directly to the Prime Ministers Office. This will not only make for a more holistic transport policy but also guarantee that ministers do not play their own whimsical and populist cards. Mr Singh should also ensure that the person chosen to formulate transport is selected from a wide pool of talent, and not only from politicians. Mr Singh has radically altered the approach to economic and foreign policies. It is time he took steps to refashion other areas that still run to obsolete tunes and raise outmoded flags.

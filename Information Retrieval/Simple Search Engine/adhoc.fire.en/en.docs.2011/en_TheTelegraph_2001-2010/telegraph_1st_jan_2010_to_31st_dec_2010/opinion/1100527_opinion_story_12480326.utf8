                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Lone voice                  
	Sir  It is appalling to hear the director general of police in West Bengal, Bhupinder Singh, say that there has been no breakdown in law and order in the hills even after Madan Tamangs death (Concern, not crackdown, May 22). A murder committed in broad daylight in front of armed policemen is not an ordinary crime. It is a deed that threatens the peace of the entire region. The State, so far, has failed to protect citizens right to life. Apart from this particular incident, several other instances of extreme brutality have already taken place in the hills in recent times.          
	The media, too, have failed to reveal the truth about the situation in the hills. Democracy has been severely violated by the perpetrators who killed Tamang. Members of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha seem to be the prime suspect in this case. It is time for the intellectuals and the common people of Darjeeling to protest against the inhuman despotism of the GJM. Otherwise, murders will become a routine affair in the hills very soon.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Vinay Sharma, Gangtok

                
	Sir  The brutal murder of Madan Tamang could have been prevented if the state government had taken necessary steps to curb terror in Darjeeling at the right time. It is a shame that in a democratic country, a man who had been fighting for the sake of freedom was killed in front of a number of policemen.          
	The apathy of both the state and the Central governments towards the hills has resulted in such a horrible incident. This murder will put fear in the peoples minds. So much so that from now on, no one will dare raise a voice against the GJM. The governments inaction regarding this issue seems to stem from the vested interests of people at the helm of affairs. These leaders hardly care about the situation that the common people in the hills find themselves in today.          
	Tamangs death is a great loss for the hills. He has done a lot of good work for the people there. He was a patriot in the truest sense. If a towering personality like him had to suffer such a gruesome fate, one shudders to think what lies in store for ordinary citizens. The government should immediately take the necessary steps to bring back peace in the region if it wants to retain its image of a strong, democratic State.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bhapi Yongpang, Darjeeling 

                
	Sir  The assassination of the president of the Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League, Madan Tamang, has exposed the ghastly side of the politics of violence. Darjeeling has become a vulnerable area owing to the lack of concern of the state government. Children living here are afraid to go to schools and their parents remain anxious till they return home safely. It is truly unfortunate that politicians in the hills prefer to use muscle power rather than their brains to achieve their respective goals.          
	A crime as gruesome as the murder of Tamang in the presence of armed policemen bears testimony to the fact that democracy in this country has been reduced to a mere phrase in the Constitution. State institutions such as the police have become puppets in the hands of political leaders. The news of Tamangs murder was telecast by all the national news channels  this shows how popular Tamang was as a leader.          
	It is high time the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, pays heed to the turmoil in the hills and the trouble faced by the citizens living in this area. He should come up with ways to resolve this problem, instead of trying to appease the members of the party that now wields considerable power in the hills.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Abu Saalim, Darjeeling 

                
	Sir  The murder of Madan Tamang shows that the GJM is indulging in vicious hostility in order to attain its goal (Butchery of dissent, May 22). GJM leaders like Bimal Gurung and Roshan Giri seem to have realized that their movement has hit a dead end. They are only making things worse by resorting to undemocratic ways.          
	The GJMs absurd demand of a separate Gorkhaland, as well as the frequent bandhs called by the party, has proved that its leaders are not the kind of people with whom the government can hope to enter into negotiations and arrive at an amicable settlement. At present, it seems that the political outfit has resorted to wanton violence and even murder. The authorities should not waste any time in bringing the murderers of Madan Tamang to book. If GJM leaders are found guilty of committing this crime, they should be put behind bars with immediate effect. The state and the Central governments must act fast to put an end to the autocracy of the GJM.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The way Madan Tamang was killed in front of armed cops is dreadful. He was one of the few people who had the courage to protest against the GJM and its agenda to spread mayhem in the hills of Darjeeling.          
	Tamang had even apprised the governor, M.K. Narayanan, about the situation in the hills. That Narayanan, after the death of Tamang, has assured that this state of affairs will not be allowed to continue is something that should be appreciated. Tamangs murder has revealed the seriousness of the threat faced by people living in Darjeeling. Owing to the inefficiency of some officials in the highest rungs of the government, certain places in West Bengal have become a no-mans-land.Tamang had to face several obstacles because of the courage with which he stood up for the right cause. Even his death carries a message: people should continue to protest against mindless violence, and strive to bring development to the hills. Tamangs demise is a huge loss for Darjeeling and its people.                    
	Yours faithfully,

                              Countless monikers      
	In India, a politicians worth is judged not by gold but by the number of sobriquets he/she has. Mayavati, who is known by various names, has a high rating in this respect. After she adorned her (in)famous garland, attracting bees as well as the nations attention, she came to be known as Malavati. She has also been dubbed Maalmati and Murtidevi by Congressmen in Uttar Pradesh. But ever since she bailed out Manmohan Singhs government during the vote on a cut motion, she is being described as Manmohan ki Maya. The new title has left state Congress workers fuming. Let down by their Central leaders, they are now wondering whether there is any point in calling Behenji names. The Congress faces a similar dilemma in Bihar. Lalu Prasad is apparently cosying up to the Congress again, making it difficult for partymen to target the Rashtriya Janata Dal. To make matters worse, the state party chief, Anil Sharma, is reportedly not on talking terms with the AICC point man, Jagdish Tytler. The squabbles have meant that while Congressmen sport a frown, Nitish Kumar cannot hide his smile.                        
	The Bharatiya Janata Party president, Nitin Gadkari, is determined to undergo an image makeover. This just doesnt involve putting in long hours on the treadmill to get back in shape. It has also meant appointing Ashok Tandon, the former media advisor of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, as an informal consultant. We hear that Tandon, now out of political hibernation, has already got busy arranging Gadkaris meetings with top editors. Gadkaris supporters must be hoping that Tandon, who is respected for his low-key but persuasive ways, will help spruce up their chiefs image.            
	 Recently, Trinamul Congresss Sudip Bandopadhyay had a spat with Basudeb Acharya of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), and was asked to apologize for his alleged use of unparliamentary language. For Bandopadhyays efforts, he earned a sharp reprimand from the Speaker. But another person proved to be luckier than Bandopadhyay in this respect. Anant Kumar, a senior BJP leader, was accused of making unparliamentary remarks against Lalu Prasad. After the incident, and amidst the furore, Kumar refused to tender an apology. In his defence, he said that although he had used some words, they had not been directed at anyone in particular. The following day, Kumars colleague and leader of the Opposition, Sushma Swaraj, apologized without mentioning Kumars name. Everyone present in the House understood that Swaraj was apologizing on someone elses behalf. Everyone except Kumar. An adamant Kumar went on insisting that since Swaraj had not taken his name, the leader of the Opposition had not actually apologized on his behalf.          
	 Lalu Prasad may have been on the receiving end of some unkind words of late, but that is not the RJD leaders only trouble. Forced to look for friends, he has mended the fence with Mulayam Singh Yadav. Their bonding has meant that the two wily leaders are trying every trick in the trade to earn some handsome concessions from the government. But their strategy has not borne fruit yet. Lalu and Mulayam are often heard criticizing the Manmohan Singh government, only to swallow their words, change tune, and sing praises in the PMs name the very next day. Moved by their plight, a BJP leader quoted an old Hindi film song to describe the duos troubles: Do bechare, bina sahare, phirte maare maare... (Two poor men, without any help, wander about aimlessly).          
	 In the P Chidambaram versus Digvijay Singh saga, the name of Amreesh Mishra has figured prominently. Mishra, who heads the Congresss anti-communalism forum in UP, is said to be coaching some prominent Congress leaders on contentious issues such as the Maoist problem. That Mishras stars are on the rise was evident from the manner in which he criticized the home minister and the PM for their handling of the Maoist problem in an article. But considering the slippery political firmament, Mishra might soon discover that he is headed downhill. Some say that only then will he rue the day he wrote the piece.                      
	If you think that seat belts are meant for airline passengers only, think again. During a heated discussion about a Union ministers probable involvement in the telecom scam, V Maitreyan, an AIADMK MP, repeatedly rose from his seat and demanded clarifications. This prompted the deputy chairman, who was in the chair, to caution Maitreyan that the latter had no business stalling the proceedings. P Chidambaram quickly suggested that seat belts should be used to desist members like Maitreyan from disrupting discussions. The smiling deputy chairman couldnt disagree.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Whose body is it anyway?
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHOSE BODY IS IT ANYWAY?                                  A recent case of a minor girls right to terminate a pregnancy arising out of sexual assault has once again focused attention on the loopholes in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act. Saheli Mitra reports                          VICTORY LAP: Celebrations in Lucknow after the Womens Reservation Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha                                  
	She was just a 12-year-old village girl, who dropped out of school to help her farm labourer parents at home. She had no idea what sexual abuse meant or that she was being subjected to it. After being repeatedly sexually assaulted by her 40-year-old neighbour, Ghanshyam Singh, she got pregnant. Her suffering did not end there. Doctors refused to abort the foetus, citing prohibition under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act of India.        
	Even a lower court prohibited the girl from undergoing abortion on the ground that it could not be proven that the pregnancy was causing grave injury to the health of the mother or that the child to be born was likely to suffer any physical or mental disability. Under the MTP Act, either of these two clauses needs to be fulfilled for an abortion to be allowed.        
	Finally, more than 12 weeks into her pregnancy, the minor girl got justice on May 11, 2010. Justice Anant Dave of the Gujarat High Court reversed the lower courts ruling and directed the civil surgeon of the Government General Hospital in Surendranagar to carry out the abortion.        
	This case has once again focused attention on the loopholes and lacunae in the MTP Act, 1972. The act, which legalised abortion in India and laid down rules so that the freedom to terminate pregnancy does not get misused, is widely believed to have serious shortcomings.        
	According to Explanation 1 of Section 3 of the MTP Act, anguish caused by a pregnancy from rape shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman and hence in such cases pregnancy can be terminated, says the minor girls counsel, Hriday Buch.        
	But what is the definition of anguish or grave injury? The MTP Act fails to explain these terms, says Kallol Basu, criminal lawyer, Calcutta High Court. The act does not define what would involve a risk or a grave injury. Hence the gravity of the injury or the extent of the risk is left entirely to the interpretation of the doctor treating the victim, which can always be biased and confusing, he adds.        
	It is not just the lack of clear definitions. Experts feel that the law is also riddled with contradictions and loopholes. Says Saswati Ghosh, a womens activist, In the changing social scenario, minor and unmarried girls are more prone to sexual abuse within the family, often leading to pregnancies. The MTP Act should be immediately amended as it is full of contradictions and limitations.        
	For example, the law states that a pregnancy can be terminated if there is a substantial risk of the child suffering from physical or mental abnormalities. Yet in the famous Haresh and Nikita Mehta case in 2008, the Mumbai High Court refused to let the couple abort their 24-week unborn child with a congenital heart defect on the ground that the MTP Act does not allow abortion beyond 20 weeks. Despite having a severe life-threatening abnormality, abortion was denied just because the foetus was past 20 weeks. This despite the fact that according to doctors, congenital defects cannot be detected before 20 weeks, points out Ghosh.        
	Radiologist Dr Madhusree Ray agrees, Certain foetal abnormalities can be detected in the first trimester of pregnancy. But congenital heart defects, Downs Syndrome and major chromosomal anomalies can be confirmed only between the 20th-24th week.        
	Which is why in the US and UK abortions are allowed till 24 weeks of pregnancy, and in Australia till 28 weeks. During the Mehta case, even the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists Society of India (FOGSI) supported the right of a woman to terminate a pregnancy beyond 20 weeks if the foetus has an abnormality which would jeopardise its quality of life, if born.        
	Again, the MTP Act discriminates against unmarried women by not recognising that unwanted pregnancies in unmarried women could result in as much anguish and suffering as that experienced by married women. The act states that where any pregnancy occurs as a result of failure of any device or method used by any married woman her anguish caused by such unwanted pregnancy can lead to grave injury to her mental health. So it clearly allows abortion due to failure of contraceptives only in married women, says Geeta Luthra, Supreme Court lawyer. The act should thus be amended and all women included, she adds.              
	Interestingly, some provisions of the MTP Act are at odds with the Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 2003, that bans tests to identify the sex of a foetus. But sex-detection techniques help identify foetuses with a high risk of congenital diseases. Pre-natal diagnostic techniques are used to detect genetic and metabolic disorders, chromosomal and congenital anomalies or sex-linked diseases, says Dr Ray. (Defective mutations of X-chromosomes, particularly recessive mutations, are associated with debilitating and sometimes fatal diseases.)        
	Since the PCPNDT Act bans sex detection tests, it is not possible to use these techniques to identify and abort foetuses with a high risk of certain sex-linked diseases, she adds.        
	The MTP Act also fails to deal effectively with the issue of pregnancy caused by the rape of mentally handicapped women. Basu cites the case of a 19-year-old mentally challenged woman in Chandigarh who had become pregnant after being sexually assaulted in a government home and was denied abortion by the Supreme Court on July 21, 2009. According to Section 3 of the act, no pregnancy of a woman below or above 18 years, and who is mentally ill, can be terminated except with the consent in writing of her guardian. But as the woman had no guardian, the court said that the victim herself was competent to give or withhold consent for the termination of her pregnancy.        
	In this case, the woman wanted to keep the child. What many womens organisations argued was that being mentally challenged herself, she was scarcely fit to take that decision or even comprehend fully what bringing up a child entailed.        
	Clearly, the government needs to address the shortcomings in the MTP Act so that it helps women who face the trauma of an unwanted pregnancy more than it hinders them.

	We astounded the world in 1990 and in 1994, and we shall do so again, wrote the former South African president, F.W. de Klerk, on the 20th anniversary of the day in February, 1990, when he had announced the end of the apartheid system. But in 1990 and in 1994, the astonishment was about the fact that disaster had been avoided, and even now it is not astonishment at the countrys success.        
	South Africa has the second-highest murder rate in the world, the education system is one of the worst on the globe, and AIDS accounts for 43 per cent of all deaths. It may be true that South Africa is doing better than was expected, but that only shows how low expectations were when Nelson Mandela was freed from prison 20 years ago this month.        
	In the end, South Africans shared interest in a peaceful and prosperous future triumphed over racism and tribalism  and a fairly peaceful and prosperous future is what they got. There have been two lawful and orderly changes of president since Mandela took office  and with only 6 per cent of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa accounts for more than a third of its gross domestic product.        
	However, it is not exactly an economic miracle. As the only industrialized country in Africa, it has always towered over the rest of the continent economically, but its growth rate in the past 15 years has been only a modest improvement on the near-stagnation of the later apartheid years. A new black middle-class has emerged, but the gulf between the comfortable minority of all colours and the poor black majority has only widened.        
	South Africa does not control its borders effectively, and the result is that at least 10 per cent of its population comprises undocumented foreigners. They are often better educated and more enterprising than the locals, and the resentment of poor South Africans exploded into vicious anti-immigrant violence in May 2008.                
	Divided world        
	There will almost certainly be further violence unless most of the illegal immigrants are sent home, but the African National Congress says that it owes the other countries of southern Africa a debt of gratitude for having given its members shelter during the years of the anti-apartheid struggle. Those countries now depend heavily on remittances from their citizens who are in South Africa illegally, and the ANC cannot bring itself to expel them.        
	That is a high-sounding moral motive, but the presence of the illegal immigrants also serves to divert the anger and envy of poor, black South Africans from the homegrown middle class that has been the real beneficiary of economic growth. Almost 40 per cent of black South Africans are unemployed, and they are on the way to becoming a permanent under-class.        
	These are the people for whom the State boasts that it has built three million new homes since the end of the apartheid, but almost all of them are cramped two-room houses. Many of these houses now have electricity, water and sanitation services  but a huge proportion of the people in them dont have jobs.        
	Education for black South Africans was always poor, and during the final 15 years of constant anti-apartheid protests, there was a lost generation that scarcely went to school at all. The end of apartheid should have changed all that, but it didnt. The money was spent on providing houses and services to keep people quiet, not on building a school system that would give them a future. According to the World Economic Forum, South Africas education system ranks 119th out of 133 countries. Only a quarter of South African children finish high school, and a mere 5 per cent go to university. The thing about South Africa that is truly astonishing these days is that the poor put up with it.

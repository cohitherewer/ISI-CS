                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        INVESTIGATE SEBI                                                    
	The committee on review of ownership and governance of market infrastructure institutions was a creation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. It was supposed to advise Sebi on how to regulate stock exchanges and related facilities. So it would have been thought that Sebi would decide on the fate of the committees recommendations; if it had any doubts on them, it was for Sebi to organize further consultations. Instead, the august supreme authority sitting in Delhi, the finance ministry itself, has let people know that it will organize a consultation. Oddly, it has let out that the members of the committee will not be invited to this meeting. From the passionate reactions to the committees report it is clear that there are few who have a good word to say about it. The only people who might have defended a report  and might have said why they came to their extreme conclusions  are in the committee. To keep them out of the meeting may be a signal that the finance ministry does not think too highly of the committee and proposes to bury its report. But if it does not mean to humiliate the members of the committee, then at least the presence of the chairman would be desirable.        
	This is not to say that there is anything desirable about the recommendations of the committee. In the first place, the reason for its appointment is itself not clear. Indian capital markets have worked reasonably well for a good many years; just why they needed a lookover is not clear. Perhaps the reason for its appointment is indicated by its prime recommendation, which is that no one except banks and a few government financial institutions should be allowed to set up new stock exchanges. So if someone did not want a particular person to set up a stock exchange and did not have the power to do so, he would appoint such a committee. The name of the only entity that would fit the bill is Sebi. It is common knowledge that a certain party has been giving Sebi much trouble, questioning its decisions and dragging it to the courts. So the report would seem to have the narrow aim of stopping the party in its tracks. There may also be other unwelcome parties lurking in the dark.        
	Using committees to achieve such narrow and partisan ends is not unknown in the government. Not appointing committees that might show the government in a bad light is equally known, most lately in the governments resistance to a joint parliamentary committee on the telecommunications scandal. But there is an older tradition that has been lost in this politicking: committees used to be appointed to establish unquestionable facts relating to controversial questions. No institution needs it more than Sebi, which has grown into an uncontrolled, directionless giant in 22 years.

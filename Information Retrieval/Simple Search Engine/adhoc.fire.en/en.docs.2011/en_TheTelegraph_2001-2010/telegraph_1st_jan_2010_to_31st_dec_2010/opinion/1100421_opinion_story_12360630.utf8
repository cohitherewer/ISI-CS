The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | end of innocence
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        END OF INNOCENCE                                                    
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee must have finally realized that it is never too late to learn. But it is impossible to miss the bitter irony in his sudden discovery of Calcutta as an anarchic city. The Marxists cried foul when Jawaharlal Nehru described Calcutta as the city of processions and also when, decades later, Rajiv Gandhi derided it as a dying city. The trouble with Mr Bhattacharjees discovery is that it smacks of an outrageous act of self-deception. He has been West Bengals chief minister for the past 10 years. His party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has been ruling the state for 33 years. Like the economic ruin of the state, the decline of Calcutta is a legacy of the long Left rule. That is why Mr Bhattacharjees lament does not sound like an honest confession. Nor does it inspire any hope that he can do much to change things in Calcutta. The citizens did not exactly need Mr Bhattacharjee to remind them of the problems that bedevil their lives. Everyone knows about the killing levels of air and noise pollution, fire hazards, encroachments on pavements and about traffic dislocations caused by endless political rallies.         
	What the people do not quite know is whether the government and the civic authorities have the will or the power to end the anarchy. Few would, therefore, be surprised that Mr Bhattacharjees lament came on a day when a CPI(M) rally stalled the citys central business district for hours. It is even possible that his supposed self-criticism is only a ploy to retrieve Calcutta for the Marxists during next months elections to the civic board. The mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, who has withdrawn from the coming contest, possibly knows, like the chief minister himself, that it is a lost battle for the Left. The Left Fronts decision to drop nearly 65 per cent of the sitting members in the current civic board from the coming polls is a measure of its desperation. The move to field women in 47.5 per cent of the total seats is another such gamble. Putting up new faces for elections is a welcome move in a country where it is common for political parties to nominate the same candidates in poll after poll. The result often is that the elected representatives become part of the vested interests. The real issue for the citizens, though, is whether a change of guard at the civic body can make the city a little less anarchic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Let the young rule
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LET THE YOUNG RULE                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	The much awaited prime ministers press conference to mark the completion of one year of UPA II was a damp squib with zero engagement. Here was a god-given opportunity to explain the many contradictory realities that have enveloped us all over the last 12 months. Progressive bills, scandals  ranging from cricket to spectrum  involving cabinet members, ministers speaking out of turn and attacking one another in public, a cut motion saved by a whisker, an Opposition in disarray, prices of goods spiralling out of control, the mess in agriculture, and more, could have been explained by drawing in the people, sharing the many problems and potential solutions, and by being inclusive.         
	Reaching out is imperative. To avoid answering legitimate questions about the shenanigans of the minister, A. Raja, or not allowing such questions to be asked by scanning them beforehand, which happens at times, makes India look like a banana republic that is immature and exploited.         
	Is it only in India that political leaders never engage with the people except during elections, and that too from a distant rostrum surrounded by protection forces? Surely leaders all over the world are susceptible to attacks? Are Indian politicians just plain disconnected from the India they have been mandated to serve or are they fearful of the fact that they may stand exposed for breaking every commitment they made when they went out to garner support? All other nations of the world manage to connect with their leaders. One of the reasons that the Gandhi family dominates the Indian political landscape is because it connects with ease.                 
	Old ideas        
	When Rahul Gandhi has a press conference, he speaks his mind and does not shirk from answering questions. There is some humour thrown in as well. Lalu Prasad engages with the crowd, which responds, and there is an immediate connection. In the past, Indira Gandhi, Jagjivan Ram, Atal Bihari Vajpayee were among those individuals who connected instantly and with charisma. Constituents feel comfortable and at home with such politicians.         
	Regardless of the bickering within the Congress over P. Chidambaram, when he speaks in a press conference, he comes across as an astute man on the job 24x7. He accepts failure when he has to and comes across as a minister who is in control. It is for this reason that insecure partymen indulge in and are allowed to get away with criticizing him.         
	Ideas and contradictions must be raised and thrashed out intellectually within party forums. The exercise must be regular, and all factions must be encouraged to speak their minds. Congressmen and women never tire of saying that discussions on contentious issues are not permitted in party meetings.         
	As one grows older, one slows down. Consequently, energetic and clear thinking ceases to move at a desired pace. There is no sense of urgency, no impetus to take conscious risks, no motivation to change course and overcome the consequences of change. Therefore, younger leaders are essential if India is to move forward, cleanse itself of the unimaginable corruption that prevails and make a statement to its people, the majority of whom are under 40 years.         
	The Congress president needs to replace the ageing office bearers with the younger lot. The people who are over 60 years old in the Congress party, carrying corroded baggage, need to hand over their chairs and responsibilities to the young leaders who have fought and won their elections. It is a matter of shame that while our former colonial rulers have a 42-year-old prime minister, India continues to be ruled by leaders who are 70 or 80 years old.

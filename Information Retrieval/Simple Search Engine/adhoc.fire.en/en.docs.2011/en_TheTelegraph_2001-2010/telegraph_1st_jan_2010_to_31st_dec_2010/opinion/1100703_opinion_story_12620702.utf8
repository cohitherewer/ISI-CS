	Caught in two minds                  
	Sir  It is evident that China is at a cross roads (Class struggle, June 24). There is the agitation by migrant workers over dismal working conditions and poor wages on the one hand, and the adverse impact of the agitation on Chinas economy on the other. If China decides to suppress the workers voice, it will send out a wrong signal to foreign investors. China will have to contain the labour unrest in keeping with its political ideology, and simultaneously provide a sense of security to foreign investors. This might turn out to be a rather tricky problem.          
	Yours faithfully,        Debasish Banerjee, Calcutta 
                  
	Queen and her crowns          
	Sir  Saina Nehwal deserves our salutations for winning the Singapore Open by beating Tzu Ying Tai of Chinese Taipei (Saina makes it three-in-a-row, June 28). Nehwal had shown that she was in scintillating form when she beat the world champion, Lan Lu, of China in the semi-finals. Nehwals triumphs in Singapore and later, in Indonesia, have made the country proud. The whole of India would like to wish her a grand success in the forthcoming Commonwealth Games as well as the World Championships and the 2012 London Olympics.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

                
	Sir  In the recent past, no other Indian sportsperson has achieved as much as the brilliant Saina Nehwal. What is really heartening to note about this badminton player is that the girl from Hyderabad has always kept her ranking targets realistic. Her back-to-back victories in three tournaments prove that Nehwal has already become one of the most talented exponents of the game of badminton. Significantly, in a cricket-crazy nation like India, where cricket is considered to be a religion and cricketers worshipped like gods, Nehwal has managed to earn the respect of all sportslovers. She has proved that one can achieve ones dreams with the help of perseverance and dedication. The young generation, even senior cricketers, could take a leaf out of Nehwals book. But her success raises a disturbing question: in India, do cricketers only deserve the highest honours, and not other sportsmen who have also made the country proud?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

                
	Sir  After winning the Indonesian Open, in addition to two other tournaments, Saina Nehwal is now ranked third in the world. Nehwal has been unbeatable in the last few weeks. This shows that her hunger for success cannot be met easily. If the Indian shuttlers current form is any indication, her rivals will find it difficult to beat her in the forthcoming tournaments.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.K. Mohanty, Bhawanipatna, Orissa

                
	Sir  Saina Nehwals performance in the championships in Singapore and Thailand was indeed remarkable. Nehwal is the next golden girl of Indian sports after P.T. Usha. The entire country should be proud of her, and she deserves our heartiest congratulations for her efforts. Unfortunately, in India, games such as badminton, chess, hockey and so on do not get the required support or patronage from the Union government and the corporate sector. The entire world of Indian sport is dominated by cricket. It is time the Central government works along with sports federations in the states and chalks out plans for developing games other than cricket in the country.                     
	Yours faithfully,

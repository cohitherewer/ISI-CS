	When secular, democratic nations start  telling their citizens what to wear, they  end up making a mockery of the grand  epithets conferred on them. It is ironic that the  Conservative government in France a country  basking in the glory of free thinkers from Voltaire  to Simone de Beauvoir is lobbying aggressively  to pass a legislation banning face-covering Islamic  veils in public. The debate over the burqa has  acquired a knotty, if unpleasant, dimension in Europe  over the recent years. A majority of politicians,  and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy,  in particular, are anxious to get rid of the burqa,  which they consider to be a symbol of oppression.  Mr Sarkozy had gone so far as to declare burqa-  clad women unwelcome in his country. Given the  drift of his rhetoric, it is really not clear whether  Mr Sarkozy wants the burqa or its wearers out of  France. The mixed signals sent out by his statement  also complicate the arguments offered in  support of the ban on the burqa. As a religious imposition,  the burqa may be a burden on Muslim  women and violate their right to dress freely.However,  equally, the veil may be voluntarily adopted  by others, so that the question of individual freedom  becomes evenly balanced out in this case.        
	With the rise of terrorism, modern States have  been forced to review security threats. Indeed the  burqa, which may be used as a cunning disguise,  has a dangerous potential to be misused.However,  a nation that claims itself to be a democracy has to  work its way around complex challenges and resolve  them in a way that honours the first principles				 of liberalism. If concern for womens freedom  with a competent judicial system in place, should  be able to offer speedy redress to those who complain  of being forced to wear the veil.

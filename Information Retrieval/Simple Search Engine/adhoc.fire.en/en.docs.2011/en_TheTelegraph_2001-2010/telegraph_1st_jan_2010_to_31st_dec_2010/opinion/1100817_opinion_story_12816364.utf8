	Military dictators go absurd lengths to rob people of their freedoms. The general election that Myanmars ruling junta plans to hold in November will have nothing to do with politics or the people. If anything, it will end Myanmars hope for democracy for a long time. With Aung San Suu Kyis National League for Democracy refusing to play by the generals rules, the election could not mean anything for the people. The conditions that the NLD had set in order to take part in the polls were unexceptionable. It wanted changes in the constitution to reduce the armys influence in a future government, international supervision of the polls, and freeing of all political prisoners. It is futile to expect anything fair from a regime that has kept a quarter of the 440 parliament seats reserved for military officers and retains the power to accept or reject the election results. In 1990, when Myanmar had its last general election, the junta did exactly that  it annulled the vote after the results had given the NLD a landslide victory.        
	The irony is that the generals are parading the polls as a giant step in their seven-step road to democracy. All the previous steps have been just as fraudulent, especially the fake referendum of 2008 that endorsed the army-scripted constitution. The United States of America, other Western nations, and even the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have condemned the farcical election laws which set the stage for the November polls. But the junta has shown how little it cares for international opinion. Worse still, despite their condemnation of the generals ways, the US and some European countries have recently shown an interest in doing business with Myanmar. Such gestures can only make the junta even more desperate and unrelenting. The free world cannot afford to let Myanmars hope for democracy down. The international community has only two choices regarding Myanmar  either force the junta to hold a free and fair poll with the NLD participating in it or treat it as a pariah regime.

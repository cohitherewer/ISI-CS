                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CUT-THROATS AND CUTLASSES                                                      Suspected pirates off the coast of Somalia                            
	Pirates have a faint ring of the absurd, a suggestion of Jolly Rogers and eyepatches, of extravagant savagery and badly rhymed ditties. But over the last two years, piracy has developed into a serious problem. In the live piracy update maintained online by the International Maritime Board, there are daily reports of pirate attacks. The first nine months of 2010 saw 289 incidents of piracy and in 2009, 561 people were taken hostage. The waters near Venezuela and Indonesia are trouble spots, but piracy seems to be most rampant in the Gulf of Aden, disrupting a vital trade route and even pushing up prices of certain goods. Faced with this most ancient of crimes in a modern context, the international community is flummoxed.         
	The pirates of earlier times had been swung from trees or shot. They were seen as savage, alien creatures, Ciceros hostis humanis generis or the enemies of all mankind. They deserved no mercy. But such expeditious measures go against the spirit of modern jurisprudence. International responses to piracy seem to fluctuate between the older, rather Manichean, rhetoric and the niceties of modern law. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas defines piracy as illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship, taking place on the high seas. In the current situation, this definition has limitations. The international community has been struggling to plug the gaps with various other laws. In 2008 alone, the UN security council passed five resolutions on piracy.        
	Modern pirates generate a problem of perception. To begin with, the authorities are timid about branding people pirates. Many claim to be fishermen and, in some cases, they are. International agencies are slow to recognize that they may also be pirates. Moreover, for centuries pirates had been treated as enemy combatants and killed in military encounters. But modern laws view them as criminals who must be tried according to judicial procedures. The international community remains ambiguous on the matter. Resolution 1851 of the UNSC endorsed the use of armed force against pirates off the coast of Somalia. By the end of that year, 23 countries, including India, had sent warships to patrol the Gulf of Aden, prompting commentators to call it the Grand Armada against piracy. Although this was effective in preventing attacks, it failed to bring offenders to book. For one, international humanitarian laws limit the treatment of pirates as enemy combatants. Also, most countries are reluctant to bear the financial responsibility and the political implications of prosecuting pirates.        
	The trial and prosecution of pirates is attended by questions of territory and jurisdiction. According to the UNCLOS, attacks must take place on the high seas to be prosecuted under piracy laws. Later UN resolutions and laws under the Suppression of Unlawful Acts held that enforcement measures could be applied even within the territorial waters of a country. But such laws are rarely applied and even then, questions of jurisdiction arise. Piracy is perhaps the first offence to be recognized as an international crime, the point of origin for the law of universal jurisdiction. Other international laws, however, complicate the situation. The UNCLOS says that any State may capture pirates on the high seas. But only this State will prosecute the pirates captured. Such a condition can only restrict legal options. According to a recent agreement between Britain and Kenya, pirates captured by the royal navy would be tried in Kenyan courts. This seems to contradict existing norms.         
	In dealing with piracy, the international community has alternated between bouts of nervous activity and helplessness. The increasingly complex literature of international law seems to hold few answers to the problem. But the logic of the gallows has also gone out of currency. Piracy in the 21st century seems to be a curious anachronism, the eruption of an older logic in a world that has changed. Perhaps that is why contemporary laws and governments are unprepared to deal with it.                          I.C.

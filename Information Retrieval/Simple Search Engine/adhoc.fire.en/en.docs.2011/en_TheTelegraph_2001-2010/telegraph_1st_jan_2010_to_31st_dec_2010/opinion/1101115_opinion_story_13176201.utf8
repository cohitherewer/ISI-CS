	Adults could make a simple promise on Childrens Day: they will think. Think about children, that is. This is so rare in India that when 24 day care centres in Calcutta and Howrah succeed in giving almost 10,000 street children cooked lunches, non-conventional education and health checks on a regular basis it is cause for surprise. Non-governmental organizations run these shelters, with 90 per cent of the funding coming from the Centre, the progenitor of the programme, and 10 per cent from the NGOs themselves. The only drawback is that the children have to be let loose into the predatory night  perhaps destroying much or all of the good for quite a few. To counter this problem, the Centre has decided to fund only those NGOs which would be able to look after the children at night too. The funding would obviously increase.        
	It sounds perfect. But the Centre will allow only one such day-cum-night shelter in each district; that is, 19 in West Bengal. It is almost as if the thinking, so wise and sensitive, has abruptly hit a brick wall. While new shelters are opened in the districts, what happens to all but two of the 24 day care centres in Howrah and Calcutta? What will happen to the children now being cared for in all but the lucky two? Doubtless there would be problems in funding extra shelters, and they would not fit the neat policy now being formulated. But that policy needed to prescribe arrangements for the children using those centres heading for closure. This failure to think things through has allowed the West Bengal government to put in its thumb. It has advised the NGOs running the 24 day shelters to ask the Centre for permission and funds to become night shelters and has also sent in a request for 30 new shelters in the districts. Given its inefficiency and its flair for destroying what other people have built, it can only be hoped that the project does not break down totally. It would be a harsh price to pay for the Centres lack of thought.

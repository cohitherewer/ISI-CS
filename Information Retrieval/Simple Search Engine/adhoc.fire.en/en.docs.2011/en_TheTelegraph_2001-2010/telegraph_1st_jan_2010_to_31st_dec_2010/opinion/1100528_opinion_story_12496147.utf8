	Can you really teach someone how to write in 200 easy lessons? Apparently you can, if you go by the advertisements in career magazines, up-market literary magazines, writing manuals or writing programmes. In fact, Amazon.com lists 4,470 titles under the heading How to write a book. Of course, they are mixed with titles like How to write chick lit, How to write and sell your novel, How to remodel your home and so on. These may be different from one another but in terms of expectations and the implied message, the books belong together because according to the prevailing philosophy, constructing a novel or a poem is no different from doing up your house.        
	The trouble with these made-easy guides is that a good book is not something that can be put together like a toy aeroplane. Every editor knows that many books are published that are made up of clichs and turgid prose that offer nothing except high wind. Why are such books published when the editor knows very well that they serve little purpose? There are three reasons.        
	First, the prevailing philosophy says that no matter how serious a book is, if it is not entertaining, it is bound to be a failure. (This is as true for the book world as it is for the media that set the trends for the book world.) So, make the book short and entertaining with clear instructions regarding how to progress from paragraph to essay, the points to be emphasized, and how to round off with a conclusion. There is nothing wrong with this approach except that all the books are so cloyingly adolescent that they offer no secret formula for writing well.        
	Second, the quantitative approach to measuring the success or failure of publishing programmes: the greater the number of titles published in a year, the more dynamic is the programme. Numbers are not linked to sales. If any post-mortem analysis is done on this, it will already be too late.        
	The numbers game is directly linked to editorial examination of manuscripts  their quality and relevance to the market  and peer pressures that advise publishers what to publish. Sadly, editorial quality has declined over the years: editors are either too academically inclined or have gone over to the mass media that offer better terms.         
	Third, readers who buy how to write bestsellers want all the lessons in a capsule; they dont want lessons on principles, methods, forms, attitudes or lists for further reading. All these are too much trouble that they dont want to go through. So is the publisher to be blamed if he caters to this readership? It is easy to make and sell in the mass market, and that, for most publishers, is what matters.        
	Having said this, it must be pointed out that not all books are quickies; there are some that go to the basics. Starters try these. William Zinssers On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction, Clear and Simple as the Truth: Writing Classic Prose by Francis-Nol Thomas and Mark Turner, James Woods How Fiction Works, and Michael Greenbergs Beg, Borrow, Steal: A Writers Life. They tell you that there is no easy road to writing well.

	Light and colour are the two main ingredients of the paintings of Katayun Saklat exhibited at Gallery K2. It is not surprising that the exhibition, Continuing to Dream (May 18-July 10), focuses on these two elements, for Saklat is a stained glass artist trained under the British master, Patrick Reyntiens, and her works are tinted and embellished by her fantasies. Colour plays such a strong role in her inventiveness that even the architectural drawings of Diu and the still life are drenched in reds, yellows and blues of various degrees of brightness.        
	The lines of her Diu drawings are severe and geometrical. The arches and windows overlooking landscape are stark and unadorned, but the colour makes up for the lack of embellishments. It is more like a radiant presence that invests even the dullest objects such as tea things with greater weight and vitality than they perhaps possess in real life. Her kettle in a bright blue that one would associate with porcelain has a solidity that it shares with the still life of Cezanne, although Saklats choice of lush colours is very different. This is, of course, a question of associations and not a measure of Saklats talent as an artist.        
	Saklat paints with oils on canvas and the intensity of her colours often makes up for the occasional lapses in her freewheeling depictions of the interiors of desolate, perhaps abandoned churches with brilliant, backlit stained glass windows. The only inhabitants of these churches are winging owls, dogs and cats leaping around as if bewitched, and mythical creatures like angels and other mystical beings who are in all likelihood figments of her imagination. A pink horse flies across the face of a giant rose window with points of colour as if it were bejewelled. She alludes to a particular myth in a work in which a lion happily lounges with deer while a winged creature hovers over them. Her paintings with their free mix of fact and fantasy have a touch of mystery although they are anything but eerie.        
	The mystery intensifies in the little lama with the third eye. Surrounded by a huge bouquet of exotic blooms like gulmohar and canna, the child is lost in a dream world where the world religions coexist (picture). It is a delightful painting full of warmth and atmosphere like many of her current works.        
	Saklat has also done a series on well-known artists and masters of contemporary Indian art who have emerged from Bengal. She plunders their storehouse of images and makes free use of them in her own work, in her own special way. However, these watercolours look somewhat stiff and stilted although she makes imaginative use of their familiar images in this tribute.

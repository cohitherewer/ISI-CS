                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIMELY WARNING                                                    
	The governorship of the Reserve Bank of India is as high as an economic civil servant can go; after that he can only fall. Rather than take the risk, governors normally fade away; they set up a durbar in Bangalore or Hyderabad where ageing sycophants can come and pay court. Some, however, find such a vegetable life intolerable after having tasted the meat of power. If they have as much energy as Y.V. Reddy, their post-gubernatorial activities and articulations are worth watching.        
	It is just over a year since he stepped down. The first invitation he accepted was to speak in the memory of S. Guhan; the latest was in Triplicane Cultural Academy. The venue may not strike much of a chord; but the message was loud and clear. It was a warning against being liberal with capital inflows. The governor of the RBI will immediately see the salience of the message, for ever since he came, sudden and arbitrary controls on capital inflows have become a thing of the past. He cannot be unaware of the view, common especially amongst his predecessors admirers, that Mr Reddy had saved the country from the storm that hit the global economy after the subprime crisis of 2007. The contrary view would be that it would have been difficult for a country that was sitting on $300 billion of reserves  enough then to finance 14 months imports  to have a payments crisis. But stranger things have happened; and no governor likes to blot his copybook by having a crisis while he is sitting at the top of the RBI. So Mr Reddys precautionary hyperactivity was understandable, and so is his unease with his laid-back successor.         
	Whatever his view of what followed him, his message is relevant. He did not conceal his preference for sequestering the economy from global forces  for erecting walls. Till 2002-03, capital inflows were under $10 billion a year. Then  thanks no doubt to the worlds confidence in Mr Reddys monetary management  the inflows went up and up; in the next six years, over $160 billion flowed in. By September last year, the country owed $98 billion more to foreigners than they owed to it. If they all decided to cash their investments, India would be in more dire straits than it was in 1991. Mr Reddys remedy is to control inflow of direct investments, and to look at its quality. There must be no more investments in amusement parks; foreign investors must bring high-quality technology. This is straight back to the 1950s. Childhood influences play a great role in the formation of great men. But an idea should not be dismissed just because it is dated. Mr Reddy has done a service by drawing attention to the balance of payments. It is possible to argue that it is too adverse, and should be improved irrespective of what is done about capital movements.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The woman who wouldnt disappear into silence
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE WOMAN WHO WOULDNT DISAPPEAR INTO SILENCE                                  Louise Bourgeois died recently in New York at the age of 98. The range and intensity of her work, and the length of her career, make it impossible to classify her as an artist, writes Somak Ghoshal                                            
	To be born is to be ejected. To be abandoned, from there comes the fury.        
	 Louise Bourgeois              
	The fear and the fury of being abandoned are the two great universalizing forces in the work of Louise Bourgeois, the French-born American artist who died on May 31 in New York at the age of 98. My work is really based on the elimination of fears, Bourgeois once said in an interview. Life is made of experiences and emotions, she explained elsewhere. The objects I have created make them tangible.        
	To be confronted with Bourgeois art  even if one were to look at images of it in books or on the internet  is to gain access to ones own secret psychic dumping ground through being allowed to enter the artists mental backyard. The intensity with which she wielded the pen, brush or the needle-and-thread, moulded a variety of media (from marble to latex) into multifarious forms, and scribbled with a monomaniacs passion through sleepless nights, had an infectious effect on her viewers.        
	Faced with her gigantic, 30-feet-high spider, Maman (1999), or the no less towering I Do, I Undo, I Redo that she installed inside the turbine hall of the Tate Modern in 2000, we instantly feel, at a visceral level, that the air around us has changed. Bourgeois art is always already manipulative in the subtlest of ways. Even as she extracts the full sympathy of the viewers with her often brazenly self-revealing work, she never allows them to feel superior. On the contrary, our sympathy crumbles into abject empathy as soon as we step inside the electric emotional field of her art. Bourgeois had the witch-like gift to revive memories that we would prefer not to remember or be made aware of at all.              
	Throughout her long life as an artist, Bourgeois approach was unabashedly confessional. She returned insistently to her own traumas and trials, recounted stories of betrayal and hurt with a hysterics relish, and showed the way to younger artists like Tracey Emin, Jenny Holzer, Sophie Calle and Roni Horn. Her contemporaries included 20th-century masters like Picasso, Giacometti and Dal as well as much younger, avant-garde artists like Bruce Nauman, Eva Hesse and Keith Sonnier, alongside whom she was shown, at the age of 55, by Lucy Lippard in Lippards landmark exhibition called Eccentric Abstraction (1966).        
	Yet, even as she made a career out of her own personal miseries, Bourgeois managed to transform the biographical context of her art into a larger refuge for mourners and melancholics. Her work, as a critic noted, drew its furious energy from a world that is part psychotherapy session and part self-help boot camp. Bourgeois, who believed that art is the guarantee of sanity, would have probably agreed. Although Bourgeois approach was informed by her faith in the palliative power of art, she also happened to live through an extraordinary period in world history, which no doubt left an indelible impression on her work. Born in 1911, she witnessed, and quietly internalized, a veritable panorama of events  from the World Wars, rise and fall of fascism and communism, to decolonization, the sexual revolution and the coming of the internet.               
	The legacy of the wars, for example, found a chilling resonance in her series of headless couples, some with prosthetic limbs, holding on to one another in a deadly embrace, hanging from a butchers hook or lying inside antique vitrines. In 1938, just before the beginning of World War II, Bourgeois married the art historian, Robert Goldwater, and moved to New York. The shift to America spared her the ordeals of Occupied France, but also poisoned her early years in her adopted country with the guilt she felt as an exile. She would eventually dissipate her anguish through a series of totemic sculptures, shown in New York in 1949 and known by their generic title, Personages.        
	Leaning precariously against the wall, or fixed later to the floor of the gallery, these slender poles were apparently modelled on people close to Bourgeois  her immediate family as well as those she had left behind in France. Pitifully unadorned and insulated in their own silence, these shapes were inspired as much by the minimal forms of Brancusi as by the chiselled architecture of Le Corbusier, both of whom Bourgeois knew closely. But it was the New York skyline dotted with elegant skyscrapers  the proud verticality of America as opposed to the sedate horizontality of Europe  that influenced Bourgeois most.        
	These erect forms reappeared in a different guise in the nine intaglio prints, entitled He Disappeared into Complete Silence, that Bourgeois made under the direction of Stanley William Hayter, the English painter who set up the renowned Atelier 17, a haven for artists, in the New School for Social Research in New York. Illustrated by Kafkaesque fables of love and loss, this series, touched by Bourgeois unique sensibility, traced its origins to the Surrealists, however strongly she would deny their influence on her and deplore their condescending attitude towards female artists.        
	Ladders, water tanks, snaking pipelines and tall buildings are crammed within a claustrophobic inscape, drained of colour and human presence. Yet, the mute desolation of these forms, which could well inhabit a painting by Dal or de Chirico, is redeemed by the terse little tales of suffering and violence that Bourgeois weaves around them.        
	Unlike the Surrealist urge to experiment, often for the sake of its rather obvious shock value, Bourgeois early work grows directly out of emotions that troubled her as a wife and the mother of three sons struggling in a foreign land to put a harrowing past behind her. However, Bourgeois was compelled to revisit, over and over again, till the end of her life, the memory of her fathers prolonged affair with her English governess, and her mothers resigned acceptance of it. While she did resent her mothers attitude, Bourgeois also claimed to have been inhabited by a ferocious mother-love. Her mother, Josephine, figures in her art as the cunning she-fox, fiercely protective of her young; as the spider, the persistent repairer; as the femme maison, the woman who is inextricably fused, physically, with her entire house. Yet, every time an interviewer felt tempted to identify Bourgeois as the Mother Universal, she was quick to protest  One needs a mother I understand, she conceded, but I refuse to be your mother because I need a mother myself.              
	Unlike her philandering father, Bourgeois mother became doggedly industrious, spending most of her time on the family business of restoring old tapestries, keeping busy with needle and thread  a skill that she passed on to her daughter like a precious heirloom. Bourgeois was one of the first modern artists to make extensive, and strikingly inventive, use of the thread and needle, as she sewed her wry witticisms on to clothes (I have been to hell and back. And let me tell you it was wonderful), stitched grotesque human dolls out of towelling, and shaped deathly faces, often with their eyes gouged out or lips parted in agony, out of frayed tapestry.        
	In her restless hands, the paraphernalia of everyday existence, from clothes to beds to mirrors, took on a gruesome edge. The odds and ends of domestic life are perverted out of their ordinariness inside her cage-like cells. In one of these cells, for instance, a bed  on whose sheets the words, Je taime, are inscribed like a wild incantation  is the theatre where an androgynous body arching upwards becomes The Arch of Hysteria. Stretched like a bow in agony or perhaps ecstacy, this headless, limbless creature rises out of the jilted squalor of life, out of a past that can only be revisited in sleep. It comes out of a depth of the self that one dare not reach when awake. Calling up the fear of solitary confinement, reminiscent of war-time subterranean bunkers, Bourgeois cells are the precursors of Damien Hirsts dystopic glass rooms.        
	It is as much a measure of Bourgeois good fortune as of her genius that she managed to produce astonishingly original work well into her eighties and nineties. In 2003, the 92-year-old Bourgeois confessed to Paulo Herkenhoff, a curator at the MoMA, that memory has become so important to me because it gives me the feeling of being in control, in control of the past. While many of her contemporaries  the painter, Willem de Kooning, for instance  lost their faculties to senility, old age proved to be an exceptionally fertile period for Bourgeois. She acknowledged the limitations of her advanced years and proceeded to use newer material suitable to her dwindling strength. Consequently, she drew and doodled more extensively during her last years, preferred to use materials like wax and latex that yielded easily, and stitched and sewed with renewed vigour.         
	But Bourgeois never quite mellowed. On the contrary, she seemed to create and live out what Edward Said called Late Style, with the intransigence, difficulty and unresolved contradictions of her art and personality. In her final years, her art became enviably direct, conveying the gist of her feelings with a dazzling clarity and conviction but without ever losing their complexity. She was often mischievously, and deliberately, elusive about her real intentions, forcing even the most confident interpreters of her art to dwell in uncertainties.               
	Bourgeois ferocious dislike of conveniently psycho-sexual readings of her art made her confuse critical opinion with her own, possibly misleading, interpretations. She claimed that the work called Cumul represented a gathering of clouds, and not the phallic shapes or breasts that everyone took them to be. Bourgeois was equally resistant to being classified under any one art-historical school. And given the sheer variety of her practice, it is indeed impossible to place her within any particular movement or kind of art  even when, as the first woman to have a retrospective at the New York MoMA, she is claimed by feminists as one of their own.         
	Bourgeois remained uniquely herself till the end. She continued to insist that she was a woman child, fragile as a reed, but ultimately remained rooted in her inner strength. I have never been able to find somebody strong enough to accept me as a femme enfant, she said, People see me as a mother. Im not a mother. Im a baby.

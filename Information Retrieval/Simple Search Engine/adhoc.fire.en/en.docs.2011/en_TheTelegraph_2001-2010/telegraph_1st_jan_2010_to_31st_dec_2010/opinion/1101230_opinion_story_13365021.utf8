The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | We tend to exoticize what we dont know
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WE TEND TO EXOTICIZE WHAT WE DONT KNOW                                  Diana Sorensen, dean of arts and humanities at Harvard University, tells Somak Ghoshal about the many real and imaginary journeys she has made                                            
	Diana Sorensen is the dean of arts and humanities, the James F. Rothenberg Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures, and professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard University. Thats quite a formidable introduction. However, Calcuttans are likely to take an interest in her for another reason as well. Born of a Danish father and an Argentine mother, Sorensen spent her early years in Argentina, a country associated with three great names that remain etched in the Bengali psyche  Diego Maradona, Victoria Ocampo and Jorge Luis Borges. Incidentally, both Ocampo and Borges featured prominently in a lecture given by Sorensen in the city, last week, at a conference celebrating Rabindranath Tagores quest for a different universalism.        
	Having admired her paper on the literary and artistic scene in Argentina in the 1920s when Tagore first visited the country, and also vicariously thrilled by the knowledge of Sorensens personal acquaintance with Borges, I went to meet her with some trepidation, only to be immediately put at ease. With her innate elegance and soft-spoken manner, Sorensen is an engaging conversationalist: an eloquent speaker, who listens intently and responds with a quiet intensity of her own. Having grown up in what she calls a binational family, she is also keenly aware of the complex nuances of a heterogeneous cultural life.        
	I grew up with a clear sense of the layers of local and foreign cultures, she tells me, when I ask about her childhood, I was sent to an English school in Argentina, where we studied everything in English in the morning, then switched to Spanish in the afternoon. So, in the morning, a good character  maybe a patriot or a hero  was glorified, only to be turned into a monstrous, imperial presence in the afternoon. As a result, Sorensen says, I quickly learned that historical events are always judged in a context. Encouraged by the great passion for reading that runs in her family, Sorensen knew, early on, that she would like to study what was called Letters in the Argentine university system.        
	While Sorensen was being exposed to a broad humanistic learning at university  she took courses in Greek, Latin, philosophy, philology and literature, among other subjects  Argentina was reeling under political upheaval. There was a succession of military coups, followed by elections, and then the army would interrupt the presidency and insert a junta. Around the time when Juan Pern died in 1974, the situation started deteriorating so rapidly that Sorensens family decided to leave the country. Her parents and sister left for Denmark, her brother went to Edinburgh, and Sorensen went to Columbia University, New York.         
	I had a wonderful time in graduate school, Sorensen reminisces, mostly because of the world-class library at Columbia. This was in stark contrast with her life as a student in Argentina, where university education, although free, exacted a different kind of price. In Argentina, the libraries tend to be under-funded because of the limited resources, Sorensen explains, Unlike in India, you can have a lot of trouble there finding the books you need, unless, of course, you buy them yourself. But the University of Buenos Aires, where Sorensen studied as an undergraduate, held other attractions, especially in the towering presence of Jorge Luis Borges, who taught English Literature there for years.        
	Hed ask me to read to him in class, says Sorensen, and then I got to know him a little as I drove him back from his teaching. In fact, she kept in touch with him even after she moved to graduate school. So I always had a bit of understanding of some of the contradictions in his political statements, which were sometimes a bit shocking. He was so focused on order that he almost forgave the army for all the terrible things that they were doing.              
	I ask Sorensen if, as an academic, she has been influenced by the methods of her illustrious teacher. If one were to evaluate him rigorously as a teacher, one wouldnt give him very high grades, she says candidly. So what was it like to attend a Borges lecture? His pedagogy was counterbalanced by his passion for literature, Sorensen says. Borges taught by reading aloud or reciting, and then by telling you, almost in an ecstatic state, why he thought a certain passage wonderful, what visions it elicited in his mind. Thats not exactly how one should be teaching  its not about value judgment, or simply saying, look how beautiful this poem is, she explains. But done by him, in his evocative style, it was like re-experiencing each text that we were studying. Borges offered a course on Anglo-Saxon literature, and Sorensen remembers him reciting extracts from Beowulf and The Battle of Maldon in the original. Im not sure Id consider him to be a model as a teacher, but as an experience for someone who was ready to be drawn into the world of language, forms and epic features, he was unforgettable.        
	In the courses that she teaches, or has designed, Sorensen seems to invoke a certain Borgesian myriad-mindedness herself. Imaginary Journeys, a course taught by Stephen Greenblatt that Sorensen helped create, requires students to explore that difficult, but pleasurable, faculty: the imagination. The idea was to replicate a journey, such as the Silk Route, in order to understand the dynamics of material and cultural exchange, says Sorensen. Students could follow, through the digital world, three ships that supposedly left London in the 17th century. One ended up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, around the time Harvard was founded. The other one went south, up to the mouth of the Amazon. And the third one got blown into the Mediterranean on its way south.        
	The aim, Sorensen explains, was to study, in a radically interdisciplinary way, every aspect of life that was brought to bear upon these journeys  ship-building, weather patterns in the 17th century as opposed to today, trade winds, the history of science, the art of reading stars, literature, culture, and even entomology. Students could trace these journeys with the help of digital images, maps, photographs of objects, 3D technologies and computer games. With ten faculty members coming in to give talks, the course turned out to be a unique interdisciplinary experiment.        
	Part of the allure of graduate teaching, Sorensen believes, is this privilege of expanding ones mind that comes with the job. Graduate institutions like Columbia (where she taught before moving to Harvard) and Harvard have international centres that bring the world close to you, she says, They allow you to be outside the bubble, put you in touch with scholars from across the globe. So even after spending two decades at her first job at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where she had an intense intellectual life, Sorensen decided to move to an Ivy campus.        
	The students at Wesleyan may have been less accomplished than Harvard students, but they were more willing to take risks, she recalls. At Harvard, I watch our students march into courses on economics, engineering or political science thinking that these are going to ensure them successful careers. But I try to persuade them to study the humanities as well, which they anyway get a chance to do under the liberal arts system in America, before choosing to major in any subject they like.               
	Sorensen feels that in our country, where there are extraordinary traditions of art, philosophy and religion, it is crucial that progress in technology or business does not overshadow Indias cultural richness. At the end of the day, what makes us human, after we have satisfied our need for food and energy and medical care, is that other side of our humanity, the one that we have to cultivate for pleasure and for the ethical imperative of having a citizenry that is thoughtful, analytical and has an understanding of its own and other traditions.        
	But then, tradition can also turn out to be a tricky burden. It is often the case, I tell her, that the West wants students of humanities from India to play the token Indian and keep off other turfs. Why is a student of literature from India considered more suited to post-colonial studies rather than to a Renaissance programme? I think thats always been the case, Sorensen agrees grimly. But no, we can help ourselves to all of it, she says, and refers to Borgess famous essay, The Argentine Writer and Tradition, where he had dwelt on these questions as well. We are not supposed to be writing about camels if we happen to live in the Arab world or about horses if we come from South America, Sorensen says.         
	She mentions that a Mexican colleague of hers at the psychology department was once described as teaching Mexican psychology. To me, that little statement encapsulates that prejudice. You can teach whatever field you choose to, but the problem is if you want to do that abroad, they can assimilate you more comfortably if you do your own national thing. So teaching a foreign field in the United States of America, as Sorensen does, must be quite a challenge. Yes, it is, she says, I have to create a bridge between an unknown world and the world of the students.        
	Sorensen believes that we must learn to move beyond the established boxes of area studies into which we are plonked and start studying dynamic geographies. Then you could do some Bengali literature in dialogue with the literature of Japan, France or Latin America. Speaking of stereotypes, I wonder, what Sorensen thinks of the overwhelming popularity of Gabriel Garca Mrquez and his contribution to the making of that literary clich, magic realism. Has Garca Mrquez done something of a disservice to the global image of Latin American literature? Sorensen, who has an excellent book on the Boom period of the 1960s, feels that the reception of Garca Mrquez has somewhat reified Latin America. One Hundred Years of Solitude works as a pleasure machine wherever you read it. If you read it in London, youd have a wonderful time reading about a banana republic, where people kill one another and have these ridiculous concepts that mix magic and science. But if you read it in Columbia, its a historical novel. Is the book, then, inescapably exoticized? The exotic, Sorensen says, can act as a seductive bridge for the outsider. But we tend to exoticize what we dont know.              
	I ask Sorensen, if she finds the tenor of life in India somewhat similar to Latin America. If I put on my Northern Hemisphere eyes, both Latin America and India have a certain sense of excess, of proliferation, with an abundance of good and bad, she admits. What I loved in Calcutta was that in every single conversation with someone here, there was a sense of encountering a keen intelligence, not to mention the proverbial Indian eloquence, she smiles. I find here what the Greeks referred to as metis  that talent for responding to an environment with both the knowledge and practical skills that it calls for. When I look around the streets of Calcutta, Im moved by the extraordinary cunning and inventiveness of its citizens. In Latin America, too, there is something of that same vibrancy and energy apparent in the daily business of living.

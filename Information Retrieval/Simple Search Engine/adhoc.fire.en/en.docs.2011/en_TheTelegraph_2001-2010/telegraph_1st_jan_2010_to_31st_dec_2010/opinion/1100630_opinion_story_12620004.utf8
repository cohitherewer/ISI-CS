	Half-done is rarely well done. The governments decision to hike petroleum product prices on Saturday was half-done; petrol prices were fully deregulated, and diesel partially, but in those of the supposedly more politically sensitive kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas, or cooking gas, there were only price hikes  by 33 per cent in the former, and 11 per cent in the latter. Losses for the oil companies  that will have to be financed at least partly by the government  will come down from about Rs 81,000 crore to about Rs 54,000 crore: Rs 21,000 crore from LPG, Rs 17,000 crore from kerosene and Rs 15,000 crore from diesel. The governments fiscal balance will look better, and many expect its fiscal deficit for this year to come down to 4.4 per cent of GDP from the estimated 5.5 per cent (this revision includes the better-than-expected revenues from the auction of telecom spectrum that just concluded a few weeks ago). But the government will also worry about the impact on inflation: some analysts estimate that the wholesale price index could be higher by almost a percentage point year on year this June because of higher fuel prices, unless food prices moderate; it was already higher than expected at just over 10 per cent in May.        
	But the rationale for the political sensitivity of kerosene prices  which is used mainly in rural India  is suspect. Kerosene is used mostly for lighting, and accounts for just two per cent of the monthly expenditure of rural households. The kerosene supply is also quite adulterated, and a lot of it is smuggled to neighbouring countries where prices are three to four times higher. An even bigger worry for those who look to the government for serious reform in the administered pricing mechanism of petroleum products is the protests from the Congress partys coalition partners would actually roll back the hike in kerosene prices; a one rupee rollback would amount to Rs 1,300 crore. Granted, the concerns over inflation are warranted. The hitherto weak monsoon  cumulative rainfall has been 11 per cent below normal thus far  is a bother. In the north-west region, however  the crop-critical area  the shortfall is just seven per cent below the long-run average. Industry is also justifiably worried that taken together with the fuel price hike, this raises the probability of a policy interest rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India sooner rather than later. The government cannot take too long to get the other half done.

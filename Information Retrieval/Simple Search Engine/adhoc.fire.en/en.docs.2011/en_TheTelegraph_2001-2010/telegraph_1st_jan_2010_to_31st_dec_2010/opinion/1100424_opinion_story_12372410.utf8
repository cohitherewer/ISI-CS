The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The seeds of Afghan corruption
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE SEEDS OF AFGHAN CORRUPTION                                  The flourishing drug trade, apart from war and corruption, makes Afghanistans future look bleak, writes Abhijit Bhattacharyya                          Strange addiction                                  
	When the American president, Barack Obama, paid a surprise visit to Kabul and had dinner with Hamid Karzai, they could not have discussed anything else other than the situation in Afghanistan where troops of 42 nations are fighting on a hostile terrain.        
	Before getting into the issues that compelled Obama to visit the war zone, one thing must be understood clearly: the president of the United States of America, whatever his political background, has to see things from an American perspective only. It is thus the presidents duty to ensure that his soldiers find their way out of the quagmire in Afghanistan.        
	With almost 45,000 infantry soldiers on ground, the US army has been principally deployed on the eastern part of Afghanistan, bordering the Durand Line. Thus, the force covers the provinces of Nuristan, Kunar, Panjshir, Kapisa, Laghman, Nangarhar, Khost, Paktika, Kandahar and Helmand. The last five are being especially re-fortified by the 30,000 fresh troops who have started to arrive.        
	The 4th infantry brigade combat team operates from Jalalabad; the 3rd infantry brigade combat team from Logar; the 4th airborne infantry brigade combat team from Khost; the 5th stryker brigade combat team from Kandahar and the 2nd marine expeditionary brigade is responsible for drug-infested Helmand.        
	In landlocked Afghanistan, drugs constitute the lifeline of the local economy. The sale of drugs fetches dollars and Kalashnikovs. Understandably, therefore, the production and distribution of drugs are a way of life for a population that has been denied access to natural resources. Given the limited agricultural land, high birth and death rates (the average life span is 42 years), coupled with endless ethnic conflict, Afghanistan is a nation mired in corruption. It is also administered in a poor manner. Asking the Afghan president to accomplish something that is impossible would be grossly unfair. Afghanistan and administration, as understood in Europe or America, simply do not go together.        
	Why does one say so? One just needs to turn ones eyes to the US troops in the Kandahar-Helmand area to know the answer. Marja, in Helmand, has a large occupation force. There is more than one coalition soldier or police officer for every eight locals. Yet, the Taliban have been able to launch an unrelenting terror campaign on their own Afghan brethren. So much so that the area belongs to foreigners during the day and to locals at night. Collaboration between the non-Taliban locals and the Americans is unacceptable to the Taliban.        
	How then does one expect the government to impart honest, effective, impartial and transparent administration in the midst of such death and devastation? Reportedly, the cultivation of opium is the main source of livelihood of the majority of farmers in Marja. The force had been instructed to seize the land belonging to these farmers some time ago. However, the same soldiers have now been ordered to leave the farmers alone. Marja is a special case right now, said commander Jeffrey Eggers, a member of General McChrystals strategic advisory group. We do not trample on the livelihood of those we are trying to win over. Thus, when it comes to the drug-trade, the tactic of violence has given way to the doctrine of peace. Is this not strange and curious?        
	Where is this cultivated opium headed for? To the grey market dominated, allegedly, by ISI informers, Western consumers, US financiers, arms dealers and fund-raisers. Obama, apparently, nudged Karzai to tackle Afghan corruption. But how can Karzai succeed, considering the serious charges of corruption that have been levelled against the Kabul government? Also, as incidents have revealed, the US may not be interested in dealing with drug-related corruption. Thus, only a week before Obamas Kabul sojourn, there were reports that the US was looking the other way even as two-thirds of Marjas fields bloomed with tall, red poppies. Today, Afghanistan produces almost 90 per cent of the worlds opium. The brisk trade, directly or indirectly, supports an estimated 1.4 million households in the country. According to rough estimates, a large number of people are dependent on poppy cultivation, thereby linking cash, corruption and commerce.        
	In fact, the American soldiers and the commanders themselves are aware of this fatal reality. Hence, either way, the Americans have fallen into a trap far away from home. Poppy forms the base of the trade in narcotics. It is illegal to process and consume drugs, and yet the American soldiers remain silent spectators in the Afghan countryside.        
	In fact, the Afghans themselves have the right to enquire of Obama and his men about the steps taken to nip corruption and drug-trade in the bud in Marja. Thus, Zalmai Afzali, of the Afghan ministry of counter narcotics, fumes  How can we allow the world to see lawful forces in charge of Marja next to fields full of opium, which one way or another will be harvested and turned into poison that kills people all over the world?        
	Afzali has a point indeed. Poppy trade, drugs, corruption, commerce, guns, dollars and destruction  everything is interlinked. Obamas advice to Karzai would make sense only if all the enmeshed factors are tackled strategically. But that is unlikely to happen. Hence chaos and corruption, death and destruction, are likely to remain a part of Afghanistans reality in the future. Obamas lecture to Karzai on corruption has no meaning at this juncture. In Kabul, corruption is the way of life, and is a matter of great significance to a people being ravaged by an unending strife.

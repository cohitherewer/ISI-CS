RAO                        Bidyut Bhavan, Calcutta				                                                   
	Independent regulation requires decisions to be overruled only by a judicial body following the appropriate procedures. Administrative officials and ministers with changing portfolios represent the government as owner. They have to be obeyed despite the autonomous nature of state-owned enterprises.        
	Electricity ministries are staffed by generalists, usually awed by the apparent technical complexity of electricity, and the likely public repercussions of decisions. The management of state-owned generation enterprises has much influence on government decisions. The state enterprise also woos the ministry officials in other ways. Privatization can remove the strong vested interest in the government to retain control over electricity enterprises. Distancing the government from the enterprise cannot otherwise happen.        
	Even unbundled electricity distribution enterprises have less influence on the government. Central cadre officials are at the top, and move on to other assignments from electricity. Politicians have only one interest  to keep electricity tariffs down even if it means growing burdens on state exchequers.        
	State ownership mires the distribution enterprise in subsidies and cross-subsidies, to help the poor at the cost of the rich. These huge liabilities have to be borne by the enterprise, since the government is unable to finance them out of its budget. State electricity boards continue to have large deficits on operations. The trend is again upwards. State ownership leads to higher operational costs, overstaffing, indiscipline, inefficiencies, little accountability of top officers or others for performance and government funds not being used for improving the peoples well-being. Generalist administrators as chief executive officers with short tenures have little incentive to improve the enterprise. Regulators collude with governments by withholding approval of legitimate expenses of the utility to keep tariffs low, and adversely affect the cash flow of the enterprise.              
	One of the electricity regulators dilemmas is poor information from companies for deciding on the tariff. Unreliable data create a mismatch between estimated (proposed) and actual transmission and distribution loss. These losses remain high in most states  from around 19 per cent in Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu to over 50 per cent in the northeastern states and Bihar, and between 30 and 40 per cent even in the developed states. Problems are the poor information base, the inefficiency of state-level generating enterprises, the inability of the state to pay subsidies for selected customer groups, the past liabilities that have to be serviced from an inadequate income stream, and the bellicosity of the Central government-owned outside suppliers demanding to be paid.        
	Load dispatch function should be a neutral function under the regulator, but it remains with the state electricity board, and the regulator regulates tariffs without being able to ensure that load and dispatch are balanced at all times. The regulator has only partial authority and the system is not properly regulated. The same contradiction exists at the central level. Inter-state transmission is regulated by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, but the regional load dispatch centres that do this balancing are under the inter-state transmission monopoly, the Power Grid Corporation.        
	In both instances, the interventions by the CERC to provide a fair playing field, to prevent grid collapse and to ensure that all parties have a fair deal are frustrated by the fact that the transmission company is state-owned and is able to get its owners approval to stall actions.        
	Two aspects of government ownership make independent regulation difficult: inconsistencies, gaps and ambiguities in government policies, and the fact of government ownership with the consequent nexus (vested interest) supporting the state-owned enterprise.        
	Too many ministries and many senior administrators prevent coordination even when the regulator requires it for his functioning. The CERC cannot regulate atomic energy even though all electricity, irrespective of its source, flows through the same wires. Similarly, the CERC regulates tariffs of the Neyveli Lignite Corporation, a Centrally owned integrated generator using captive lignite mines. Coal is regulated by another ministry, not the CERC, and Neyveli can hide extra profits behind high coal transfer prices.        
	Government ownership enables state electricity boards and companies to violate principles of good governance. Accounts, for example, are often not finalized for years. Asset registers are either not kept or are out of date, and it is impossible to know what to take as asset base for calculating returns. Or there is no record in many cases of the number of transformers, feeders and so on, with the board. Further, demand forecasts for electricity have been perennially overestimated and revenues and expenditures for tariff filings are revised repeatedly.        
	In most states, viability exercises under power sector reform have been worked out on bad assumptions of the demand for power. The assumptions were highly ambitious compared to actuals. So is the estimation of shares of extra high tension and high tension/low tension demand. The latter affects viability because much of the T amp;C loss occurs in the HT/LT segment.        
	Not surprisingly, the response from private investors to the few proposals offering distribution businesses have been poor. Investors perceive that the price-setting methodology employed by regulatory agencies is hostile to long-term investment. Some regulators routinely remove legitimate expenses from the accounting rate of return and classify them as regulatory assets, depriving the utility of cash.        
	The multi-year tariff framework also poses some problems for the commissions. Sufficient data are not available to correctly set the initial level and benchmark improvements which can either produce excess profit or loss or require commissions to reopen the issue. This would damage the credibility of the regulatory process. Two, principles must be evolved for sharing of risk if demand and/or demand-mix changes substantially. Three, the basis for laying down targets for investments in advance and the method for relating it to target improvements must be known. Four, there must be linking of the return on capital base to the achievement of certain performance standards, such as improvement in service quality, extension of coverage to specified groups of consumers and so on. Also, the regulatory risks faced by the other utilities where reforms are in place and tariff orders have been passed must be considered. Another risk is in securing political support to implement harsh measures for reducing inefficiencies. There are many examples of unnecessary appeals to courts by state-owned entities, with either explicit or implicit approval of the owners, namely the governments.              
	How can these problems be resolved, since government ownership will continue? One answer is to completely distance government enterprises from the controlling ministry. However, this has not worked despite attempts in many public enterprises since 1988 to do so. These include the government and the enterprise entering into a memorandum of understanding about targets and responsibilities. They are mere paper exercises since the ministry concerned is able to commit only for itself, not for the rest of the government.        
	Another answer is to truncate the size of a ministry after the creation of a regulatory commission, since it will be doing things that were earlier the responsibility of the ministry. This means the loss of power and jobs for many and, especially, for lower-level officers, and no politician or senior bureaucrat (in service) is willing to implement such proposals.        
	Government ownership and control of much of the regulated systems make regulation ineffective. For regulation to be effective, courts and public opinion must clean up the system, privatization, competition, choice for customers must become universal, and electricity markets and trading with adequate regulation to ensure fairness, with an independently run transmission system, must be in place.        
	The Electricity Act, 2003 has brought many initiatives: captive generation, trading, power exchanges, spot trading and day-ahead trading with the possibility of futures trading; mandatory open access is still distant. Merchant power enables investors to sell power outside the regulatory framework at market prices. Hope springs eternal despite state ownership.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STRANGE GAMES OF HIDE AND SEEK                                  How will the move to legalize sex work help sex workers as long as society continues to perceive them as creatures from another planet?                                            
	Sex work suffers from a peculiar paradox of visibility. Whenever people speak of it, they think of women  there are men too  offering sexual services in a vacuum. The clients are a faceless mass, not as visible as they would be as human beings engaged in the daylight transactions of everyday life. Sex workers become invisible in these same daylight spaces: to enter them, even to admit their children to school, their identities must be erased or changed. Here they do not exist but their clients do, although sex workers client is not part of the latters wide range of social identities.        
	To include the assumptions underlying marriage as well as free trade in sex within an official blueprint of society probably leads to embarrassing intellectual contortions, although, as the Supreme Courts recent remarks on legalizing sex work suggest, reality cannot be wished away. But even this reality took a very long time to enter public discourse. Institutional concern about the spread of AIDS, mainly about its entering the mainstream of society, infecting visible housewives and, sometimes, their unborn children, presumably because of the wanderings of their men, had forced society to acknowledge publicly that commercial sex exists. Sexually transmitted diseases were the chief concern, not rights of sex workers. Official visibility for sex workers has grown since. The work of various organizations has helped their voice to be heard; social recognition and human rights are now very much a part of the campaigns associated with sex workers. Their clients, however, remain invisible.        
	In this context, what would legalizing sex work mean? Laws to protect sex workers from exploitation, for example, the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, have, in some ways, made sex workers even more vulnerable to tyranny, be it of the police or of middlemen. What is illegal is soliciting in public places and sex close to a public space. This means hardly anything, but, even then, would a new law change that? Brothels are illegal, but they do exist, giving law enforcers immeasurable scope to enact their power fantasies whenever they feel the itch. India has never outlawed commercial sex work, but has simply made every effort to keep it out of sight. Only the service providers, that is.        
	The court has said that legalizing sex work would help monitor the trade, rehabilitate and provide medical aid to those involved. But who is to do the monitoring and what would they monitor? Implicit here is the assumption of inequality, as if by engaging in commercial sex, an individual becomes less capable of conducting her own life. Poverty and the loss of agency are allied issues, but the immediate question is about attitudes. The problem lies with the perceptions of society, which persists in seeing only the fallen woman as though she comes from a different planet, and pretends she can exist without a client. That is the source of discrimination and tyranny, not the dearth of laws.        
	There are other things that do need monitoring. The Supreme Court has said that India is becoming a hub of child prostitution. The failure here is enormous and frightening, and it lies in the inability to implement the law, not in its lack. It is not innocent inability, of course, for organized crime cannot exist without entrenched interests from powerful sections of society. Will legalizing sex work help or hinder action against child trafficking?         
	Then, what would rehabilitation mean? The returning of deserted wives to truant husbands, of bartered girls to their poverty-stricken parents? Or shelter homes, vocational training, and new jobs at the end of it all?        
	What do sex workers say?                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

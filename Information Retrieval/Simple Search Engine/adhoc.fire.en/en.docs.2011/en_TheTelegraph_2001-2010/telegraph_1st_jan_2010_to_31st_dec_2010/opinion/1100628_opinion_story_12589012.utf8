	Book wise                  
	Sir  The report, Kher dumps Hitler, India has takers (June 19), says that the actor, Anupam Kher, has pulled out of the planned Bollywood film, Dear Friend Hitler, amidst protests from Jewish groups. According to the director, the proposed film does not seek to glorify Hitler but is about his relationship with his mistress, Eva Braun. Glorification or not, and this particular film apart, deeper questions arise in this context both about the freedom of expression and the freedom to decide which film one sees or which book one reads. It is understandable that Jewish groups would be concerned about anything related to Hitler. After all, the horrors perpetrated less than 70 years ago in Europe on the Jews by the Fascist forces led by Hitler can never be forgiven. But does that abhorrence justify the call for a ban in India on Hitlers autobiography, which, after all, has been published internationally? This seems to border a bit on extremism.          
	Anyone with knowledge of history would know that the Third Reich, and what followed, would have come about even if Hitler had not written Mein Kampf  it did not require a book to bring about World War II and the concentration camps. And if one is aware of Hitlers delusions about the superiority of the Aryan race then one would also know that if the Nazis had not been defeated, Hitlers project of racial extermination would probably have been extended to include brown-skinned Asians too. Yet Mein Kampf has takers in Asian countries, as it has in the West. No one in India has preached anti-Semitism, and no thugs are shouting Sieg Heil in this country after reading the book, despite its spiralling sales. To read the book is not necessarily to believe in its ideology. How many have actually read the book from cover to cover is another question altogether.          
	If certain communities feel disturbed when they see the book in Indian markets or learn that a film is being made on Hitler, then they are free not to buy the book or watch the film. Banning the book altogether would inevitably suggest the working of vote-bank politics in a country from which already a writer of renown such as Taslima Nasreen has been forced to flee in order to pacify certain groups of people.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Nothing new          
	Sir  Ever since Mamata Banerjee announced a year ago that she would make Digha another Goa, I had wanted to visit Digha. So I went on a holiday there from June 14 to June 17. The Tamralipta Express to Digha stopped at five unscheduled places. True to the tradition of the Indian Railways, vendors and beggars made passengers lives miserable. In the compartments, music was being played loudly by some unruly young men, causing sound pollution, but nobody protested.          
	Digha has not changed. There are plenty of potholes in the roads. But the most dangerous aspect of the place is the presence of the cycle vans and motorized rickshaws plying without licence. Hotels are trying to cope with the ever-increasing load of tourists. They have no fixed rates, which are maintained only by the government hotel and by the Digha Sankarpur Development Authoritys Saikatabas. Private hotels cheat tourists indiscriminately. Food is costly compared to that in Calcutta or in Burdwan.          
	Digha has two beaches  old and new. After sunset, tourists are unable to watch the sea as unlicensed shops block the sea front. It seems that because of political compulsions, authorities are unable to take action.          
	There can be no comparison between Goa and Digha. Goa is a state; Digha a subdivisional town. The view of the river Mandavi meeting the Arabian Sea from Dona Paula is a thing of beauty. Apart from these natural attractions, civic amenities, down to banks and ATMs, are very much present in Goa. Digha has no branches of any important bank, let alone ATMs. There are no cyber cafs, not even a book shop in Digha. Sorry, Mamata Banerjee, Digha will never be Goa.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Tapan Das Gupta, Dashghora, Burdwan 

                
	Sir  In the Sealdah-Lalgola section of the Eastern Railways, the stretch between Rezinagar and Beldanga, a distance of about five kilometres, got damaged in the floods of 1978. After that, 32 long years have elapsed. Yet till today, trains negotiate the stretch at about 10 kilometres per hour. It is sad that in this age of rapid progress, the Indian Railways have not cared to upgrade its tracks in this line. Will Mamata Banerjee look into the matter?                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Roopayan Bhattacharyay, Berhampore, Murshidabad

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A nation decoded through images
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A NATION DECODED THROUGH IMAGES                                                                  
	MAZAAR, BAZAAR: DESIGN AND VISUAL CULTURE IN PAKISTAN (Oxford, Rs 3,000), edited and designed by Saima Zaidi, is a beautiful volume, although a little intimidating in its weight and size. Ranging from the democratization of religious symbols and images among the colourful secular decoration of trucks and minibuses, through flamboyant film posters, calligraphy in public spaces as well as in mosques and madrasas, the crowded writing in newspapers, the evolution of advertisements, the design and significance of the flag, to stamps, currency notes and matchbox labels and then to miniature painting, Indus valley seals and Gandhara art, the book attempts to recreate and interpret the visual experience of Pakistan. Perhaps the green dust cover and endpapers are meant to ensure that the reader does not forget the specific culture that is being explored.         
	No work on the visual experience of the subcontinent can escape the impact of vivid colours, slightly mad juxtapositions of design, the uncontrollable cascades of things and images, and an edgy, addictive excitement. The volume reproduces this silent, highly attractive clamour that finds an oasis of peace only occasionally, as at the entrance of a mosque bordered with calligraphic writing (Top). What the book could have done, perhaps, is seek better balance between ambition and coherence. The sweep of the volume, divided into five sections and containing 33 essays which explore the interactions between visuals and their viewers, needed a firmer core than is offered by the editors definition  The term visual culture covers popular and mass culture and ancient and contemporary art and architecture, but does not include the moving image. The first four sections seem chiefly focused on the experience of images in contemporary urban Pakistan, from studio backdrops for photography to symbols of political parties, and hence cohere well. The evolution of the advertisement is particularly well illustrated (Right). The essays, by experts from different disciplines, discuss the background and evolution of designs and images, their resonance and impact, sometimes by focusing simply on the aesthetic representation of one traditional activity and its connection to a particular strain of culture, as in the masculinist ethos of the wrestler (Bottom).         
	The pre-Partition section is the one that gropes a little, in spite of the fascinating essay, more picture commentary, on matchbox labels  truly a collectors delight  and the discussion of advertising and propaganda during World War I printed by the lithography department of the art school established by the British (Left). But, however interesting in themselves, the essays on miniature paintings, Indus Valley seals and Gandhara art seem a little out of place. What the modern Pakistani will see in a museum perhaps, or at a tourist spot?

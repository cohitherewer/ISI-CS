	Dastak, a Delhi group, has spent the last five years reviving the extinct Urdu oral tradition of Dastangoi, guided by S.R. Faruqi. Their recital, concluding The Parks New Festival, opened a window into Mughal times and beyond, when narration of Islamic romances formed a court entertainment that fascinated no less than Akbar, who patronized it. By the 19th century, the Persian linguistic medium trickled down into an Urdu avatar, in which language the longest of such medieval epics, the Dastan-e-Amir Hamza, had burgeoned. But the performing art died out.        
	Mahmood Farooqui and Danish Husain have reinvented the solo original in duo format, and recreated an hours sample in seated storytelling mode of the episodes in which Amar, Hamzas comrade, encounters the feared dragon army of Afrasiyab, evil emperor of sorcerers, and one of Amars disciples disguises himself as an enchantress to distract Afrasiyabs general. Mostly facing the audience, occasionally each other, the pair displayed impressive memory and stamina, and employed humour and contemporary allusions to enliven the fantastical tale, supplementing the scripts intrinsic variety in the shape of stichomythic exchanges and nasr-e-muquaffa (rhymed prose) to break up the lengthy narrative passages. To resurrect it fully, they need to work in more of spontaneous improvization on topical matters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Married or not
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MARRIED OR NOT                                  The Supreme Court recently held that a live-in partner is also entitled to maintenance. Will this pave the way for a law governing the rights of couples who cohabit, asks Smitha Verma                                            
	The schools in Delhi didnt have a problem with Promila Patels son  it was the mother they couldnt come to terms with. Patel found that every nursery school she took her son to turned down his application. And this was after Patel told them that she was not married to her partner.        
	Finally, Patel decided not to give the details of her live-in relationship with her sons father. And the boy got admission. The school didnt ask for a marriage certificate as they presumed we were married, she says.        
	Four years later, Patel believes the problems may just get worse for women like her. In a significant ruling last month, the Supreme Court said that to qualify for maintenance, the couple must have voluntarily cohabited and presented themselves to the world as akin to spouses for a significant period of time. The court also said that both the partners need to be unmarried for maintenance to be considered. My partner was still married  in the process of getting a divorce at that time. This kind of ruling can put couples like us in a difficult spot, says Patel.        
	In September, another bench of the Supreme Court ruled that a long standing live-in relationship was as good as a marriage, holding that children born out of wedlock in such cases had legal rights. It also laid down that a female live-in partner could claim maintenance only if the relationship meets certain conditions and does not amount just to a one-night stand or a few weekends together. In fact, it ruled out maintenance if either of the partners is married to someone else at the time of the relationship.        
	The Supreme Court ruling was in response to the judgments of a Tamil Nadu family court and the Madras High Court, both of which had awarded maintenance to a woman, even though her live-in partner claimed that he was married to another woman.        
	Critics feel that the Supreme Court ruling that the partners need to be unmarried to claim maintenance is not fair on women. In many cases, women are unaware that the man has another wife. It is only when problems arise in such relationships and the woman approaches the court for maintenance that the husband retaliates by stating that he was previously married, says Mumbai-based womens rights activist and lawyer Flavia Agnes.        
	In fact, Agnes believes, The Supreme Court ruling will have an adverse effect on a lot of women in India, particularly in the rural areas, smaller towns as well as poor women in urban areas.        
	The other drawback of the ruling, say experts, is that it does not define what constitutes a significant period of time during which a couple ought to have cohabited for them to be treated on a par with married couples. There have been cases of maintenance where long-term meant 10 to 15 years. But there have also been cases where three to four year-old relationships have come up to the court for maintenance, says Supreme Court advocate M.M. Krishnamani. The judgment has left everything open to interpretation, stresses Sudha Sundararaman, national general secretary, All India Democratic Womens Association.        
	This despite the fact that under the provisions of the Domestic Violence Act (DVA), 2005, a woman in a live-in relationship can seek legal relief against her partner in case of abuse and harassment. Section 2 (g) of the DVA provides that a relationship between two individuals who live together or have lived together in the past is considered a domestic relationship in the nature of marriage. Moreover, a woman who is subject to any form of violence in a live-in relationship (as in a marital relationship) can file a complaint under section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. She can also seek relief through protection orders, compensation and interim orders citing Sections 18 to 23 of the DVA.        
	But abuse and harassment are not the only issues that need to be addressed in live-in relationships. Many unmarried couples believe that their relationship needs to be defined legally, because when one of them leaves the other there is very little that the deserted partner can do for redress, unlike married men and women who can move court.        
	According to Rekha Koratkar, former president of the Pune Family Court Lawyers Association, the courts intend to make people responsible. The law is for those women who have been faithfully residing with a man and has been cheated upon, says Koratkar.        
	Take Anupama Thakur, a marketing professional in Mumbai, who lived with her partner for 10 years and had a son. And then one day he walked away, leaving her severely depressed. Her performance at work suffered and she almost lost her job. The split led to such bitterness that Thakur does not allow her former partner to meet their son.        
	The recent rulings could make a difference to people like Thakur. Laws for live-in couples would mean that neither partner can walk out on the other arbitrarily. And they could also mean that both partners would have visiting rights where children are concerned.        
	Many believe that the rulings on live-in relationships will now lead to actual laws. The Supreme Court can only pass judgments. It is a matter for the legislature to take up now and frame a law, says Krishnamani.        
	People living with their partners are eagerly waiting for that, because the law, as it stands, makes life difficult for couples who opt not to marry. They face several practical problems, as Delhi resident Joseph Chakola, who has been living with his partner for two years, points out. The biggest problem we faced was getting a rent deed in our joint names. Since the relationship isnt legally sanctioned we had to get separate rent deeds, says Chakola, a professional golfer. His partner, Alessandra Sikand, who works in the hospitality industry, faced a similar problem while applying for a gas connection in their joint names. You cant think of having anything jointly, rues Chakola.        
	Calcutta resident Tripti Dey, who started living with her partner a year ago, says she has to run from pillar to post for all matters that necessitate paperwork. She couldnt write her partners name as a guarantor for a loan application. The guarantor had to be either the spouse or the father, so eventually I put in my fathers name, she says.        
	Clearly, a well thought out law that protects the rights of live-in partners is the need of the hour. And one hopes the Supreme Court rulings will pave the way for that.

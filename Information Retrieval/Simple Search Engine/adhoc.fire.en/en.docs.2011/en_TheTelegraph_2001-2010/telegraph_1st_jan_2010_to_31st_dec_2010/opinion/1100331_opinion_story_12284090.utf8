	Q: Our parents died intestate. I have three brothers. I wish to sell my share of the land and the house but my brothers are not agreeing to this. Nor are they ready to buy out my share. They have also refused to sign any transfer (of my share) deed. Can I get my share without a partition suit? I cannot serve any written intimation to them as their present addresses are not known to me. Under the circumstances, can I serve a notice for a partition suit through a newspaper?  
	NAME WITHHELD  A: No, you cannot get your share without instituting a partition suit against your brothers. But before instituting the suit you should serve your brothers a legal notice claiming your share. But you cannot give such notice through a daily newspaper.    
	Q: If a will is made on plain paper and bears the signatures of two witnesses but is not registered, will it be accepted legally? I was told that State Bank of India accepts such wills for disbursement of money from concerned accounts. Is this true?  
	P.K. Banerjee, Calcutta  
	A: As per The Registration Act, 1908, registration of a will is not compulsory. Neither is it necessarily to be made on stamp paper. Nevertheless, registration is desirable. In general, banks do disburse the money in the accounts of the deceased if the claimant has obtained a probate of the will of the deceased or has obtained a succession certificate from the court.    
	Q:When we took possession of our flats two years ago, the promoter of our building had promised to give us the completion certificate. But he has not done so as yet. After repeated reminders he told us that a completion certificate was not compulsory. The mutation of all the flats has been done. Will there be any problem later if we do not have the completion certificate?  
	H.S. Nath, Calcutta  
	A: A completion certificate is certainly a compulsory formality as per the provisions contained in Section 403 of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1980. A completion certificate is basically a permit given by the municipal commissioner, certifying that the building is fit to be occupied. In the absence of a completion certificate no person shall be allowed to occupy any such building within the corporation area.

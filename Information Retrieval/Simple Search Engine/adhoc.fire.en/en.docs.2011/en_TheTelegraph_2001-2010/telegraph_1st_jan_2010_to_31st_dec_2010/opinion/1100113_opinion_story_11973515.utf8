	Bertrand Russell once said that collective fear stimulates herd instinct, and tends to produce ferocity towards those who are not regarded as members of the herd. And it has. For a few weeks now, fear about a possible hike in interest rates seemed to have gripped several groups of people, business associations and sections of corporate India, and all of them have expressed virtually the same fears in a very vehement manner: that higher interest rates are not yet justified, they will choke the incipient economic recovery and damage the 9 per cent growth prospects that India wants and can return to quickly. But among other groups of analysts and economists, there is a parallel set of fears: high inflation (already, food prices have risen rapidly in the last few months) and the onset of another asset bubble fuelled by the enormous amounts of liquidity created as part of fiscal stimulus packages announced as a response to the global financial crisis. Raising interest rates has been part of the wider debate on deficits  and how they can be cut  and debt. Throughout it all, the Reserve Bank of India has been silent on the course of monetary policy and the measures that markets could reasonably expect.        
	However, everybody could be missing the wood for the trees, forgetting that the determinants of short-term interest rate behaviour  those which monetary policy affects most  differ from those that influence the behaviour of long-term interest rates. Second, the real amount of liquidity may be overestimated. Third, the yield curve, which represents interest rates from the short (one year) to the long (10 years) term, is already very steep. Fourth, capital inflows are very robust just now; raising interest rates could lead to a spurt and pose problems for exchange rate management.         
	A back-of-the-envelope estimate for liquidity is money the RBI takes in through its liquidity adjustment facility: about Rs 80,000 crore in mid-December down from its peak of nearly Rs 166,000 crore on September 4, 2009. Within that Rs 80,000 crore, about Rs 20,000 crore is a cushion for capital outflows if there is another global shock. Other adjustments reduce the overall liquidity even further. The difference between the interest rates on 364-day treasury bills and 10-year government bonds is about 310 basis points or 3.1 per cent. Long-term debt is already hard to finance, and pushing up short-term rates will only result in raising those at the long end too. Financing infrastructure, for instance, could become even more difficult. Higher interest rates mean higher rate differentials, more capital flows and even a stronger rupee, not something that would help exporters. Perhaps one should take a leaf out of James Thurbers book: not look back in anger or forward in fear, but around in awareness.

	It is difficult to predict when the Naga peace talks will result in an agreement, but few can doubt that both sides share a keenness to carry the process forward. The delay in reaching an accord is thus less important than the spirit in which the talks are conducted. That Thuingaleng Muivah, the top leader of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, found his interactions with the prime minister and the Union home minister very positive is indicative of the right ambience of the current round of talks. By now, Mr Muivah should have no doubts whatsoever about Manmohan Singhs anxiety to see the talks succeed. The Naga leader is reported to have some reservations about the Centres new interlocutor. But the success or failure of any peace talk is ultimately a matter of political will at the highest level. With the prime minister himself unquestionably committed to the success of the peace process, small problems should not matter in a big way. Mr Muivah and his comrades have proved their commitment to the ceasefire agreement as well. The result is a long spell of peace in Nagaland that makes the people desperately want the peace talks to conclude successfully.        
	However, both sides know that there are still unresolved issues, especially the two seemingly intractable ones of Naga sovereignty and integration of all Naga-inhabited areas. Mr Muivah himself knows of the governments difficulty in conceding these two demands. No state in India, no matter what kind of autonomy it is given, can aspire to be a sovereign political entity. And the integration of all Naga-inhabited areas would lead to the disintegration of the political boundaries of at least three other states  Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Both these demands reflect a search for a national identity for the Nagas. After half a century of rebellion, Naga leaders would know that a distinctive political identity is not necessarily acquired through so-called sovereignty or territorial integration of a people. The Indian State has shown its remarkable ability to allow the people to preserve their unique ethnic and other diversities. The NSCN, led by Mr Muivah and Isak Chishi Swu, can use greater autonomy for Nagaland to not only preserve but also reinforce the Nagas unique political and social identity. But peace, rather than war, creates better conditions for this to happen.

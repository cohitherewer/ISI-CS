                                                    RAREST CASE                                                    
	This is not the first time that the Supreme Court has spoken up against arrests on flimsy grounds. As it is a violation of personal liberty, an arrest should be made only when there is no other option. Apart from the principle of the thing, it also leads to great ignominy. Since people do not distinguish between a pre-conviction and a post-conviction arrest, the disgrace is the same either way. The social price is heavy, punishing the family as well as the accused. In 2000, the national police commission had said that allegation does not constitute grounds for arrest, and the power to arrest should be used in the rarest of rare cases. The grounds include, for example, the need to infuse confidence among victims of an alleged murderer or rapist, or to prevent the accused from escaping or tampering with evidence when that seems possible, or to restrain a repeat offender or a violent person. These specific grounds may obviously be stretched or manipulated if the police find it convenient, but the principle is clear enough. As a chief justice said in relation to a case in 1994, the existence of the power to arrest is one thing, the justification of the exercise is quite another.        
	Real life does not work quite like that, which is why the court has had to repeat itself. The problem is not in the principles, with specific rights of an arrested person during the time of arrest, the rights of the writ of habeas corpus and anticipatory bail all clearly spelt out. The problem is in the delay in judicial processes and the low rate of conviction for all crimes. In spite of knowing the rules, so to speak, there is a silent consensus in favour of the quick arrest. The ground for this is interesting: since many criminals escape conviction, pre-trial custody may be the only punishment they are likely to get. While there is earthy commonsense in this, it is rather far from an ideal state of things. And it encourages further flaws. When a poor or illiterate person, politically powerless, is arrested upon allegation, he or she may remain in prison for years without going to trial. Besides, there are still certain laws, aimed at containing political extremism, that allow arrest upon suspicion. These blur the issue. But unless the delay in the justice process is eliminated, this fundamental flaw will continue to generate situations that go against the most meticulously worked out principles of the fair and the just.

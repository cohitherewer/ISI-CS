The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | THE age of neglect
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE AGE OF NEGLECT                                  MALA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The Indian Institute of Advanced Studies in Shimla is housed in a historic building that is quite special but which needs urgent attention, repair and conservation. It still has its major elements virtually intact, representing a bygone era when the building  its imposing architecture, carefully-crafted structure, and the environs in which it sat  established the then demand for quality and excellence. The Viceregal Lodge is one such edifice. Converted into what was to be Indias finest advanced studies institute, this building, and the institution it houses, needs to be put on the human resource development ministrys front-burner. It has to be restored to its status of being the symbol of the best environment and architectural space in the country for generating cutting-edge research, robust debates, discussions, ideas and initiatives.        
	National and international scholars should be in residence for short and longer periods to deliberate and discourse with their counterparts through seminars and dialogues. Publishing collections of writings, outcomes of the work done at the institute, should be part of the mandate. And much more.        
	The government of India keeps talking about drawing in the leading universities of the world and forging equal partnerships but there is not one academic or research establishment that is on a par with Harvard, Oxford, Cambridge, Heidelberg and suchlike in terms of a working and self-sufficient campus. Our intentions remain in the realm of a dream sequence and no director, however creative and willing to take on the challenge, is able to function because of the babu and the archaic rules of operation. The atmosphere begins to suffocate the best.         
	There is always an excuse and explanation for all that needs to be done. Some of the brightest Indian scholars are in residence overseas because of the uninspiring atmosphere in virtually every one of our national institutions, and yet we remain unashamed.                 
	Man-made hurdles        
	Since India is in the process of restructuring many of its arms of governance, and is introducing acts to correct the discrepancies within the endless social structures that rule our lives, the business of creating a few outstanding academies that will bring back the ancient reputation we had as a civilization of great learning, with universities like Taxila to boast of, should be a priority.        
	The shells are there and desperately need to be infused with energy and expertise. Some of the institutions are located in prime spots, like the IIAS in Shimla. An elaborate restoration plan has been presented to the people who take the decisions and advance the funds. It lies resting on some bureaucratic table, waiting for some babu in Delhi  ridden with boredom, with no comprehension of how prime institutions are rebuilt and charged with intellectual capital.         
	The IIAS should be made into an example of an institution of distinction that India can present to the nation and to the world. The HRD ministry that is re-ordering a great deal of the past baggage needs to re-order this one too. Funds are never a problem, since allocated monies are never spent, and for this monumental work a strong case could be made and scholars will certainly stand by the initiative. It has to move beyond looking like a CPWD operation  unkempt and patchworked, managed like a rusty bureaucratic machine dependent on babus unable to deliver international standards  into being a liberated domain that encourages intellectual sensibilities to reach new horizons. Will inaction and babugiri frustrate yet another dream that attempts to break the shackles of government control and unchain such temples of learning? Will there be a positive and unambiguous intervention that clears the man-made hurdles?

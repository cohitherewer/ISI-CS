The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | too long a wait
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TOO LONG A WAIT                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The newspapers are busy speculating about everything and have been unable to give readers a clear picture of what is happening between the ruling government and the Congress Party in the realm of decision-making. A few examples stand out. Clearly, the prime minister and some of his advisors and colleagues have a different position from the party on moving towards a hasty yes for the introduction of genetically modified foods and therefore, unambiguous support for Monsanto, as opposed to the party stance of deliberate caution. Then there is the nuclear liabilities bill, which the party is not satisfied with, and which the government wants to push through.        
	The Indo-Pak talks too need to be deftly calibrated. The sense is that the government is in some kind of a rush to clear certain agendas before time runs out and India is poised for another general election. And time does fly. Reading all that is in the public domain and listening to experts and those in government both as advisors and practitioners, the impression is that priorities and goals, methods and ideologies within the government have serious and problematic divergences with the larger party. The womens bill passed the test of the Rajya Sabha. The Congress president backed the bill with unequivocal support. Yet, it has been severely critiqued by Congressmen in high government office as well as by party officers. They claim it should not have been rushed through!        
	Over a decade of debate and they call it a rush. That in itself only goes to show how vulnerable the men in power feel about the possibility of a majority of women, who may, over the years, enter the sanctum of decision-making, empowered by the people. I have heard perfectly literate and otherwise intelligent men say that it would be a breach of fundamental rights to force women to fight elections from reserved constituencies. In reverse, we have had enough of a majority of men in Parliament, which they have abused and reduced to a shameful farce.                
	Forward march        
	Why can the collective stand on priority issues not be decided by the government and the party in the core team meetings, instead of representatives of both airing their differences in public. I would imagine this is so because decisions must have political assent and not be led by technocrats and bureaucrats, and the political positions in this case rest with the party. That is the real truth. The rise of the power of the babu and the abdication of responsibility by the many politically and intellectually uninitiated incumbents as ministers to their bureaucrats have diluted governance to a point where it has resulted in India becoming a confused and soft State. The party has had to intervene on all major issues to salvage possible drifts into unknown and unwanted waters.        
	Increasingly, the party is gaining importance as the vehicle that leads the way forward. In this context, if what I assume is correct, Rahul Gandhi will take on the mantle of Congress president from Sonia Gandhi in due course, continue to rejuvenate the party and set up the ideology of the government. Prime ministers will follow that diktat and govern the nation with cabinet colleagues. Following his agenda and actions, this seems to be the trajectory Rahul has embarked on. It is the base on which a new political culture will grow and mature, and hopefully replace the corroded fundamentals of the present and passing generation of politicians.        
	Inclusive dialogue, not insular governance within the party, will take the agenda for India forward. The country has to include the hitherto neglected and give them the respect they deserve. Human resource is this nations most treasured asset. It cannot be disregarded. The strange neo-colonization that is trying to enter through the cracks in a weak edifice needs to be distilled.

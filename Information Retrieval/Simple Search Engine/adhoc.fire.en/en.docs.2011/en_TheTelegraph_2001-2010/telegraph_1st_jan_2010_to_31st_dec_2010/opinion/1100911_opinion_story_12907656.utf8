	Sir  Delhis citizens are paying a heavy price for hosting the Commonwealth Games. The CWG have come as a boon only to the unscrupulous netas and babus while ordinary people are having to put up with unplanned construction, water-logging, traffic jams and dengue. Only the heavy rains might spare Delhi from its hardships by forcing the organizers to drop their ambitious plans. It is indeed surprising that the Commonwealth Games Federation has not called off the event despite the reports about poor planning and financial irregularities.           
	Yours faithfully,        Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Delhi 
                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that on a day when we salute those who have taken up the burden of spreading knowledge in society, one such individual had to suffer for voicing his opinions (Kerala teacher with hacked palm sacked by college, Sept 5). Instead of encouraging the victim, T.J. Joseph, to fight the extremist forces, the management of Newman College, where he was employed, decided to sack him. How could an educational institution allow itself to be brought under pressure from the Peoples Front of India, whose activists had assaulted Joseph and chopped off his palm? This only goes to show how conservative certain educational institutions have become.           
	The inherent conservatism within centres of learning has been highlighted in many other forms. Debates surrounding dress codes of women teachers and students are one such example. The attack on Joseph proves that even teachers are not going to be spared by fundamentalist elements. Worse, by sacking Joseph, Newman College has condoned the violence that was perpetrated on him.           
	One has also been jolted by the fact that the gruesome incident took place in Kerala, which has the highest literacy rate in the country. If such ghastly acts can take place in Kerala, one shudders to think what might happen to teachers in the less literate corners of the country.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Anirvan Sengupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  T.J. Joseph was grievously injured by fundamentalists for allegedly making a derogatory reference to the Prophet in a question paper. It is unfortunate that the Newman College management has now decided to dismiss the teacher. Christianity teaches people to forgive and be kind to one another. A college following such principles should not have acted in this manner.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala

                          
	Hell on earth          
	Sir  I have recently read a number of articles concerning the deteriorating traffic situation in Calcutta and its suburbs. I would like to draw attention to the pathetic condition of Dum Dum Road, especially the stretch between Nagerbazar and Seven Tanks. Commuters have to take this road to board the Metro Railway or the suburban trains. During office hours, the road is taken over by errant autodrivers waiting for passengers.           
	A part of the road is also occupied by vegetablesellers and rickshawpullers, while vehicles remain parked on the remaining space. To make matters worse, private buses pick up and drop passengers without showing any concern for the vehicles stranded behind them. Traffic problems on Dum Dum Road have persisted since 1983, when I was a school student. It is time the authorities took steps to resolve the issue.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Bipin Gupta, Calcutta

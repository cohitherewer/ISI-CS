	Humiliation, outrage and the right instinct have led seven young women in New Alipore to initiate a campaign they are calling Safe City. Their goal is to create surroundings that will enable women like themselves to step out of their homes without the fear of being harassed. They are actually replicating, in one tiny corner of the globe, concerns that have led to movements all over the world since the 1970s. Sexual harassment and molestation of women on city roads and in public transport are common in all cultures. This crime deprives women of full and free access to urban spaces and opportunities. Of the many movements to address this, one of the earliest was led by groups of women in North American cities. Their Take back the night marches have become a byword in the worldwide campaign against harassment of women in public spaces. Europe, too, had to begin addressing this problem by the mid-1980s. In Latin America, the regional programme for safe cities for women was implemented in a number of cities. The approach was flexible. The nature of violence, the areas where this was inflicted and the arrangements of specific neighbourhoods were studied. With the results, the activist groups spoke to public officials, municipal authorities and civil society actors, transport authorities and the police, ensuring their commitment to well-lit neighbourhoods, special monitoring, and immediate and sensitive responses.        
	Out of worldwide concern and various efforts has evolved a programme for gender inclusive cities of which New Delhi has become a participant. A conference on safety in cities will be held there this November. Bangalore has evolved its own Nirbhaya Karnataka programme in response to molestations of women on city roads. One of the programmes chief aims is to make community response and support possible, and stop people from turning away when a woman is being bullied in front of them. In such campaigns, it is necessary to be aware of issues as broad as womens right to free movement in public spaces as well as of local features such as economic and cultural antagonisms. In India, for example, the high level of politicization of society characterizes both the attacks and the administrative response to them. A grassroots initiative, such as the one just begun in New Alipore, may function as an antidote to that.

	An Indian for All Seasons: the many lives of R.C. Dutt 
  By Meenakshi Mukherjee, Penguin, Rs 399        
	Meenakshi Mukherjee was neither a historian nor an economist; she had no particular reason to develop a fascination for 19th century Indian economic history either. A literature and languages don, she happened to browse through Romesh Chunder Dutts historical novels in Bengali, and got interested to know more about this second Indian entrant to the Indian Civil Service who had his finger in quite a few other pies. One thing led to another. The two existing biographies of Dutt  one by his son-in-law, J.N. Gupta, and the other by G.A. Natesan  were both written too close to the illustrious persons death. The post-colonial era, Mukherjee must have thought, should lend an altered perspective on the Dutt narrative, so why not write a new biography?        
	Mukherjee had one piece of luck. In a by-now-almost-gone-to-seed library in Calcutta, she unearthed a number of Scrapbooks bequeathed to it by one of its founder-members, R.C. Dutt himself. The Scrapbooks run into several volumes and cover the entire span of Dutts service career and include his diaries, notes, clippings from newspapers and journals as well as copies of letters to his close relatives. This was rich material not available to  or not availed of by  the two previous biographers. (Lying demurely in one of the Scrapbooks is a 1904 telegram from A. Ghosh, a gentleman on the personal staff of Sayajirao Gaekwad, offering Dutt the post of amatya to the State of Baroda; in later life, the gentleman was known as Sri Aurobindo.)        
	A debate is always possible on what the format and contents of a biography ought to be. Purists will perhaps have misgivings about aspects of Mukherjees work. While she pays due regard to the ritual of chronological order in her chapter divisions, the themes she chooses for dilating upon may appear somewhat idiosyncratic. Towards the end, the biographical effort drifts into a literary discourse woven around Dutts novels. The book as a whole, therefore, is more a tour d horizon than a critical survey of Dutts life and contributions.        
	One criterion to judge the worth of a new biography can nonetheless be whether it succeeds in arousing fresh interest around its central character. Viewed from this angle, Mukherjees endeavour has not been in vain though. As one finishes reading the book, the character emerges of a native ICS who, while steadfastly loyal to the British crown, is still full of patriotic passion and anxious to explore ways and means to reverse the wretched condition of life and living of the vast majority of his countrymen. Dutt could never rise beyond the rank of an acting divisional commissioner: for a native officer, the injunction of this far and no further was taken as normal. Dutt found salvation in his prodigious writings. Apart from several scholarly and semi-scholarly volumes in English, he wrote novels and essays in Bengali at a furious pace. Defying the wrath of Brahmin orthodoxy, who thought a non-Brahmin like Dutt was trespassing into their territory, he translated from Sanskrit to Bengali some of the key sutras from the Rig Veda.        
	Mukherjee hints at the duality which must have afflicted Romesh Dutts daily perambulations. Entry into the Heaven-Born service  as the ICS was then described  led to an identity crisis. Dutt tried to remain close to his more conventional and tradition-bound relatives and continued to profess himself a Hindu. But it was still a case of widening social distance. He was increasingly drawn into a sophisticated  and more Anglicized  Brahmo milieu. His daughters had English education and married grooms of their choice, one of them even chose a non-Bengali.        
	Did such an alienation of the mode of living bother the person? Or was a defence mechanism at work? After all, was he not writing and lecturing constantly on themes which echoed the thoughts and aspirations of his native brethren and was he not, despite his official status, outspoken while commenting on the ills and deficiencies of colonial administration? But the behavioural contradiction did not disappear. Emulating the example set by his seniors like Dadabhoi Naoroji and W.C. Bonnerjee, he too had made up his mind to settle in England after retirement from service. These gentlemen, quintessential products of the imperial era, had, of course, their point of view. The Indian cause, they convinced themselves, could be most appropriately served by carrying the campaign right into Britain, and that necessitated taking up residence there and maybe even getting elected to the British Parliament.        
	Mukherjee has drawn attention to yet another incongruity  and this is Dutts approach to a particularly sensitive issue of the day. During his early years as calf civil servant posted in the districts, Romesh Dutt had come across the gross anomalies emerging from Cornwalliss Permanent Settlement introduced in the Bengal Presidency; it constricted the governments revenue-raising while providing total freedom to the zamindars to squeeze the peasants to death. His first venture into English writing was, in fact, the product of the anguish he felt at the plight of the exploited peasantry. With advancing years, his views not only mellowed, he even began to see virtues in the Permanent Settlement. It was perhaps an instance of the company one keeps affecting ones judgment. In the final decades of the 19th century, Dutt had grown close to the Indian Association, which was infested by zamindars and fat cat barristers who fought cases on behalf of the zamindars; these were also the people who managed the affairs of the Indian National Congress in its early years. Dutt, after all, was elected president of the fifth session of the grand old party. One of the main planks of the mild nationalism the Congress had adopted in that phase was the demand for representation of natives in greater numbers and in relatively more crucial positions in the imperial administration, something Romesh Dutt fully endorsed and had campaigned for for long.        
	Despite Mukherjees plaudits, Dutts Bengali novels are at best period pieces. His tract on ancient Hindu civilization too is eminently forgettable; it is a rehash of the James Mill primer that was once standard reading for the East India Companys employees, with some supplementation from Dutts repertory of the Veda Sutras. His other book, on the evolution of British economic policy and administration in India in the second half of the 19th century, however, still holds attention as much for its wealth of data as for its arguments in support of reforms in such areas as land tenure, famine relief and general fiscal policies. His comments on home charges and endorsement of the drain theory were, understandably for a member of the ICS, on a low key; he still said what he felt needed to be said. Mukherjees book permits us to taste the flavour of the debate that ensued.        
	It is sad that Meenakshi Mukherjee died even before the book could be formally released. Should there be a reprint or a second edition of it, one would love to see a more expanded version of the family tree in the appendix. Dutts children and grandchildren and their other relatives came to fill a very large space in Bengals social superstructure in the 20th century.

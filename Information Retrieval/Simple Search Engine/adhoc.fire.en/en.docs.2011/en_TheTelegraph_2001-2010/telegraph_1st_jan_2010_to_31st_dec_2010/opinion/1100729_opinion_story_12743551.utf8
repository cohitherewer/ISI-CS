The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A scapegoat for scoring brownie points
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A SCAPEGOAT FOR SCORING BROWNIE POINTS                                  Despite their virulent rhetoric, the main target of anti-Israel groups is not merely the Jewish State but also the moderate and the open-minded in the Arab world, writes Eli Belotsercovsky                             Time to choose sides                                        
	Among the hundreds of various conflicts that plague even this enlightened era of science and technology, the Palestinian issue would undoubtedly grab the title of the most publicized worldwide. This is particularly interesting since it is, by and large, a localized conflict with a limited number of casualties. The reason for such an unprecedented publicity lies in its perceptions.        
	These mostly include Israeli versus Palestinians or Israeli versus Arab. But in some circles of Arab society, a more Huntingtonian version of the Jewish (or Western) confrontation with the Islamic world is prevalent and contributes to the more apocalyptic view of the conflict. This image falls in line with conventional wisdom, contributes to an easier, black-and-white way of thinking and appeals to the mainly ideologically motivated.        
	During the 1950s and the 1960s, the Arabs shared a common uncompromising position that Israel, as a foreign outpost, had to be erased from the map of the Middle East. Since the 1970s, these perceptions have changed and the Arab leadership has gradually developed an awareness of the need for coexistence and, at a later stage, normalizations. This trend developed not only as a result of an Arab move towards historic reconciliation between the two sides but mainly due to the realization within wide segments of Arab society that Israel cannot be destroyed. This has brought Egypt and, at a later stage, Jordan, to sign peace agreements with Israel and normalize relations. Despite this, some factions within the Arab and the Muslim worlds persisted with the idea of the destruction of Israel. The threat that Israel represents for these people is not military.        
	Since 1967, Israel has not conquered any territories but rather fully withdrawn from Lebanon and the Gaza strip as well as from all territories that were claimed by Egypt and Jordan. The supposed threat of Israel stems from its being a modern, democratic state, whose citizens enjoy prosperity and freedom and whose Arab minority of some 18 per cent enjoys full rights and a standard of living similar to that of western Europe.              
	Having such a State at their doorstep would deprive some of the more extreme Arab regimes of their formula of Israel as a reason for all their woes, real or imaginary. Deflecting the political, economic or social frustrations towards Israel exempted these regimes from accountability and strengthened their grip on power. These regimes, such as Iran or Syria, fear that recognition of Israel will contribute to the spread of democracy, human rights and tolerance and, by this, will greatly endanger the sustainability of their dictatorships.        
	Despite their virulent, anti-Israeli rhetoric, the main target of these groups is not the Jewish State. Their real enemies are the moderates and the open-minded within the Arab societies that reject the medieval rules of oppression and tyranny. Far from the limelight of the press, many Gulf countries admit that their main source of threat is Iran. The Lebanese have for years faced a situation of having a state within a state with the Hezbollah, as an Iranian proxy, dragging Lebanon into confrontation with Israel. The Egyptians, who have repeatedly failed to break a peace agreement between the Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, are openly blaming Hamas intransigence for this.        
	The latest incident with the so-called aid flotilla has been most illustrative. The heated wave of rhetoric, particularly of the more extreme among Arab and Muslim leaders, was overwhelming. Interestingly, it is these leaders themselves who do not miss any opportunity to play to the galleries that commit gross violations of human rights on a daily basis.              
	But the fact is that the head of the Palestinian Authority went to Turkey and expressed his concern about the growing closeness between Ankara and the Hamas. The Egyptians, who border Gaza alongside Israel, have partially lifted their own blockade of Gaza which was imposed due to reasons that are not dissimilar to the Israeli ones. And even Turkey, with all its inflammatory speeches against Israel, is not considering severing or cutting off diplomatic relations with Jerusalem.        
	Any attempt to avoid being dragged into the politically correct fad of the day  the Israel-bashing festival  and to try to examine the facts, will expose a few questions that might shatter the widely accepted version of the events. These would include the following: Why were there no incidents and no violence on five of the six ships of the flotilla? And did this have anything to do with the fact that the vast majority of the passengers on the Mavi Marmara belonged to IHH, an organization that has been declared by Europeans as a terror organization and was banned until a few years ago even in Turkey itself? If the aim of the flotilla was to transfer aid to Gaza, why did the organizers reject the conventional way of shipping the aid through the United Nations channels overland? If Israels aim was to attack, why did it not do so from the air  why put the lives of soldiers in danger needlessly?         
	Why were Israeli soldiers brutally attacked by the so-called peace activists, and why was one of the most respectable Turkish dailies condemned by the government for publishing pictures of these attacks? At the very least, the issue is not completely clear cut as some have attempted to portray it, and in many circles, questions are now being asked as to why there was such a rush to judgment before all the facts were known.              
	There are many more questions that can be asked, and it seems that Israel can and probably will be a convenient scapegoat for any future attempts by certain political leaders in the Arab and Muslim worlds to score points in the domestic political arena. However, every responsible person has to take a stand and decide on whose side he or she is  on the side of the moderates or on the side of the extremists.

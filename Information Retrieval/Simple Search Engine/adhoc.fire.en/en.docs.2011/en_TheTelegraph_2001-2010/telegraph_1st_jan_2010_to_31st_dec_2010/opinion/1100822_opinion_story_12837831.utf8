The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a paying profession
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A PAYING PROFESSION                                                          
	The educated unemployed of India need worry no longer. All they need to do is join a political party and then rise to become a member of parliament. It is one of the best jobs that anyone can think of having in the country: the pay is good, the perks are fabulous and the work is minimal (at times even non-existent). The latest hike in the salaries and perks of MPs makes being a legislator in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha one of the best occupations in the country. No one grudges the increase in salaries and perks that MPs are going to vote in for themselves. There are grounds to argue that legislators should be paid at the same level as that of members of the judiciary and the executive. According to the same premise, it should also follow that, like bureaucrats and judges, MPs should then be taxed on their income. The fact of the matter is that MPs do not pay income tax. The reason for this exemption is that being a member of the bureaucracy and the judiciary is a profession, whereas becoming an MP is a service to the nation. An MP could belong to any profession  he could be a lawyer, a doctor, a teacher and so on  but he gives up that profession to become an MP and devote himself to helping the nation govern itself better. Because being an MP is seen as an act of dedicated service (and indeed many parliamentarians do give up lucrative professions to become an MP: Somnath Chatterjee, the former Speaker, is a case in point), he is exempt from paying income tax.        
	A rough calculation shows that, after the proposed increases, the exchequer will have to pay out Rs 21.8 lakh per year for every MP. This figure excludes the amount MPs spend on their travel (by car, train and plane), their furnishing, their treatment, highly subsidized housing in Lutyens Delhi and other hard-to-estimate perks. It would be no exaggeration to suggest, as a ballpark figure, that an MP will earn anything between Rs 50 and 60 lakh per annum. This entire amount is tax free. If the tax component were to be included (since this is a loss to the exchequer), an MPs cost to the exchequer would be close to Rs 1 crore per annum. This, by any reckoning, is a tidy sum to earn by providing service to the nation.        
	Watching the proceedings of Parliament on television or reading about their behaviour in newspapers, a cynic might ask if MPs do perform any service to the nation. Such scepticism apart, joining politics  a decision that could lead the person taking such a decision to become an MP or even a minister  should be seen by society as a vocation. In fact, society, as distinct from the government, probably already sees politics as a vocation. The days when joining politics was seen as an act of renunciation and sacrifice belong to the past. The recognition of politics as a vocation will remove the idea that MPs are doing service to the nation and therefore should not be paid as well as bureaucrats and judges and should be exempt from paying income tax. After the new proposal becomes law, MPs will be handsomely paid. They should make themselves more accountable and responsible as other professionals tend to do.

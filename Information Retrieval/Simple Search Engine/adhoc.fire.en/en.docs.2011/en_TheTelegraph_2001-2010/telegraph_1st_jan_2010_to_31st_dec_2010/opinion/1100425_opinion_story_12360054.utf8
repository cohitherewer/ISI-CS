                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Too much song and dance                  
	Sir  These days, viewers of private television channels are fed an overdose of the singing and dancing that seem to characterize all the shows. The cacophony generated by such programmes is nerve-racking. The suave and sober ambience of the once-popular quiz shows, which used to be the first choice of a television programme among all age groups, is sadly lost. Can some of these channels not think of a way of changing over to the quiz-show format that would also guarantee them satisfactory TRPs?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Treasure trove          
	Sir  Congratulations are due to The Telegraph for the startling expos on coal robbery in Birbhum. The captive coal mines at Hazratpur in Borjore, jointly operated by the state and the Emta Group, yield a better quality of coal than Eastern Coalfields Limited. But the government still seems reluctant to preserve the Borjore coal units.          
	However, it appears that the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has now woken up from his deep slumber and ordered a crackdown on the coal thieves (Coal-runners find protectors in khaki, April 19). But such a step alone is unlikely to put an end to the well-planned coal racket, in which the villagers of the adjoining areas are involved.          
	The stolen coal feeds many illegal sponge-iron units, which depend on cheap energy for their functioning. These units should be frequently raided and their trade licences cancelled. All trucks carrying loot consignments should be intercepted regularly and the vehicles seized.          
	The presence of the police at spots where the coal robbery took place indicates that the state forces are stationed at the scene of crime to facilitate and legitimize the theft. These corrupt police officials ought to be identified and dismissed from service immediately.          
	Yours faithfully,

	From global to local          
	Sir  Mukul Kesavans insightful and thought-provoking article, The modern Indian (April 15), dwelled on the distinction between tradition and modernity. Kesavan aptly substantiates his argument with examples from his personal experience. This makes the piece all the more instructive.          
	He talks about how he saw documentaries based on the 1970 Mexico Olympics and on the 1971 Test series where India won an epochal victory against the mighty West Indies, years after the events were over. This, he says, is indicative of the patience that characterized people of his generation. He contrasts this with the impatience of the younger generation.          
	The difference between the spirits of the two ages that Kesavan describes is not just explained by the passage of time, but goes far beyond. A myriad scientific and technological revolutions in the intervening years have given the West an edge over us. We, in the non-Western world, can well lament the fact that we have been left far behind. But we must also remember that if the West enjoys more benefits than India, it is because the former has been blessed with many more technological advances.          
	Modernity is, in essence, cosmopolitan in character. It cannot be sustained by Indians, who mostly live in the rural areas. In order to progress, it is not necessary for us to ape the West and live in a hedonistic manner. Also, a lifestyle that is acceptable in Bangkok may turn out to be incompatible with the realities of Delhi or Calcutta.                    
	Yours faithfully,

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | raising a stink
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RAISING A STINK                                                    
	To the long-suffering citizens of West Bengal, the spectacle of the Union health minister being chased around by a cloud of bleaching powder at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital looks like some sort of perverse poetic justice. Thanks to the fabled inefficiency of the Left Front government, brazenly abetted by its health minister, Surjya Kanta Mishra (who was also caught in the powdery storm), public healthcare system in the state lies in a shambles. It is telling that the Central health minister had come visiting to look into the delay behind the Rs 150-crore upgradation of the medical college into an institution of excellence modelled on the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi. Of course, the authorities in charge of the medical college came up with a quickfix to cover up their long negligence of the institution; having carried on in their jobs for years without any sense of accountability, they appear to have been programmed to respond in this manner. Hence, the over-generous sprinkling of bleaching powder.        
	Over-zealousness typically leads to the exposure of shamefully fundamental flaws. The pungent odour of chlorine has raised other kinds of stink  a shocking lack of decorum among members of the main opposition party of the state who had come to register their protest with the Union health ministry. They did so by raising loud slogans in a silence zone and causing great distress to the patients. This only showed the vacuity of their own outrage. The demonstrators showed no respect to the very people they pledged to lobby for in the first place. The sordidness of the situation has been emphasized by two added revelations  the shocking news of funds allocated to public healthcare lying unused due to bureaucratic muddle or sheer uninterest of the employees, even as people lay dying in government hospitals; and a young girl in rural Bengal getting polio in spite of being vaccinated against the disease. Health officials in the state need to wake up as soon as possible. This is the 21st century, and the rot has gone too deep. Bleaching powder is simply no good.

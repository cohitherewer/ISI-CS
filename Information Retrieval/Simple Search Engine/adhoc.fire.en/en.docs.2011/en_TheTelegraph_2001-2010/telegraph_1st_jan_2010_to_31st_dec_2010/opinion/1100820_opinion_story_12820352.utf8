				       BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	It was shameful to hear members of parliament wanting a radical increase in their salaries and perks. This band of elected representatives, with a few exceptions, has reduced democratic processes to a farce. These men have betrayed the people of India, taxed their patience in an indescribable manner, and have roundly insulted the nation. Instead of being given more, they should be reprimanded and given less. Let these men and women be thrown into the realities of a maimed country that they have misused and exploited.        
	Basic needs have not been met, simple infrastructure has not been put in place. Civil administration over the decades has deteriorated. Commitment to the job at hand is a thing of the past. Municipalities are allowed to get away without ensuring the services they are mandated to deliver. Governments are in denial, and leaders look the other way as they spend their time and energy tending to their personal, selfish needs. That is the truth which is evident to all and sundry. The sharp contrast between the pre-Emergency period, and the post-1977 decades that legitimized corruption and now, is crystal clear.        
	The crude shenanigans that we witness in the Lok Sabha and sometimes in the Rajya Sabha define the degradation of our times and put the quality of leadership, and therefore, of governance, at the bottom of a scale of ten. If it had not been for the entrepreneurial, innovative, patient and forgiving DNA of the people of India, we would have been in the middle of a revolution. With all that we see around us, it is inappropriate for MPs to ask for anything at all for themselves. They should be given a list of clear dos and donts, along with an ultimatum that makes them accountable.                 
	New standards        
	Each of the 500 odd elected members should be compelled by their respective party presidents to ensure potable water, connectivity, working health centres and primary schools in every district or block of their constituencies. They must most not be given free or subsidized accommodation in Delhi. While in the capital, during sessions of Parliament, each one should be given a room to stay in. This nonsense of occupying national property at the cost of the citizens of India is unwarranted. MPs must live permanently in their constituencies or be disqualified.         
	If they want to reside in large, sprawling bungalows in New Delhi, they must pay the market rate from their own pockets. They too are citizens of this democracy and must live by the rules they make for the common man. The prime minister can most certainly enforce this.        
	Disruption of Parliament proceedings should be stopped. Those indulging in such destructive activities in the sacrosanct Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha need to be expelled for the term. As citizens, we are sickened by the base level of proceedings in the Houses that has discredited this fine and vibrant nation. To leave such an untenable legacy for the large number of young men and women in India today is sacrilegious. Members must deliver before they demand.         
	Government accommodation and perks should only be available to those in the Central ministry. No individual preference should be permitted. Those who do not vacate government premises within 48 hours of demitting office should be forcibly ejected, as ordinary citizens are when they do wrong. Why should wrong be deemed right for MPs? If the 1,000 odd Indians who people the Houses of Parliament refuse to behave like honourable citizens of a great civilization and emerging economic power, they should be reprimanded in the strictest possible way to set new standards of probity and good sense.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | If the law would allow it, Sir
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IF THE LAW WOULD ALLOW IT, SIR                                                                  
	The controversy over the legalization of prostitution has been raging in India for quite some time now, and there are parties lined up in favour of and against the scrapping of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (1956) or Pita, as it is popularly known. Pita is a strange law. While it does not say that prostitution per se is illegal, it penalizes attendant activities such as pimping, trafficking, soliciting or brothel-keeping. In other words, it penalizes anyone living off the income of prostitutes.         
	Groups campaigning for legalization point out that if the law is done away with, prostitutes would be more secure in their profession since they would no longer have to live in fear of frequent police raids on brothels meant to evict them. With prostitution joining the ranks of other jobs, the social stigma associated with it would be removed too. Sex workers would then assert their rights openly, get their children admitted to schools without a fuss, and lead a life of respect.        
	All these may sound too good to be true, and perhaps they are. In every discussion of legalization, an important voice conspicuous by its absence is that of the young girl working as a prostitute. She is represented by various non-governmental organizations, social workers and even by retired sex workers. But what does the girl herself  in all probability a teenager (since prostitution, of all the trades, has the least appreciation for aged flesh), possibly illiterate, locked within the four walls of a dingy brothel lorded over by a madam whose wishes she cannot defy  feel, if at all, about the issue?         
	The essential question to be considered here is that of the girls volition. Did she enter the trade willingly or was she coerced? Given the dire straits in which large sections of people in India live, that, in turn, make them easy prey for traffickers, it is more likely than not that the girl had been forced into prostitution, and that too at an early age when she could not have been in a position to express or withhold consent.         
	In spite of laws, widespread trafficking in child and women within the country is a reality India cannot deny. Each day, thousands of minor girls are trafficked to the cities from the rural areas, to India from the neighbouring countries. They are sold to brothels, which use accepted methods such as rape, torture and starvation to break the girls mentally and physically. Once the girl gets into the grind, she has to cater to as many as 13 clients a day. She cannot escape until she has paid back the brothel-owner the amount for which the latter had bought her from the trafficker.         
	Alok of Sanlaap, an NGO that works with trafficked women, says that an occupation that is rooted in violence can never be legalized. For him, legalization would only concentrate power in the hands of pimps, traffickers, brothel-keepers and the like without doing anything for the betterment of the sex workers themselves. Exploitation would increase, since the little fear of punishment that still operates in the minds of traffickers now would be wiped out as legalization makes it easier for them to bribe the police and other representatives of the law.         
	Large-scale social change is required before prostitution can be legalized. If legalization comes about, would parents happily give their consent when their daughters choose prostitution as a career? But more than the prevailing mindset, what needs urgent revision is the way laws are implemented in India. The existing law, Pita, which was surely meant to protect the prostitutes, has so long been used against them, as all organizations, regardless of their position on the legalization debate, point out. So is there any guarantee then that the abolition of the law would reverse the situation overnight?         
	Shakespeare, with his usual acumen, had foreseen the trap long ago. In Measure for Measure, when the judge of Vienna, where a new law has been passed to bring down all houses of pleasure, asks the pimp, Pompey, whether he considers prostitution a lawful trade, the latter answers, If the law would allow it, sir.                    ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

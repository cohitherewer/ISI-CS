The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Spring cleaning the mind
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPRING CLEANING THE MIND                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                                                  
	Jackson Pollocks action painting, Bhupen Khakhars populous panels, Andy Warhols loud colours  a multitude of references crowd the mind as one studies the paintings of Sanatan Saha, on display at Galerie 88 till May 15. But beyond these layers of allusion, one glimpses an attractive, even witty, mind at work, as it plays around with familiar motifs and queers the viewers comfort zone.        
	A lady riding a lion may have become a staple for Bengal art for obvious reasons, but Saha adds a mischievous twist to that iconic image. Instead of the ten-handed goddess, a young girl, dressed in what looks like pink sports attire, strides the teeth-baring quadruped  we cannot be quite sure if the poor creature is simply exhausted or trying to act fierce. In another canvas, amid a profusion of distorted shapes and ghostly figures, a girl in a black sleeveless dress stands invitingly. The gothic charm of this composition is enhanced by the giant cobwebs that grow along her torso.        
	The densely populated, mutually interlocking planes that comprise Sahas visually arresting world are best described by the cleverly punning title of this collection, Complexcity. It is evident from the titles, referring insistently to dreams, memories and histories, that the artist has carried out a thorough spring cleaning of his mind. A deluge of broken forms, like fragments of a psychedelic nightmare, has been emptied on the canvas in apparent disharmony. The finish sometimes is so rugged, the colours so smoky and the forms so hazy that one is reminded of paper collages, of hastily torn bits of glossy magazines, of walls being smeared with graffiti in wild abandon. There are dark depths, suggested by a deep-sea blue in some of the paintings, in which skeletal, visceral, human, animal forms float in a morass of gloom. Seductions (picture), with its dreamy bubbles and dissolving beauties, is morbidly fascinating, and easy to engage with. It is even easier to like  a quality that may not always be a good for art.        
	It is something of a contradiction that the complex city that Saha takes you through is so easy to inhabit. Once you have got into his style, Sahas tricks may seem all too quickly accessible. While Saha has come up with a language that is an engrossing mix of indigenous and European influences, the persistent return to the same kind of imagery may begin to feel cloying. Saha has expertise and a startling emotional reach. All the more reason why he must not allow his idiom to become too absorbed in its own self-created codes of obscurity.

	Lying among the books I have planned to read, there was Known Turf by Annie Zaidi. Despite its unappetizing title and jacket, I did get down to reading it because it had been recommended by P. Srinath and Tabish Khair, whose opinions I value. I was not disappointed. Zaidi writes about her encounters with Chambal Valley dacoits, including Phoolan Devi and half a dozen male gangs. What emerges is the fact that most of them kill rival gangsters, and not common people, for the simple reason that the former encroach upon their sources of income. She had heard stories about the exploits of the legendary Sultana Daku, and watched films based on the lives of dacoits, notably Gabbar Singh.        
	My own limited knowledge of dacoits goes back to my childhood in village Hadali. The most dreaded name in the desert region of the river Jhelum was Tora Dakoo. He was known to have killed many rivals and members of his own gang who had questioned his leadership. His gang and he visited Hadali in broad daylight, rifles slung on their shoulders. As word went around, people shut their front doors and a deadly silence enveloped the village. Among the many doors he knocked on with the butt of his rifle was ours. My grandfather would open the door to let him in. They embraced each other like long lost friends. My grandmother would serve him pinnees (gur ladoos) with tea, and offer the same to his men who stayed outside. He addressed her politely as Vaddi Bhain; she called him puttar (son).         
	After he had finished, my grandfather would give him an envelope full of currency notes. Tora counted them before putting them in his pocket, as it was not robbery but protection money to ensure that no other gangster came to our home. The gang visited a few other Hindu and Sikh houses. Before leaving, Tora said Allah Hafiz. No one dared to lodge a complaint against him to the police. He also helped with money the poor parents who could not afford their daughters marriage.        
	Annie Zaidis collection has good reportage peppered with humour. It is most readable.                
	Quiz question                
	I have carried Shankar Sens poems in my columns more than once. He wrote to say that he is busy translating Buddhadev Guhas epic novel, Madhukari, into English.         
	Guha has quoted a few couplets in Urdu without naming the poet. I am unable to identify the poet. I invite readers to do so. I reproduce both the originals and Shankar Sens translations:                
	Taaruf rog ban jaye to usko
   bhoolna achha        
	Taalukh bojh ban jaye to usko

	If familiarity becomes oppressive,        
	It is better to forget it.        
	If a relationship becomes a burden        
	It is better to break it.

	It is better to give it a beautiful         
	turn and let it go.                
	Gustakhi ham sey hogi sirf ekbaar        
	Jab sab challengey paidal

	I shall be at fault just once        
	When others shall walk on foot        
	And I shall be borne on their         
	shoulders.         
	Revised maxims                
	Love thy neighbours neighbour        
	To err is human; to blame others for it is good politics

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Evasive action                  
	Sir  It seems that the government is somewhat hesitant to act sternly against those who execute young people marrying within the same gotra (Khap flak for govt, August 6). The practice invokes a medieval tradition which is irrelevant now. But the home ministers proposal of a special law is probably a way of shirking immediate responsibility. A law is follow-up action. Would it free the Centre and the states from their immediate duty to stop such cruelty and bring the offenders to book despite the political protection they get?          
	Yours faithfully,        Ranjit Sinha, Calcutta
        
	Dubious games          
	Sir  The way players and sports authorities abroad are expressing dissatisfaction at the upcoming Commonwealth Games is appalling (Games ripples cross borders, Aug 2). Senior government officials and the Indian Olympic Association do not realize that accusing the government of neglecting the construction of venues for the games can backfire.          
	It is sad that the people of India could not take a leaf out of South Africas book. The preparations for the Fifa World Cup dispelled the worlds fears. It is we who lack the courage of conviction, giving foreigners every opportunity to sully Indias image.          
	Yet corruption seems to have grown since the decision to hold the games in India was taken during Atal Bihari Vajpayees tenure as prime minister. The work of preparation has not been expedited and the S.P. Mukherjee Swimming Complex is leaking water along the walls.          
	At this juncture, the sports and government officials for whom the Games have become a means to make money should be punished.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah, Hooghly

                
	Sir  All sports enthusiasts are eagerly awaiting the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi. However, with a few months left to go, the scenario is rather murky. The ineptitude of the organizers is revealed every day and the financial transactions are raising eyebrows. Our prime minister, with his dream of making India a global powerhouse, must look into the matter seriously.           
	Failing to organize the Games well will cast a shadow upon Indias reputation in the eyes of the world. The organizing committee must be taken to task for its lacklustre efforts and dilly-dallying. The financial deals should be strictly audited.           
	But in the light of Indias past record in the Games, we can optimistically look forward to a spirited performance from our athletes on their home turf.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Chirag Mandal, Howrah

                
	Sir  It is shocking to hear about the scandals associated with the preparation of the Commonwealth Games, something that has been in the offing for seven years. Time is running out and the work is in a shambles. Corruption and bribery have led to inefficiency. Even investigations into the losses will not serve any purpose now.           
	Our prime minister seems to be deaf to national problems and lacks initiative. To add insult to injury, Queen Elizabeth has refused to visit India for the inauguration of the Commonwealth Games, thus breaking an established tradition. Lack of security is one of the reasons for the cancellation.          
	In our country, corrupt people are rarely prosecuted. If cornered, the culprits resign but the loot is never recovered. Holding the Commonwealth Games has exposed our national character in the international arena. Even if the guilty are punished, it will not restore our dignity.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
S.P. Sharma, Mumbai

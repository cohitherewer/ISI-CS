	Bold suggestion                  
	Sir  I would like to thank Bishnu Pada Ray, the lone member of parliament from the Andamans, for demanding to integrate Jarawa children into mainstream schools in a bid to end the isolation of this tribe. Ray argues that the Jarawas should not be treated like museum pieces. At present, the Jarawas are considered to be little more than wildlife exhibits. It is perhaps pertinent to mention my own experience during a visit to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands three years ago. I had travelled from Port Blair to Diglipur, and we had to pass through a Jarawa reserve. During the journey, we came across a Jarawa couple deep inside the forest. All of us were very excited, as if we had come across a rare wild animal.          
	After the initial excitement, however, I was really ashamed of my behaviour. Like the rest of us, Jarawas are human too. Their present misery can be attributed to them being kept in complete isolation. It is true that initially, the Jarawas were completely averse to the idea of meeting outsiders. However, ending their isolation may not necessarily lead to a loss of identity. It is certainly difficult to define the process of modernization. Ancient communities have passed through several stages in the course of their cultural and social evolution. Even the Yanomami tribe, which lives in Brazils Amazon rainforest, has accepted practices that can be considered modern. They no longer depend on hunting and gathering for subsistence.          
	Do the Jarawas themselves want to remain in isolation any longer? As of now, the answer is not clearly known to us. But we know that most tribes, which were once living in isolation, have gained by accepting a modern way of life. One thing, however, must be taken into consideration. Tribes that have been living in isolation for so long have not developed immunity against common diseases that afflict outsiders. They should be given proper medical care when they are brought out of isolation. I must mention, once again, that Ray must be complimented for his bold and humane suggestion.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Sibdas Ghosh, New Jersey, US             
	Safety first          
	Sir  This refers to the news item, Unfasten seat belts, this is Orissa (July 8). The perception that seat belts are not required if the speed of traffic is low is based on false assumptions about seat-belt use. According to the report, local residents scoffed at the safety suggestion, saying Bhubaneswars roads were not high-speed corridors and hence there was no need for seat belts. Such ignorance can have dangerous consequences. Evidence from studies and simulations suggest that even after controlling vehicle speed, three-point seat belts effectively reduce the risk of injury and death from head-on collisions. This fact needs to be incorporated into the campaigns to raise awareness about the adoption of seat belts while driving.           
	The safety device should be made mandatory for passengers sitting in front or at the back of vehicles. Child-restraint systems should also be put in place in the back seats. In addition, campaigns must also be organized to put child-safety seats in place and ensure that old vehicles are maintained on a regular basis. In this context, it is important to mention that old vehicles are particularly dangerous, and likely to come with with ineffective seat belts with no lap restraint.          
	One other thing. A number of people oppose the wearing of safety device on the ground that seat-belt laws infringe on their civil liberties. They seem to believe that if a driver were to discard seat belts, the only person harmed would be the one who is driving the vehicle. This is far from true. The seat-belt non-compliant driver, who does not insist on wearing seat belts, is not only jeopardizing his or her own life but putting the safety of his copassengers at risk. Wearing a seat belt should be made compulsory all over India. A safe practice cannot have any bearing on ones civil rights.          
	Yours faithfully,        Arin Basu, Christchurch, New Zealand              
	Parting shot          
	Sir  Even though three years have gone by, there is no sign of prices of essential commodities going down to an affordable level. This has inconvenienced the ordinary people, and one wonders for how long will they have to pull along like this. The rise in prices also means that there will be fewer buyers of consumer goods. This will create a chain reaction and raise the possibility of yet another recession, which, in turn, will have a negative impact on the national economy. It is high time that the State intervenes to stem the rot that is tearing the social fabric and the economy to shreds.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Anil Kumar Choudhury, Kalyani

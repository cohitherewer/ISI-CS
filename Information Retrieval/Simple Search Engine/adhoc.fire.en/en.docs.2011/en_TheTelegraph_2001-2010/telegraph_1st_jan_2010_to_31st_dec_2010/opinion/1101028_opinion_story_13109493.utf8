The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Until the pips squeak
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNTIL THE PIPS SQUEAK                          - Who suffer most from the planned cuts in Britain?        WESTMINSTER GLEANINGS -   ANABEL LOYD                                                        
	My son works in Chile. Sad for me, for its a long way away, but not for him with summer there on its way and the country en fte after the brilliantly orchestrated mine rescue. We could do with a major morale boost here to get us through the bad times ahead, but health and safety stop us doing most things that get anyone into any danger and, the more regular floods associated with global warming aside, we are generally lucky on the natural national disaster front. I should probably say touch wood; disasters are multiplying and it may be that we will find drastic changes in our long-term, successful-enough economy and the undermining of our expectations of public wealth almost as hard to deal with.        
	George Osborne, the Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, in his speech laying out the broad picture of the recent spending review, told us that we are to be squeezed until the pips squeak. The trouble, as always, is that while we are theoretically all in this together, the reality is different. The really rich will be unaffected, they can pay for their services; those in the middle will lose the icing on their cake, if not part of the cake too; and the poor will be poorer still, with fewer benefits, fewer job opportunities and fewer public services to call on. Many of those at the bottom or in the middle of society will lose their jobs and there will be likewise fewer new ones to try for and less of a welfare cushion to fall back on.        
	But what to do? Something has to be done. Is it better to go for shorter-term pain than longer discomfort? Actually it isnt going to be that short-term either way with many planned cuts being phased in over several years and the throbbing ache likely to affect the whole country for a decade or more. Mind you, if this government can deliver on efficiency savings in a public sector run riot, it will not be before time. The problem is that poorer communities, particularly in the North and in Scotland, will be so much worse affected than London and the fat of the land South. The closure of at least one of the two airforce bases in Moray, Scotland, with the other still threatened, will mean the loss of well over 2,000 jobs and related income loss to the local community of 68 million. There arent too many employment alternatives in Moray, and the governments dream of a more mobile workforce is frankly improbable at the best of times and nonsensical in our current straitened circumstances.        
	Nevertheless, we all believe, moan though we may, that something must be done. Unlike the French, the workers of this country will need more goading than this to turn out on the streets in protest, even when our retirement age is raised to 66 whereas theirs is hitting 62. It isnt the time of year anyway, we would rather sit over the measly heaters we cant afford and complain quietly.         
	There are few good alternatives. Higher taxes would seem to make sense, but higher tax for higher incomes does not raise enough money. Lower incomes must suffer too and will suffer worse. We all suffer already from higher value-added tax on our purchases. Do we means test so the wealthier pay more across the board? Theoretically, it should be so, but the cost of the mechanisms for means testing would outweigh any potential financial benefits, and means testing has, not surprisingly, a bad name as a highly socially divisive measure.        
	We would love to go on as we are; keep on borrowing at all levels from domestic to national to international, sweeping overdrafts and deficits under the carpet. We cant. One fine day, and we have come quite close, our lenders will demand that we open the coffers and we will then find them empty. Cue for national suicide. These cuts may slow our massive outgoings but when or whether our economy will start to grow again in the face of the pain of ongoing cuts and, vitally, when or whether the non-government sector will pick up the baton and run with it are the multi-billion-dollar questions on which the future growth and profile of the country depends.        
	There is no good news, but only slightly less bad news, for some whom the government dares not immiserate too obviously. The old will retain free eye tests, prescriptions, bus passes, television licences and a few other perks that might be the envy of the elderly in countries with less state welfare on offer. The disabled are less well cared for although most of us have a certain desire to see some of the long-term and dubiously incapacitated firmly encouraged to return to work. The devil is, as always, in a broad approach that has neither time nor, even more so, money to explore the rights and wrongs of individual cases.        
	State schools are not to suffer too much, with ongoing yearly funding increases. Its a pity that there is not enough money to spare for the proper exploration that should have happened years ago of inefficiencies in an education system that, well or ill funded and however many hours spent in school, continues to fail many of the children in the country. There are good reasons why those who are able scrimp and save to send their children to private schools. Curriculum changes and infrastructure spending have been sticking plaster to a system in which teachers are undervalued and pupils are under-incentivized and uninterested. Perhaps the cuts in unemployment benefit will make a difference, but it is hard to believe when university graduates cant get jobs and vocational training is also undervalued and hard to find.        
	As it is, university fee rises appear likely to discourage students from poorer families to accumulate large debts while studying, thus nipping in the bud recent rises in student numbers and in new universities. The worst scenario seems to be more disaffected young people with poor or pointless academic education and few opportunities for the focused vocational training that would provide them and us with greater competition in the market for skills and crafts that we all need and struggle to get  from carpenters and electricians, telephone and television engineers, to plumbers, plasterers and upholsterers.              
	Otherwise, if you can get in  and recruitment is competitive these days notwithstanding, or even because of, the war and the heroic element  the army may be the place to be as a young person. The army is riding high and we love our brave boys in a way that the Falklands War never made us. You might be killed in Afghanistan, but if you arent you are a living hero and if you are, your family can be proud, even on a scrape-along pension. We all, however against the war, give to the Help for Heroes charity; mention something that could help a disabled soldier, from a wheelchair-friendly fishing boat to a bionic limb, and it will sell; walk round London in uniform and every door opens; everyone wants to pat a soldier on the back or shake a military hand. Squaddies are getting drunk free in every bar in London  the police try and turn a blind eye to the minor fracas that ensue when the boys have a good time. Its nearly as good as being a Chilean miner.

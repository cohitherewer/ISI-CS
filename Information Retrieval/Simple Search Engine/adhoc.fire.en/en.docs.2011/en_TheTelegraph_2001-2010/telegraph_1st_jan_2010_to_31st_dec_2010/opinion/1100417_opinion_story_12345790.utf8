	Following Goldfinger but slightly altering his famous pronouncement it could be said that the first embarrassment is happenstance, the second coincidence and the third calls for resignation. Shashi Tharoor, the minister of state for external affairs, would do himself a service if he followed the above dictum. His comments regarding cattle class during the austerity drive of the government and on Saudi Arabia while on an official trip with the prime minister were the first two embarrassments. His alleged involvement in the Indian Premier League Kochi cricket team and the public outcry it has created have not particularly helped the United Progressive Alliance government. There are no grounds for disbelieving the statement made by Mr Tharoor in the Lok Sabha clarifying his position. Mr Tharoor has been, for the better part of his career, an international public servant, and so it is difficult to believe that he would run the risk of misinforming the Lok Sabha by being economical with the truth. In spite of this self-signed clean chit, the point remains that Mr Tharoor has not maintained the highest standards of propriety that are expected from a man of his standing and training.        
	These standards are summed up in the old saying that even Caesars wife should be above suspicion. This means that no person or persons who are close to Mr Tharoor, as a relative, friend or associate, should have been part of the project to which he acted as mentor and guide. He should have ensured this when he agreed to help the consortium that won the bid for the Kochi team. Mr Tharoor failed to do this and hence the shadow of impropriety on his career as a minister. Any impropriety on the part of a minister is an embarrassment to the concerned government and it behoves Mr Tharoor to free the government of this discomfiture. Such an act would not be an admission of guilt. On the contrary, it would be an act imbued with a high sense of honour.        
	The same set of standards applies to Lalit Modi, the chairman and commissioner of the IPL. By virtue of the post he holds and the huge popularity of the IPL, Mr Modi has become a public figure and, therefore, publicly accountable for his decisions. It has now come to light that persons related to Mr Modi are part owners of two IPL teams. These persons may be wealthy in their own right and so capable of making bids in auctions but those auctions were presided over by Mr Modi. Even assuming that the auctions were perfectly above board, the question of impropriety looms large over the entire process.        
	Mr Tharoor and his current bte noire, Mr Modi, have both failed the same standards. The pity is that both of them should have known better. Given their background, both of them should be exemplars in Indias public life. Alas, both are being gobbled up by the quicksands of Indias declining standards.

	There may, I suppose, be limits to American arrogance. But where? Britain in the 1880s was like the United States of America today. The only global superpower, it imagined itself Gods gift to the world  and vice versa. And odiously smug and overbearing we often were.        
	The longer I live in an American satrapy, the more I feel what many Indians felt then. Britains leaders go on their knees to the White House. Its troops fight Americas wars. American prosecutors use an unequal extradition treaty from Blairs day to grab Britons for trial. A Senate committee summons British politicians for interrogation about last years release of the (supposedly dying) Libyan jailed in Scotland in 2001 for blowing up a PanAm airliner  and huffs and puffs when, for once, the Brits dare to say no.         
	My reaction is rage, the frustrated rage of a patriot. Dr Johnson once declared patriotism as the last refuge of a scoundrel. If hed been describing scoundrels, maybe; though Ive always got by with humbler excuses such as I lost the address. But as a definition of patriotism, phooey.        
	Im a patriot to excess. Shakespeares this sceptred isle...this blessed plot brings tears to my eyes. And not just because Im old; I could have wept in 1963 when, after 30 months in Mumbai, I saw again from the plane our tiny, green fields. Britain is my country, right or wrong. And with that phrase, back to my business, language.        
	The phrase is often misused. It doesnt mean I approve of Britains errors or crimes. All it means is all it says: that, whatever it does, my country it is. Love of country is easily denigrated. My patriotism is your chauvinism, named after a (mythical) Nicolas Chauvin, who supposedly fought under Napoleon and hero-worshipped him. Jingoism began life in a British music-hall song of the 1870s: We dont want to fight  against Russia, to be exact  but by jingo [an old substitute for by Jesus] if we do, weve got the ships, weve got the men, weve got the money too. Jingoism is specifically bellicose; the cleric who recently objected to Blakes poem Jerusalem, utterly unwarlike in any wordly sense, as jingoist was plainly as muddled about language as the Church of England is about theology.         
	On their side, patriots have coined many a fine phrase. Churchills never... was so much owed by so many to so few on the Battle of Britain is unforgettable. So is W.B. Yeatss a terrible beauty is born, on the anti-British uprising in Dublin in 1916, a seminal event in Irish history. Europes young were sent to war in 1914-18 with the Latin thought that dulce et decorum est pro patria mori, it is sweet and honourable to die for your country. Of all people, Kipling, whose son was killed in 1915, came nearer the truth: If any question why we died, tell them, because our fathers lied. Yet 1918 brought a still-popular British poem (and hymn, nay): I vow to thee my country, all earthly things above, entire and whole and perfect the service of my love. Above his family? Well. But memorable it is.         
	Not all agreed. If he had to choose to betray his country or a friend, wrote E.M. Forster in 1938, I hope I would have the guts to betray my country. Britains highly literate traitor, Kim Philby, later cheerfully betrayed both, but, since his memoirs were edited by the KGB, left no well-worded lie to say why.        
	A pity. And there I reveal a clash between my feelings for my country and for its language. When William Pitt, its then prime minister, died in 1806, his last words, supposedly, were, My country, how I leave [or, in a rival version, love] my country. I prefer the far livelier third version: I think I could eat one of Bellamys veal pies. And while I can barely rise to my feet for dreary God Save the Queen, another national anthem, with musics aid, stirs me deeply  The Star-Spangled Banner.

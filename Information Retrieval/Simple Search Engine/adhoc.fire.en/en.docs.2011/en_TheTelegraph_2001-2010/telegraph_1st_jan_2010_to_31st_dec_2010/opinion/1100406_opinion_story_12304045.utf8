                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        COUNT DOWN                                                    
	At certain moments Indias size and population seem particularly noticeable. For example, the Election Commission has every reason to congratulate itself  after heaving a secret sigh of relief  each time the general elections are over, because the magnitude of the enterprise is something that few other countries can imagine. Similarly, the registrar-general and census commissioner must be at the peak of activity with the beginning of the enumeration for the 2011 census this April. Indias population is 120 crore, of which an estimated 26 crore families live in far-flung areas. The decennial census provides the basic data for analysis by economists and social scientists, and for the formulation of policy. This time the census will be used to build an electronic database that the government will use to issue a unique identity number to every person. The successful completion of the enumeration would be another triumph for the registrar-general, for in a country where a large number of people are not linked to modern networks, the census is the only means of knowing how the people are faring.        
	For the first time, there will be questions on ownership of mobile phones, internet connectivity, electricity connections, drinking water arrangements and so on. Such questions are vital for correctly targeted economic policies and infrastructure distribution. But it is also extremely important that enumerator and subject both do their jobs well. It is not clear how conscious people are that giving truthful answers is useful for their own sakes. This awareness of the importance of census enumeration should have been created by now  this is the seventh census. Also, the choice of enumerators should be reviewed. Schoolteachers and government workers can do the enumeration only to the detriment of their jobs; this cannot be good either for them or for their levels of dedication. Local young people who have passed at least Class X could be trained in each district and sent off with the lists  they would be happy to earn money. Encouraging people to be truthful and enumerators to be dedicated is all to the good, but this is predicated on trust. The detailed information gathered from and by trusting people should not be put to political use: that is the one fear that makes people reticent. It is the governments job to see that the outcome of a task of this scale is put only to positive uses.

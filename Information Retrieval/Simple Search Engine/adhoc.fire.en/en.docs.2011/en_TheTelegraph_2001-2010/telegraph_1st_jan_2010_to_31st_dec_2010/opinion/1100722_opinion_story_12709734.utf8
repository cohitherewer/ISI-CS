	If Barack Obama had set 2011 as the time for the beginning of the troop pullout from Afghanistan, it was a matter of honour for Hamid Karzai, the president of the war-torn nation, to claim for himself the privilege of announcing a definitive date for the end of that process. By stating 2014 as that date, Mr Karzai has assumed for Afghanistan, and for himself, some amount of agency over the conduct and the conclusion of the war. This was the high point of the Kabul conference. But what precisely is to take place between these two resolutely set time limits has not been resolved by the conference. To keep Afghanistans date with history, Mr Karzai has assured its allies that he intends to multiply the strength of the Afghanistan national army and police by several hundred thousands so that they can fully take over the nations security from the foreign forces (and allow their respective commanders-in-chief to face their domestic audiences free of guilt). Mr Karzai has also demanded, and been granted, control over 50 per cent of the international aid going to Afghanistan in order to provide more effective governance. To quell worries about whether these measures are sufficient to promote the transfer of responsibilities, Mr Karzai has reiterated his commitment to battle corruption and carry forward his reconciliation plan for the Taliban which he sees as a sure-fire way to break the back of the insurgency.        
	But worries remain. A lot of them, of course, have to do with doubts over whether the Afghan army and police  threatened with desertions, illiteracy, drug abuse, confused loyalties and popular mistrust  would ever become competent enough. Old doubts about the Karzai administrations ability to fight the corruption within remain. But the overwhelming concern is with the likely equation that is to evolve between the administration and the Taliban, and its effect on regional and international security. Mr Karzai, for sure, has grasped Pakistans hand of friendship as a facilitator in furthering his grand plan to talk with the Taliban. But Pakistans own strategic designs in the region are bound to make friendships rather complicated. At Kabul, India called attention to the red lines which ought not to be breached in talks with the Taliban. But the desperation to keep the timeline intact may force Mr Karzai and his Western allies to forget the word of caution from old friends.

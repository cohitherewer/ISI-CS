The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | How different from us
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOW DIFFERENT FROM US                                  What happens to single-sex worlds, be they colleges or terrorist organizations, when the opposite sex walks in, and what happens when it keeps away?                                            
	Some of the happiest years of my adult life were spent in an institution where I had no right to be. St Hildas was the last womens college in Oxford when I went to teach there in the mid-Nineties. The four other womens colleges in the university had all turned bisexual (as a mischievous don had put it once) by the mid-Eighties. But St Hildas was holding out against that inevitability, although male college lecturers like me had begun to trickle in. A few years later, when my post was advertised as a fellowship, I couldnt apply because of my sex. This was sad. But changing my life was easier and more exciting than changing my sex. So, I half-burnt my academic boats and came back to live in Calcutta. My sadness was keener, though, when I read in the papers, in 2006, that the college had voted finally (but not unanimously) to turn co-ed.        
	Something was lost, I felt, something that was important, valuable, and difficult to pin down and therefore to defend without sounding silly and impractical. A special kind of freedom and eccentricity of intellect and spirit was losing out to the practical, the sensible and the modern in these last bastions of battiness, and the worldly life of the mind is going to be less remarkable for it. In the old St Hildas, young women, whatever their nationality, background or class, coming to live away from home for the first time, would suddenly find themselves in a community of older women who robustly went about their ordinary lives but somehow also held together another way of life whose relations with the real world were always a little askew and strange. What could be a better place for the young than this curious mix of the odd, the protective and the rigorous for trying out different ways of being oneself before braving out into the light of common day? And, for me as a man, to be let into this peculiar community of living and learning, and to be left to myself to adjust to its batty logic, felt like a rare and endlessly amusing privilege.        
	I remember Dr Mapstone, tutor for undergraduate studies in English, taking me into hall on my first day and whispering into my ears, throughout lunch, delicious little introductions while delicately stabbing at her inadequate-looking kippers without quite eating them: That, Mr Sen, is Barbara Levick. She looks like, works on, and thinks she is, a Roman emperor. Hanging above us, in splendid gilt, was Dorothea Beale, the founder of the college. She and Frances Buss, both formidable suffragists, became the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of womens education in England, their names joined forever in an immortal limerick: Miss Buss and Miss Beale,/ Cupids darts do not feel.// How different from us, Miss Beale and Miss Buss.         
	St Hildas food  we called it Womens Food  was never adequate for me, especially at its most exquisite. Every time I went into formal hall, I would have to stop at a doner-kebab van afterwards and wolf down a burger and chips. But about Cupids dart, the limerick was wrong. As an undergraduate, I went out and then lived with a Hildabeast, as students of the college call themselves, and never have I seen more men cohabiting amorously with the women in grim-looking graduate houses. As we tiptoed out of our loved ones rooms at night to pee, we would sometimes run into, and smile sheepishly at, one another on the stairs or landing before joining the queue outside the loo; our New Manhood always made us put the seat back down after we finished. Throughout my association with this particular Hildabeast, we both felt cannily but unobtrusively observed (if not exactly watched over), perhaps even subtly indulged, and never unduly judged by the late-20th-century descendants of Miss Beale and Miss Buss.        
	By the time I came back to St Hildas as a tutor, my inclinations had clarified themselves in the other direction. But here too, the askewness, and the mix of rigour and freedom, proved naturally accommodating. And during the long and intense Shakespeare term, I discovered the joys of teaching the sonnets to a series of devilishly intelligent young women without Life necessarily following Art. Sometimes, while walking back home in the evening after a long working day with the poets master-mistress, I would feel something fall away from me. It was a feeling, at once light and sharp and strange, of being suddenly genderless. But the feeling would slip out of my grasp if I tried to make sense of it. Is this what Mrs Woolf had felt too, so that she famously asked the ladies of Newnham and Girton, several decades ago, whether there are two sexes in the mind corresponding to the two sexes in the body, and whether they also require to be united in order to get complete satisfaction and happiness?                    AVEEK SEN

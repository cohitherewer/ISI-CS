	Free the mind                  
	Sir  The brutal destruction of the World Trade Center towers has left a painful scar on American minds. Hence, Americans are sensitive about the proposal to construct a mosque near ground zero (Protest over NY mosque, Aug 24). The US constitution permits people to practise their faith freely, but care should be taken so as not to hurt the sentiments of a particular community. The best solution would be to set up a religious-cum-cultural complex that would cater to all major faiths. There is no harm if the government takes a liberal stand on this issue.          
	Yours faithfully,         Diptimoy De, Calcutta 
                  
	Futile exercise          
	Sir  The United Progressive Alliance government is under compulsion to placate its allies. The leaders who had successfully stalled the passage of the womens reservation bill have now forced the government to include caste in the list of questions in the census enumeration (Caste about, Sept 14). It is not difficult to understand the motive of those who insisted on including caste in the census exercise. In states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, politics is determined by caste factors. Census records containing caste-related data will help politicians identify vote banks during elections. The demand for a caste-based census has very little to do with formulating socially equitable policies.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sanjit Ghatak, Narendrapur 

                
	Sir  The decision to start a separate exercise based on caste enumeration from June 2011, after the completion of the main census, is not only unnecessary but also an example of wasteful expenditure. It proves, once again, that the government is vulnerable to pressure mounted on it by the so-called socially underprivileged groups. A lot of violence has been inflicted in the name of caste, but the government seems determined to keep these conflicts alive for the sake of electoral gains. Even after 60 years of Independence, no government has succeeded in dispensing social justice to the poor and the needy. As a result of this neglect, the disparities continue, heightening the chances of conflict in society.          
	Worse, if the judiciary were to rule against a separate caste-based enumeration, there will be allegations of judicial activism on the part of the legislature. The government should match the data of a caste census with those of the main census to flesh out effective welfare policies.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Close contest          
	Sir  I usually find it difficult to take Mamata Banerjees pronouncements seriously. But, for once, I agreed with her when she compared Rahul Gandhis recent foray into Bengal with the seasonal visitation of the koel (Rahul in air, Mamata sees cuckoo, Sept 14).          
	It is evident that Rahul would like the Congress to ride piggyback on Banerjees party that has tasted political success in Bengal. A seasoned politician, Banerjee is unlikely to allow this to happen because she considers Bengal to be her bailiwick. Banerjee is also aware that she alone can counter the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Hence, she is entitled to chart her own course of action. Now that Rahul has exhorted his followers to assert themselves in the state, a clash of titans is likely to take place before the next assembly elections. When will Rahul learn that one cannot be holding Banerjees hands in Delhi and shaking fists at her in Bengal?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
V.K. Tankha, Calcutta

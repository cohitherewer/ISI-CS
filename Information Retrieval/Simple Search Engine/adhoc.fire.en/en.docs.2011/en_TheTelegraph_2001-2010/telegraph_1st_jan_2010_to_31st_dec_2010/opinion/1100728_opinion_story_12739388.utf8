	The Left Front in West Bengal has proved its uniqueness in many ways. It believes, for example, that education does not have anything to do with learning, or with students, or their needs and futures. Instead, education is a fief to be ruled over by its followers, while the Fronts leaders play peek-a-boo with English, chasing it up and down Classes I to VI to III and I. Such uninformed doggedness had doubled the odds for a whole generation of students, but the Left Front did not notice. Now it is venturing into regions yet untrodden, by splitting the primary and secondary school education boards into two. Perhaps the Left Front feels its continuation in power is at risk  which is apparently unthinkable  and has decided to re-establish itself as a friend of rural Bengal. Only what it plans to do is very unfriendly, especially towards the children in the villages. The panchayat and rural development department will now run primary and secondary education boards independently of the states school education boards. The government and the newly responsible department seem to have no qualms about lack of expertise: all expertise is elitist anyway.        
	After a murder, the wise sleuth follows the money. After a new policy, especially by the Left Front, the wise citizen of Bengal follows the votes. Following the votes leads to the fact that around 55,000 teachers in the shiksha kendras, created according to the requirements of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, will have their jobs regularized and their pay scales revised. There will also be more jobs as the new boards are created. The Centre had directed the panchayats and the state school boards to jointly run the shiksha kendras, going up to Class VIII, to ensure that all children in the age group of 6-14 went to school. In West Bengal, the panchayats had already almost taken over; the state government is merely making this official because there are votes to be gained. This means the institutionalizing of an inferior level of education, a deliberate injection of hardened inequality when school education is struggling to reach equality throughout the nation. Thousands of children are being ruthlessly condemned to end their studies in Class VIII, because a school system in the control of panchayats would not be equipped to send pupils into the higher classes of state schools. But destroying childrens futures is one of the things that make the Left Front unique.

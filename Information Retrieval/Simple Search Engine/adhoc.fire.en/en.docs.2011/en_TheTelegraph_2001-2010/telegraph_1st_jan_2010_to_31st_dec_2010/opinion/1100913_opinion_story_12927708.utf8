	Young people have to be particularly crass and vicious to keep their teachers confined for 52 hours. Whatever the cause, there can be no justification for this form of physical coercion and mental torture, apart from the single, overriding fact that forced confinement should be considered as bad as ragging and be treated with the same severity. When something as disgraceful as a gherao for more than two days of teachers by students occurs in what is supposed to be one of the leading universities in the country, it raises fundamental questions about the meaning of education. The question becomes more acute when the cause for the gherao is found to be a discussion in the universitys executive council regarding the need for installing closed-circuit television on the premises after the death of an outsider in a water body within the campus. This, together with identity cards to be shown on demand after six in the evening, was being thought of to ensure the students security.        
	Apart from the fact that protesting against means of their own security displays pure stupidity on the students part, the EC had actually opened up a channel for discussion to address issues that the students might have. That route was ignored. Apparently, student leaders felt that without an exhibition of their power by bullying and forced confinement they would not be able to impress the larger student body. They did not really want reasonable, civilized discussion or a clarification of genuine doubts  if there were any. That their followers can be impressed by criminal conduct, and also be credulous enough to believe in the lies being spread about the ECs intentions, are alarming thoughts. The question is: will the university authorities deal with the leaders as they deserve?

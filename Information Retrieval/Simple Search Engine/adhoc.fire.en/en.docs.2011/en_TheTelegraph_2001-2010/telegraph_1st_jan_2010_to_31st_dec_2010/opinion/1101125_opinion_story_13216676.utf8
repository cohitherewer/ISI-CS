	As with all skirmishes between the two Koreas, it will never be known for sure which of the two cast the first stone in the present round of conflict. But it is fairly evident that North Korea has lived up to its reputation of being an unpredictable neighbour by retaliating to what could have been an unintended error on the part of South Korea while conducting a naval exercise on the borders. North Korea may even be said to have surpassed its ill-repute this time by aiming at a civilian target  the Yeonpyeong Island in South Korea  in a major transgression in several decades of hostilities between the countries. The counter-fire from South Korea has been heavy and the imminent dangers were sufficient to have rudely woken up the president of the United States of America in the dead of night. Since then, the worldwide condemnation of North Koreas action has cooled tempers in South Korea and led to a de-escalation of hostilities.         
	As before, the border conflict between the Koreas could not have led to war. Neither of the two Koreas nor the world would want it. But the hostility leaves relations between the two neighbours as raw as ever. Also, it raises questions about the possibility of ever taming a belligerent North Korea without proscriptions from China. It is Chinas unstinted support for North Korea, despite the latters undesirable behaviour, that has allowed North Korea to get away repeatedly with its abominable conduct. Chinas unwillingness to come down heavily on North Korea and allow a US-backed South Korea to gain the upper hand has enabled the military regime in North Korea to retain its continuous sway in power. The imminent succession of Kim Jong-un, who will take over from an ailing Kim Jong-il, makes it imperative for North Korea to flex its muscles again. If its misbehaviour gets the desired attention, it may even find a way back to the table for the six-party talks that were suspended in 2005, or, even better, force a cornered US to open bilateral negotiations for economic and military concessions.

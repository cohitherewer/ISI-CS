The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A fall foretold
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A FALL FORETOLD                                                    
	An unstable coalition government headed by an unelected chief minister is always a fragile affair. The curious thing about the ruling coalition in Jharkhand is that it survived as long as it did. The Bharatiya Janata Partys decision to withdraw support from Shibu Sorens government would, therefore, surprise few. In fact, given the developments of the past few weeks, both the BJP and Mr Soren himself had perhaps anticipated the separation. The BJP, though, might like to argue that it is the betrayed rather than the betrayer, for the collapse of the government may have pushed the chief ministers chair out of the partys reach. But few would be convinced by the partys attempt to take the moral high ground. The break-up of the partys alliance with Mr Sorens Jharkhand Mukti Morcha was almost a foregone conclusion right from its beginning. Even though Mr Soren is not exactly known for his integrity, the BJP had no qualms about joining hands with him. And the attempt to save the government with a proposal of chief ministers by rotation was a gamble that had to fail. The BJPs ultimatum to Mr Soren to quit by Monday or face the withdrawal of its support to his government marked a new low in coalition politics in India.        
	The governor, M.O.H. Farook, faces a challenge to match constitutional propriety with political wisdom. Mr Soren made no secret of his plans even before the BJP dumped him. He has had his stints of alliance with the Congress and his fresh overtures to it were, therefore, predictable. Several leaders from his own party had been unhappy with the JMMs alliance with the BJP. Nor has the BJP been a united house in Jharkhand. All this will lead to yet another spell of horse-trading, which has been synonymous with unprincipled coalitions. The governors options in such situations have been laid down by the Supreme Court in several judgments, most significantly in the Bommai case. Simultaneously, Mr Farook has to examine if an election at this stage is the right option to end another spell of political uncertainty in Jharkhand. The struggle for supremacy between the alliance partners has left the states administration in tatters. This is a dangerous void in a state battered by abject poverty and the Maoist rebellion. Sadly, that does not seem to bother Jharkhands politicians too much.

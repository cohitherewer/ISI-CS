	Away from the spotlight                 
	Close-Up: Memoirs of a life on stage and screen (Women Unlimited, Rs 375) by Zohra Segal is a refreshingly candid account of the life of one of Indias finest actors. Her regal roots notwithstanding, Zohra Segal has always been a non-conformist. In 1930, she enrolled in a dance school in Dresden, and, on her return, joined Uday Shankars academy in Almora. This was followed by marriage with the talented, but moody, Kameshwar, and the couple moved to Lahore where they founded their own dance institute. Segal decided to take up acting next, and this move helped her forge fruitful associations with hallowed institutions such as Prithvi Theatres, the British Drama League and BBC television. What enlivens Segals work further are the descriptions of her encounters with the legends of the British stage. There is a breezy quality about Segals prose and this engaging book, which is a testimony to the myriad talents and vigour of this feisty artist, also includes 21 previously unpublished letters from Prithviraj Kapoor as well as some rare photographs.                                   
	Lets play! The Puffin book of sports stories (Rs 175) comprises short stories which remind us that sport enriches human life by exposing hidden strengths and weaknesses. Various kinds of sport  cricket, hockey, golf and basketball  and characters  winners, losers, underdogs and bullies  fill these pages. In The Secret Weapon, an engaging cricket match leads to the discovery of an unlikely hero, while My Mothers Game is the tale of a girl who buries the memories of loss in her newfound love for hockey. This enjoyable collection will help todays children rediscover the joys of outdoor sports.                        
	Zero Dial: The dangerous world of informersby J. Dey (Jaico, Rs 250) recounts how the lives of three police informers collide against a deadly backdrop of terror, murder and deception. Deys unsung heroes live dangerously by peddling both truth and lies in exchange of money. But selling information can be a risky business, and the hunter is often hounded by the underworld and the police when he breaks the rules of this lethal game.         
	Dey is a trained journalist, and that explains his realistic depiction of Mumbais seedy localities. The plot, however, is weakened by its wide ambit and the numerous characters who leave the reader bored and bewildered.

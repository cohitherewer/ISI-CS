The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | greed for growth
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GREED FOR GROWTH                                                          
	Students of history know that capitalism emerges in tandem with rising expectations and, therefore, from greed. Before a sense of social responsibility and government regulation put fetters on what one economist called the animal spirit of human beings, avarice tends to run amuck. The president of the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, is therefore quite right to draw attention to the rise of greed and graft in Indian society as it enters a period of unprecedented economic growth by way of free market capitalism. Graft is not a necessary condition for the rise of capitalism but greed could be a driving force in an economic system that unfetters the productive forces of society and opens up avenues and scales of wealth-making never conceived of before. This is the history of capitalism in England and in the United States of America. Think of the robber barons in the US and the growth of corruption in the politics of England in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when capitalist wealth-making was enjoying its debut in that country.        
	India is a very late entrant into unfettered capitalism. Thus, in terms of capitalist growth, it is a relatively young country. Its late entry means it enjoys certain advantages. Indian entrepreneurs can make profits from the older forms of business like manufacturing and also from the newer forms like, say, information technology. The relative youth of Indias capitalism brings to mind certain unpleasant features of early capitalism in England and in the US: venality, disregard of laws and morality, selfishness, tampering with the political process and so on. While these features are reprehensible, it should be noted that they are aspects of an era of transition. No one will say that venality and corruption have been completely eradicated in Great Britain and the US but it is undeniable that their incidence has been greatly reduced than what they used to be in the phase of early capitalism. Will it be too optimistic to assume on the basis of historical precedence that the graft and the greed now apparent as the bane of economic growth are only passing phases?        
	There is one very solid and unique basis for such optimism. India is the only country going through a phase of capitalist growth under a democracy governed by universal adult franchise. Neither the US nor England had a full democracy: the vote was severely restricted. In the 20th century, the countries that have entered capitalism with high rates of growth  the Asian tigers and China  have no democracy. The power of democracy and the rule of law in India guarantee that neither politicians nor entrepreneurs can get away with graft and the violation of established regulations. The climate of social responsibility also ensures that a moral and ethical code is in operation. Democracy works as a safeguard against greed gone berserk.

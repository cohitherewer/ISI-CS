                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WITH NO RESPECT                                                    
	The Constitution allows for the nomination of 12 members to the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) by the president. It adds the qualification that persons so nominated should have special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art and social service. The founding fathers of the Constitution introduced the nomination clause to elevate to the Council of States men and women who have achieved eminence in areas far away from politics. The intention clearly was to draw in non-political persons of standing to debates concerning the making of national policies. Such men and women would not be honoured by being nominated to the Rajya Sabha; rather their presence would bestow honour upon the Upper House. Significantly, the Constitution makes no provisions for politicians who failed to get themselves elected to either the Rajya Sabha or the Lok Sabha. In the early years of the Indian Parliament, the spirit and the intention of this clause was upheld. Subsequently, it has been more honoured in the breach.        
	The clutch of nominations announced last week includes the name of a person who, as an active politician, failed to win a seat in the last elections to the Lok Sabha. His party  the Congress  did not offer him a ticket to come to the Rajya Sabha. His closeness to a former prime minister should not count in the consideration of a presidential nomination. The argument that on previous occasions politicians have been similarly nominated is nonsensical, since innumerable wrongs do not make a right. To be honest, there is hardly anyone in the latest list who deserves the nomination. The government, by sponsoring such nominations, is eroding the august character of the Council of States and, what is worse, it is also mocking the Constitution. Nominations of this kind are additions to the long list of instances that go to show how in India those very people who are supposed to champion and safeguard the value of institutions act decisively to erode their value. The demeaning of Parliament, its codes and conventions, is an unseemly aspect of Indian public life. The governments attitude to this problem is evident from its utter disregard of the Constitutional provisions regarding the nomination of eminent persons to the Rajya Sabha. The government cannot violate the spirit of the Constitution and expect to retain respect.

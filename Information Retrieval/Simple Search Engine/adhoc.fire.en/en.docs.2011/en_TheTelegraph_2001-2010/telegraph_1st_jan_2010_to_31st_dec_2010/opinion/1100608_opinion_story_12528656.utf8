	Heal thyself                  
	Sir  The Supreme Court has sent out a strong signal by saying that unqualified vaidyas have no right to work as doctors. The editorial, Learned quacks (June 3), has rightly highlighted the obvious dangers of allowing ill-trained medical men to treat hapless patients. But the problem cannot be averted simply by stopping the vaidyas from practising. A greater danger is posed by the fact that the state government has decided to launch the rural health practitioners programme to so that patients living in rural areas can have a larger number of doctors at their disposal.           
	Those enrolling for the course will become registered doctors in only three years, which is about half the time taken to become a bachelor of medicine and surgery, the minimum qualification required to work as a physician till now. There is much more than a grain of truth in the objection that the quality of students joining the rural medical programme would be compromised if they do not go through a standard screening procedure like the Joint Entrance Examination. There are also serious doubts as to whether the new health practitioners would have even half the knowledge that a regular allopathic doctor possesses. Nowhere in the world is the duration of a basic medical course less than 5-6 years. Communist Chinas experiment with the barefoot doctors has been discarded long ago. There is no doubt that the rural health practitioners would only further contribute to the already abysmal state of healthcare in West Bengal.           
	It is unfortunate that in India patently unqualified doctors and illegal quacks have flourishing practices. They do not have to fear the authorities, which usually turn a blind eye to their activities.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Not game enough          
	Sir  Sports lovers are baffled at the decision of Queen Elizabeth II to skip the Commonwealth Games in Delhi this year (Queen to skip, May 31). A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said the Queen has a tight autumn schedule which makes it impossible for her to visit Delhi in October. The explanation has raised quite a few eyebrows because the time and venue of the 2010 Commonwealth Games have been decided 4 years ago. How can the Buckingham Palace calendar for 2010 not reserve the dates when they have been known much in advance? This cannot but point to the low priority that the United Kingdom accords to India.          
	Inaugurating the games is a matter of pride for the Crown. The Queen herself described the Commonwealth Games as a great sporting celebration in her inaugural speech for the last Commonwealth Games held in Melbourne in 2006. Is the British government concerned that the Queens security would be compromised if she comes to India? In any case, her son, Prince Charles, will attend the games. So speculations regarding security threats have to be baseless. If the Queen can visit other places, why can she not come to Delhi?                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  By not attending the Commonwealth Games, Queen Elizabeth II is breaking a 44-year-old tradition. Her absence from the games makes an indirect comment on the breakdown of law and order in India. We are having terrorist strikes, Maoist attacks, train derailments and aeroplane crashes with disturbing regularity. The Central and state governments have been unable to prevent these. Our prime minister has failed to guarantee the safety and security of his citizens. The cancellation of the Queens visit is like a slur on the nations security arrangements.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Dead line          
	Sir  The broadband service of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited has become extremely poor lately. For over 10 days, BSNL links have not been available in my locality. Since complaints take a long time to be processed, lodging them do not make much sense. It is difficult to assess why, in spite of having the best infrastructure, BSNL is unable to deliver the goods. This is tarnishing its image. As BSNLs performance becomes more and more unimpressive, private players, which depend quite a lot on BSNLs core infrastructure, are marching ahead with aggressive marketing. BSNL must wake up to this challenge.                    
	Yours faithfully,

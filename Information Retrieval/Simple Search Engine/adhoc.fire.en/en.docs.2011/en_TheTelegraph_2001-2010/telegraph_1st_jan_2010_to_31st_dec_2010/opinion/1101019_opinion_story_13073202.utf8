	India can claim to have the worlds most ingenious tax collectors. If proof were needed, one only has to look at the latest notice of the revenue authorities to Vodafone. To recall their intertwined history, Vodafone announced in February, 2007, that it had bought Hutchison Internationals 67 per cent share in the equity of Hutchison Essar, the Indian telecommunications operator, for $11.1 billion. The Ruia brothers, who owned the other third, were not too happy, but they finally acceded. But Vodafone soon got a demand notice from the Central Board of Direct Taxes for 22 per cent capital gains tax on the amount. Vodafones view is that the transaction was entered abroad  in Cayman Islands  by two foreign parties over neither of whom the Indian tax authorities had jurisdiction. CBDTs view is that the property sold is situated in India, and that profits made on its sale are taxable in India. A reasonable course would have been for both parties to sit across a table and talk things over. But that is not in CBDTs nature; and Vodafone chose not to talk and went to Bombay High Court instead.        
	The case proceeded for two years; then Bombay High Court ruled in favour of CBDT in September. Vodafone appealed to the Supreme Court, which is still to hear the petition. But in the meanwhile, CBDT has sent Vodafone another notice. Vodafone could have taken the position that CBDT was going after the wrong thief: capital gains are made by the seller, and that CBDT should be pursuing Hutchison International, who sold the stake. Now CBDT has anticipated that line of defence, and tried to cut it off. It has accused Vodafone of being Hutchisons agent, and charged it under Section 163 of Income Tax Act. It makes no difference what Vodafone is; CBDT is determined to have its pound of flesh.        
	CBDTs pursuit of the flesh is admirable as long as one thinks of it as a carnivore. It clearly thinks of revenue maximization as its dharma; in its eyes, it is serving the interests of the State with single-minded persistence. But the State must also sometimes think for itself. Capital gains tax already discourages investors from selling their equity holdings. As a result, turnover in the Indian stock market is low; promoters have cornered the shares of most companies and kept their valuations absurdly high. The impact on strategic deals has not been quite the same, but capital gains tax has discouraged them too. It has helped promoters keep a stranglehold on companies, and prevented their transfer to better entrepreneurs. In other words, CBDT bears a fair share of the responsibility for the moribund state of Indias corporate sector. It may be incapable of taking a broader and longer-term view, but it is surely not too much to expect some statesmanship from the finance minister and the prime minister.

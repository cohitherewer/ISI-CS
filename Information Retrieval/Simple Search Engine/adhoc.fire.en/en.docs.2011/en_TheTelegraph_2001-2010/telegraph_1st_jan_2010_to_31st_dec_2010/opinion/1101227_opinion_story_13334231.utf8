	Modern master                  
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkar has done the country proud again by scoring his 50th Test century during the first Test match against South Africa (Sachins the God of cricket: Krish, Dec 20). His career has scaled new heights during the course of this year. One cannot forget that he also achieved his first double century in one-day cricket in 2010. Sourav Ganguly, the former captain of the Indian cricket team, has rightly pointed out that it is Tendulkars stupendous ability that sets him apart from other cricketers (Sourav: Its an unbelievable achievement, Dec 20). Even though his career has spanned two decades and he is now 37 years of age, Tendulkars indomitable spirit and hunger for runs set an example for younger cricketers. He has often said that it is his love of the game that keeps him going (Im playing for the love of it: Sachin, Dec 20). His successors will find it very difficult to break Tendulkars records. One hopes that he sets a record that remains unbroken forever.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Sachin Tendulkar has proved that he still possesses the skills to play excellent cricket. With the world cup just around the corner, one hopes that he continues setting as well as breaking records. His perseverance and calm approach to the game have stood him in good stead over the years. It was only when he was the captain of the Indian cricket team that his performance suffered. He was unable to deal with the pressure of captaincy. Barring that brief period of decline, Tendulkars career has been exemplary. To his credit, he has always steered clear of controversy and focused only on the game. He deserves to be awarded the Bharat Ratna by the government of India.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

                
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkars 50th Test century was a remarkable feat. It is not easy to perform consistently over two decades and be the anchoring force of the team at the same time. He has been showered with praise by many cricketing legends, and the current coach of the Indian cricket team, Gary Kirsten, is an admirer of his batting skills (Sachin is professor of batting: Kirsten, Dec 20). Tendulkar has reached a point in his career where no praise can do him justice.          
	Tendulkar has faced a fair amount of criticism as well. His critics have often claimed that he is only interested in his own performance and records and unconcerned about the teams showing. Many have even said that he should retire. However, Tendulkars talent, along with his sense of responsibility, has proved to be his driving force. He has done his countrymen proud regularly, often saving the team from defeat single-handedly. He is now at the peak of his form, and must continue performing well if India is to win the world cup in 2011.          
	Yours faithfully,         Shreyasee Majumdar, Calcutta            
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkars character, both as a player and as a human being, can set an example for people from all walks of life. His dedication, concentration and composure have helped him put his skills to good use. Bowlers would say that Tendulkar appears to be a deceptively calm sea, whose strong hidden currents tear their bowling apart.           
	Years ago, Gundappa Vishwanath was called an artist, and Sunil Gavaskar an architect of the game. If that is so, then Tendulkar can be called a one-man construction company.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

      
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkars cricketing excellence can only be matched by his character and his loyalty towards the nation. He had once courted trouble by saying that he was an Indian first, and a Maharashtrian later. His statement stirred controversy, but his sense of national pride was laudable. Sourav Ganguly has rightly said that 2010 has been great for the Little Master, who has proved that age has little to do with ones performance.          
	Yours faithfully         Ashim Kumar Chakraborty,Guwahati             
	Sir  Sachin Tendulkar is a genius who loves the game dearly. It is indeed an unparalleled feat to have maintained the hunger and consistency for 21 years at the international level. Tendulkar, unlike other sportsmen, has borne the expectations of a billion people for all these years. As for the Bradman versus Tendulkar debate, it would be unfair to compare the two greats. Winning the world cup would be the icing on the cake for Tendulkars career.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Chirag Mandal, Howrah

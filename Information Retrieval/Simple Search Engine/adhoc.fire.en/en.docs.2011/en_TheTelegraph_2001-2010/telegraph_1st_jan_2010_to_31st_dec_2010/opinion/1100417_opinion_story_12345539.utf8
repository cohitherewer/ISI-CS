	Even works of art that avoid direct references to the human figure or situation ultimately have to appeal to our sensory perceptions. Or else, they will remain beyond the comprehension of human beings. Gandhara Art Gallerys exhibition, titled Beyond Objecthood (March 3-11), held in Nandalal Bose hall of ICCR, featured 18 artists from all over the country whose works  even the abstract ones  displayed all-too-human elements that are typical of art that defies classification. This particular space in ICCR is too cramped for proper display of art work, and this exhibition proved that once again. The lighting was crude as well, and the spotlights were either too bright or vice versa.         
	Adip Duttas giant jalebis (picture) in contrasting shades of steel wool and a jet-black material were not just a representation of a popular, treacly sweet but of wheels within wheels, and in more ways than one. Bose Krishnamachari played around with all the colours of a rainbow and created optical illusions on his canvases. Krishnamacharis painting from his oft-displayed series was technically perfect, and so were Duttas jalebis. But Duttas simple video of this sweet being fried in a kadahi was too much like documentation. It lacked the indefinable quality that makes video art successful.         
	Samir Aichs image tried to depict something whose character is impossible to pinpoint. Like Superman, it could have been anything, from a fuel-pump nozzle to a bird, and one could almost see the artist chuckling at the puzzled visitor. Arindam Chatterjees complex drawing of the darkness in what was presumably a mine or a prison conveyed powerfully a sense of claustrophobia. If one were to inspect Anjum Singhs drawing of the Milky Way, one would have discovered that it could double up as a diagram of the atomic structure. Her bouquet of air horns painted red inside exuded a delightful sense of ambiguity.         
	Ambiguity was also the hallmark of Manisha Parekhs graphite drawings, which made a desperate effort to resemble botanical sketches of flowers but turned out to be something quite different. Jayashree Chakravartys school of fish seemed to be illusory  there were there one moment, and gone the next. It left viewers puzzled about what one had actually seen  some fossilized fish or the depiction of a living one wriggling from one layer of pigment to the other. Both Nantu Bihari Das and Manjari Chakaravarti used real furniture to convey their sense of what is not. They did this more successfully than the abstract artists like Harsha Swaminathan, John Tun Sein and Samindranath Majumdar.

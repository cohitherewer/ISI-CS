	Everyone in Indian politics loves a crisis. It is the time to make and break deals. And, in Jharkhand, which has seen seven governments during 10 years of its statehood, the opportunities for politicians during a crisis can be endless. The Bharatiya Janata Partys threat to withdraw its support to Shibu Sorens government has opened up fresh possibilities of deal-making. The defence that Mr Sorens son, Hemant, has put up for his fathers mistake during the voting on this weeks cut motions in Parliament is simply laughable. But the BJPs moral posturings over the chief ministers action too look rather suspect. Despite several corruption scandals involving him, the sangh parivar had no problems in joining a government headed by him. It is no surprise, therefore, that the BJP now sees in Mr Sorens betrayal an opportunity for the party to take over the chief ministership. But the transition can hardly be as smooth as the BJP might wish. For all its disclaimers, the Congress is almost certain to try and make its own deals with Mr Soren and his party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. After all, before he became the BJPs ally, Mr Soren had been an ally of the Congress.         
	All this may be good news for the deal-making sections of Jharkhands politicians, but another spell of political crisis is a recipe for more disaster for the states poor people. It is one of the poorest states in the country with some of the worst human development indicators. Many of its politicians may have profited from unstable governments over the past 10 years. But political instability, corruption and an administrative collapse have together made things very difficult for the common people. This is a dangerous vacuum in a state where the Maoist rebels have long threatened the rule of law. And it is no secret that the Maoists draw their cadre mostly from the impoverished tribal communities. The absence of a credible administration is just what the rebels need in order to recruit more tribal people to their ranks and to spread to wider areas. Unfortunately, endless political uncertainty keeps Jharkhands politicians too busy with power games to fight either poverty or the Maoists. It is a great betrayal of the hopes that the tribal people had over the creation of the new state. The rise and the fall of governments in Ranchi are only a footnote to this bigger tragedy.

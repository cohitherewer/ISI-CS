	Talk shop                  
	Sir  The talks in Islamabad between the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan turned out to be a damp squib, generating undesirable bitterness at an inopportune moment (PM keen to iron out wrinkles, July 23). The talks had as their backdrop the recent violence in Kashmir that had led to the death of at least 15 people. Pakistan fully capitalized on the situation by trying to divert attention to the human-rights violation in Kashmir. It also took advantage of the factually correct but ill-timed statement by the Indian home secretary, G.K. Pillai, about David Headleys admission of the involvement of the Inter-Services Intelligence in the 26/11 attack. In any case, given the inflexible stand of both the nuclear-power countries, the talks were bound to be fruitless. Like countless other parleys before these, the Islamabad talks will go down in history as another routine round between the two countries.          
	However, it must be mentioned that the Pakistan foreign ministers comparison of Pillai with the principal accused in the 26/11 massacre, Hafeez Saeed, bore evidence of S.M. Qureshis deplorable lack of political etiquette. It vitiated the entire atmosphere of the talks. S.M. Krishnas rebuttal of Qureshi was no doubt dignified, but it lacked the required punch. Pakistan has since then toned down its high-pitched rhetoric and expressed an honest intention to continue dialogues with India. But the change of mood was clearly influenced more by the impending visit of Hillary Clinton to Pakistan and the Kabul conference, which started immediately after, than by any sincere repentance on Pakistans part.          
	India has to bear one thing in mind. No Pakistan government, be it military or civilian, can survive without keeping the Kashmir issue and hatred for India alive. Further talks with Pakistan will no doubt follow, but they are not likely to bring about any dramatic change in Pakistans attitude. In spite of pressure from the United States of America, it will be difficult for India to brand Pakistan as a perpetrator of terrorism. Pakistans good-neighbourly relations with China will act as the formers safety shield.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Pakistans proven involvement in the Mumbai attack does not need to be authenticated by its foreign minister. At Islamabad, Pakistan used G.K. Pillais comment on the ISIs involvement as an excuse to thwart any progress in the talks. But then, Pakistans attempt to exploit Indias restraint is well-known. India, on the other hand, has always tried to bridge the trust deficit despite its neighbours hostile reaction to such attempts. What happened in Islamabad was thus not exceptional.          
	Pakistan always lives in denial, and it is this attitude that got exposed in its indecent behaviour towards its guests. The whole world knows that Pakistan is the breeding ground of terrorists and that its government is being remote- controlled by people who play the game from behind the scene.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The relationship between India and Pakistan appears to be an endless courtship devoid of any prospect of, or urge for, a marital union or a respectable co-existence. Expectations are raised before every rendezvous. But when people start hoping for something concrete to evolve from the closed-door discussions, leaders walk out with glum faces, accusing the other side of being inconsiderate or inflexible.          
	For years, we have been told that people on either side of the border share a common heritage. The annual candles at the Wagah border keep reminding us of this. Is our commonality working as an impediment to a healthy wedlock then? After all, khap panchayats on either side of the border are constantly reminding people of the unholiness of the marriage between people who have certain things in common.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The India-Pakistan talks in Islamabad were destined to end in a deadlock. Their fate was decided from the time Indias home minister, P. Chidambaram, visited Pakistan. Pakistan then came to know Indias agenda. To put pressure on India, it escalated violence in Kashmir, border infiltration along the Line of Control, and cross-border firings on Indian troops. In retrospect, Omar Abdullahs insistence on flag marches by the army seems to have been the right strategy to cow down the separatists and to show that India means business.          
	The Indian foreign ministers agenda was to speed up the trial of the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai carnage. Obviously, Pakistan will never acknowledge or bring to book the handlers, planners and perpetrators, as they are part of the Pakistani establishment  a fact highlighted by G.K. Pillai before the talks. India actually scored a point by proving Pakistans duplicity to the world again. No matter how much noise Pakistan makes, it stands guilty of supporting terrorism. This is evident from the testimony given by a third party, the American, David Coleman Headley.           
	The talks may appear to have failed, but India has managed to make a public pronouncement on the Pakistan establishments active role in propagating terrorism. Unfortunately, some of Indias politicians and experts in the media do not understand the subtleties of international diplomacy. Of course, not everybody is an Atal Bihari Vajpayee. But Indians need to show greater unity before they take on future challenges.          
	Yours faithfully,

	In Nicolas Sarkozys France, national integration has become more important than individual rights  and not many politicians appear to have much of a problem with this. Only one member of the senate voted against the bill banning face-covering veils in public, as opposed to the 246 others who supported it. The bill had already been approved by the national assembly in July, so now it is all set to become law. Although the text of the bill did not mention Islam, it is obvious that the move is directed at the countrys Muslim community, which constitutes 10 per cent of the population. The intention is ostensibly noble  to protect women from being forced to wear the burqa  though that does not absolve it from undermining the first principles of the constitution. Following the doctrine of individual liberty, citizens should be free to wear whatever they choose to. Moreover, the logic of the rule of law turns such an embargo effectively redundant. If constitutional safeguards already exist to protect individuals from coercion, why should the State bother to impose its own coercive rules on its citizens? The decision to fine all burqa-clad women, together with men who force them to wear it, also betrays a less-than-clear understanding of the customs and compulsions that govern modes of behaviour within certain communities. So a near consensus on the burqa ban is not going to change Mr Sarkozys political fate very much  at least not for the better. Never a popular president, he now faces the possibility of being reprimanded by the European court of human rights.        
	It is a pity that into the third year of his presidency, Mr Sarkozy has radically moved away from the fine balance he had struck between being firm on immigration and fair towards ethnic minorities. The shock of the global meltdown  followed by his high-handed approach towards capitalism  has also deepened the peoples disaffection. Mr Sarkozy got a taste of the publics anger when, on September 7, close to 3 million workers took to the streets to protest against his proposed pension reforms and job cuts, causing one of the biggest one-day strikes in France in years. Mr Sarkozys severe crackdown on the illegal Roma (the gypsies), as also his declaration that the full veil is not welcome in his country, have made clear the limits of his sympathy for non-French people. The burqa ban merely sums up his attitude.

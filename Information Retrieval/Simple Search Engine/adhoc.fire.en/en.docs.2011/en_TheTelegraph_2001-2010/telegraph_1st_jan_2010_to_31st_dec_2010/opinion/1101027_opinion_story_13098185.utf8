                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        POINT MADE                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	In the 1960s, I knew a young Indian diplomat posted in London. He later rose very high in the IFS. But what intrigued me was not his professional skills but the accent of his perfect English. It wasnt exactly British. But to me, just back from 30 months in Mumbai, it wasnt Indian either.        
	I had to be mistaken, of course, and I was. But excusably so: he had been educated  before Cambridge  at Sherwood College, Nainital, and (you guessed) St Stephens, Delhi.        
	Accent is a major factor in the use and the force of spoken language, just as vocabulary and style are in writing. In Britain a century ago, nearly all the upper class south of the Scottish border and many north of it, spoke not with a regional accent but with what came to be called an Oxford accent  the university, not the place. And everyone, user or non-user, rich or poor, accepted that this was the sign of a gentleman  put bluntly, a member of the ruling class  or, at least, that any down-to-earth accent revealed the opposite.         
	When (rarely) young aristocrats actually married one of what were known as the  Gaiety Girls, after the theatre of that name, the first thing her reluctant parents-in-law would make plain was that she must learn to speak as they did. Hence Bernard Shaws Pygmalion, and later its musical version, My Fair Lady  a play on the way his plebeian heroine would pronounce Mayfair, the grandest district of London.         
	Later this accent was renamed received pronunciation  a would-be neutral term which was no such thing, since it implied that all educated people spoke this way. Today, inverted snobs call it a cut-glass accent, presumably because glass with incised patterning is far above the moulded glass of ordinary folk; and its speakers, talking posh, are derided as chinless wonders.         
	Yet this accent persists. Time has modified it, of course: hear a British broadcaster of the 1930s and  not only thanks to those days recording apparatus  his accent may sound cut-diamond. But todays less marked form is still widespread. I was brought up, initially in a Scottish household, using it, and use it now. So do many, probably most, other educated Britons. And you can meet accents far posher than mine.        
	And, which is the point, except from its sworn enemies, this accent still receives much of the respect that it got in the days when class-deference was a British norm. Even now, a man using it is taken more seriously, felt likelier to be speaking with  and exercising  authority, than one, maybe his equal or indeed superior, with some down-to-earth accent.         
	Scottish speech is still an exception: the once cut-glass BBC is now thick with Scots. But talk plain Estuary English, the accent of millions down-river east of London and around it, say Myfair instead of Mayfair, and youll find an on-air job hard to get.         
	Though many think so, this isnt a uniquely British phenomenon, albeit more marked in Britain than elsewhere. America has class accents, if not so uniformly a single one: compare Barack Obama with the average American, let alone Afro-American. France too, in French, as I know  I lived there for years  though many non-Frenchmen think not. I imagine its true of most languages and most societies. It makes language an instrument of power.        
	Even in those societies where English is, or was, an import? Well, hear R. Viswanathan, now Indias ambassador to Argentina, but brought up in a Tamil-speaking farming family. He struggled into English at a local college, but later when I went to Chennai for higher studies and Delhi for joining the Foreign Service, I was intimidated by the high-flying rich kids with Don Bosco and Doon School accents. It didnt last: I was more hungry to catch up and prove myself. But point made, Id say.                    thewordcage@yahoo.co.uk

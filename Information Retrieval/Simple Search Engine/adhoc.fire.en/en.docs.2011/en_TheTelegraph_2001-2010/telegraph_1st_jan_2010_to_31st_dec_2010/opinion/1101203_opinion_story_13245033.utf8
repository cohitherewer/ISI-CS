                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OUT OF THE CLOSET                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	As the scams keep multiplying and take on bizarre avatars, with all kinds of characters in search of importance or a pot of gold, there is a sense that the process of cleansing has finally begun. Exposures that unravel the manipulations indulged in by those in power and by the sector in charge of permissions and clearances for their projects and businesses allow for a restructuring of the conditions and norms for the sake of transparency and accountability. Years of government control on any and every aspect of life and living created many monsters that became law unto themselves. Their arrogance made them complacent about breaking laws with impunity.         
	Large scale corruption prevailed and became a way of life in this nation-state that was preparing itself to emerge as a global economic power. Ideas, entrepreneurship and aspirations, based on integrity and normal values, were betrayed by the authority. Rich and poor alike were treated with scorn. The rich, in a concerted effort to beat a closed system, bought their way with the help of favours and cash while the poor suffered at the hands of a moribund, greedy and inept administration that never managed to deliver basic goods and services to the people. Even today, with mind-boggling sums related to corruption smacking us in the face, mindless debate ensues for months on end as to whether an additional Rs 600 crore can be allocated to the Right to Food proposal.         
	However, there is a silver lining: the government is being forced to take note and, hopefully, will bring in radical structural reforms to ensure that India does not become a banana republic. There are some individuals in the government who are bringing the errant to book. For years, laws have been twisted and broken, aided and abetted by the bureaucracy and the enforcement agencies. It had become a habit because no one ever got caught in the act. The cosy cocoon has been cracked open and the muck is spilling out into the public domain, angering India. Politicians have to seek re-election and will therefore attempt to either clean up or cover up.                
	Open secret        
	The investigation needs to move forward logically and bring the babu and his politician boss into the ring. They cannot be protected by the State because it is they who took the largesse offered by outsiders looking to hasten processes, break the norms, ensure competitors are sidelined for a price, and so on. It is time that all the players in the Indian board game of unaccountability are rigorously probed. Investigating only one element of the nexus will not break the destructive combine, but will keep all its other arms alive and manipulative.         
	Maybe, the national advisory committee needs to put pressure on the government to introduce a reform process to bring transparency in government functioning as the next step that will strengthen the right to information act initiative. Babus must be accountable and open to public scrutiny. This is imperative because when compared to politicians  who have to be re-elected  the babu is there for keeps till retirement.         
	The recent developments have highlighted the uneasy role of the fourth estate as participants in the process. Gathering information demands a carefully calibrated scheme, one which maintains, at all times, a clear and definite distance from the players in the process. It is this distance that differentiates a non-partisan reporter. For media people, particularly editors, to be seen as close to the political class is always suspect unless they are columnists. The latter express their personal views and are not catalysts of news dissemination. Introspection and redefinition are the needs of the hour.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Letters to Editor
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Good show                  
	Sir  The opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi was spectacular, but the headline of the report in The Telegraph was bland in comparison (Not so bad (touch wood), Oct 4). Moreover, Doordarshans broadcast of the event also spoiled the show. The telecast was interrupted repeatedly by advertisements, and the presenters looked lost. Charu Sharma was rather unimpressive as an anchor, but Mayanti Langer rescued the show to some extent. The sound quality was equally poor. One wonders why Doordarshan was entrusted with the responsibility of presenting such an important event when it does not have the infrastructure or expertise required for the job. A private broadcaster could have performed better. But despite the adverse media reports and the hostile public attitude towards the Games and their organizers, the opening ceremony went off well. One hopes that the Games do not face any more hurdles, and that they finish smoothly.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The much-hyped Commonwealth Games were finally inaugurated on October 3 in a glittering ceremony. The inauguration showcased not only Indias technological prowess but also its rich cultural heritage. Certain uncomfortable facts surrounding the Games were suppressed with admirable tact before the opening ceremony  something that prevented India from being humiliated on the world stage. The wonderful beginning has made many forget the messy run-up to the event.          
	However, those glued to their television sets to watch the opening ceremony were irritated by the commercial breaks every now and then. Monetary considerations must have made the authorities include so many advertisements, but they could have at least been kept short. Some people apparently missed much of the show, including the speech by the controversial Suresh Kalmadi. Nevertheless, the private networks captured Kalmadis speech, and one could see that people were jeering at him. Thankfully, the speeches of the other dignitaries were free from from such hullabaloo.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Watching Doordarshans telecast of the inauguration ceremony of the Commonwealth Games was distressing. The telecast was continuously disrupted by commercials. Such a grand event should have been presented in a better manner. It should have been a matter of pride for Doordarshan to be able to broadcast the show to millions of viewers. It should not have displayed its greed by including so many advertisements in its presentation.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The nation is now engrossed in the Commonwealth Games, one of the biggest sporting events of the world. Concern and debates over the Games were put to rest by the magnificent opening ceremony. The media could not find much fault with the show. India has set a new standard in security arrangements during the Games and this event will do a lot of good to the nations image. The opening ceremony presented Indias culture and traditions beautifully. Hariharans rendition of Swagatam was excellent. However, the theme song by A.R. Rahman failed to live up to the peoples expectations. Despite a few glitches, the event managed to grab eyeballs. The stadium, resonating with drumbeats and classical music, aptly reflected Indias moment of pride.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

                
	Sir  The opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games was shown on Canadian television. The event was a treat to watch, but Suresh Kalmadis speech was a disaster. His address lacked both the etiquette and the expression necessary for an event of such magnitude. One wonders why Kalmadi was allowed to speak on the occasion, given the controversies and the charges of corruption that have been brought against him.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Diptendu Chakraborty, Toronto, Canada              
	Sir  Delhi has decked itself up to host the Commonwealth Games. New hotels have been built, metro stations renovated and roads repaired. This is the glossy picture of Delhi that has been presented to the world. But the dark side of the city has been hidden from public gaze. Delhi has dire poverty in some areas, a dreadful lack of hygiene, traffic jams and flooded streets during the monsoon. The lackadaisical attitude of the authorities is impeding Delhis growth. Parts of the real picture were exposed during the preparations, but they were covered up for the sake of national pride. Unless Delhi improves itself, the rushed makeover before this event will only bring further trouble. The State should take urgent steps to prevent another debacle before India hosts an international event again.          
	Yours faithfully,        Kaushic Mazumdar,Dimapur, Nagaland

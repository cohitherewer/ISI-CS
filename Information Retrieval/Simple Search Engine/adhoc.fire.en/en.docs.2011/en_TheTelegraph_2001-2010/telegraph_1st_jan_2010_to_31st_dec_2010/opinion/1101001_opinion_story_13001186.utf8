The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | clean the mess quickly
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CLEAN THE MESS QUICKLY                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	And now, the responsibility of cleaning up every third-rate and unacceptable plan concerning the Commonwealth Games has been finally given to the chief minister of Delhi, who has been put in situ at the last moment. How strange and ironic is that? It goes to show how ridiculous the many points of reference in Delhis governance really are.         
	A number of bodies, pulling in personal and different directions with no single, nodal entity as the responsible point of reference, have been fiddling with the preparations of the Games. Shady money-making has been a game that Indians are experts in, and the scale of the percentage that the operators make depends on how well honed their manipulative skills are. The men and women who get this opportunity actively compete with one another in this newly devised form of Monopoly  that wonderful board game of yore  and win all the medals.         
	It has been an extraordinary experience to watch the unravelling of the truth as far as the planning and administration of the CWG are concerned. India has organized many events that showcased the best of this country  from classical art and handicraft to cricket, spiritual yatras and mass political movements. The decay we see in this particular case is unprecedented. The corruption of the mind and soul has shamed India. To think we have failed to put together the Games with dignity and professionalism is unbelievable, and all excuses  from the inconsequential to the complex  are unacceptable. Heads must roll, and a hastily incorporated eGoM must not be the wishy-washy solution because all that it manages to do is to delay things so that other horrors can take over the imagination of the people of India. We need to fast-track the delivery of punishment if we want to dignify India.                 
	Old horrors        
	Money has taken precedence over the delivery of quality, and aesthetic sensibilities. The government, its babus and the political class are not, by any stretch of the imagination, competent to deliver anything that can stand up to international standards. Indian civilization, its people, their inherent skills and creative minds have stood the test of time and continue to command respect and admiration across the planet. Aided and abetted by the bureaucrats, these formidable and diverse strengths have been drowned in the quagmire.        
	The horror continues unabated. The graphic designs created by the government are bad and are stuck in a terrible time warp. The colour palettes are garish, textures shiny and slimy, the sensibility a mixture of the lowest common denominator of the West and the tacky jugadh of urban India that has become the unfortunate benchmark of the Indian aesthetic.         
	When confronted with questions about this scary reality which is plunging India into a morass, bureaucrats claim that their committees are on the verge of bringing about radical change. However, action on the ground is invisible and the stalling of renewal and reinvention is there for all to see. India is being stunted by babudom; there are no two ways about that. The management of the CWG, the many points of reference, the complete absence of accountability, the delays and last-minute jugadh, the corruption, blame game and so on represent the manner in which the government administers India and destroys its creative energy.         
	Are we going to revive and revitalize the best of India? Is there a tall leader with the necessary attributes to command the respect of the people and transform this nation state from a near banana republic to a truly emerging power with a supple rate of growth that benefits all?

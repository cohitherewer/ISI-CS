	I have an amorous relationship with Maggi noodles for several reasons, one of them being that the brand is almost the same age as I am. It was launched in 1984, a year after my birth. A brand makes much more of its time than a human being, evidently. In the two-and-a-half decades since its inception, Maggi has made itself synonymous with the word noodles in India. It has gained incredible popularity compared to other packaged foods, so much so that until recently it enjoyed a monopoly in the instant noodles market in this country. This is probably owing to the fact that Nestl India Limited, Maggis parent, foresaw the culinary desires of new-age Indians with faultless clarity. When it comes to a busy schedule and hunger pangs, the 2-minute catchword almost never fails to intrigue us.        
	Until the end of 2009, all was well with Maggi, as usual. But things seem to have gone a bit downhill since then. According to data collected by the market research firm, Nielsen, Maggi is losing market share since December 2009 on a monthly basis to new noodles brands such as Top Ramen, Knorr and Horlicks Foodles. The data shows that Maggis share in the instant noodles space across the countrys urban markets has fallen consistently between December 2009 and July 2010. Maggi held over 90 per cent of the market share in December 2009, while in July it was left with a little above 85 per cent. Just five per cent loss in market share may not seem important, unless placed in the context of the Rs 1,300-crore instant noodles market of India, and also the fact that Maggi has never had significant competition before. Analysts are of the opinion that with new competition, Maggis market share is certain to be affected further. Manoj Menon, an analyst working with fast-moving consumer goods, wrote in a report earlier this year, Maggi faces product substitution risk and brands like Knorr and Foodles could potentially impact its incremental growth.        
	However, Maggi still commands over 85 per cent of the market and faces no imminent danger of being de-shelved. But growing competition in the Indian noodles market is an interesting phenomenon. There seem to be diverse speculations among analysts as to the reason behind this new trend. Some say this is because consumers prefer healthy snacks now; brands such as Knorr and Foodles have concentrated on this penchant when designing their advertisements, while Maggi has not done so sufficiently. But this logic alone might not suffice to explain the shifts in market trends that have somewhat swayed the decades-old noodles brand. A more pertinent logic, it seems, is that several noodles brands, launched by powerful multinational companies such as GlaxoSmithKline and Hindustan Unilever, have started jostling for space alongside Maggi in the last few years. This sudden flurry of noodles brands is rather unprecedented in the Indian market. One wonders why. Why have companies felt the need to penetrate the noodles market all of a sudden after almost three decades of a single brand ruling the roost?        
	One could call it delayed wisdom, but looking at the cut-throat competition in consumer goods markets across India, it is hard to believe that no other company had the acumen to notice the noodles market before. It is possible that the popularity of Maggi appeared intimidating to prospective entrants. But what is still baffling is the question why Maggi has become less intimidating to its competitors in the recent past. Ankit Bansal, a consultant with a reputed market research firm, says, These launches represent a smart move by manufacturers to capitalize on the fundamental shifts in socio-economic patterns of the Indian society, rather than a me-too strategy. The manufacturers are trying to tap the potential this change has to offer.        
	The current growth rate of the Indian noodles market is about 17-20 per cent a year. This growth has something to do with the change Bansal refers to. It holds up a picture of Emerging India  of the increasing number of urban Indian professionals leading nomadic lives, changing cities every now and then, living out of cardboard boxes and having only enough time to cook instant noodles. Looking for their noodles on the shelves of supermarkets, they face a wide range of choices now. But, going by the figures, most of them still seem to prefer Maggi, perhaps out of habit, or maybe out of nostalgia.

	Red alert                  
	Sir  The day scribes were attacked in Pirakata was a sad one for the press in Bengal, where newspapers have flourished since the 19th century (Govt shuts eyes, party hems and haws, Sept 4). The assault seems to have been an attempt to stifle the media, which form the vital fourth estate in a democracy. The armed and aggressive activists of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have demonstrated that those who raise their voice against the party will not go unscathed. Even though the CPI(M)s strong-arm tactics failed in Nandigram and Singur, it simply refuses to learn any lesson from the past.          
	In the latest incident, a reporter and a photographer of The Telegraph, among others, were beaten up by the CPI(M) activists. The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, said that he was unaware of the mishap. The truth of his claim is suspect. There have been numerous instances in the past when the chief minister has feigned ignorance while his party workers have gone on a rampage. Declaring that he was unaware of the incident cannot absolve Bhattacharjee of responsibility.          
	Not only does Bhattacharjees response jeopardize his credibility, but it also raises questions about his competence as chief minister. He is unable either to rein in the party cadre or to protect the people and the CPI(M) workers from the Maoist onslaught. The state home ministry, which is headed by Bhattacharjee, has proved to be powerless to manage the crises.          
	The last few years of the CPI(M)s long rule in West Bengal have seen the growth of a worrying trend  of brutalizing journalists reporting unpalatable facts about the party. When the freedom of speech is smothered by violence, democracy stands threatened.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Subrata Pal, Karimpur, Nadia 

                
	Sir  The attack on the seven journalists in Pirakata brought back memories of Nandigram. There the CPI(M) cadre had set themselves upon journalists reporting the turmoil. Such attacks on mediapersons reflect a lack of basic administrative control. They also expose the total failure of the state government to protect the basic right of the people to practise their professions.          
	The incident in Pirakata seems to substantiate Mamata Banerjees allegations that the CPI(M) is running armed camps in Jangalmahal. The journalists had gone to the area to report on the CPI(M) camps. If the party activists had nothing to hide, they would not have objected to this visit. Perhaps the party workers were afraid that the huge stock of illegal arms they have accumulated will be exposed.           
	The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, has already acknowledged the existence of armed CPI(M) camps in Jangalmahal and recognized the need to take action against them. But it is doubtful whether the Bengal government would heed his warning.           
	Desperate to regain lost ground before the assembly elections in 2011, the CPI(M) seems to have resorted to undemocratic methods. These include recapturing villages, possibly by force. The party is anxious to get back its hold over the large swathes of West Bengal that have now become Maoist strongholds or have been won over by the Trinamul Congress. Perhaps this is the reason why the chief minister chooses to look the other way as his party workers attack journalists.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Incidents like the one in Pirakata are only to be expected in a state with a directionless,confused and ineffective government. It is headed, moreover, by a chief minister who has lost all credibility. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee claimed to have known nothing about the attack in Pirakata. Yet, according to reports, he had asked state officials to monitor proceedings in the area and ensure that people return to their homes in safety. Hence it is unlikely that he was not in the know.           
	Ever since the Union home ministry acknowledged the fact that the CPI(M) runs armed camps, the state government seems to be suffering from an attack of nerves. Its anxiety has prompted knee-jerk reactions, epitomized by the violence in Pirakata. Recently, even the prime minister indicated that he was aware of the controversy over the camps. He also mentioned the attack on journalists (PM refers to injury to reporter, Sept 7). The Union government must consider the matter seriously. Bhattacharjee may try to prevent the Centres intervention by saying that law and order is a state subject. But this should not stop the Centre from cracking down on CPI(M) camps.                    
	Yours faithfully,

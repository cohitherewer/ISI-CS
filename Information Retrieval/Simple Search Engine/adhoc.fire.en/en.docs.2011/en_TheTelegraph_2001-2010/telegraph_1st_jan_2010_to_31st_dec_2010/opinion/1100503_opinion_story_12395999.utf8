	The other side                  
	Sir  I have always had a sense of pride about the achievements of Indian women diplomats such as Nirupama Rao. Although scandals about the staff at the ministry of external affairs are not uncommon, it was shocking as well as painful to hear that Madhuri Gupta, a part of the Indian Foreign Services B-grade cadre and a second secretary at the Indian mission in Islamabad, has been spying for Pakistan for over two years (Curiosity bug nets spy, April 28). In 63 years of Independence, this is perhaps the first instance of a woman being involved in espionage.          
	Gupta claimed that her betrayal stemmed from anger at the way in which the IFS treated its B-grade officers. However, she might have considered other ways of addressing her grievances. It is most likely that the lure of money prompted her to pass on secrets, despite the fact that she comes from an affluent background and does not seem to need money. If Gupta is found guilty, she should be severely punished.          
	Yours faithfully,         Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 
                
	Sir  The case of Madhuri Gupta is perhaps a wake-up call to the government to address dissatisfaction among its employees. It is well known that there has been growing resentment among the armed forces personnel. Gupta lacks support from all quarters and every patriotic Indian will want justice to take its course. But the reason that she gave for her actions  that she felt she deserved more after years of service in the IFS  is a sentiment shared by many others.          
	Most government employees are disgruntled with their lot. In many cases, the reasons for resentment may be imaginary, but perceived as well as real deprivation can have equally dangerous consequences. The lack of opportunities and recognition may well manifest itself in bizarre ways. This sense of frustration has been growing among non-governmental employees as well. It is not possible for an organization to work with such deep discontent within its ranks. The people it employs will never be able to contribute to its goals positively.          
	Yours faithfully,         Md. Motleb Ali, Calcutta 
                
	Sir  In passing on crucial information to Pakistan, Madhuri Gupta has violated the principle of secrecy. The fact that an IFS officer in possession of sensitive information should spy for Pakistan for so long without being detected also indicates how inadequate the Indian security system is (Spy turns tables on quizzers, April 29).          
	The MEA might have tried to wave the matter aside, saying that the information passed on by Gupta can do little harm, but the extent of the information that she has betrayed to Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence may not be known to the ministry yet. The Pakistan government, meanwhile, has been tight-lipped, saying that the matter is Indias internal problem. Gupta cannot be let off lightly. She should be brought to trial and punished. She has committed one of the worst possible offences that an Indian can be guilty of.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ahana Sen Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It has become the norm that just when India and Pakistan are set to have talks, something untoward happens. This time, it is by someone from our own country, and no less a person than a member of the IFS. Incidents like this may be even more dangerous than a terror attack. We can secure our country from the latter by deploying more forces to sensitive areas such as borders, major cities and stations, but if our own diplomats betray the country, there is little left to be done. It is not possible to keep tab on every single IFS officer.          
	Another spine-chilling thought is that the Research and Analysis Wing may also have corrupt people like Gupta as its employees. It is time that the whole system, including RAW and the Intelligence Bureau, is put through a scanner. India and Pakistan have no chance of achieving a durable peace otherwise.          
	Yours faithfully,        Kunal Das, Haldia, East Midnapore            
	Delayed justice          
	Sir  Jagdish Tytler has now been acquitted of charges of being involved in the massacre of Sikhs in the 1984 riots, which occurred in the aftermath of Indira Gandhis assassination (Tytler clean, April 28). The Central Bureau of Investigation gave him a clean chit, which was ratified by a Delhi court. Perhaps he should be compensated by the Congress high command for the ordeal he has had to go through.          
	Nevertheless, certain questions remain unanswered. An estimated 3,000 Sikhs died in Delhi in 1984. But it has still not been established who was responsible for this tragedy. Before closing the case finally, the apex court should consider setting up a special investigation team, similar to the one appointed in the case of the Gujarat riots, to look into the matter. The case, however, has been weakened by Tytlers exoneration and the bail granted to Sajjan Kumar, the other Congress leader accused of being involved in the riots. It also lacks the voice of activists like Teesta Setalvad who have worked tirelessly for investigations into the Gujarat riots.          
	Yours faithfully,         S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

Rao                        Race to greatness				                                                   
	The last decade of the 20th century changed India. The new decade will help us embark on new paths altogether. The changes were not merely in economic policies, from command and control to openness and freedom for private enterprise. We were recognized as a nuclear power. P.V. Narasimha Raos hesitant steps towards changing foreign policy directions to look east to Asia have led to the creation of the influential BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China ) group.        
	The first truly national coalition government  the National Democratic Alliance  lasted a full term with clearly defined goals. These included military muscle to bolster economic power, anti-Statism in the economy, rapprochement between India and the United States of America, and growing closeness to both the US and Israel, along with attempts to put an end to the mutual antagonism with Pakistan.        
	Changes in policies despite different governments had continuity. Communal killings (Staines murders in Orissa, the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat and others), organized and externally supported Maoist rebellion in broad swathes of India, externally funded terrorist attacks, growing internal mobilization of some Muslim youth to create religious disharmony as well as economic pressures due to record oil prices, crop failures and global recession were some of the new challenges. The administrative apparatus was largely unaccountable, ineffective, inefficient, corrupt and concerned more with turf wars than dealing with the growing challenges. All this made policy implementation uncertain.        
	After the Gujarat riots and the many Muslim deaths, there have been practically no major communal strife. The new decade might see state governments being proactive in preventing disharmony. The Centre may crack the whip more easily, with assistance from the Central security and intelligence set-ups that have been created in response to terrorist threats.              
	The second decade saw growing hostility to migrants speaking other languages  in Bombay, and in states attracting migrant agricultural labour like Punjab, Haryana  with no government reaction. Economic neglect of some regions in large states like Maharashtra, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and even Rajasthan have resulted in agitations for splitting the states. The Centre has done little to alleviate such neglect. Relief packages are poorly thought out and badly implemented. They do not kick-start development or give authority to the local population.        
	Fear of electoral consequences, and of Balkanization, has led to a dithering on demands for local autonomy. In 1955, the death of Potti Sriramulu in a hunger strike led to the creation of Andhra Pradesh. It also led to the wise decision of setting up a states reorganization commission, leading to the creation of states formed on linguistic lines .        
	A new SRC in the 1990s could have considered smaller states that are administratively more viable, enabling the speedy development of neglected areas such as Vidarbha in Maharashtra, the hill areas of West Bengal, Bundelkhand and some other parts of Uttar Pradesh, the large tribal tracts of Madhya Pradesh and perhaps some other contiguous areas. Neither the NDA nor the UPA coalition governments acted on this. Telangana will come about, and will lead to smaller states, peacefully or after much violence.        
	Terrorist attacks in the previous decade were not as military precise in their planning and execution as the Bombay attack in November 2008. These attacks finally woke the government from its complacency. The home and internal security ministries could not any longer be left to a loyal clothes horse or a self-styled Iron Man. Since then, there is for the first time a confidence in the public mind that these portfolios are in good hands and the right actions are being taken speedily to promote coordination among intelligence agencies, police and other security forces to send the clear message that there is zero tolerance for terrorism.        
	Unfortunately, the same single- point message sent to the Maoists rebelling against the State in the vast tribal belt of central India has been in the wrong. The message must ensure the delivery of economic and social packages. But the administrative systems of the concerned state governments appear incapable of the effort. The tribals in the Maoist-controlled areas, who are citizens and among the most deprived in the country, could tear the country apart in the coming years to secure their just demands.        
	The other challenge is the development of minorities, especially Muslims and Dalits. The latter remain marginalized even in their present religions. Giving them special preference will either cross the Supreme Court ceiling on reservation or bring them in conflict with the Hindu Dalits. Political sensitivity and leadership can find new approaches, but they will require capable administrative implementation.        
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee initiated large investments in urban and rural infrastructure, especially in roads and ports. These stimulated the economy. The UPA developed the idea of public-private partnership and viability gap funding, which enabled private sector participation at low cost to government. These have stimulated massive investments in urban and rural infrastructure, consumer demand and economic growth.        
	Economic reforms in India date back to the opening in the 1980s, under Rajiv Gandhi, to information technology and telecommunication, the relaxing of rigid industrial licensing and the easing of restrictions on so-called industrial monopolies. The 1990s saw all political parties, limited by their mindsets, in favour of State ownership and control.        
	The presence of the communists in the first UPA coalition made it impossible to change course. These made the easing of many restraints on industrial development difficult. That may explain the faster development of the services sector  trade, hotels, restaurants, transport, communications, finance, insurance, real estate, information technology, and government services  in relation to industry. Agriculture remains the most neglected sector in the economy despite being the major source of employment. Industry is also a laggard in our poor economy. Y.S.R. Reddy broke the jinx of incumbency in Andhra Pradesh mainly because of massive investments in agricultural assets such as dams, canals and so on. The freedom from the old mindset in this decade might allow national growth-oriented policies in agriculture and industry.              
	The idea of inclusive growth has seen fruition with the national rural employment guarantee scheme. The bureaucracy has ensured the programme is poorly implemented. But what was implemented has begun to change the face of employment among the rural poor, added substantially to purchasing power, stimulated rural markets and the economy, and begun to change the labour market. Other innovative pro-poor schemes like education for all and the national rural health mission have been implemented even more poorly.         
	Administrative reform remains the least reformed area. Changes in rules for recruitment, training, evaluation, promotion, tenures and transfers, specialization, accountability, disciplinary actions and so on are yet to take place even 62 years after Independence. The same goes for the reform of administrative institutions, and especially of local self-government, in urban and local bodies to improve autonomy, local planning and implementation. The bureaucracy is a stumbling block everywhere, with legislators wanting to retain credit for improvement in their constituencies.        
	At the close of the first decade of the new century, it is clear that despite its limitations, India is now poised to be a major player in the comity of nations. Powering this race is the Indian economy. But is it going to be a superpower as many claim or will it merely improve the living conditions for most of its people? In my next column, I shall explore the problems and prospects.							       The author is former director- general, National Council for Applied Economic Research

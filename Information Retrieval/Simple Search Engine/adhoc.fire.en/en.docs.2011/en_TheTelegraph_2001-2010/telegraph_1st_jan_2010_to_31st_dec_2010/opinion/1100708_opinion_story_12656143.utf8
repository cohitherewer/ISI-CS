	Women in Indias armed forces are engaged in a different kind of battle, and they have not won yet. In March, acting on a complaint from some female officers of the army and the air force, the Delhi High Court had ordered the government to grant women permanent commissions instead of the conventional short service commission that allows them to serve up to 14 years at most. It sets them apart from the men, who can apply for a permanent commission and be entitled to higher benefits as well as a longer time to serve the country. The defence ministry has shilly-shallied over this order, and has placed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court for a review of the high courts March order after the high court issued notices to the army chief, the defence secretary and the adjutant general for not having followed it.        
	There is a deeply ingrained resistance to the idea of women as soldiers, and this is so all over the world. Even the Delhi High Court order ensures that women are given a permanent commission in non-combatant roles. This is exactly like the Indian air forces ban on women flying fighter planes. The army appears not too keen on giving women officers permanent commissions because their subordinates would be men, and the armys male-driven culture baulks at accepting orders from women. This sounds crudely discriminatory, but excuses displaying greater sophistication have similar roots. One objection against women pilots in the West was the fear they would not be able to fight gravitation; that has been countered with suggestions for training in military occupational specialities that should be exactly the same for men and women. Equality would be for the sake of effectiveness, not gender balance. This could work in India too. The old ban on close and ground combat for women has stopped working ever since frontlines became fluid. Thousands of women have been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, if only because the West can no longer reject the resources. Women know that female prisoners of war are sexually vulnerable when they take the decision to fight and prove themselves able; men need not pose this as another concern. Both men and women need training to accept that all jobs in the army are open to anyone who proves to be fit for them. Culture is created by the dominant attitude; it cannot be a pretext to stop women from getting permanent commissions.

NAYAR                                                      
	The sleaze from the Indian Premier Leagues gutter, which has significantly diminished the countrys political class and others in authority  such as the chairman and managing director of Air India, Arvind Jadhav, who willingly converted the airline into a private carrier for the IPL  is a warning that for the Indian State, Dubai continues to be a curse.        
	My first direct exposure as a young journalist to the depth and range of corruption and wrong-doing in the Indian government was in Dubai, where I lived in the 1980s. I used to frequent the office of the owner of a big bank in Dubai. His chief hatchet man, his CEO of sorts  although such fancy corporate designations were unknown in Dubai then  was an Indian from Kerala, who constituted my access to the bank owner, a multi-billionaire businessman whose sprawling global business empire included everything from hotels and car dealerships to newspapers and real estate.        
	It is only an incidental aside to the main narrative of this column that at that time, the bank owner, whose family had huge business and personal stakes in Pakistan, was providing refuge to an exiled Benazir Bhutto in one of his three houses off Londons Mayfair and simultaneously running businesses under various names for the head of one of the 22 families which controlled 66 per cent of Pakistani industry and owned 87 per cent of that countrys banking and insurance prior to nationalization of those by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. While Benazir was running her campaign against General Zia-ul-Haq from this Dubai businessmans London property  where I first met her  the irony is that the man for whom the same entrepreneur was running benami ventures was one of the most powerful ministers in General Zias cabinet.              
	The general manager of the bank owned by the Dubai businessman was an amiable Scotsman, who was totally trusted by the owner to look after his wide-ranging interests. One day, the general manager was summoned by the owner and told that a fairly large sum of money needed to be withdrawn from the account of Mr Crow and that the Scotsman should deliver the money to the owner. It would be collected by Mr Crow whom the owner would be seeing in the next two days while he was visiting the Emirate.        
	I sat quietly in a corner of the room, sipping gahwa, a ritual coffee preparation in Arab communities, and wondering who Mr Crow may be. I did not have to wait long to discover his identity: Mr Crow was a very senior civil servant who later became Indias foreign secretary.        
	For a journalist with a nose for information, Dubai is one of the most open places in the world. Once a newsman has won the trust of an Arab, howsoever sensitive his position may be, he will share information with you which will be wrapped in multiple layers of secrecy in most other countries. In my decade-long experience in Dubai, people share information with trusted journalists in the full knowledge that it will not be written about  until after decades, as in the case of this narrative. Unless, of course, the journalist is seeking a one-way plane ticket out of the Emirate.        
	So, I found out that the arrangement with Mr Crow was merely the tip of an iceberg of questionable activities in this once-thriving bank, which fell on bad times during one of the Gulf regions cyclical downturns and was taken over by the Emirates government to be merged with a bigger bank, which was wholly owned by the sheikhdom of Dubai. It is not known what subsequently happened to the secret account of Mr Crow. But the future foreign secretary was not the only prominent Indian to have his illicit wealth stashed away in undisclosed accounts abroad in those days of severe foreign exchange controls at home.        
	Only a few people at the top in the family-owned, poorly-regulated, unaudited banks in Dubai in those days knew the true identity of account-holders like Mr Crow. I have heard the general manager and the owner of the bank in question discuss with the Malayali CEO of the conglomerate the accounts of a Mr Frog or a Mr Cat. I was told in absolute confidence 25 years ago that a rising politician then, who subsequently became a member of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs cabinet, was the holder of one such account while another member of Singhs previous council of ministers had a fat account under a similarly fictitious name.        
	During much of the 13 years when Win Chadha, arms-agent-turned-accused in the Bofors scandal, lived as an absconder in Dubai, Indias emissaries who went to the Emirate ostensibly to have him repatriated repeatedly told Dubai authorities that although they were serving papers seeking Chadhas return, in reality they did not want to lay their hands on him. Over the years, such duplicity by New Delhi has cost India the respect of the Dubai government. When Chadha finally returned to India in 2000 during National Democratic Alliances rule, the then Indian ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, K.C. Singh, successfully used his persuasive powers, not legal coercion to facilitate his return. By then, New Delhi had so completely lost credibility with Dubai in the Chadha case that no Indian official with a modicum of integrity or sensitivity could look the Emirates authorities in the eye or demand the repatriation of the former Bofors agent.        
	It is no surprise that Dubai became home to the so-called D-Company, the gang of fugitive smuggler and drug dealer, Dawood Ibrahim, who eventually contracted his services to organize terrorist attacks on India on behalf of Pakistan. Or that Dubai was the transit point from India to Pakistan for some members of the Memon family, who planned the serial bomb attacks on Mumbai in 1993. How could the Dubai government be expected to believe that India was serious about getting Dawood back to Mumbai when it has been plain as daylight to the UAE and to Bahrain that at least on two occasions in the 1990s when there was real chance that Dawood  and his brother Anees Ibrahim in the case on Bahrain  would be extradited, New Delhi blew the opportunities to do so.        
	Everything that is rotten in India has a Dubai angle: human trafficking, gold smuggling, money laundering and terrorist financing through the hawala or parallel banking system, and now, the IPL. It is symptomatic of Dubais dubious importance for Indias political class that during every election season in India, the value of the rupee shoots up in the Emirates money market where the Indian currency is freely available and is actively traded. Not only does its value go up: currency notes of Rs 1,000 denomination suddenly become short in supply, obviously because they are physically transported to India to finance the elections with black money.        
	In the 1980s, when a surge in complaints about exploitation and mistreatment of Indian workers forced New Delhi to offer more institutional protection to immigrant workers, an Indian consul-general in Dubai who sought to ensure such protection was threatened by recruiting agents, Indians who supply labour to the Gulf states. When the consul-general stood his ground, the agents plainly told him that they would go to New Delhi and get their way. Not only did they get their way, but soon enough, the ministry of external affairs instituted several enquiries against the consul-general who eventually left his post under a cloud.              
	The situation has only got worse and more serious since then as Dubais hold over India deteriorates into a stranglehold. More recently, another consul-general in Dubai, a very senior officer who is currently serving elsewhere abroad, paid with his reputation after South Block instituted investigations against him based  believe it or not  on allegations levelled against him by known frontmen for Dawood Ibrahim. Relying on evidence provided by Dawoods henchmen in moving against the senior diplomat was like relying on a thiefs testimony in a case of robbery against himself!        
	Last week, speaking about the rot in the IPL and Indian crickets Dubai connection in the Lok Sabha, Abdul Rahman, the MP from Vellore, singled out for praise two officers, Yash Sinha and Venu Rajamony, who were recently consuls-general in the Emirate. Given the unfair treatment of some of their predecessors by New Delhi which surrendered to cabals in Dubai, it was just as well that Rahman, who lived in Dubai before contesting from Vellore last year, put his impressions on record.        
	Because more and more of Indias rich and powerful are increasingly beholden to Dubai one way or another, the Emirate has now come to believe that India can be treated like another banana republic that Dubai, in fact, is. Last month, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Dubais ruler, accepted an invitation to be a keynote speaker at a conclave organized by a media group, then used that invitation to wangle a meeting with the prime minister and left without addressing the conclave. True, the government had nothing to do with the conclave, but the Dubai rulers behaviour betrays a lack of decency which ought to inject an element of caution in any future dealings with the sheikh whose policies have brought Dubai to the edge of a precipice.

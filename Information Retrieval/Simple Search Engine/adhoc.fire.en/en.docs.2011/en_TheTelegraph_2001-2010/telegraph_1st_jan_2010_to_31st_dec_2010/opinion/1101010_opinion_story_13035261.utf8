	 Although clearly pleased with the Ayodhya verdict, the Bharatiya Janata Party decided to play it safe the next day, which happened to be a Friday. Indeed, the party spokesman, Shahnawaz Hussain, contemplated hard before opting out of praying at New Delhis Jama Masjid, which is a stones throw away from the Parliament. Instead, Hussain prayed at home, thanking the almighty that the judgment had not resulted in communal violence. The calculated absence from the Friday congregation also spared Hussain the searching questions from fellow namazis who, post-prayer, have a habit of gathering around political leaders to get a feel of the state of the country. In faraway Bhopal, the news of Lord Rams birthplace being given some sort of legitimacy excited some BJP-allied outfits so much that they began distributing sweets and bursting fire-crackers. But before the TV channels could roll the cameras, the chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, ordered a disruption of power supply as part of his overall thrust to enforce discipline. The cover of darkness continued for an hour till a sobering sense prevailed.                
	 Rahul Gandhis declaration that both the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Students Islamic Movement of India are two sides of the same coin has outraged many in the BJP. A closer scrutiny revealed that this, apparently, is the line endorsed by Digvijay Singh, the general-secretary of the All India Congress Committee. He has been saying this in his home state, Madhya Pradesh, since the early 1990s, when the questionable activities were noticed and, as the then chief minister, Singh accused the saffron parivar of indulging in destruction. Now the RSS-BJP leaders are wondering if Rahul is pursuing Diggy Rajas agenda or putting forth his own point of view.                            
	 The tenure of the Union home ministers officer on special duty, Safi Ahsan Rizvi, has come to an end. For the last few months, the officer with the Indian Police Service has been reportedly saying how P Chidambaram will find it hard to get a suitable replacement. Now Safi has been promoted and given a coveted assignment in his home state, Uttar Pradesh. In the North Bloc, officials and Safis colleagues are pleased and reassured that the IPS fraternity has still got such a talent pool.                            
	 Apparently, the legal eagles of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board are feeling a bit sheepish after the Sunni Waqf Boards claim on Babri Masjid was rejected by the high court. These members are now putting pressure on a somewhat reluctant clergy to move Supreme Court. The AIMPLB top brass has been told to engage the best lawyers of the country to fight the case. Efforts are on to organize huge funds to pay for these advocates. And sensing the general mood, senior lawyers in the apex court have reportedly started sending out feelers.                            
	 The chairman of the organizing committee of the Commonwealth Games, Suresh Kalmadi, may have set a record of sorts. Not just for allegations of corruption but also for being the butt of a hundred jokes. No other personality, in recent years, has given rise to so many humorous digs. Indeed, these one-liners are spreading like wildfire, not only across the country but also among Indians abroad. The truth behind the bulk SMS ban is to stop Kalmadi jokes, goes one. Heres another: Terrorists set to skip CWG 2010 citing unliveable conditions and fear for their safety. Some more: Prince Charles is actively convincing the Queen to visit dengue-hit Delhi. This may be his last chance to become the king! Q: How many contractors are required to change a light bulb in a Delhi CWG stadium? A: 1 million. (1 to change the bulb and the rest 999,999 to hold the ceiling). And finally: The next edition of the CWG will be called KWG, or Kalmadi Wealth Games.                            
	 Mayavati is fielding someone called Lal Krishna Advani from Supaul in the forthcoming Bihar assembly elections. The Bahujan Samaj Party list also has names like Prabhunath Singh, running from Daraunda, and Krishna Sahi, contesting from Hathua. The BSP cadre have been instructed to clarify the affiliations of these candidates during the campaign so as to avoid all possible confusions.          
	 Pressure is mounting on the BJP leader, Shatrughan Sinha, to ask his daughter, Sonakshi, to campaign for the party in election-bound Bihar. However, the budding actress is reluctant to make her political colours public just yet. Moreover, no less than Salman Daabang Khan has reportedly advised his co-actress against making a political gesture at a time when her career is at such a nascent stage. So, at the moment, things are a bit tense between father and daughter.      
	Sinha Senior reportedly values Salmans opinion but does not want to antagonize the party leadership either. All this has put him under a lot of stress. As it is, things are heating up in the electoral field, and Sinha really does not need any additional excitement on the home front.

	Fanning hatred                  
	Sir  It was upsetting that Pastor Terry Jones wanted to commemorate the September 11 attack by burning copies of the Quran (US church defiant over Quran stunt, Sept 9). Jones, a member of the Dove World Outreach Centre in Gainsville, Florida, saw the gesture as a warning to radical Islam. Ironically, the great Muslim festival of Eid was also on September 11 this year. Burning copies of the Quran on such an occasion could have had explosive repercussions.          
	Jones seems to represent a certain resentment against Islam that has been gaining ground in the United States of America. It was manifest in the objections to building a mosque near Ground Zero in New York. Even the US president, Barack Obama, was at times viewed with suspicion because his middle name is Hussein. Radical Islam may be a threat to certain countries but it is important not to identify all Muslims with the likes of Osama bin Laden. Similarly, all Christians cannot be represented by Jones and others of his ilk.          
	The threat to burn copies of the Quran had incited protests in Pakistan and Afghanistan, some of which turned violent. Joness plan, which was fortunately stopped in time, can only be described as crude, provocative and utterly disrespectful of another religion. No religion in the world preaches or sanctions hatred against other faiths.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  Pastor Terry Joness plan to call September 11 the International Quran Burning Day and consign the holy book of Islam to the flames was foolish and condemnable.          
	The act might have had dangerous consequences that Jones either overlooked or chose to ignore. The threat to burn the Quran would not have been taken lightly by the Muslim world, where the holy book is revered. Nothing in the Bible encourages Christians to treat Muslims or any other religious group with this kind of contempt.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	The game is up          
	Sir  The preparations for the Commonwealth Games have been dogged by controversy. It has not helped that Delhi received rainfall on an unprecedented scale this year. As Mukul Kesavan observes in his article, After years of living with climate, this year we have had weather. (Raining on the Games, Sept 9). Meanwhile, the Games, due to be held from October 3-14, are drawing closer.          
	A few weeks ago, Mani Shankar Aiyar, a member of the Congress, had expressed satisfaction with the wet Delhi weather. The rains, according to Aiyar, augured well for the agricultural sector. They also threatened to foil preparations for the Commonwealth Games. Personally, he said, I will be unhappy if the Commonwealth Games are successful.           
	Indeed, the shoddy preparations for the Games reflect miserably on the countrys image. To begin with, most of the construction work has failed to meet deadlines. A huge amount of money was allocated for the Games. Claims about the nation being benefitted in return are not convincing. Widespread corruption among organizers also resulted in vast sums being squandered on the Games. At last, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has decided to intervene in the matter.           
	The sports ministry should order an inquiry into the fiasco of the arrangements for the Games. No major sports event should be hosted by India until this inquiry is completed.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Diptimoy De, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Mukul Kesavans article served to reinforce Mani Shankar Aiyars rancour with the Commonwealth Games. Repeated warnings failed to rouse the countrys ruling classes from their deep slumber. It took the divine intervention of a long and heavy monsoon to alarm them. The president of the Indian Olympic Association, Suresh Kalmadi, and his team have disgraced India in the international arena. The beautification drive in Delhi in anticipation of the Games is only a cover-up for ugly realities: widespread corruption, clandestine acquisition of forest land, failure to meet deadlines and cavalier disruption of campus life in Delhi University, to name a few. The beggars may have been removed from the streets of Delhi. But they have been replaced by an equally grim reality  the evident greed and dishonesty of those in power.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

	Once a problem child, always a problem child. Despite repeatedly agreeing to self-reform, North Korea seems to have gone back to its truant ways. A multinational investigation concluded last week has proved conclusively that it was indeed a North Korean submarine that sank Cheonan, a South Korean warship, in a dastardly attack in March that killed more than 40 soldiers on board. North Korea has consistently denied such claims, perhaps aware of how international opinion would shape up against it. It is common knowledge that the seas remain the battle front of the two belligerent nations that signed a non-aggression pact in the 1950s, and that the end result is often quite ugly for both the Koreas. But given its steady recalcitrance to curb its nuclear ambition, North Korea would have known that it would not be easily forgiven for having carried its naval war games a bit too far. The way the cards are stacking up against it would confirm its suspicions. The United States of America and Japan have thrown their weight behind South Korea, which is threatening to take the matter to the United Nations. Seoul has already ceased all commercial ties with North Korea, and is planning to start a propaganda war in the demilitarized zone and increase its military presence in the seas through joint exercises with the US.         
	North Korea may be in a difficult corner right now, but it cannot be said to have dug itself into a hole with its naval misadventure. In spite of Seouls fulminations, it is unlikely that it will find itself amidst a fresh outbreak of war or international sanctions. Its stockpile of nuclear weapons may be a deterrent for the first, and its friendship with China rules out the second. China has steadfastly refused to come down heavily on North Korea, preferring negotiations to sanctions, and its reaction to the present crisis is no exception to that established behaviour. The US, naturally, is doing its bit to bring around China. But if it has to choose between Iran and North Korea for a promise of Chinese support, it would, without doubt, find itself compelled to go slow on the Korea front. The regime in North Korea, thankful to the crisis for the image boost it has given it, understands the US compulsions too well. So far from turning sober, it may continue to remain the problem it is.

	RAMAKRISHNA PARAMAHAMSA: THE SADHAKA OF DAKSHINESWAR (Viking)
  By Amiya P. Sen                
	A very accessible biography of modern Bengals most legendary religious figure. Excellent on Ramakrishnas spiritual background and his teachings.                         
	WAR AND PEACE IN MODERN INDIA: A STRATEGIC HISTORY OF THE NEHRU YEARS (Permanent Black) 
  By Srinath Raghavan                
	A fresh look at some critical issues in the foreign policy of Jawaharlal Nehru. How did Nehru view the use of force while pursuing his foreign policy? The author looks at Junagadh, Hyderabad, Kashmir in 1947-48, Bengal during the refugee influx of the 1950s and, of course, the Sino-Indian war of 1962.        
	IN MY BOOK  
	Graham Robb rsquo;s Parisians   (Picador) presents slices of that city rsquo;s history through episodes in the lives of famous and   obscure individuals. The book begins with a riveting account of Napoleon rsquo;s first visit to the city, as a young soldier who was not yet twenty, and had yet to lose his virginity. Other chapters feature elevating or embarrassing encounters with and in Paris  of the poet Baudelaire, the philosopher Sartre, the musician Miles Davis, and the politicians de Gaulle, Mitterrand, Adolf Hitler, Madame Zola and Sarkozy. This is a work of biography and social history, or more accurately, of biography as social history which also provides a subtle exploration of what Paris meant to these men and women. It is quite a wonderful book, so good that it cries out for imitators.

	A HISTORY OF THE WORLD IN 100 OBJECTS (Allen Lane) 
  By Neil MacGregor                
	A highly original and thoroughly enjoyable approach to the history of mankind using objects left behind by civilizations of the past. Offers a glimpse into some of the treasures of the British Museum. One of the outstanding books of the year.                        
	FOLLOWING FISH (Penguin) 
  By Samanth Subramanian                
	Chronicles a fascinating journey along the coastal regions of India to explore fish-related memories. This is a treat in more senses than one.                        
	THE HARE WITH THE AMBER EYES: A HIDDEN INHERITANCE (Chatto amp; Windus) 
  By Edmund de Waal                
	A stunning and poignant memoir that travels across the world to recapture the fortunes of one of the richest Jewish families of Europe. The starting point is the collection of Japanese wood and ivory carvings that the author inherited.                        
	DHARMANAND KOSAMBI: THE ESSENTIAL WRITINGS (Permanent Black)                 
	The story of the remarkable life and mind of a scholar-rebel who brought together in his life erudition, spirituality and simplicity.   
	IN MY BOOK  
	 quot; Sonia Faleiro rsquo;s Beautiful Thing (Hamish Hamilton) is a small gem of observation and intimate reportage mdash; a sassy, sensitive and deeply moving account of a bar girl rsquo;s journey spiralling down through the circles of hell that is Bombay rsquo;s sex industry. James Mather rsquo;s Pashas (Yale) is the first full-length study since 1935 of the Levant Company, the organization which oversaw both England rsquo;s trade and diplomacy with the Ottoman world, and which supervised the remarkably successful relationship between the two worlds. My favourite book of the year is Bruce Chatwin rsquo;s letters: Under the Sun (Cape), a reminder of just how brilliant and gifted that driven, mendacious and dazzling man could be.  quot;
    William Dalrymple    
	THE EMPEROR OF ALL MALADIES (Scribner) 
  By Siddhartha Mukherjee        
	Traces the history of cancer from its first recorded appearance to attempts in the 20th century to battle with it and to find a cure for it. This is an eloquent biography of a dreaded disease.                      
	 ONCE AGAIN TO ZELDA (Picador) 
  By Marlene Wagman-Geller                
	Looks at the dedications of some well-known books and locates the stories that lie behind them. A book about books and thus delightful for readers and book-lovers.                        
	 HUGH TREVOR-ROPER: THE BIOGRAPHY (Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson)
  By Adam Sisman                
	A deeply satisfying account of the life of a historian and public figure who courted controversy and revelled in it. Trevor-Roper wanted to write like Gibbon but never wrote the magnum opus expected of him. He was the master of the long essay.                
	CHURCHILLS SECRET WAR: THE BRITISH EMPIRE AND THE RAVAGING OF INDIA DURING WORLD WAR II (Tranquebar)
  By Madhusree Mukherjee              
	That Winston Churchill was an imperialist who hated the idea of relinquishing the British Empire in India is well known to most people and certainly to Indians. But that his dislike for Indians could extend to creating conditions for a famine that would kill hundreds of thousands is revealed by Madhusree Mukherjee in this book. It has fresh material which helps confirm what were previously only suspicions. The famine that devastated rural Bengal in 1943 is placed in the broader context of World War II. Vivid and evocative.  
	IN MY BOOK  
	My reading in 2010 was retrospective in many ways, retrieving narrative and material pasts, as with Juan Gabriel V aacute;squez rsquo;s retrofictional dismantling of Joseph Conrad rsquo;s Nostromo, translated from Spanish into English by Anne McLean as The Secret History of Costaguana (Bloomsbury), and Finbarr B. Flood rsquo;s marvellous history of transmissions and transformations in material cul ture, Objects of Translation (Princeton). V aacute;squez rsquo;s novel, if not lsquo;Latin America rsquo;s postmodern answer to  Europe rsquo;s modernist vision rsquo;, is nevertheless an absorbing, tragicomic account of the building of the Panama Canal and Conrad rsquo;s evolution as a writer. Flood studies a range of objects from buildings and inscriptions   to ivories, textiles and metalwork, brilliantly illuminating the intricate patterns of exchange between Hindus and Muslims in pre-modern India.

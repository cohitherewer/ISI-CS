The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A nation full of shirkers
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A NATION FULL OF SHIRKERS                                  THIS ABOVE ALL: Khushwant Singh                          Holiday mood                                        
	The Bharat bandh called on July 5 by the Opposition parties brought life to a standstill in many states. The loss to the country ran into hundreds of crores. Its success is understandable as prices of petrol, diesel and edibles like dals, vegetables and just about every thing have gone up three to four times. But it would have been better if the Opposition leaders had specified what they would do to bring the prices down if they were in power rather than simply blaming the government. Their inability to do so exposes their sinister motives; they came together, even though they are bitterly opposed to one another, to try out their joint strength and see if they could bring down the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government and make a bid for grabbing power. And the easiest short cut is to prevent the government from functioning, no matter what it may cost the country.        
	Unfortunately, we, as a people, are prone to abstain from work on the slightest excuse. This is very different from the Chinese who are well known to work eight days a week. We, on the other hand, take as many holidays as we can wangle  earned leave, sick leave (whether sick or not), religious holidays, gazetted holidays as a mark of respect to leaders who kick the bucket, and at times with no excuse whatsoever. That is the main reason why the pace of our progress is slower than Chinas. Besides we have the largest number of beggars whose only work is to beg on the streets. We also have a large number of shirkers who justify not doing any work on religious grounds  sadhus, sants, nihangs and their likes. We have to cultivate work culture and erase words like hartal, bandh, gherao and chakka jam.                
	Visitors from the neighbourhood                
	Last month, 11 Pakistani journalists came to visit India. Some of them expressed the wish that besides calling on the prime minister and the home minister, they wanted to meet journalists like Kuldip Nayar and me, who, even though refugees from Pakistan, went out of their way to foster Indo-Pak friendship.         
	I am now too old to take the strain of meeting strangers. I gave in when I was told that one of them claimed to be from Hadali, where I was born 96 years ago and spent the first five years of my life. So Asim Awan, political reporter of The Express Tribune of Islamabad, turned up at 7pm. He was not from Hadali but from the neighbouring town of Khushab, along the banks of the river Jhelum. All I remember of it is the railway platform and the story I was told of one of my great-grandmothers who lived there. She used to go to the river before the break of dawn to have a bath. One early morning, she felt something sting her in the back. She hurried back and died. When they were bathing her corpse for cremation, they found the mark of a snake-bite behind her neck. How many people can boast of a great-grandmother who died of snake bite? I can, and she lived in Khushab.        
	Both Khushab and Hadali have undergone a great change in their population since the partition of India in 1947. In Hadali Hindus and Sikhs were replaced by Muslim refugees from Rohtak. In Khushab, they were replaced by Muslims from Ambala. In both Hadali and Khushab remained original Muslim clans comprising Awans, Tiwanas, Waddals, Mastials and Noons.        
	I asked Asim Awan whether he found any anti-Pakistani bias in India. Not at all, he replied. On the contrary, when people found out that I was from Pakistan, they went out of their way to be extra friendly. I was happy to know that. He added: After all, we are the same kind of people and speak the same languages.        
	At the end of the meeting, I asked him where they were staying. In Maurya Sheraton. Even the staff are very friendly.        
	It is amongst the most expensive hotels in Delhi, I remarked.        
	We are not paying out of our pockets; we are guests of your government, he clarified.        
	I was happy to hear that. However, the next morning, I read in the newspapers that the number of Pakistanis visiting India has dropped by half because our embassy in Islamabad does not grant them visas. I was baffled. Is this what our home minister believes to be the way of reducing the trust deficit that he often talks about?

	The Letters of T.S. Eliot, Volume 2: 1923-1925 
  Edited by Valerie Eliot and Hugh Haughton, Faber, 35        
	In 1923, after a typically harrowing party at the Eliots, Virginia Woolf noted in her diary: I noticed that [Eliots] eyes were blurred. He cut the cake meticulously. He helped us to coffee  or was it tea? Then to liqueurs We discussed the personal element in literature. Tom then quietly left the room. L. heard sounds of sickness. After a long time, he came back, sank into the corner amp; I saw him, ghastly pale, with his eyes shut, apparently in a stupor. When we left he was only just able to stand on his legs.        
	Woolfs bleakly comical account captures the essence of the three miserable years Eliot spent in London between 1923 and 1925, working for the Lloyds Bank, while editing the quarterly, The Criterion, as he nursed his chronically ill first wife, Vivien, and suffered a thousand afflictions himself. In spite of the storm and stress, Eliot somehow affected an Olympian calm, a brisk, business-like manner that runs through the voluminous correspondence he kept up during this period. Even as he wallowed in self-pity (I have been boiled in hellbroth) and made a detailed inventory of Viviens ailments (an extraordinary excess of streptococcus fecalis, and other mischievous cocci), he did so with a clinical precision (like playing the ideal host, cutting the cake perfectly and being quietly sick all at once) that belied his inner turmoil quite splendidly.        
	Eliots impeccable grace gave no satisfaction to his more volatile friends like Woolf, who would probably have preferred him to go properly mad instead of perpetually hanging on the brink of a breakdown  which is neither here nor there, as Woolf wryly observed. Poor dear Tom, she went on, [I wish he] had more spunk in him, less need to let drop by drop of his agonized perplexities fall ever so finely through pure cambric. But for this instinctive self-preservation, Eliot could very well have done himself in, so deeply mired was he in a slough of despond for the greater part of these three desperate years.        
	In his day job as an expert on Enemy Debts, Eliot combed through 20 newspapers in several European languages, prepared reports, and led a team of four girls and three men. Then, after eight exhausting hours at the bank, he squeezed into each evening an entire days work that really mattered to him  commissioning for The Criterion, reading proofs and manuscripts, advising his publisher on payment and production, alongside preparing the occasional lecture for Oxbridge undergraduates (he would deliver the prestigious Clarke Lectures in 1926), revising his essays on 18th century poetry for the Hogarth Press, and contributing articles to periodicals like the Dial, Times Literary Supplement and The Nation. Like Prufrock, he measured out his life with coffee spoons.        
	Such a Herculean regime eventually took its toll on Eliots health, threatening to undermine his suave public persona. (With an equally deadly array of maladies he offered close competition to his invalid wife.) There are sporadic outbursts of rage, despair and bitter resentment to friends and family (his mother, John Middleton Murry and Lady Ottoline Morrell are the chief recipients of these intensities), a good deal of self-loathing induced by some obscure guilt, and unsparing criticism of his own work (he dismisses The Waste Land as simply a struggle). In these years, Eliot practically wrote no verse (except for the scraps of Sweeney Agonistes and that ghostly song-sequence, The Hollow Men); instead, he made the pursuit of unhappiness his most cherished avocation.        
	Eliot may have plausibly felt himself a misfit in the charmed circle of schizophrenics, malcontents, feminists, homosexuals and geniuses that grew up in interwar London. It certainly did not help being a political conservative, who made a staid but steady living as a banker, when literary salons all over London were teeming with romantics, rebels and reactionaries. In spite of his Anglophilia, Eliot kept a sane distance from wild excesses. After reading a piece by Wyndham Lewis for The Criterion, he thought it was much better to leave the Bloomsbury accent at a queer exaggeration of speech and omit the parenthesis bringing to ones mind the sounds associated with spasms of a rough Channel passage which seems to cheapen it. No wonder Eliot took a while to admire the cadences of Gertrude Stein and the later Joyce.        
	Yet, in spite of this apparent lack of glamour, Eliot seldom suffered from a sense of injured merit: his genius was recognized almost universally and accorded the highest esteem in the European republic of letters. Joyce, Proust, Woolf, Yeats, Lawrence, Cocteau, Valry, Dostoevsky and Hugo von Hofmannsthal were among his regular contributors. Scholars like Richard Aldington, Bonamy Dobre, Herbert Read and Ernst Robert Curtius were some of his closest associates. A devoted group of friends, led by Ezra Pound, even started the Bel Esprit Fund to get him out of the bank  but Eliot turned down the offer with a characteristic mix of righteousness and diffidence.        
	At the same time, when it came to helping his friends and favourites, Eliot never shied away from extending personal favours. He offered double rates to Proust, Yeats and Woolf, handled the belligerent Wyndham Lewis with practised ease, and spoke nothing but well of Vivien, even to his confidants. He admires her heroic fortitude and capacity for endless self-sacrifice, although his friends do not quite seem to share his views. (Virginia Woolf, once again: Mrs Eliot making me almost vomit, so scented, so powdered, so egotistic, so morbid, so weakly.) The ideal husband till the end of 1925, Eliot fought with her doctors for causing her even the slightest distress, and lashed out at poor Marianne Moore with teeth-baring rage when she rejected a story by Vivien for the Dial. However, with his own periodical, Eliot was not above asking Harold Monroe (albeit in his best English tentative manner) to be gentle on May Sinclairs new novel, or insinuating to Conrad Aiken that he should do a complete and destructive study of David Garnett. Being a fiercely discerning editor, he also rejected work, even from the high and the mighty, that fell short of his exacting standards: from Edmund Wilson to Robert Graves to Tagore, he did not spare any.        
	There were more alarming aspects to Eliots character than these minor eccentricities. In his unwavering allegiance to old-school Toryism, he could go a bit too far at times, falling out viciously with his one-time chum, Murry, whom he later dubbed the apostle of suburban free thought. This intrinsic conservatism even stopped him from taking up the post of literary editor at The Nation, generously offered by John Maynard Keynes before it was passed on to Leonard Woolf. Eliot preferred to feel vexed by his unpaid position at The Criterion, run by the irascible Lady Rothermere, whose friends included Mussolini. Strangely enough, even as Eliot expressed bitter contempt for Jew publishers like Horace Liveright and deplored the rise of the Labour Party, he set up before himself an elusive ideal of internationalism: some sort of a EU of the soul, which counted Chapman, Dante and Dostoevsky as kindred spirits, and explored the dissolution of the intellect in 17th century poetry from a 13th century perspective. He was perhaps the gentlest Tory that ever could be. It seems to me that at the present time we need more dogma, reads a typical remark in the letters. As dogmas go, this one could scarcely have been less dogmatic.        
	It would be equally simplistic to indict Eliot of being cruel towards his sickly wife. While it is true that he never got over his early love, Emily Hale, Eliot also put Vivien before everything else, even fought with his own family to ensure that she was well provided for in the unlikely event of her outliving him. The editors of the present volume, one of whom happens to be the second wife with whom Eliot found happiness in his last years, have avoided any mention of Hale, though Eliot vaguely refers to her in one of the letters. There is also just one endearing note from Wee (Eliots pet name for Vivien) to her Tom. Viviens playfully seductive tone of the earlier years (My dearest Wonky-penky) is erased by woeful entreaties to Tom to come back from his continental journeys and forgive her unkindness. But, like a Shakespearean dark comedy, there is no happy ending here, only a Beckettian voice from the tomb (as Eliot described himself in a letter to Sydney Waterlow) chronicling the dreary business of being alive.

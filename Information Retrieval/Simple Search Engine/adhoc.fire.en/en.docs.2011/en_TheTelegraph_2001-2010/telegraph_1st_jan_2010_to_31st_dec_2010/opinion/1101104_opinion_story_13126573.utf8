	Deathly desires                  
	Sir  Ashok Sanjay Guha has made a probing analysis of the strange phenomenon of self-killing observed in different societies, classes and countries (To be or not to be, Oct 27). The rise in suicide rates across the world is chiefly a result of disparities in incomes and the corresponding social inequalities. Globalization has created a polarized world, making the developed nations more and more affluent and the developing ones poorer. This has induced frustration and depression in people from all strata of society. The absence of social support systems, as Guha points out, has increased the number of people attempting to end their lives. However, in most suicide cases, the decision appears to have been taken at the spur of the moment and the reasons are unexplained. Although Guha asserts that rich societies are more prone to suicide than poor ones, he also admits that within a society, the suicide rate among the poor is greater than that among the rich.          
	It is true that too much affluence and a hectic pace of life can frustrate people and cause them to lose interest in their lives. Conversely, poverty and social backwardness also drive people to their deaths. There is a dichotomy in Guhas contention. Contrary to popular belief, suicide rates do not seem to be related to educational background. For example, Kerala, with a high percentage of literacy, has a very high suicide rate as well. A strengthening of social values through proper education is the only way to build the support system required to prevent suicide rates from rising further.

	Sir  The article, To be or not to be, was exceptionally enlightening and Shakespeares famous quote made an appropriate headline. Ashok Sanjay Guha has made good use of reason in trying to dispel the common perception that there is a positive correlation between suicide rates and income inequalities. He rightly asserts that various factors, ranging from social catastrophes to natural disasters, contribute to ones propensity for self-slaughter.          
	In trying to explain the tendency of men to kill themselves, Guha cites Emile Durkheims work on the sociology of suicide and the Easterlin Paradox. These references have added value to the article as they help the reader take a holistic approach to the issue. The reasons behind suicide, as discerned by Guha, seem to be both economic and emotional. But while economic hurdles can be overcome by various means, emotional trauma  even when a sound social support system is in place  is more complex and difficult to defeat. Every person is different emotionally which is why a general support system may fail to help.          
	There cannot be a simple remedy for the problem of suicide. The present times have brought about unstable political and social conditions that have created hedonistic tendencies in the youth. The media play a major role in shaping the perceptions of todays generation. The contents of television shows and films often create disturbing notions in young minds. Youngsters today are increasingly being surrounded by images of violence. Television indirectly propagates aggression through reality shows and suchlike. All this can be quite upsetting for adolescent minds.          
	Guha rightly says that a fast-paced life with higher mobility, both occupational and geographical, and the emergence of the nuclear family may have resulted in people getting more isolated and depressed. A leisurely lifestyle enables people to connect with one another and forge social bonds. This might be a viable way of avoiding emotional trauma to a certain extent, but one doubts how far this method would be practicable in todays urban social environment. However, the creation and preservation of a strong social support system are important for people from all over the world, especially for those from economically weaker nations.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Stop that          
	Sir  The Shiv Sena in Mumbai is notorious for its tyranny and unpredictability (Young blood, Oct 20). It makes every effort to terrorize non-Maharashtrians in the city and bullies young people unnecessarily on Valentines Day. It even goes to the extent of trying to stop the release of films that have contrary political or religious views. So far, Bal Thackeray had directed the nefarious activities of the Sena. Now it seems that his grandson, Aditya Thackeray, will take over. The leader of the Yuva Sena  the youth wing of the Shiv Sena  is all set to carry forward the legacy of bigotry and vandalism that his grandfather had started.           
	As an initiation ritual, he has declared his displeasure with Rohinton Mistrys Such a Long Journey, which was a part of his college syllabus and was perhaps too critical of his grandfathers politics. Aditya demanded that the book be removed from the curriculum of Mumbai University. Such untoward orders from the Shiv Sena are not new. What is surprising is that the administration has given in and fulfilled Adityas demand instantly. It is equally astonishing that the students have not protested more strongly.           
	One fears that Adityas triumph will ensure that the tyrannical ways of the Sena remain unchecked. The preposterous activism of the Sena, which has even demanded a burqa ban, is assuming unreal proportions. The partys potent efforts to form an undemocratic society may drive diversity and democracy out of Mumbai one day. The incident of the removal of Mistrys book should be a wake-up call for liberal-minded Maharashtrians who want the Senas tyranny to end.

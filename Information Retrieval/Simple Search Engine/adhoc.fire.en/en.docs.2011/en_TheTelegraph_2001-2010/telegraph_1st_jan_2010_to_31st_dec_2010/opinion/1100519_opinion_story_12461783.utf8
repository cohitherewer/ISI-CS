                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A CURIOUS CASE                                                    
	It is difficult to resist the ready and the easy way. The Central health ministry could have acted most sensibly by carrying out a rigorous investigation into the inner workings of the Medical Council of India. For several years now, the MCI has been accused of corruption, which includes explosive charges of bribery against its president, Ketan Desai. So the health ministry decided to dissolve the 150-member apex regulator of medical education, first formed in 1956, to make way for a new board of governors to be selected by the ministry itself. Such a drastic move cannot quite be explained away by exigencies. No doubt there was a pressing need to clean up the existing system, which is riddled with nepotism and shady dealings. However, rather than earning the trust of the common man, the health ministrys off-with-its-head attitude is likely to have the opposite effect. Does the ministry seriously believe that a seven-member board installed by it would actually convince people that the era of partisanship under the MCI has finally come to an end? Instead of inducing transparency, the health ministrys draconian working methods will inevitably introduce an element of suspicion into the system. In fact, the irony is deepened by the MCIs standing complaint that the health department has ignored its recommendations while approving the establishment of new medical colleges. It seems as if the health ministry is hoping to salvage whatever credibility it can by replacing one discredited system with another.        
	While it is the bounden duty of the health ministry to ensure that errant doctors are brought to book, it is best to embark on such a mission with an open mind and without prejudice. The State must accept that any fair assessment of medical education can only be done by a team of veterans from the profession. And only members of the medical community are qualified to make an informed choice while selecting such a panel of specialists. The State could, at best, facilitate the process of stemming the rot by setting in motion a system of fairness and accountability within the MCI. Instead, by acting with evident imperiousness, the health ministry has not only forsaken a chance to play the impartial arbiter but also needlessly politicized a decision that should have been left to the jurisdiction of experts.

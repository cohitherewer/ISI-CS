Nayar                                                      
	Krishna Seshan is an alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, who became an engineering professor and industry professional and designs, modifies and invents tools and gadgets to help the disabled when he is not teaching or doing industry consulting on the United States of Americas west coast. In the old-style world of diplomacy, it would be highly incongruous for Seshan to have anything professionally in common with Ramu Damodaran  an Indian foreign service officer and aide to then prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao  who has been engaged in peacekeeping and special political questions at the United Nations or editing the UN Chronicle, among other assignments since 1994.        
	It is testimony to the changes sweeping conventional diplomacy in the 21st century that people like Seshan are now precisely at the epicenter of Damodarans work at the UN. Last week, secretary-general Ban Ki-moon launched UN Academic Impact, an initiative to link centres of learning worldwide with the UN to promote ten universally accepted principles, such as educational opportunity for all, global citizenship through learning and unlearning of intolerance through education. Damodaran has been appointed chief of this initiative.        
	Addressing a large and diverse gathering of academics from Botswana to Bangkok, from Kyushu in Japan to KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, from Mexico to Mongolia, the secretary-general explained the rationale for yet another of the world bodys latest initiatives in the new millennium: All of your countries already contribute to the UNs work by donating peacekeepers, supporting development and providing the political backing we need to succeed. In addition to resources, in addition to personnel, we need ideas. Ideas bring the United Nations to life.              
	The UNs under secretary-general for communications, Kiyo Akasaka, expanded on that theme, but what he had to say was revealing in the extensive, perhaps unexpected, interest which universities are showing in associating themselves with the world body. Universities from 90 countries have already joined the UN Academic Impact, Akasaka said. During the launch, over two days, representatives of 160 universities from 47 countries... have come to the UN to share their ideas to exchange information and make plans for future collaboration on issues that affect us all.        
	From what one could see of the way the initiative is planned and structured, it is clear that the UNAI is not one of those global start-ups that are launched with great fanfare only to fall by the wayside. Akasaka is certain that in 2011, each institution that has joined the UNAI will undertake at least one activity in celebration of one of the initiatives ten guiding principles.        
	In India, 42 universities have already found it worthwhile to join the landmark UN effort. For those among them seeking a globalized role, the UNAI could not have come at a better time. Recent efforts personally spearheaded by the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and entrusted to the human resources development minister, Kapil Sibal, to inject university education in India with a global outlook and vision have so far produced mixed results. In the US, where Singh initiated these efforts, many American universities have unfortunately shown interest only in turning their foray into India, being opened up by Sibal, as a money-spinning venture. At the same time, the Americans have voiced complaints that many university heads in India have looked at Singhs efforts only as a chance for junkets to the United States of America and have not followed up on what has been mutually agreed upon between institutions in the two countries.        
	For those academic institutions in India that are caught in this unenviable predicament, the new UN initiative offers a way out through a window to the world. Institutions of higher learning in India that enjoy a good reputation are increasingly being recognized abroad and foreign universities are more keen than ever before to tie up with them. But a major problem has been that Indian universities are still stuck in the old ways of disseminating the mechanics of admissions and the like, and are not open to much else that can help them globalize. What little global encounters they have are only through disciplinary approaches by association with organizations like the Royal Society of Chemistry. The UNAI, for the first time, gives them the option to make the UN their discipline instead. With a little adaptation and by using their association with the UN, the world could be their oyster, as the adage goes.        
	For many of these universities, association with the UNAI could, in fact, be their eureka moment, having treated the UN during all these years, for decades in fact, as something very, very remote. By offering a roadmap or a work plan for integrating with the principles on which the world body was founded for humanity, these institutions of higher learning are now being made aware of how they could be fruitfully communicating with the UN.        
	The new UN initiative offers as much to students as to researchers and teachers. One of its aims is to bring together students to create an articulate student community. This should be of particular interest to students in India, who are increasingly active on an individual level but largely shunning the community except in the case of those who come together to articulate protests or grievances.        
	This is partly because unlike in an earlier period, there are no galvanizing issues for the students any more. It is the hope among those in charge of the UNAI in New York that the UN and its activities will, instead, work as a galvanizing force. In Delhi, some years ago, a successful and effective campaign against the use of plastic bags began among students: there are many such issues which the UN has been promoting, and exposure to such issues through the new initiative could well help young people grow into better citizens.              
	Among the global assembly at the launch of the UNAI in New York, a more effective and articulate participant was from Calcutta University, represented by its vice chancellor, Suranjan Das. In recent years, on the international stage, particularly on the American stage, Calcutta  and West Bengal  have repeatedly appeared to be on the cusp of a global embrace only to prove such a promise illusory.        
	On several occasions before the Tata Nano exited West Bengal, the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and the industries minister, Nirupam Sen, were wooed by US businesses, and it was hoped that either of them would make a promising appearance at a prized annual meeting of the US-India Business Council. It did not happen. Then West Bengal opted out of efforts in New York to promote Indias east and from the annual pravasi gathering in New Delhi of people of Indian origin. The Calcutta University vice-chancellors active presence at the UN last week, although on a different plane, may yet gain for the city something it has lost by acts of omission.        
	There were clear indications at the end of the two-day UNAI launch that Calcutta University may become the global hub for peace and conflict studies. Because Das made a strong case for the university on the strength of its existing Institute for Foreign Policy Studies, an autonomous research centre focusing on Indias Look East approach, its West Asia policy and its studies on world peace, it is quite likely that the hub will catapult Calcutta University to greater global exposure. If that happens, it will make a significant break with a unitary bias in promoting Indian universities. It will be contrary to the practice where institutions in and around New Delhi are bestowed all the opportunities and privileges. And it may well be Calcuttas turn for a change.

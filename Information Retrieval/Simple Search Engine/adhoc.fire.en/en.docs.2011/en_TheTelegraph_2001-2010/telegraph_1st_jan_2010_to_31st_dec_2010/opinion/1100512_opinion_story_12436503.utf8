	By the end of this month, Nepal may turn into a country without a government, a parliament and even a constitution. The Maoists there are working to ensure that the Himalayan State withers away in such a fashion. Before they can achieve that, they want to hold the government  and the people  to ransom. Their indefinite strike from May 2, which they had to call off in the face of public anger, was aimed at forcing a constitutional void. Nepal is currently run by a transitional government and a constituent assembly elected on the basis of an interim constitution. The assembly had a mandate to prepare a draft constitution during its term, which ends on May 28. It is obvious now that the assembly cannot do that. Worse, an extension of the assemblys term has become uncertain because the Maoists will not support any such move by the present government. And the government cannot muster the necessary majority in the assembly without the support of the Maoists, who have the largest number of seats. If such a constitutional crisis happens, it will be grist to the Maoists mill. They have been working toward this ever since they left the interim government over the issue of the integration of their armed cadre with the Nepal Army.        
	However, a large part of the blame for the mess lies with the prime minister, Madhav Kumar Nepal. Right from the time he took over the reins of his 22-party coalition government, his primary aim has been to keep the Maoists at bay. This is not only confrontational politics at its worst but also a betrayal of the popular mandate. For all their bullying tactics, the Maoists form the largest political group in Nepal. Any government that denies this reality will lack both credibility and popular support. Mr Nepals anxiety to settle scores with the Maoist leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, has clearly distracted the former from more important business. His government failed to do enough in order to keep its commitment to prepare the draft constitution on time. More worrying is the fear that Mr Nepals incompetence might endanger the peace process that ended the 10-year-long Maoist insurgency in the country. The United Nations Mission in Nepal and several foreign powers want the prime minister to mend fences with the Maoists. Many parties and social groups now favour a national unity government to take charge and reach a political consensus. The future of the peace process is far more important for Nepal than its leaders personal ambitions.

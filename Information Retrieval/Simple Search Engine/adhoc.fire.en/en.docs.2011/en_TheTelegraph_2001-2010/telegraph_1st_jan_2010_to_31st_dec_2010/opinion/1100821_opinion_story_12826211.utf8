                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SONGS FOR THE STAR PLAYERS                                  This above all : Khushwant Singh                        Extreme folly				                                       
	I first met Suresh Kalmadi in 1980 and immediately liked him. Both of us entered the Rajya Sabha that year: I a nominee of the Congress, he elected from Maharashtra. I heard his maiden speech and was enthralled. I felt he had the making of an all-India leader. I wrote a very favourable account on his speech and went out of my way to befriend him. He responded to my gesture, and we visited each others homes. His wife, a school-teacher, was a shy lady. At their house, I twice met Sharad Pawar, who stayed with them. I concluded that Kalmadi was Pawars protg. All I knew of Kalmadis background was that he had taken premature retirement from the Indian Air Force and that his family owned a restaurant and landed property in Pune till Pawar brought him into politics. I did not suspect he suffered from a sense of financial insecurity till he celebrated his acquiring of a Maruti sales agency in Pune by throwing a lavish reception on the lawns of his parliamentary bungalow. The lawn was lit up with coloured bulbs, liquor flowed, tasty snacks went round. I was disillusioned and cooled off him.        
	About the Commonwealth Games, I know very little. I go along with Mani Shankar Aiyar and am convinced that they should not have been held in Delhi, a city which teems with thousands of beggars  a few at every road crossing  where the only shelter the poor find during bitter winters and monsoon rains are on the footpaths and under overbridges. The destitute do not even get one square meal a day. Squandering hundreds of crores of rupees on building stadiums, swimming pools, squash and tennis courts and much else is an act of extreme folly. It should never have been allowed. Suresh Kalmadi played the star role in the tragi-comedy.        
	I cannot help adding here a few film songs that K.J.S. Ahluwalia of Amritsar has sent me. They would go very well as background tracks with the movie to be called Games Tamasha.        
	Suresh Kalmadi: Kutch toh log kahein gaye        
	Sheila Dikshit: Kahin daag na lag jayey        
	M.S. Gill: Kabhi khud pe kabhi haalat pey rona aayaa        
	S. Jaipal Reddy: Yeh kya hua, kaisey hua, kyon hua        
	Tejinder Khanna: Merey tutey huay dil sey koi toh aaj yeh puchhey        
	 Delhiites: Jab dil hi tut gaya, hum jee key kya kareingey        
	Manmohan Singh: Sab kutch seekha hum ney, naa seekhi hoshiari...        
	Sach hai duniyanwalo, hum hain annari.        
	Without prejudice                
	Many years ago, a pretty Sindhi girl recently married to a sardar came to me to complain about the behaviour of customs officials at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. She had been on a sightseeing tour of Europe, had bought nothing on which duty could be imposed, and so made straight for the Green Channel meant for those who have nothing to declare. However, her suitcase had her maiden name, Mansukhani, printed on it. The customs man, who had cleared her, asked: Madam, your passport bears the name, Singh, yet your suitcase says Mansukhani. Can I examine its contents? So she said to me, There is a prejudice against Sindhis. Many people believe that they will do anything to make money. It is unfair. Dont you agree?        
	I do, I replied, I have lots of Sindhi friends. Without exception, all are honest and generous to a fault. I cant say that about other Indian communities. I gave her an instance from my own experience.        
	My uncle, Ujjal Singh, who was the governor of Tamil Nadu, had asked me to make a disc with selected hymns of ten gurus. He put a tidy sum of money from the Guru Gobind Singh Foundation at my disposal. I asked my friend, Nirmala Matthan, who has a melodious voice, to read the script. She is a devout Roman Catholic. She refused to accept any money. I asked ragi jathas, both Sindhi and Sikh, to sing a hymn each. The Sindhis also refused money. Only the Sikh ragi jathas accepted on condition that instead of being paid in cheque they should get the money in cash; otherwise they would have to pay income tax.                
	Let live                
	During the recent floods, Banta caught a fish from the ground floor of his house and asked his wife, Banto, to cook it. Banto could not cook because there was no gas, no oil, and no shop was open because of a Bharat bandh. Banta threw the fish back on the flooded road. The fish jumped back, shouting, Bharat sarkar zindabad.

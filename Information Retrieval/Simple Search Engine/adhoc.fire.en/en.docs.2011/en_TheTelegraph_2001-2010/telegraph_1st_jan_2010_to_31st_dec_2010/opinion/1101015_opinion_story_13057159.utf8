The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The rot has set in deep
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE ROT HAS SET IN DEEP                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	To be an honest, truly nationalist and proud Indian has become something one really has to work at because everything around us is wallowing in corruption and mismanagement. Governance in almost all spheres is sub-standard, correctives are few and far between, those who break rules with abandon run free and ordinary Indians, who live by the established norms and with integrity, are compelled to operate in the pervasive muck that has overwhelmed us all. There can be no other description for the reality on the ground across the diverse economic and social strata of our nation.        
	Wherever you look, many strange and often unimaginable things meet the eye. In the debate concerning the right to food, the government is quibbling about what constitutes the below poverty level even though we all know that the dividing line is virtually intangible, and that those above the stated line are equally hungry and desperately poor. The additional allocation of 600 crore, which may be required, is being debated upon, and the discussion is generating much angst among those recommending that the same price apply for the people marginally above the declared line.        
	Why is it that men and women who loot the government openly, break every rule in the book, make crores and get away with their crime are being celebrated by the high office and suchlike, while the debate for a sum of 600 crores to feed hungry citizens carries on unabated in conference rooms? Surely we should be ashamed of condoning the corruption that has become endemic to life in India.                
	Dismal picture        
	We switch to Karnataka. The scenes in the state assembly were so shameful that they left every viewer cringing in horror. What had happened earlier in the week made it clear, yet again, that money and corruption rule. No leader bats an eyelid or attacks the unethical political game that gets played out. They are working for themselves, at the cost of the citizen, civil society and the mandate given to them to ensure good governance. Horse-trading will ensue and, frankly, it makes no real difference to the people whether the ruling party wins or the Opposition pulls off the numbers because all parties function in exactly the same manner.        
	Cut to Kashmir. Omar Abdullah speaks the truth, says it for what it really is, and all hell breaks loose as the Opposition begins to assault him verbally. Why do we want to rewrite the truth instead of dealing with it and working out a sane solution? What he said about accession and merger does not make him anti-national by any stretch of the imagination. We have to confront the reality as we have inherited it and move forward. The criticism about the interlocutors announced by the Central government is unwarranted, and the cry for politicians to be interlocutors is wholly absurd because it is they who have messed it up in the first place. The scale of money that is allocated for Kashmir is so huge that keeping the status quo in the valley is hugely lucrative for the classes that rule the roost. Non-partisan interventions are the first difficult step that could root out the corruption.        
	To replace one corrupt character with another is not the solution but, in fact, an aggravation of what India is besieged with. New drafts of Acts that are on the anvil include some ominous and unthinkable sections that are mindless, and have been designed to create many more areas of lucrative corruption, extortion and blackmail for government servants. They belong to the mandates of dictatorial, inhuman regimes that collapsed because of entrenched corruption and criminality, which emanated down from the top echelons of power.

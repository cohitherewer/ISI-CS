	The judiciary can be the agent as well as the index of social change. The Supreme Court has held that children born out wedlock can be legal heirs of their parents property. The sons of a married man had contested the right of the sons from this mans live-in relationship to inherit his property. The court ascertained that the mans live-in relationship had lasted for almost two decades; this makes the children born in it legitimate for all practical purposes. According to the apex court, a long-term live-in relationship is to be distinguished from a walk in and walk out relationship when there is a presumption of marriage between the two people living together and in societys perception of this partnership. This position is not only sensible but also progressive, for it does not take for granted the valorizing of the institution of marriage, thereby refusing to conflate law and morality. This has been the Supreme Courts position quite consistently. It had quashed the cases brought against the allegedly licentious statements made by the Tamil actor, Khushboo, and made it clear that the court thought there was nothing wrong with live-in relationships or sex between consenting adults outside marriage. The bench had even pointed out that the love of Radha and Krishna had not been sanctified by matrimony. Similarly, the court refused to distinguish between wedded and unwedded avarice when it ruled, last year, that the anti-dowry law would apply in the case of live-in partners as well. In 2008, it declared that children born in a live-in relationship would no longer be called illegitimate, for the law inclines in the interest of legitimacy.        
	What makes live-in relationships indistinguishable from marriage in the eyes of the higher judiciary seems to be the duration of the former. How long, one might wonder, would two people have to live together for their partnership to be deemed a long-term live-in relationship? And would it be entirely fair to the offspring of short-term relationships if their legitimacy  say, as heirs  depended on the duration for which their parents had managed to be together (or had been perceived by others as being together)? These small questions apart, the courts perception of live-in relationships as an adult exercise of the right to life could only be a welcome judicial endorsement of the progress towards a modern and equitable society.

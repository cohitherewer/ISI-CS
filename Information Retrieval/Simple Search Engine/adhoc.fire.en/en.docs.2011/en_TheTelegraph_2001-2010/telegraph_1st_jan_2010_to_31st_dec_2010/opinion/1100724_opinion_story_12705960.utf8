	Welcome change                  
	Sir  The Trinamul Congress rally on July 21 proved to be a blessing for Metro commuters. The Chandni Chowk ticket counter usually has a single person issuing tickets. If you are lucky, you might just find two men at the counter. But on July 21, there were four men giving out the tickets, and that too at record speed. If a rally can bring about such a miraculous change, perhaps we should welcome rallies. At least then we may get to see the people who get their salaries from the taxpayers pockets without providing any service.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Slumbering law          
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the four senior medical students accused of ragging and eventually causing the death of a fresher, Aman Satya Kachru, have been granted bail by a fast-track court in Himachal Pradesh (Bail for 4 in Aman ragging case, July 19). When this incident occurred last year, it triggered heated debates on how to tackle the problem of ragging, leading to the setting up of anti-ragging committees. The measures have proved to be largely ineffective. Although the judiciary has ruled that ragging is a punishable offence, a mere categorization of ragging as illegal obviously is not sufficient to eradicate the menace. There are students who are so depraved that they will torture juniors just to satisfy their ego. Only the fear of a fast trial and exemplary punishment can deter them from committing such inhuman acts.           
	It is a shame that even after 63 years of independence, our country is unable to properly uphold the rule of law. Once the accused are out on bail, the process of adjournments and appeals in successive courts will start. It will go on for years, and then the case will be conveniently forgotten. This is what happened in the court cases concerning Ruchika Girhotra, the Bhopal gas tragedy or the 1984 Sikh riots.           
	After the 2009 elections, there was a lot of hue and cry about bringing the youth into the mainstream of Indian politics to ensure a fresh flow of ideas into the administrative system. I wonder why our young MPs are silent on the ragging issue when young people are being targeted. The same goes for honour killings. It is high time our judiciary wakes up from its slumber. The Supreme Court itself must adopt a system of time-bound trials if people are to retain faith in the judiciary.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Mad rush          
	Sir  Recently, my friends and I visited the South City mall on a Saturday. I had parked my car on the roof of the mall. When we were about to leave, I saw that there were nearly 100 more cars in the line to get to the ground level. The South City mall has a four-storeyed parking lot, with each storey having space for 100 cars. If 100 cars are rushing to get out of each storey at a given time, it means that 500 cars are trying to get out of the mall. Naturally, it took us nearly two hours just to reach the counter where the parking fee was to be paid.          
	I saw that the mall authorities had shut down two of the four payment counters, and were diverting all the traffic to these two. When I asked them why they were not using all the counters, they replied, Ask the management. Later I learnt a startling truth. The parking lot is being outsourced to a particular company which, to earn some extra income on weekends, deliberately increases the pressure on two counters.          
	Yours faithfully,

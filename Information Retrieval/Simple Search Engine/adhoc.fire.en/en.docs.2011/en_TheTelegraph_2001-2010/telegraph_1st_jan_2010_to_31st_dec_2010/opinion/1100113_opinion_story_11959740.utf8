	Sinking feeling                  
	Sir  It is sad that 18 people, including eight children, belonging to a picnic party from Ultadanga drowned after their boat capsized on the Rupnarayan river (Picnic boat tragedy, Jan 4). Twenty-nine people had boarded the country boat for a cruise on the river. The accident was caused by the irresponsible behaviour of the adults on the boat. They should have kept in mind that boats such as the one they had boarded are meant for fishing, and that it was not wise to overcrowd it, as this could put the lives of the passengers at risk. A bit of restraint and discipline on their part could not only have saved lives, but also spared the common people of their plight. Commuters were inconvenienced by a roadblock near Gouribari bridge and Khanna more put up by the grieving family members of the deceased. These people blocked the road and rail lines after the authorities failed to recover the bodies of the missing people from the river.           
	This incident also raises questions such as the availability of life support devices on boats and whether these boats have permits for commercial operations. Since there are several popular picnic spots near the site of the mishap  the Rupnarayan being an added attraction for the picnickers  private operators with well-equipped vessels should be allowed to ply the river.           
	Even the launch service on the Hooghly among Howrah, Bagbazar, Ahiritola, Babughat and Sovabazar, blatantly violates the rules by carrying passengers way beyond its capacity, especially during the rush hour. Many a time, the khalasi on duty directs passengers to spread equally over the deck to distribute their weight. We have often protested against the over-crowding in ferries but the authorities seldom pay attention to the complaints.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Mamata Banerjee has blamed the state government for the boat tragedy near Kolaghat. However, she does not seem too keen on trying to account for the three train accidents that took place just a day before the boat tragedy. The latter should be a matter of grave concern for her as she is the Union railways minister. But I suppose the job of the minister ends with the laying of foundation stones for new lines and flagging new trains. With a lackadaisical state government and an equally unconcerned Opposition, who is going to care for the people afflicted by tragedies that have become a norm in the state?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Hungry hearts          
	Sir  The rot within (Jan 7), by Brijesh D. Jayal, and Abhijit Bhattacharyyas In an ancient land tainted by many vices (Jan 7) can be read in tandem. Jayal and Bhattacharyya have highlighted the problem of corruption at all levels of governance.           
	Although Jayal has suggested that the media and the Indian public can play a more active role in trying to tackle this malady, the fact remains that corruption in the country is endemic, and it requires a radical solution. Change must be initiated from the top as a matter of policy. It is ironic that the prime minister, who has a clean public image, has not bothered to ensure transparent governance.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
J.K. Bubna, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Abhijit Bhattacharyya is absolutely right about the frightening level of corruption that has gripped Indias civil and military institutions. Those who hold the top positions within these institutions do all they can to shield colleagues who are guilty of committing immoral acts. Whether it is the N.D. Tiwari episode, the military land scam, or the S.P.S. Rathore incident  each of these incidents tell the same story of how the establishment protects the law-breakers. It is only because of the alert media and the judiciary that these irregularities are brought to light and action is taken against the guilty.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is depressing to read the newspaper every morning. One comes across pages full of reports on the misuse of public funds, scams, rapes, molestations and murders. Every society has its vices as well as its virtues, but India seems to be sinking in a pool of vice. This is certainly a scary thought.           
	What is more surprising is that it is not just the poor who are responsible for this state of affairs. Affluent people who have no dearth of wealth are equally, if not more, greedy to accumulate even greater riches.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Then there were ghosts      
	Funny amp; Funnier: Stories by Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay (Scholastic, Rs 120) has been translated from Bengali by Palash Baran Pal and Abhijit Gupta. The book lives up to its title, for the 10 stories in the collection are simply hilarious. This is a wonderful chance for non-Bengali readers to get a taste of Shirshendu Mukhopadhyays unique world, where ghosts whimper in fear of human beings, where feisty cows give chase to timid tigers, where some men are so polite as to be unable to deny thieves the chance to loot their houses. The translators have mostly been able to retain the unique earthy flavour of Mukhopadhyays prose. This is no mean feat given the fact that this taste has got as much to do with Mukhopadhyays peculiar brand of Bengaliness as with the content of his stories. There are a few slips, like jhinge being translated as bitter gourd, which actually is karela (Haro Babu the Gentleman), but on the whole, the translators effort is commendable. It is not often that one comes across translations that are as entertaining as the originals.                                 
	Legends of the Lepchas: Folk Tales from Sikkim (Tranquebar, Rs 200) by Yishey Doma records the lores of the Lepchas who inhabit the region that now falls under the state of Sikkim, parts of Darjeeling district and certain portions of Nepal and Bhutan. The creation myths of the Lepchas follow a pattern that is strongly reminiscent of the stories in the book of Genesis. Only they substitute the creator-father by a creator-mother, Itbu-moo  perhaps a pointer to the original matriarchal structure of this hill tribe. These myths would be of particular interest to Bengalis whose favourite holiday destination is Sikkim. The tales make familiar places like Rangpo, Tashiding and the Khechoedpalri lake magical by investing each with a myth involving fairies and demons.                         
	The Puffin Book of Classic Stories for Girls (Rs 150) has an introduction by Manjula Padmanabhan. This is an eclectic collection, with stories by authors as diverse as Ruskin Bond, Lewis Carroll and Rabindranath Tagore. The excerpts from novels sit oddly with the short stories, making the reading experience jerky. In choosing the stories, the editors seem to have been led more by the zeal to bring something of everything from all over the globe to young readers than by any specific criterion. This results in a collection that is a bad mishmash which spoils the charm of the individual stories.

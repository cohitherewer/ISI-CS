The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | No place left for art
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO PLACE LEFT FOR ART                                  Bona Fide -Malvika Singh                              
	A great play was staged in Mumbai this week. It was performed in an extraordinary theatre with excellent acoustics. The venue was the National Centre for the Performing Arts. The play was called A Disappearing Number, and it dealt with the life of Ramanujan and his relationship with Hardy  the exchange between the Occident and the Orient, the finite and the infinite world of numbers and ideas. And, here comes the rub, there is no space in the capital city of India where a great performance like this one can be staged with ease and mobility. A complicated ballet, an epic theatre, a visiting philharmonic orchestra, are all restricted from performing to their potential in Delhi because there is absolutely no facility that can accommodate the best. This sad and rather shameful truth needs urgent rectification.         
	If there is a will, there can be a great solution to this present problem. Pragati Maidan, where the Trade Fair Authority of India sits at the moment, needs to be cleared of all the tacky pavilions and exhibition halls, levelled and prepared so that it becomes the central point for cultural events. Trade fairs should happen along the outskirts of a city and Dwarka would be an ideal alternative. Apart from anything else, it would alleviate traffic snarls along Mathura Road, a major artery that links New Delhi to the Old City and the settlements across the river. At Pragati Maidan, India should construct a great proscenium theatre, a modern, open-air amphitheatre, a national library, a conference and seminar facility, all enveloped in a sacred grove of indigenous trees and plants.        
	What prevents the government of India and that of Delhi from thinking out of the box and reinventing all that has become moribund? Why has the energy and excitement of building world class, competitive institutions died? Why do the babus spend their time protecting mediocrity and sub-standard enterprises?                 
	Old ideas        
	Whether it is an academic institution, a think tank, museum, library or any such public enterprise, these incompetent men and women serving time in government dilute and destroy the concerned institution. They shun any partnership with their equivalent in the private sector. Their intellectual insecurity and incompetence drown these potentially great national landmarks.        
	Why do we not have the equivalent of a Brookings Institution? Why is the Indian Institute of Advanced Studies allowed to wallow in abject neglect? Why is our National Museum not comparable with the Met or the British Museum or the Louvre? Where is our National Library? Why do we have to access the British Library instead of our own? Why are our archives in such a complete mess? Why is the Nehru Memorial Library so tacky and rundown? How come we do not have a Bolshoi-like theatre or a Kremlin-like museum since we were so influenced by the Soviet Union once upon a time? Why did we never absorb the best from those we aligned with? Is it because the bureaucracy that rules our lives has no knowledge of what ignites the mind and soul?         
	Our fast growing corporate sector is equally disconnected from the realm of ideas. Think tanks in India cry out for funds and are, more often than not, aided by international foundations. Most Indian industries have no interest in modern institution building. Both the babu and the boxwallah are insular creatures who, for the moment, have selfishly boxed themselves in their little worlds, unwilling to reach out and engage with India. A one- point agenda, laced with monetary greed, has debilitated the privileged. When this illness is cured, India will truly lead with ideas. Till that time, we shall remain subservient to this, that and the other.

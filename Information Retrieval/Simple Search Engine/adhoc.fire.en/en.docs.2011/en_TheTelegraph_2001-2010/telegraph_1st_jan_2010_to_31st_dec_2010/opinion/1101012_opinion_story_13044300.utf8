The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | two weeks of civility
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TWO WEEKS OF CIVILITY                                  MALA FIDE -MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The National Museum in New Delhi has an ongoing special exhibition of art and objects related to national sport through the ages. It is interesting to find that all the gold medals that have been won at the Commonwealth Games are in wrestling, archery and shooting, the great indigenous sports of India. This is quite extraordinary, and deserves acknowledgement and celebration. The miniature paintings displayed were delightful, as were some of the objects. Sadly, because of the non-existent guiding and appalling signage, a few visitors bumped into the exhibits. As for the city of Delhi, it looks clean and sparkling, with disciplined traffic sticking religiously to the demarcated lanes, the otherwise unruly killer buses plying with dignity as buses do elsewhere on this planet, and policemen doing their job instead of being lackadaisical. There is a bright energy in the atmosphere. We Dilliwallahs are savouring this fortnight of civility and order.        
	Mani Shankar Aiyar, who declaimed about getting out of Delhi during the Games, has missed out on the best moments this city has seen in years. Those who did not have the privilege to scoot on a whim got a taste of a beautiful, and rather happy, Delhi  that is the irony. Will the government of India reconstruct the management norms and hand over the tools of governance to the chief minister and make the state government both responsible and accountable? Or will it continue to endorse the usual malfunction?                
	Mumbai morose        
	In contrast, Mumbai is in a shoddy condition, falling apart, with garbage piled high even outside the Willingdon Sports Club, not just around its slums. With the richest Indians having lived and grown richer in that metropolis, a visitor sees no attempt by the powerful to participate in stalling the degradation of Bombay, the once-upon-a-time City of Dreams.        
	That Bombay of yore had a soul, a racing, overactive pulse that was exciting, and attracted people who aspired to make good their out-of-the-box ideas. It was home to all regardless of differences. It was, in fact, the gateway to India. Today, Mumbai is in a rapid decline, unkempt and exploited, with a fast-disappearing soul.                
	A fresh victim        
	Cut to Delhi. The media that were abusing the Games are now thrilling over them. Before we know it, they will be bursting forth with accolades for all those they have been digging into the ground. The swing-around has been one of the funniest comic operas we have witnessed in a long time. Soon, they will have to think of a new story, a fresh victim. But there is one lesson for all: the next bid for a Games must be at a location that needs to be upgraded  a smaller city or a town. It will ensure a cutting-edge infrastructure that will revive the place for decades. Delhi gets a regular injection of what is required to keep it at an acceptable international level of quality. Now, it is time other cities get their place in the sun.        
	The CWG could have been organized in a manner that would have done India proud. We have the capability and the discipline to deliver the best. However, governments have a tendency these days to hand over the organization to lobbyists, not to professional best bidders. The CWG organizing committee has proved this with the delays, the slipshod completion of the Games Village, the shoddy construction works and suchlike. These have demeaned us in the eyes of our own people as well as those of the world. The organizers are seen as racketeers  which does not augur well for an emerging economic power. Heads must roll. Accountability must kick in. A new operating manual must come into play for the future. Let us learn from our errors of judgment.

	Juvenile homes meant for orphaned, abandoned and runaway children are notoriously unhomely places. The state social welfare department took its own sweet time to realize this fact, which has been often pointed out by activists and social workers. It is heartening that the authorities have finally decided to act on the problem. However, as usual, their plan of action raises new worries. It has been decided that following the model adopted by Maharashtra and Karnataka, West Bengal will identify foster parents willing to give these children a proper home. The expense of bringing up the wards will be borne by the State. Noble as the idea might be, it is, from its inception, fraught with uncertainties. How is the State going to make sure that self-interested couples do not get custody of these children, tempted by the monthly stipend allocated by the State for their upkeep? Apparently, officers of the social welfare department would visit these families at regular intervals to monitor the condition of the children entrusted to them. But given the dwindling number of employees in the district offices, is this idea practically feasible?        
	By acknowledging the shortcomings of state-run homes, the government has effectively owned up its failure to deliver its duty by the citizens. A welfare state should factor into its vision the responsibility of rehabilitating children under its care in the mainstream. Educating them and helping them find employment are as important as giving them three square meals and a roof above their heads. It is no secret that remand homes are not only breeding grounds for corruption but are also run with little regard for the health, hygiene and humanity of their inhabitants. Such barbaric conditions often provoke these children to run away. It may be a blessing for a young person to be given a chance to leave such a place and move in with a real family  compassionate enough to give him or her a new purpose in life. However, the kindness of strangers is an unpredictable affair. It could well turn out to be quite the contrary.

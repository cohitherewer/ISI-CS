The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Schooled in mediocrity
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SCHOOLED IN MEDIOCRITY                                  Visual Arts - Soumitra Das                      Picture byAnindya S. Ray                                
	The 52nd National Exhibition of Art (January 8-27) of the Lalit Kala Akademi, National Academy of Art, New Delhi, is being held at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, after a gap of 25 years. This may, of course, be considered a great privilege and honour for this city as the chief minister himself had inaugurated it.        
	But the hopes of seeing at least workaday art are dashed the moment one steps inside the hall. One walks from wall to wall, rarely coming upon a single painting about which anything positive can be written. Apparently, an elaborate screening process exists to select the participants from all over the country. So if these are supposed to be talents culled from all over India, one should be justifiably concerned about the countrys artistic future.         
	Many of these unschooled artists seem to have emerged from a pre-modern era and are only capable of producing colourful, figurative works that look like enlarged illustrations for tracts on the virtues of domesticity, handouts on the charms of an agrarian society and suchlike. There is one of stupendous crudity of a goat with flowers sprouting from its body. As to the watercolour of Victoria Memorial Hall, such works are available a dime a dozen anywhere in this city.        
	There are, however, some notable exceptions that one can easily overlook. The best known among them is Faiza Huma, a known name in gallery circles. Her painting, as usual, is very spare  a bare, pale cream canvas with a splash of black enmeshed in fine lines  an abstract work competently executed like most other works by this artist. Hukum Lal Vermas sweeping black brushstrokes against a grey and brown background have been done to death. Yet, it is aeons ahead of the conjoined crows, the bull showing off the source of its power, and evocations of life before the Fall. The sculpture of the horse, too, did not make much sense, and the large head composed of plastic alphabets was seen at a local gallery late last year.        
	There were two colour photographs  of children in a river and of a brightly illuminated fair after rain and both were nothing to write home about. Of the graphics, Naina Aroras series composed of small geometrical figures in a narrow strip stood out for its economy. This handful, however, did nothing to raise the standard of the show.

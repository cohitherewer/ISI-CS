	One move of a pawn was a giant step for Indian sports, without fanfare though it was. Chess, perhaps because it is the most cerebral of games, never produces mass hysteria. It is difficult to imagine Viswanathan Anands winning of the world chess championship being followed by a post-match party and euphoria, as happens, say, when India wins a cricket match against as weak a team as Bangladesh. The absence of enthusiasm, however, should not detract from the majesty of Mr Anands achievement, even though this is not the first time that he has become the worlds number one chess player. Very few, except the close followers of what has come to be called the royal game, realize the sheer physical stamina a chess tournament involves. Chess champions, in fact, go through a rigorous regime of physical training to keep them in shape and to help them de-stress. The moving of a chess piece  an easy enough task that can be done by a child  when it becomes an integral part of an overall strategy, requires an amount of mental energy that the body can produce only when it acts in perfect unison with the brain. At a very basic level  and a level not usually associated with chess  Mr Anand deserves applause, especially as he won a tough tournament with the deciding game turning out to be a cliff-hanger.        
	Nerves of steel and a profound ability for strategic thinking concerning the pieces on 64 squares are the supreme virtues of a chess master. Mr Anand obviously has oodles of both, but in the critical match he added to these the quality of unpredictability. He deployed the Queens Gambit declined Lasker variation. This completely unnerved his opponent, Veselin Topalov, especially as Mr Anand has seldom used this particular move in his career. The element of surprise clinched the match in favour of Mr Anand who, playing black, had begun at a disadvantage in the final game. There can be very little doubt that Sachin Tendulkars accomplishments notwithstanding, Mr Anand is Indias leading sportsperson. His dominance of the chessboard registers a shift since the game has been under the influence of Russian masters for a long time, except for a brief while when the redoubtable Bobby Fischer was king of the royal game. The crown of chess has finally come to the country of its origin. Mr Anand is a hero unsung in his own country. Unhappy the country that cannot recognize its own heroes.

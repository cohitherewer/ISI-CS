	The media in the Middle East carry a lot of Middle Eastern stories, of course, but why do most of the world media do the same?         
	This is a phenomenon that cries out for an explanation, and its not easy to find a credible one. Its certainly not oil, which is the lazy explanation. Oil is quite important in the global economy, and the Middle East has a large share of the market and an even bigger share of the reserves. But its been 37 years since the oil-rich Arab states refused to sell their oil, and they couldnt do that again.        
	Not wouldnt  its not a question of trust  couldnt, because it would cause far too much disruption in their own economies. The 1973 oil embargo took place at a time when most of the major Arab oil-exporting countries had populations two or three times smaller than what they are now, and when their people did not live in full-fledged consumer societies.         
	Its different now. The cash flow from oil exports pays not just for imported cars and plasma-screen TVs, but also for the very food that the local people eat: most Arab oil-exporting states import half or more of the food they consume. They also have huge investments in the Western economies that an oil embargo would hurt.         
	Well, then, what about the fact that the United States of America has invaded two Middle Eastern countries in the past ten years, and still has troops in both of them? Does that explain the obsessive focus on the Middle East?        
	No, because the obsession was there before the invasions. In fact, the causation is probably the other way round: the exaggerated importance with which Americans already viewed the Middle East was almost certainly a contributory factor in the Bush administrations decisions to invade Afghanistan and Iraq.                
	Huge distortion        
	The main factor in the Afghan decision, of course, was the foolish belief that invading Afghanistan would somehow help suppress anti-American terrorism rather than stimulate more of it. Almost nobody in Washington seemed aware that they were falling into a trap laid for them by Osama bin Laden.         
	The greater Middle East contains about ten per cent of the worlds population. The Arab world at its heart is only five per cent. The whole region accounts for only three percent of the global economy, and produces almost nothing of interest to the rest of the world except oil. So why does it dominate the international news agenda?        
	The Europeans play a role in this, because the media in the former imperial powers take a greater interest in their former colonies than in other countries of equal importance. But the American media really set the agenda, and their fascination with the Middle East requires a different explanation.        
	A large part of it is driven by the deep emotional investment in Israel that many Americans have. Israel is not viewed as just another foreign country, to be weighed by its strategic and economic importance. It is seen as a special place, almost an American protectorate, and its foreign policy agenda (which is all about the Middle East) largely sets the US media agenda.        
	The other big factor is the lasting American obsession with Iran, which is as great as the obsession with Cuba. Both countries have successfully defied the US, and that has been neither forgiven nor forgotten.        
	Combine the love for Israel and the hatred of Iran, and you have an explanation for the American medias obsession with the entire Middle Eastern region. Most media elsewhere, especially in the West, just follow suit. Its a huge distortion that leads to the neglect of much important news about the rest of the world, but at least the Middle East gives good value for money. The news it generates is unfailingly interesting.

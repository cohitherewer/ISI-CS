	The rembrandt affair,																														 By Daniel Silva,  Michael Joseph, Rs 499  
	Gabriel Allon was an ace officer of the Israeli secret service. He is also a trained and a top-class restorer of old masters. When this novel opens, he has retired from service and lives with his beautiful former colleague in a remote part of Cornwall overlooking the sea.  
	The theft of a long-lost painting by Rembrandt, The Portrait of a Young Woman, from a restorers house in Glastonbury (the restorer was murdered in the process) brings the eccentric London art dealer, Julian Isherwood, to Allon. Isherwood is desperate because he has invested all that he had on the painting. He wants Allon to recover the painting. Partly out of friendship but more out of his interest regarding the painting, Allon takes on the assignment, not knowing where the search would take him.        
	Allon knows enough about Rembrandt and this particular painting to be aware that it was painted in Amsterdam, where the painter lived in a large house west of the citys old centre. He decides to begin at the beginning in Amsterdam. It doesnt take him and his wife much time to discover who was the last known owner of the painting. The family, however, was a victim of the Holocaust and the painting hadnt been heard of since then, though one daughter of the family survived.        
	Allon visits her and hears her story: the Nazi officer who had arrested the family had decided to spare the girl from being sent to the concentration camp provided the father exchanged her life for the Rembrandt painting.        
	With this knowledge, Allon quickly discovers who the Nazi officer was and that he had disappeared from Germany in the last days of World War II after having deposited his fortune and the painting with a Swiss bank. The next stop for Allon is Argentina, where the Nazi officer had fled.        
	In Argentina, Allon meets the Nazi officers son, who is physically the spitting image of his father, but is full of repentance for his fathers many misdeeds. Allon discovers that after the Nazi officers death, his fortune was appropriated by the owner of the bank and on the basis of that a huge industrial enterprise was created. The present owner of the empire is known for his benevolence and contribution to good causes. Whoever has tried to investigate the origin of the familys wealth has ended up as a corpse. There is, in fact, an attempt on Allons life in Argentina.        
	This is the turning point of the thriller. What began as a private enterprise becomes a full-fledged operation on the part of the Israeli secret service and Allon has to forget his retirement. He reassembles his old team and as more and more information is gathered, the Israeli service realizes that they need the help and co-operation of its British and US counterparts.        
	The first step is to put in place an agent in the heart of the industrial empire, in fact in the owners bed. Once this is done and Allons team has access to the targets mobile phone and laptop, they make the startling discovery that the owner is covertly helping Iran to develop its nuclear capability.        
	It would be a shame to reveal the end. The angels (in this case, given the name of the hero, it is perhaps best to use the singular) win of course. But there is a nice twist towards the end, and readers are made to realize that in a covert war there are only half-devils and half-angels.        
	The writing is fast-paced as befits a gripping thriller such as this one. The bit about picking the agent, training her and putting her on the job is very well done. There is a side story about the media and lots of convincing details about how IT is used for spying. As thrillers go, this is as good as it gets.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PLAY IT AGAIN                                                    
	Rhetoric serves to shroud self-interest, and the latter can be made to masquerade as altruism by those blessed with the gift of oratory. Very few will dispute that Barack Obama came to India, and, like Julius Caesar of old, he saw and he conquered. The conquest was emotional: he danced with children; paid his respects to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi; quoted Rabindranath Tagore; cited Vivekananda; praised Ambedkar; and was lavish in his tribute to Indias civilization and democracy. It was music as long as the music lasted. The aftermath of euphoria is always crowded with uncomfortable questions. Why this sudden discovery of India? Do India and Indians need to be told by a president of the United States of America that they have arrived and have a great history and an even more promising future? The Aeneid said, Beware the Greeks when they come bearing gifts. Does the same apply to Uncle Sam even when the bearer is so obviously well-meaning? The questions need to be asked, since foreign policy is never determined by pious and highfalutin statements made for public consumption. Foreign policy is dictated by the hard-nosed pursuit of self-interest.        
	Mr Obamas visit had a subtext. His decision to visit India so early in his term and his glowing compliments must be placed in the context of the rise of China and of Islamic fundamentalism. India is a flourishing secular democracy in a huge arc of the world mostly dominated by countries governed by the shariat and totalitarian regimes. Hence the discovery of India as an ally, and the recognition of Indias arrival as a powerful player in international affairs and in the world economy. India should be careful not to be swayed by the honours being bestowed and promised. There is the danger of being reduced to a pawn of the US on the global chessboard. Neither should India, in a knee-jerk reaction reminiscent of Krishna Menons, reject all that has been put on the platter only because it comes from the US. India, even without the US president saying so, is a self-confident and powerful nation, and it should pursue its own interests in foreign policy. It should use its friendship with the US to further its own interests vis--vis Pakistan and even China.        
	In the prevailing ambience, the fundamental contradiction between a dominant US and an increasingly powerful India has a tendency to get suppressed. The US would abhor a challenger and, ironically, if India fulfils the potential which Mr Obama emphasized, it may become that. The immediate picture of Indo-US relations is rosy and the goodwill generated by Mr Obamas visit illustrates that. But todays bonhomie could be the ground for tomorrows loathing. Ersatz friendships are prone to fathering unnatural vices.

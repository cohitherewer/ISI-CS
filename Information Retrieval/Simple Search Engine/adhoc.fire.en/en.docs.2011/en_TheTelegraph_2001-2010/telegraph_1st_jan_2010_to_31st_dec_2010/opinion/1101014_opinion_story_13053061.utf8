No wonder West Bengal is desperate for change                                                  
	The West Bengal state assembly elections are due next year, and given the political climate, it looks unlikely that the Left Front will come back to power. If so, curtains will come down on an era that began in 1977 with a flourish, but seems to be ending rather ingloriously amidst reports of widespread corruption and bickering between the state unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its central committee in New Delhi. When the rise and fall of the Left Front government in West Bengal is scripted, it will reveal how the state, which was among the leaders in practically all economic parameters when the CPI(M) came to power, gradually slid down and presently occupies an unenviable position.        
	As of now, barring foodgrain production, West Bengals other economic indicators compare abjectly vis--vis the eight developed states: Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Punjab and Haryana. West Bengal is sixth in net per capita domestic product and last in per capita consumption of electricity. The percentage of electrified villages and households is the lowest. It has the lowest per capita budgeted expenditure on education and thus the least number per capita of middle and secondary schools. It also holds the dubious distinction of having the lowest literacy rate with Punjab and Haryana. But the most shocking fact, by far, is that after 30-odd uninterrupted years of being ruled by a supposedly pro-poor party, the state has the largest percentage of people living below poverty line.        
	If West Bengals economic and social indicators are depressing, how is its fiscal health? Worse. In pre-Left- Front days, the state governments budget invariably reflected an exemplary trait  revenue expenditure was less than earnings, leaving a surplus. Then came the Left Front and the deficits on revenue account. The idea was that if more investment than revenues earned by the state was required, it would have to be made to initiate growth, and increased revenues from this growth would offset the deficit. To implement this concept, the Jyoti Basu government launched a militant trade union movement, which drove big business and prospective revenues out of the state. When revenues dropped sharply, the Left Fronts response was to resort to more loans. The only prudent solution of getting out of the vicious cycle was to resort to a cut in government spending, hiving off loss-making State-owned units, and shedding surplus manpower. But none of these happened. On the contrary, records show that while the state was being led into a debt trap, recruitment continued, salaries were increased, and with it, government spending.        
	Currently, the state government has a staggering debt of Rs 1,14,096 crore; it spends more than 90 per cent of the revenue receipt on salary, pension and interest payment alone; in 2010-2011, while Rs 15,000 crore will go for debt servicing, only Rs 5,000 crore could be set aside for development. To add insult to injury, the government has just increased pension substantially, and is currently resorting to large-scale recruitment. The votes may come the Left Front way, but the cost would have to be met by the next government.        
	In the current session of the assembly, the state finance minister is likely to table the West Bengal fiscal responsibility and budget management bill. Once passed, the bill will put a cap on the states borrowings and bring down the revenue deficit with every yearly budget. It also mandates mid-term reviews, calls for trimming allocations based on the states receipts aside from borrowings, and targets a zero-revenue deficit as early as March 2015  an utopian ideal for West Bengal. One wonders what took the finance commission so long to impose the FRBM on West Bengal, as the state has been in a debt trap for a decade and the overdraft of around Rs 100,000 crore came out of the Central government allocation. Had this loan been repaid, the Centre could have used it for subsidies on fuel, for instance, or on any other development project. Karnataka and Maharashtra faced similar fiscal problems in the last decade, but overcame them with prudent fiscal measures.        
	If the state has indeed borrowed this colossal sum, what has it done with it? Granted, with its labour policy, the state could not attract industries, but West Bengal could do with more electrified homes, more hospitals in the rural areas, more schools and colleges, more and better roads, more low-cost housing, more people having access to drinking water  the list is endless. Kerala, which is also not industry-friendly, has channelled revenues towards these sectors, and is now a model for other states. Over 30 years of Left rule and Rs 100,000 crore down the drain could not bring down the poverty level by five percentage points. Is it any wonder why the people are desperate for change?        
	There is a military strategy called the scorched earth policy, in which the retreating army destroys resources useful for the invading enemy, thereby rendering the conquered land useless. Left Front leaders have transplanted this strategy on to the fiscal front. It should occur to them that the state and the people are theirs too. We are not at war.

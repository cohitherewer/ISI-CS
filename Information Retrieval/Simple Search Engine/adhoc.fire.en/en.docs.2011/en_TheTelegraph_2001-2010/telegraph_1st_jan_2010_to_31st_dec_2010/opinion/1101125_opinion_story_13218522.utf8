                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOME OF HOPE                                                    
	The room was reasonably full  with students, their teachers and visitors, but Barsha, from her wheelchair spotted me and began waving her hand. When I went near her she told me with the help of the communicating device before her that I was coming to the Indian Institute of Cerebral Palsy after a very long time. My face must have registered some surprise at her powers of recall, for she said after five years. Then I remembered that she had been present when I had given a talk at the institute on Can good writing be taught?        
	Barshas recall is obviously better than mine; so are her other talents. She is a poet. She writes her poetry with the aid of the device that has been prepared for her. She reads poetry with a great deal of care and attention. She is differently abled because she cannot speak clearly and is wheelchair bound. But her enjoyment of life and her engagement with it takes your breath away.         
	She is among the many persons whose lives have been transformed by the outstanding work done by all those who teach them and look after them in the IICP. What these boys and girls are unaware of is the fact that by their very presence, by their courage and by their drive to achieve, they have also transformed the lives of the staff of IICP. This is one reason why it is a unique institution.        
	A visit to the IICP is an overwhelming experience. I went last Saturday to see an interactive exhibition the students had put up on sports and I came away with my mind swirling with emotions: humility, notions of ones own privilege and uselessness but also a sense of triumph at having seen what human beings, ordinary human beings like you and me, can achieve, what odds they can overcome. After such knowledge, what forgiveness?        
	I moved from room to room to learn about the recently concluded Commonwealth Games, about cricket, about football and about the Olympic Games. In a short play, the students enacted the first Olympic Games, complete with the prize-giving ceremony. I met the boys and girls who were taking part in the exhibition and helped to put it up. Those amongst them who cannot speak clearly have a small box before them which is programmed to give their responses to simple questions. This device is still not perfect because the demand for it is so restricted that very few people are willing to make an investment to improve it.        
	This is one of the many challenges facing the IICP  the availability of equipment tailor-made to meet the special demands of its students. The biggest challenge is one of social attitudes. Most of us are haunted by the idea of the handicapped. Hence the reluctance to accept those who are differently abled as being part of the mainstream. The change is not going to come overnight, but it will never happen unless we all consciously make an attempt to change our attitudes and stop being self-satisfied.        
	Before I came away, I promised Barsha I would go back to listen to her telling me about creative writing. I know that my next visit to the IICP will leave me again with a lump in my throat and my emotional world utterly disrupted. But I have to go back because the IICP is one of the few places in this wretched city of ours that gives one hope and restores faith in the ability of human beings. It is an enchanted place.

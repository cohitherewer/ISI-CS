                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OPENING UP ACCESS                          - A choice among carriers is beneficial in particular contexts					 					      COMMENTARAO:   S.L. RAO                                                            
	There are many instances in the delivery of infrastructure services where it is economical only to have one carrier or transportation facility to move the service between two points. Examples are water pipelines, pipelines for oil and gas, railway lines, or wires for transmission and distribution of electricity. All have to use the one common carrier even if there are many different service providers supplying different customers. Economists call this natural monopoly. Open access means that anyone who wants to use this transportation can do so if the capacity is available and they pay the price. If open access is mandated by law, the carrier has no choice but to make the carriages possible, subject to capacity being available and price of carriage having been determined.        
	Most transportation facilities in India  for electricity, water, oil and gas  have been under the control of the government. Interstate electricity transmission has been till recently the exclusive domain of the Power Grid Corporation of India, a Central government company; intra-state transmission, and most of the distribution wires, are state government-owned monopolies. Oil and gas pipelines are still a monopoly of the Gas Authority of India, a Central government enterprise. State governments own almost all pipelines for water supplies. Since governments were believed to take decisions that were neutral and objective, and there were no other suppliers, the issue of open access never came up in the past. In recent years, this situation has begun to change, first in electricity, then in oil and gas, and it will, over time, extend to other infrastructure services. But for a long time in the future, the suppliers will be dominated by government-owned providers, with a growing number of private providers who will want to use the available transportation facility. Rules for open access must be carefully considered, should be common for all services, and be rigorously enforced.              
	Open access is thus a means to curb the tendency of any monopoly to exploit its position by charging differential rates or indulging in other discriminatory or exploitative acts. If it is to be effectively implemented, the service provider (the electricity generating plant or the oil or gas field owner) should not also own the transportation facility, and the tariff for the transportation must be determined by an independent and neutral body. In India, this is circumvented by having different companies under common control that undertake, say, electricity generation, transmission and distribution. It is natural that sometimes they favour their own companies.        
	The concept of open access came into Indian law in the Electricity Act, 2003. The act, for the first time, recognized some new ideas: captive generation, electricity trading, markets and electricity exchanges, and, as a result, merchant power plants set up purely for trading purposes. These measures were expected to add to generation capacities, as investors chose the route that would give them best returns. The act mandated open access on the transmission and distribution wires so that any supplier could use the wires for transmission and distribution of electricity, subject to capacity being available and the price mutually agreed upon.        
	Later, the same concept was introduced (by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board Act) in pipeline transmission of oil and gas. The owner of the pipelines had to allow all suppliers to use the pipeline. (The provision in the act has yet to be notified.) Wires or pipelines are natural monopolies; more than one such link may not be viable. In the absence of choice between alternative transmission operators available to the service providers, open access would prevent exploitation of a position of natural monopoly by the owner of the wires.        
	However, the choice of suppliers is relevant only when there is no shortage, and there is ample supply. The application of the concept of open access should have taken account of the fact that electricity in India is in short supply and will probably remain so for a long time. It should also have recognized that the concept could not override supply arrangements in vogue and made earlier. Such arrangements could have been made either formally in written agreements or by custom. The neglect of these two preconditions has led to the disputes that have arisen between distribution companies and suppliers and in interstate transmission between the different states.        
	A pre-existing supply arrangement to distributors that was in operation for decades could not be suddenly abandoned because open access makes better prices possible from sales to other prospective customers. This would disrupt the existing distribution arrangements based on that supply and suddenly raise the cost of electricity to the users there.        
	Many buyers are willing to pay higher prices, subject to transmission capacity being available. Political compulsions impel state governments to try and ensure adequate supply in their states and without sudden large increases in tariffs. When there is a shortage because of a sudden demand surge through monsoon failure, heat waves, breakdowns and so on, state governments are loath to allow electricity generated in their states to go on their wires under open access to customers not approved by them. The supplier is selling it to other customers because he gets a better price. The originating state is reluctant to match such higher price because it will mean a tariff increase and/or a fresh burden on state budgets.        
	The solution obviously is for the state to ensure adequate supply in its own area by entering into long-term supply contracts. If the contracts result in excess supply, the power can be sold elsewhere. All states must also fine-tune tariff arrangements to maximize earnings from those who can afford to pay, raising efficiencies in use, preventing theft, and adjusting tariffs for time of day and season.              
	Hence the provision for open access in the act must be modified to take account of the following:        
	It should not apply when there are pre-existing supply arrangements, whether entered into formerly or in practice for a long time.        
	It must require state governments, before they refuse permission for open access, to first take the actions for minimizing demand, maximizing earnings, improving efficiencies in use and not being too hesitant about raising tariffs. Any forbidding of open access must be approved of by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission.        
	The state electricity regulatory commission should avoid allowing consumer choice of the electricity supplier until it is assured of adequate supply needed to meet demand.        
	If supplies are ensured and choice is allowed by the SERC, the SERC must estimate the proportionate cross-subsidy costs and ensure that they are met by the new distributor.        
	If, however, the generating plant was set up for captive use and/ or merchant sales, neither state governments nor regulatory commissions must intervene to stop interstate sales and transmission through open access to the wires.        
	Open access gives freedom of choice to consumers, producers (for example, electricity generators), and helps establish trading and markets. But choice can be relevant only when there are adequate supplies and suppliers. When there is shortage and there is market dominance by one supplier  namely the government, and the wires are largely owned by the government, which also controls the load despatch centres  then choice has little meaning. It can become operational in instances of captive generation, and of merchant power plants. Regulators and governments should be careful about introducing choice in other situations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Changes in the constant
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CHANGES IN THE CONSTANT                                  With its growing crowds, keener conflicts and frequent disruptions, the Metro, once Calcuttas pride, retains its dubious fascination even as it becomes shabbier                                          
	I used to wonder why the thought of Calcutta always brought to my mind the image of a cocoon. I suppose it had a fair bit to do with how both staunch lovers and detractors of the city associated Calcutta and its institutions with a sense of stability. Despite its flaws, Calcutta took great pride in many things that werent about to change.        
	Except that some did. An age-old feather in Calcuttas cap on which the citys reputation rested for decades was its underground railway. Having functioned like clockwork over the years, it has almost become an institution in itself. Not only was it a fast, safe, cheap and readily available means of travel for the citys commuters, but it was also considered the safest form of public transport by anxiety-ridden parents.        
	I only started using the Metro regularly about seven years ago  and I can already perceive the difference between then and now. I remember being able to board trains from Rabindra Sarobar and Maidan with relative ease. Stations like Esplanade always meant a jostling crowd, but, until recently, it was not beyond control. The recent expansion of the Metro line may very well be responsible for it, but the footfall that the Metro now witnesses on a daily basis reaches the six lakh mark, according to a Metro railway official. That I have to allow two or three trains to pass before I am able to muster up the courage to valiantly plunge into the deluge of passengers apparently about to immerse the train proves just how bad things have become. Like vehicles increasing by the hundreds in Calcutta everyday as the roads choke, an ever-increasing count of passengers come to board a never-changing number of trains, some of which are truly on their last legs. How are these supposed to function under the mounting pressure? I remember noting with alarm just how much the doorways of a Metro coach today look like the entrances of our infamous minibuses  passengers are on the verge of hanging out of the trains. The sliding doors take more than five attempts before they are able to shut properly. This does not bode well.        
	The Metro was the only reprieve during my university years as far as travelling long distances was concerned. However, a recurring problem that led to fairly frequent shutting down of services  and has, strangely enough, not yet been properly addressed  is the alarming number of suicides that the citys Metro stations have witnessed. It is disturbingly easy for someone who looks like a regular passenger to jump to his death in the path of a speeding train. Metro Railway officials have successfully prevented several such attempts since 1988, but what of proper preventive measures, like glass barriers separating the tracks from the platforms? The sheer volume of passengers is a decisive indicator of the revenue that is being raked in. In light of that, one wonders why the general manager of the Metro Railway should say in April that an integration of trains, a signalling system and screen doors  measures required for the successful implementation of the glass barrier system  are difficult to introduce.        
	Today, I must concur with glowing accounts of the Delhi Metro, having experienced it myself. But, though it was a stellar experience, I never felt that Calcuttas Metro had to compete with, or better, the performance of its counterpart in Delhi. Although far humbler, it was always functional, relatively comfortable and free of hazards  which was all that really mattered. However, in the span of a few months, Calcuttas constant has deteriorated drastically. The reason is not difficult to spot. As long as our railway minister continues to enthusiastically flag off a dozen new trains while paying no attention to the maintenance and condition of her citys Metro, Calcuttas commuters have a problem on their hands.

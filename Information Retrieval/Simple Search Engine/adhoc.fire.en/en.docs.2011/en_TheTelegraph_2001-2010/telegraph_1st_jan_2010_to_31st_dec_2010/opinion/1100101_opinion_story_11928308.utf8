	Maybe Yesterday   By Dorothea N uuml;rnberg
  ,Promilla, Rs 650  
	Human relationships are often indefinable. But human society is not all that comfortable with relationships that do not conform to certain pre-formulated categories. Human society flatly rejects those relationships, which appear as potential threats to its age-old institutions. In the essay, Instincts and Institutions(Desert Islands and Other Texts), Gilles Deleuze writes: In the end, the problem of instinct and institution will be grasped most acutely not in animal societies, but in relations of animal and humans, when the demands of men come to bear on the animal by integrating it into institutions (totemism and domestication), when the urgent needs of the animal encounter the human, either fleeing or attacking us, or patiently waiting for nourishment and protection.  
	The Deleuzian animal is relentlessly encountering the human in the institution of marriage, especially in the era of globalization, in which the spheres of knowledge and activity have widened for every individual. What we blandly term as personal maladjustments are actually questions of defining an individual selfhood on its own terms. In marriage, where love is totemized and/or domesticated, the impulses of fleeing and attacking the institution pre-empt the concern for nourishment and protection which it guarantees.        
	This is something which the protagonists of Dorothea Nrnbergs novel, Maybe Yesterday (translated by Karin and Amrit Bhatia), discover in the form of a mid-life crisis. Married for a reasonable length of time, Julian Kaiser, a Viennese aircraft captain, and his wife, Tara, a dedicated Indologist, suddenly find their relationship falling apart. It is not as if they no longer love each other (though it seems so, for the moment), but they find that it is impossible to live together any more. They have managed, so far, to share the same room despite incompatibilities in their professions and temperament, but now, both seem to be tired of making compromises, and the relationship crumbles at the slightest provocation. This rupture changes both individuals in radical ways.        
	Julian has a brief romance with Laura, a Florentine pianist, but shortly thereafter, he has a strange vision of a deva while attending a meditation session in a Buddhist community in the Tyrolean Alps. It was Stefan, his friend, who first introduced him to this community, and it is Stefan again, who, having been told of the vision, takes him to Mokudo, the abbot of the monastery, who is supposed to explain the significance of this vision to Julian. Julian, from that point of time, is haunted by that image, and embarks on a mad hunt for it. His quest brings him to India, and, in his mind, the identity of the deva becomes increasingly confusing.        
	Tara, meanwhile, makes an arduous yet futile journey looking for her biological father  a Ladakhi tour guide . Her mother had told her about him when she was on her deathbed. Her attempts to contact Julian on his cellphone do not yield results. She becomes even more absorbed in her research, starts translating the Uddhava Gita, and engages in long e-mail conversations with one Prathab Singh in Delhi, who is interested in her field of study. She comes to Delhi to attend a conference. It is in Delhi that Tara has a chance meeting with Julian. While Julian discovers he has been looking for Tara for all these years, Tara notes with surprise how readily she accepts his embrace. For a moment though, Julian has to go back to the cockpit and Tara to her conference. Julian flies to Kuala Lumpur, and Tara, at the end of the conference, undertakes a fateful journey to Leh.        
	This is a saga of the triumph of the instinct of love over the institution of marriage. It is also a tale of the insurmountable loneliness of todays global citizens. Shuttling between Europe and India, the narrative captures the transitions between illusion and reality, between the intangible and the palpable. The narrative is a trifle gloomy, but it does not fail in exuding a distinct charm.

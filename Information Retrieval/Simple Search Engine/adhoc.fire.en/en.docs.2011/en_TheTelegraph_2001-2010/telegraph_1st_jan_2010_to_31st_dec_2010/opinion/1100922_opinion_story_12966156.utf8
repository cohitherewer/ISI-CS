                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LEGAL FAQS                                  Advocate Nibedita Roye answers your queries                                          
	Q: I did my BTech from IIT-BHU where I was victimised for being a scheduled caste student. My batchmates, mostly upper caste Hindus, humiliated and tortured me in many ways. The teachers also tortured me. I had complained to the vice-chancellor about this. An enquiry committee was also set up but no action was ever taken. The director and the dean suppressed the matter and pressured me not to make any further complaints. What can I do to get justice?         
	Robins Raman, via email                
	A: Assuming that the incidents happened quite some time back and you did not lodge a complaint with the local police station at that time, the chances of getting a complaint registered as an FIR against the culprits after such a long time are minimal.              
	Q:My sisters husband, a primary school teacher, is missing since 1994. My sisters suit for declaration of her husbands death was dismissed on the ground that the police enquiry was still pending and declaration of death could not be granted without the final police report. How can she get her husbands retirement benefits in the absence of a death certificate or a declaration to that effect by a court? She is facing great financial hardship.        
	Minati Chatterjee, Calcutta                
	A: Without a decree or a death certificate it is not possible to lay a claim to a persons assets. Your sister should request the concerned police station to follow up and expedite the pending police enquiry and file their report before the appropriate court.               
	Q:I took possession of a flat a year-and-a-half ago and its registration was done last month. Towards the end of last year, water began to seep from the bathrooms of the flat above. The matter was brought to the notice of the builder, who is in charge of the maintenance of the housing complex. Though my bathrooms have been badly damaged by the seepage, the builder has refused to take any action. What legal recourse do I have?        
	Madhuchhanda Ganguly, Calcutta                
	A: Since the builder is still responsible for the maintenance of your building, but has not taken any measures to repair the damage, you could send him a legal notice, asking him to rectify the defects. If the legal notice is ignored and no action is taken, you can file a case against the builder before the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum making him liable for deficiency in services.

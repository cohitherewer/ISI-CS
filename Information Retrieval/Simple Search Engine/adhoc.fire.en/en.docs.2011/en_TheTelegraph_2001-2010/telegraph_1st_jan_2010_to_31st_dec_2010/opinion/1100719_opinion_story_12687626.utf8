	Difficult choice                  
	Sir  In Open choice (July 14), Prabhat Patnaik writes, As a Marxist, I am totally opposed to the perspective of the Maoists, who, if ever successful ,will, in a conspicuous fashion, foist upon this country a one-party dictatorship that is the very antithesis of socialism.... But is it only the Maoists who prefer one-party rule? Every communist nation, be it China, Cuba, North Korea or Vietnam, is ruled by one party  a communist party that follows Marxist principles. Maoism, it can be said, is an off-shoot of Marxism. In fact, there are very few ideological differences between Marxism and Maoism. In West Bengal, the Maoists are opposing the Communist Party of India (Marxist) because they feel that the CPI(M) is revisionist by nature. On its part, the government led by the CPI(M) is trying to root out the Maoists since it considers them to be a threat to its rule.           
	Yours faithfully,
  Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 
          
	Sir  Prabhat Patnaiks Open choice was truly illuminating. Patnaik has exposed the futility of the Maoist movement, which is based on identity politics. Even the Naxalite movement of the 1960s succeeded only in wiping out a generation of talented youth in Bengal. One hopes that this time round, the misguided tribals will return to mainstream politics and consolidate the only revolutionary gain that the oppressed citizens of India have ever achieved namely, one-person-one-vote.           
	Yours faithfully,         Jai Shankar Agarwala, Jalpaiguri            
	Sir  The Maoists, so far, have desisted from targeting state capitals. This is possibly because such a direct attack on the administrative nerve centre could bring upon them a brutal retaliation. However, the state administration seems to be happy with the fact that the Maoist menace remains confined to remote towns and villages. Most officers transferred to Maoist-infested areas consider the posting to be a punishment. Given the present situation, the Maoist problem is likely to persist as long as the Central and state governments fail to come up with stringent plans to curb Maoism. As the government goes ahead with its plans of industrialization and land acquisition, the number of displaced people is set to rise. This will surely generate some sort of an anti-government backlash that the Maoists will exploit. Even if the Maoist threat is curbed, some other form of unrest will replace it as the State is unlikely to change its policies in a hurry. Until and unless the people decide to engage in peaceful means of protest, democracy in India will get weakened in the years to come. The ultimate sufferer, undoubtedly, will be this populous nation.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Help at hand          
	Sir  It is not surprising that beggars have become moneylenders in Burdwan (Beggars turn moneylenders, July 16). As is evident, begging can be a lucrative profession. But the beggars cannot dare to lead a better life simply because they would end up losing their jobs. It is significant that poor businessmen, who are not entitled to get bank loans, have been able to survive with the fiscal support provided by beggars in Burdwan. It is encouraging to have such a parallel financial system under present market conditions. However, The Telegraph should have been more cautious before publishing the names of beggars and their monthly incomes. This kind of information may put the beggars at risk. Unscrupulous elements can easily trace them and harm them for money. Perhaps, it is time to recognize that beggars are also a part of society and that they serve the economy with their ingenious lending system.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  If I were inducted into the advisory committee of the local municipality, my advice to civic officials would have been as follows  free the roads of litter and garbage; clear the pavements of encroaching hawkers; remove hoardings from trees and lamp posts; eliminate stray canines; instruct dog-owners to carry bags while walking their pets and penalize them if the dogs dirty the roads; prevent corporation workers (safai karmacharis) from burning leaves and other combustible garbage on roads; minimize water logging and repair the pot-holed stretches.These simple, but effective, steps would be welcomed by every harassed Calcuttan.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhag Mehta, Calcutta

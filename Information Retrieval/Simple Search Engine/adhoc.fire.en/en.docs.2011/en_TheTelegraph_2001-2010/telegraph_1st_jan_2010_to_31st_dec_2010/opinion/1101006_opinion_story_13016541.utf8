	Pretty complex                  
	Sir  In The Kerala conundrum (Sept 30), Ashok Sanjay Guha mentions two opposing approaches to bring about development. One focuses on output and income growth and the other on developing human capability. Kerala has the highest suicide rate in India, the highest rate of alcoholism and a discontented population. It is a fallacy to think that growth in income and the development of human capability are mutually exclusive, even though the State has a greater role to play in the case of the latter. Hence, a strategy that makes it possible to promote both approaches simultaneously has a greater chance of succeeding. The common element of critical importance is an environment that facilitates the freedom of choice. A system that prevents people from exercising their free will would result in people fleeing their home state in search of a better life elsewhere.           
	I work in the Middle East where the largest number of employed Indians happen to come from Kerala. After living in a Left-ruled state, the number of Bengalis who have emigrated to the Middle East is also considerable. Notwithstanding Prabhat Patnaiks unabashed support for the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (Dial M for modernity, Sept 16), this begs a simple question: why is emigration more pronounced in the states ruled by communists?

	Sir  Ashok S. Guhas presentation of Keralas socio-economic realities is balanced. Kerala has a flavour which is distinct from that of the other states in India. This is manifest in its emphasis on austere living, its fetish for cleanliness, a committed sense of social responsibility and perceptible communal harmony. All these values stem from deep-rooted traditions that have remained unscathed, possibly because, unlike in other states, growth and income have failed to create a strong impact in Kerala. Barring a few places like Kozhikode and Kochi, which have tasted prosperity as a result of the money sent by workers from the Gulf, life has remained serene and unruffled in Gods own country. If the values intrinsic to tradition are cherished, the move towards crass commercialization can be arrested.          
	Happiness is a state of mind. Professor Paul Samuelson defines happiness as material consumption divided by desire. Kerala demonstrates this formula very well. Keralites are simple and sincere, but are not good at enterprise. Not only outsiders but even Keralites are wary of setting up industries in their home state. They prefer to migrate to neighbouring states such as Tamil Nadu or Karnataka that are renowned for an efficient work culture.          
	Interestingly, Guha mentions that Kerala has the highest suicide rate in the country. This is indeed true and somewhat strange considering that the people of Kerala have a seemingly healthy attitude towards life. A professor in psychology is of the opinion that Keralites in general are introverts. This personality trait may explain their inability to succeed in enterprises that require aggression.          
	Analysts all over the world have raised questions about some of the basic premises of all economic theories. Economics argues that human decisions are always rational. This, however, is not always the case. That is why the development of human capabilities is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition to bring about industrial development.

	Knotty issue          
	Sir  Hamas has always been the proverbial fly in the ointment (Hopeless dream, Oct 1).Yasser Arafats spirit seems to cloud Hamass vision even today. Consequently, talks with Israel get stymied on every occasion.           
	While Mahmoud Abbas and Fatah have reportedly agreed to recognize Israel and accept the long recommended two-state solution by sharing the land between River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, Ismail Haniyeh has not been able to make Hamas leaders see reason. Worse, Hamas has aggravated the situation with its periodic rocket attacks and terrorist strikes on Israel. This is a self-defeating stance that only leads to severe retaliation by Israeli forces on Gaza.           
	The American president, Barack Obama, has opted to follow the path charted by his predecessor without assessing whether it is productive or not. Obama should have adopted a new approach by closing ranks with Iran and cementing the laudable efforts made by the erstwhile Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami, in this context. That way, he could have used the good offices of Tehran to check Hamass intransigence. Such a strategy would have also improved ties between Israel and Iran and shown the United States of America in better light in the strife-torn region of West Asia.

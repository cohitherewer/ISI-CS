	Indian institutions can still spring a pleasant surprise or two. Bangalore University has become the first academic institution in the country to reserve seats for transgender students in its post-graduate courses. The National Law School of India University in Bangalore intends to do the same soon. For once it would seem that reservations are being put to positive use. The authorities of Bangalore University have shown themselves to be both sensitive and determined, recalling that transgender candidates have been rejected by the university in the past. Yet there are young people from that community fit and waiting to go into higher studies. The university is making sure that their aspirations are fulfilled.         
	The authorities in both institutions are concerned that persons of different sexual inclinations are deprived even of basic rights, and, therefore, of the opportunities of joining the mainstream. But their vision has a dimension that goes beyond political correctness. Many academic aspirants from the group are brilliant; hence rejecting them is a loss of human resources. The university is not only offering a separate gender column in its admission forms, it is also arranging for separate bathrooms and restrooms for the new students, as well as counselling sessions for all students so that transgender students are not harassed. The policy is not haphazard or ad hoc, as many populist or politically correct moves tend to be. It also shows how much can be done in academic institutions  whatever the ideological biases of the state government. But the decision could not have come out of thin air. The third gender movement is particularly strong and vocal in the southern states. Visibility matters. While the university is setting an example of the thoughtful use of reservations, the development can also be seen as the fruitful convergence of a minority campaign and its institutional response.

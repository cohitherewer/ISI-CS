	Q: The maintenance charge on the flats in our complex was initially levied on a square-feet basis. Then we began to collect it on an equal basis. Subsequently, one flat owner stopped paying the charge. He is now willing to clear his dues, but only on a square-feet basis. How can we recover the dues?        
	Saroj Kumar Mukherjee, Calcutta        
	A: The West Bengal Apartment Ownership Act, 1972, provides that an apartment owners share of common expenses is determined by the association comprising a board of managers. The assessment should be made according to the value of the apartment unit. If arrears are not paid up, the association may realise the dues by filing a civil suit against the defaulter.        
	Q: I want to buy a flat. The original owner died a bachelor but left a will. His widowed mother and childless widowed sister are the heirs. But they are unable to produce the original sale deed and the will. They are willing to sign the sale deed, give a certified copy of old sale deed and register a signed indemnity bond. Is it safe to proceed in this way?         
	L. More, via email        
	A: The certified copy of the sale deed would provide you with details of the owner and the history related to the property. But if the original owner did make a will leaving the property to the said heirs, then a probate of the will has to be obtained by the beneficiaries so that they can transfer the property to you. You should also conduct a search of the property in question both in the registry office and the courts with the appropriate jurisdiction.         
	Q: When an SBI savings bank account holder went to an ATM on May 28, 2010, the first attempt to withdraw Rs 20,000 failed and no receipt was generated. In the second attempt Rs 20,000 was dispensed but the balance was reduced by Rs 40,000 (Rs 20,000 + Rs 20,000). This matter is now under the jurisdiction of the banking ombudsman (RBI, Calcutta) and the dispute is yet to be resolved. Was the customer justified in seeking redress from the banking ombudsman?        
	Subhrangsu Mukherjee, Calcutta        
	A: Yes, the customer is justified in seeking redress from the ombudsman. If after enquiry it is proved that the bank was guilty of negligence, the customer can claim compensation, holding the bank liable for deficiency of services.

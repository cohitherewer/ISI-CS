	High food prices are forcing small businesses to close down. Take the case of Gao Li. This 30-something lost his job as a driver in a multinational when his boss left. Thanks to the global recession, multinationals in China are no longer giving their employees personal drivers, and, after scanning the internet for jobs (thats how hed got the drivers job), Gao thought it best to set up his own restaurant. That had been his dream for years; he was a good cook, having trained under a Taiwanese friend when he finished middle school.        
	Gao had hoped to set up the restaurant in his hometown, but rentals were too high in this fishing village-turned-SEZ. So he shifted base to an adjoining city, leaving his wife and little son behind. There, he set up a modest 25-seater eatery in an industrial area. Keeping prices minimal, Gao found hed hit the right market. Business was so good that it left him no time to breathe. He would buy the food himself, supervise the two cooks hed hired, and then deliver lunch boxes to the adjoining factories on his cycle.         
	Dinner was less frenzied; he didnt have to deliver food, but his eatery was always full. Soon his wife and son joined him  the three of them living on the floor above. His wife pitched in; his son made new friends and Gao got him enrolled in a nearby school after having to pay an additional fee for being an outsider to the city.        
	This idyllic situation, however, didnt last more than 10 months. Food prices started going up, but Gao couldnt afford to raise prices at his restaurant. Earlier, he was breaking even; now, he began to lose money. Finally, he thought it best to cut his losses. Handing over the running of the restaurant to his wifes brother, he moved back to his hometown. Today, the restaurant set up with such enthusiasm has become a small take-away place; Gao is jobless.                
	Hit hard        
	Inflation has reached such proportions that the minimum expenses for a family of three in urban China today are not less than 3000 yuan, says Gao. Prices of grains, vegetables, fruit, meat and oil compare with those in India; but salaries of working class people are higher in China. Migrant labour, often single, start work at 800-1,000 yuan (one yuan = Rs 7.7), and get dormitory accommodation near their workplace and one meal.        
	Its middle class people like Gao, whose wives dont work and who have a child, who are hit hard. All over the coastal cities, which had been at the forefront of the post-Mao liberalization, small shops and restaurants have disappeared, to give way to fancy mobile/ electronic stores. Rentals are just too high.         
	Even an international supermarket chain like Carrefour has rented out an entire floor to expensive clothes wear shops, restricting its USP  row upon row of cheap, good quality readymades.        
	What will Gao do now? Originally, he had planned to shift to Macau, where his parents stay, and open a restaurant there. He even underwent the 1,500 yuan DNA test necessary to take up residence in Macau, to prove he was his parents son. But having moved back to his hometown, Gao has rediscovered its charms. Trees still line its avenues; while skyscrapers are gobbling up open greens, huge parks remain untouched. The housing colony where he has always lived, one of the first to be set up, is ideal for children. Now Gao doesnt want his son to grow up in treeless Macau, where looking out of ones apartment, all you see is another wall.        
	So the Gaos wont leave this city. Instead, this never-say-die Cantonese plans to take a four-month course in basic plumbing and electrical repairs and then get attached to one of the swanky hotels that keep coming up.

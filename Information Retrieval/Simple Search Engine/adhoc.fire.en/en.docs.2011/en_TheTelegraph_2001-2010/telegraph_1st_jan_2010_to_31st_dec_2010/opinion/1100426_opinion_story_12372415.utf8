	The Indian Premier League has been the best and worst show for a long time. The two go together in India. For instance, the Emergency was a dreadful show, but the trouncing of the Indira Congress in the 1977 election changed the entire tone; the economic crisis of 1991 was the worst of independent India, but it led to the lucky transition from socialism to the present mixed-up capitalism. The IPL is a progeny of that new system  just as complex, confused and rollicking. And again, the real game, namely the bat-ball being played every evening, has been quite forgotten; people cannot even distinguish the men of the mauve JXU from the ochre QZV. But everyone knows Lalit Modi as if he was the boy from the corner shop, and hangs on his precious words, dropped off on the way to the next plane or speakeasy. Shashi Tharoor had by far the better looks, but he lost out in the popularity polls because of his literacy.         
	The falling out of the two gave a chance to the crypto-socialists hanging around the portals of power; they have jumped in with all the fervour of a pack of wolves. They were led by the finance minister, who thundered in Parliament that the finances of the owners of IPL teams would be probed, and sent the minions from the income tax and enforcement departments into the office of the IPL; they took care to let the media know before visiting it. The owners of most teams are well -known people of means; they would have been filing returns for years. Their partners from abroad would not, but they do not have to. So what the government has organized is a charade of self-righteousness.        
	Government types love publicity; they think that they are so much more important than filmy and cricket types and get so much less exposure. So they are likely to make the best use of this opportunity and keep creating diversions as long as they can. The administration of the IPL was never a model; they will leave it in a mess. Politicians too smell an opportunity; they will use it to get a stronger hold on the IPL. But at the end of all that profit maximization, the show must go on; more important, the real game must be insulated from the political ones.

	Brutally honest                  
	Sir  The report, Pocket empty but lawyers laud CM (Nov 6), presents an optimistic picture of Bihar, which is being run by Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United) in partnership with the Bharatiya Janata Party. As the report points out, it is unquestionable that Kumars rule has made the state livable after a long time. Under Lalu Prasad and his wife and successor, Rabri Devi, anarchy had reigned supreme in the state. Poverty was everywhere and the political hegemony of the Prasad family touched every aspect of life. Given the misrule, practitioners of law naturally had a good time. The criminal court lawyers of Nalanda, in fact, present a true picture of the times.          
	Kumar is turning out to be a messiah for the state. He has judiciously reformed the administration and gone after miscreants. Of course, the peril of communalism remains. That raises a pertinent question. Why does Kumar have to continue the partnership with the BJP? Kumar has never compromised on ethics. He had even opposed the BJP. The minority community feels safe in the Kumar regime, which has suppressed riots with an iron hand. It would be unfortunate if the chief minister fails to win the elections because of certain irrational fears raised by the Opposition.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Suchayan Biswas, Durgapur 

                
	Sir  The honesty of the lawyers of Nalanda are praiseworthy. Good governance under Nitish Kumar has taken away their bread and butter, yet they are not complaining. I salute them. They have shown that the nations interests are more important than self interest  and this is exceptional indeed. There are lawyers in Assam  as also elsewhere in the country  who, despite their huge income, do not hesitate to accept false briefs and encourage clients to file false cases so that they can make money.          
	Interestingly, all this is not unknown to the legal fraternity. Yet, no action is taken so as not to disturb the bar-bench relation. The Supreme Court and state high courts should take suo motu action against unscrupulous lawyers who are a blot on their profession.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Cry freedom          
	Sir  It is not surprising that the government of India threatened to arrest the Booker prize-winning novelist and human rights activist, Arundhati Roy, for her remarks about Kashmir (Arundhati strikes a defiant note, Oct 27). It is a sign of the Indian governments brutal attitude towards the Kashmir issue. To Kashmirs demands for justice and self-determination during the current phase of protests, the government has responded by using military force. More than 112 civilians  mostly youths  have been killed and several thousands injured. In the absence of strong international criticism, the Indian State has been emboldened enough to crush any sign of dissent.          
	Intimidating Kashmiri civil society has been a standard government response. It has been quite a journey for Kashmir since 1947, when the use of the fraudulent instrument of accession amounted to the snatching away of the territorial and political azaadi of Kashmiris. In the next few years, through its propaganda machinery, the Indian State completely covered its bloody footprints in Kashmir. State repression has grown several times in recent months.          
	From the very beginning of the current unrest, the government adopted the policy of restricting journalists from reporting on demonstrations and brutal government reactions. The Indian army and paramilitary forces allegedly beat up journalists and refused to respect their curfew passes. In one such incident in July this year, several photojournalists working for local, national and international publications suffered serious injuries when the security forces tried to stop them from recording the demonstrations. One journalist of the BBCs Urdu service, Riyaz Masroor, was stopped and beaten by the police as he went to collect his curfew pass on July 9.          
	The current phase of unrest in Kashmir has clearly exposed the weakness of the State apparatus. In the absence of Pakistani support to the new generation of Kashmiris, Indias blame game against Pakistan, Islamic terrorism and the Lashkar-e-Toiba has lost credibility. Several media commentators have questioned Indias brutal tactics and sympathized with Kashmiri demands, which are now finding a greater resonance within Indian civil society.           
	Yours faithfully,

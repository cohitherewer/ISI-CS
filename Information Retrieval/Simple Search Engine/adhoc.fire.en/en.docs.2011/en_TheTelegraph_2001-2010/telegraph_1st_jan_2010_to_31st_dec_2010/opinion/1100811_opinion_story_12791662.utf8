	Doomed state                  
	Sir  What happened in Leh was a heart-rending tragedy (Joyful at party, till monster growls, Aug 8). Now a colossal amount of work needs to be done to clear the debris, and this will prove to be a big challenge. The cloud burst, which decimated life and property, will be remembered as one of the greatest natural disasters in Indias history. Nothing can be done to bring back those who have lost their lives. It will also be difficult to retrieve the properties that have been washed away. All that one can do is hope that Leh and its residents recover quickly.           
	During this difficult time  marked by distress, hunger and cold  what is required is a show of unity and plenty of hard work to mend broken spirits and make Leh habitable once again. The government must provide all the help it can and ensure that the rescue operation proceeds efficiently. Normalcy will return to Leh soon because no natural calamity is strong enough to break the spirit and determination of mankind.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Rini De, Kharagpur

                
	Sir  An unprecedented cloud-burst triggered flash floods, which destroyed Leh. As per reports in the media, over 150 people have died and scores of others are still missing. Rescue workers have been working round the clock and defence personnel  including the army and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police  have been deployed to speed up relief work. Besides ensuring the safety of the survivors, the government should also provide basic amenities to the affected population at the earliest. Ordinary citizens should also pitch in to speed up the rehabilitation process. Better infrastructure has to be provided and the drainage system  which has collapsed completely  restored to what it was before. It is time the victims are made to feel that the entire nation is by their side during this crisis hour.           
	Yours faithfully, 
  Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad              
	Poor record          
	Sir  The allegations of corruption against some of the organizers of the Commonwealth Games have left Indians extremely disappointed (Govt Games rescue move, Aug 8). The malpractices that have come to light have received considerable international attention. It will take several years before India regains its reputation as a nation with high moral standards. Indias industrial and economic development will suffer in the coming years as foreign investors are likely to assume that nothing can be done in India without resorting to corrupt practices.           
	Thousands of Indians working abroad will also be looked down upon as citizens of a corrupt nation. It is true that corruption exists in every country, even in the developed nations. But, in India, the vice has become deeply embedded. So much so that it has not even left an event as prestigious as the Commonwealth Games untouched. One wonders why politicians and bureaucrats stoop to such deplorable levels and compromise with standards while organizing an event of international repute. Are these officials so heartless and dishonest that nothing matters to them save their ill-gotten wealth?                     
	Yours faithfully,      
N.S.Venkataraman, Chennai

                
	Sir  It is shocking to note the irregularities and corruption surrounding the Commonwealth Games. What is equally galling is that none of the accused has been arrested so far. Corruption in India is multiplying despite the best efforts of an honest prime minister. Only an effective deterrent in the form of stringent penalties can check the scourge. Hefty fines, a life-imprisonment term or the confiscation of property can be considered as possible deterrents to curb corruption.           
	An example should also be set by identifying those responsible for tarnishing the Commonwealth Games immediately. The guilty should then be arrested and the truth exposed at the earliest.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Rough ride          
	Sir  The report, Duronto thrash (Aug 8), which stated that a passenger on the Sealdah-bound Duronto was assaulted by the train staff after he had protested against the manner in which food was being served, came as a shock. Not only the quality of food but also the catering services have deteriorated considerably. Keeping pace with the spiralling inflation, prices of food items on the train have also increased considerably. Didi had promised that janata meals would be provided at Rs 10, but most of the food items on the train cost more than that. To make matters worse, there is a dearth of cafeterias and food kiosks on platforms. Those who are unwilling to buy food from vendors to safeguard their health are left with no choice but to eat the mediocre meals that are being served on the Duronto.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Syed Hussain, Calcutta

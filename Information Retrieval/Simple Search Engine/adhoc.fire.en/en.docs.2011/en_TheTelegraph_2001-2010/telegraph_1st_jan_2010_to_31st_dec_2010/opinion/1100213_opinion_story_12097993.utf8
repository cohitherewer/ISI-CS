The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Ordinary tributes to the master
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ORDINARY TRIBUTES TO THE MASTER                              Theatre      Ananda Lal                                                
	First to get off the starting block for the mammoth Tagore sesquicentenary celebrations shaping up from this year, Lokkrishti offers its homage by dramatizing his unusual late story, Laboratory (picture). Director Phalguni Chattopadhyay follows the text quite scrupulously, though he adds a couple of characters not strictly integral to the narrative and, most superfluously, a lengthy theatricalized tribute to the Bard. Tagores subtle description of how Sohinis social experiment in her laboratory goes wrong gets across pretty well: Rumki Chattopadhyay gives a strong portrayal of this dominating, opportunistic Punjabi woman devoted to her dead husbands scientific dream, and of her sudden realization that pairing off their daughter, Nila ,with Rebati, the young scientist hand-picked by her, would not work to her advantage because of Nilas hypnotic hold over him.        
	Rebati, the typically Tagorean half-developed male, receives credible treatment from Bhaswar Chattopadhyay, while Phalguni Chattopadhyays experience tells as Rebatis sexist professor who thinks that constant jokes at womens expense endear him to them. Very unfortunately, however, Monalisa Chattopadhyay kills the production by depicting Nila as a villainess in the TV mould, grimacing grotesquely at the audience whenever she has evil on her mind. She should learn that Nila has a more complex personality, but even that may not help her because it seems she just cannot act.        
	The Tagoreans, from London, presented Tagores very first play, Valmiki Pratibha, at ICCRs Tagore Centre, in supposedly traditional style. This meant painted backcloth, extensive foliage chopped from trees to represent the forest, all songs lip-synced to a soundtrack, and smoke machines whenever goddesses entered. Any true Tagorean would understand that this is a bundle of contradictions. Tagore rejected the obsolete Victorian pictorial scenery in his mature productions, so this kind of misguided antiquarianism is pointless. On the other hand, using recorded music and smoke technology made it obviously untraditional. And to desecrate living green branches in the name of artistic dcor showed utter callousness in such ecologically-minded times.        
	The director, Gairika Gupta, protracted the duration to nearly two hours by repeating songs like Rim jhim ghana ghana re without any justification in the original. She split the Vanadevis into a group plus an unwarranted soloist and turned the dacoits into buffoons. As Valmiki, Ananda Gupta affected a sickly saintliness from the beginning, and moved stiffly as if scared of losing his long-hair wig. The only redeeming feature was the little girl, performed with sincerity by Suchismita Ganguli.

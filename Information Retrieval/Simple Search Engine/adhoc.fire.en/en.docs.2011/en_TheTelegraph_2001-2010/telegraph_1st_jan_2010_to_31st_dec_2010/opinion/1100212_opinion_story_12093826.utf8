                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO TALK SHOP                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	In an effort to join the world of nations on the international high table, India broke the shackles that had tied it down and isolated it for decades, opened up the economy, liberalized controls and joined the free market. A shift was beginning to take place and the entrepreneurial spirit of India, which had been repressed for decades, led to a growth trajectory that the country had not seen earlier.        
	Instead of crafting processes and methodologies that made cultural and historical sense, that were organic and devised with sensitivity, we superimposed an alien model that did not connect with the diverse realities of India, one that had sharp edges and was unacceptable to large chunks of the population that were struggling to live a life of dignity.        
	The United States of America, shunned by many Congress dispensations of the past for a variety of reasons ranging from its strident and invasive foreign policy initiatives to its economic policies, was delighted when a coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party was instated at the Centre. The USs long wait to infiltrate Bharat was slowly turning from a distant dream into a pulsating reality. In 2004, pundits in America had predicted a win for their favourite party, the BJP, but it was a Congress-led coalition, with Manmohan Singh at the helm, that came to power.        
	Even then, there was marginal relief because they saw the possibility of an economist, with advisors who had worked with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, being cajoled to accept the US as a hugely important geo-political ally. To cut a long and tedious story short, the nuclear deal happened and the prime minister showed great determination to see it through despite much opposition. He even threatened to resign if his party and government did not back him fully. It was a mission for him and he stood his ground.        
	His second most important mission appears to be peace between India and Pakistan. Sadly, anyone questioning the time and pace of negotiations with that country gets shunted to other posts which makes the exercise appear flimsy. The role of the US in South Asian politics has neither altered course nor matured into something that can generate trust.                
	The real boss        
	A composite dialogue needs to be started with the US, rather than with Pakistan, on Indo-Pak issues. Many questions arise  is Americas influence on the government of Pakistan and its interventions in that country so weak that the worlds most powerful nation cannot ensure the dilution of Inter-Services Intelligences role in the governance of Pakistan?         
	The USs funding of an anarchic and dangerous Pakistan, which is clearly in the hands of undemocratic, non-elected institutions that are involved, intrinsically, with assaults on India is unacceptable to Indians. Hours after the Indian prime minister calls for a resumption of talks, his Pakistani counterpart speaks of the liberation of Kashmir. Yet, America is silent. It seems that the US favours an independent Kashmir as a strategic base to monitor the troubled region. Is this why it chose to ignore such developments?        
	Public opinion is a fundamental ingredient in a functioning democracy, and the Indian prime minister will have a lot of explaining to do on this false dialogue because with every conciliatory move, the ISI-led lot retaliates, and a silent America looks the other way. Therefore, let us first have a conclusive dialogue with Pakistans mother country  the US  and demand assurances from it on our terms. If it cannot play a non-partisan, productive role, it should stop meddling. Why the desperation to talk to Pakistan? Why not accelerate talks with the Maoists? Surely, the governance of India should be at the top of the agenda.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FOR A SECULAR IDENTITY                                  Fifth Column -Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	A recent instance of defiance against the civilian political bosses by the generals of the Turkish army went unnoticed by the media. Turkish army chiefs boycotted an official ceremony at the presidential palace because the presidents wife had worn a headscarf. The army, apparently, had prior knowledge of the dress-code of the first lady who is known to have used the hijab to cover the head and neck since adolescence.        
	Understandably, the boycott came under sharp criticism from the prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose wife, too, wears the headscarf. A separate reception was organized at the same time to give senior army officers an opportunity to avoid the invitation from the head of state. Interestingly, the Republican Peoples Party, the chief secularist Opposition, also declined the presidents invitation to commemorate the creation of a modern, secular Turkey.        
	Now let us visualize the reality in Turkey and the possible consequences of this incident. Despite being one of the founding members of the Organization of Islamic Conference and with a predominantly Muslim population, Turkey does not have an official religion. This happened owing to Kemal Ataturks endeavour to make Turkey a secular nation. However, things appear to be changing after 9/11. Turkeys fiercely secular army has come under intense political pressure from the right-wing forces in the government.        
	The relations between the army and the government soured because of an alleged military plot to overthrow the civilian government. Ties between the military and the government further deteriorated because of the Turkish National Security Councils recommendation in mid-2009 that some of the demands of the Kurdish population be fulfilled. General Ilker Basbug, the former chief of the Turkish army, opposed any change in the constitution that would bestow any right on the Kurdish people and grant general amnesty to the members of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The Turkish military cannot be faulted for its views because the army suffers frequently at the hands of the PKK.                
	Delicate position        
	New Delhis armed forces too can take pride for being avowedly secular. However, such an act of open defiance by the Indian army will be unthinkable. To be fair to the Turkish army, it must be admitted that of late the institution has often found itself at the wrong end of the stick. This need not necessarily bring out the best among professional soldiers. Turkeys army has been a thoroughly professional force. However, if stretched beyond a point and for too long, it is possible that the soldiers may start to retaliate.        
	The provocation of the civilian leaders notwithstanding, some will argue that the Turkish armys defiant posturing has shown it in very poor light. Turkey is far-removed from the Indian mainland. Yet, the incident in that country carries a strong and unambiguous message for India. Indian generals should not allow the army to lose its secular credentials under any circumstance.        
	The Turkish army continues to remain secular too. This is no mean achievement, considering the fact that the country had enjoyed the status of a pan-Islamic nation till the early half of the 20th century. Today, Turkey is a nation state without an official religion. But the Turkey of yesteryear was an empire ruled by the Ottomans. The action of the Turkish army stands out as correct from a moral point of view. But there will be some critics who will continue to argue that the army was wrong in displaying open defiance.

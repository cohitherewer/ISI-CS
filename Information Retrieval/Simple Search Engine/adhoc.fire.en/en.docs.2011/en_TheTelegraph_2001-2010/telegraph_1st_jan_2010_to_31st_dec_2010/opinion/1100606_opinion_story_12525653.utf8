                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Long wait                  
	Sir  For people like Afzal Guru, having to spend years on death row is probably worse than being hanged (Legal delay haze over Afzal plea for death, May 27). A time-bound decision should be ensured in such cases. A maximum of three months should be allowed for arriving at a decision on mercy petitions filed to the president. The delay in the verdict creates emotional turmoil in the convict, apart from diluting the impact of the death sentence as a deterrent for similar crimes.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi
        
	Peace matters  
	Sir  The landmark ruling by the Supreme Court, which ended possibly the longest and the most bitter corporate war in recent times, is bound to impact government policy and business (Ambanis to compete amp; let live, May 24). The verdict has established that national interest should always override individual interest. The court has ruled that the government owns natural resources on behalf of the people, and is empowered to determine their pricing and distribution. Even if the government were to delegate the task of extraction and sale of natural resources to private players, the latter do not have unfettered rights on them as they are subject to constitutional restrictions. It will be a while before the full implication of the apex courts verdict sinks in.                    
	Yours faithfully,        J. Akshay, Secunderabad            
	Sir  The non-compete agreement between the Ambani brothers is likely to be short-lived. It may also create bitterness when Mukesh and Anil Ambani compete with each other in the free market. The shareholders of Reliance companies may suffer as a result of this. The brothers should set aside their differences and develop cordial ties. Otherwise, it is possible that their business empires will crumble in the future.          
	Yours faithfully,        S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi      
	Empty threat          
	Sir  The United States of Americas threat to Pakistan over the issue of terrorism is a damp squib (US delivers blunt message to Pak, May 10). The US is unable to act against Pakistan because of numerous reasons. First, the US will end up as the loser if it alienates its most trusted ally in Asia. Second, the Pentagons lopsided policy of supplying arms to its Islamic allies, who are suspected of being the patrons of State-sponsored terrorism, will create a huge uproar across the globe. The US administration will have to watch helplessly the results of its own misdeeds in the region.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Arun Malankar, Mumbai            
	Sir  It is easy to predict how Pakistan will react to the latest stiff warnings issued by the US. Terrorist groups operating in Pakistan will now lie low for some time. In the meanwhile, Pakistan will be collecting arms and ammunition from America, ostensibly for the purpose of fighting terrorism on its soil. When everything is forgiven and forgotten, these weapons will be passed on to the terrorists so that they can resume their global jihad.          
	Yours faithfully,        Vineet Phadtare, Mumbai                      
	Erratum          
	The editorial, Real is the rational (June 5), mentioned that the last assembly elections in West Bengal were held in 2005. The correct year, however, is 2006. The error is regretted.          
	 The Editor

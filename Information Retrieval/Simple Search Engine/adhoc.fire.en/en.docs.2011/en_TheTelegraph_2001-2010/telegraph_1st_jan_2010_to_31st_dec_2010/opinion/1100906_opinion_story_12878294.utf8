The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the long goodbye
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE LONG GOODBYE                                  SANKAR SEN                              
	The war in Afghanistan seems to be reaching an endgame. To all appearances, General Stanley McChrystals famous surge appears to be petering out. The operations of the Western forces in Mazra and Kandahar have come to a halt. The offensive in Helmand, designed to clear the area of Taliban fighters and hand it over to the Afghan army and police, has not been successful. The latter, trained at considerable expense by Nato troops, have proved inadequate for the task. There is public disenchantment in the West with the war. Canada is all set to pull out its troops. Britain is also focused on a strategy that would allow a face-saving pull-out. In the United States of America, some Democratic senators have shown impatience with the continuing presence and rising casualties of US troops in Afghanistan. The anti-war wing of the Democratic Party fears that Barack Obamas policy risks pushing the US deeper into the bog of Afghanistan.        
	It was assumed that better governance will persuade Afghans to reject the Taliban and help the government of Hamid Karzai to turn the tide against Mullah Omar and other extremist leaders. This goal has not been achieved. Karzai presides over a thoroughly corrupt administration, and by hanging on to power after rigged elections, he has alienated people who are not willing to risk their lives to support him.        
	However, a precipitate US withdrawal from Afghanistan will open a Pandoras box. It would weaken governments in many countries with significant Islamic minorities and provide an additional momentum to jihadi Islam. It would raise questions about the USs ability to execute its proclaimed goals. The US is depending on Pakistan army to find an honourable exit. The latter believes that the balance of power in the region is tilting towards Pakistan for the first time since 9/11. Regardless of calls from some members of Congress for a get-tough approach to Islamabad, there is no alternative to a strong US alliance with Pakistan. The overwhelming majority of supplies vital to the US-led effort in Afghanistan flow through Pakistan. Although the US is now negotiating with Russia and other central Asian republics for new supply routes, these would come at great logistical costs.                
	Old fears        
	Pakistans goal is to gain strategic depth by installing a government in Afghanistan in which the Taliban will be an important component. Pakistan is keen to push India out of Afghanistan, as an alliance between the two is against its interest. Pakistan has used terrorist groups to carry out operations against Indian targets in Afghanistan. So there are problems with any Pakistan-sponsored solution. Pakistan can deal with the Pashtuns and the Taliban, but there are Taziks and Uzbeks who mistrust Islamabad and will fight a government in Kabul which they view as a tool of Pakistan. Other nations with an interest in Afghanistan  like India, Russia and Iran  will not accept agreements sponsored by Pakistan.        
	There is evidence that Pakistan is playing a double game in Afghanistan. Smug in the belief that it knows what is good for the country, the army has continued to run a secretive rogue policy that contravenes international law as well as Pakistans national interest. China, India and Russia would be more threatened than the US by an Afghanistan hospitable to terrorism.        
	Chances of an organized withdrawal are possible only if a settlement is worked out with the consent of the regional powers. For the reconciliation to succeed, it has to overcome opposition from the non-Pashtuns. Compromises may have to be made. Direct elections of provincial governors may be introduced, by which the south is to be handed over to the Taliban and the north to Uzbek, Hazara and Tazik warlords. It will indeed be a strategy of divide and go.

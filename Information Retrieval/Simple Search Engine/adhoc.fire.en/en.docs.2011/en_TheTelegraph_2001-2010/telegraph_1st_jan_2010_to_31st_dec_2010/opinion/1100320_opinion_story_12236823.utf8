	The British political system is full of contradictions. The principal among these is the startling fact that Great Britain is a thriving and robust democracy with a monarch as the head of State. Following from this is the presence of the institution of the House of Lords, which represents the Crown and the nobility. (Such is the power of custom and convention of the House of Lords that peers consider themselves defranchised as they are supposed to stand above the fray and to represent the interests of the Crown.) Over time, and reflecting changes in British society and politics, the House of Lords has refashioned itself. It is certainly no longer the powerful body it used to be before H.H. Asquith reduced its powers by way of a radical dose of reforms in 1911. Despite reforms and refashioning, it has been clear that the House of Lords is living on borrowed time. As an institution it is an anachronism. Tony Blair, when he became prime minister, declared it to be undemocratic and unrepresentative. Not even Mr Blairs critics will disagree with his choice of epithets. One of the steps that Mr Blair took was to replace hereditary peers by appointed officials. Another step was to take the senior judges out of the House of Lords and to rename the highest court the supreme court. And now his successor has announced plans to completely abolish the House of Lords.        
	According to the new reform plans, the existing lords, almost all of whom are appointed, will be replaced by an elected chamber. Those who seek election to this chamber will not belong to any political party and they will be elected on the basis of proportional representation. This chamber will probably be called the senate and one-third of its members will be elected when there is a general election. Obviously, these proposals, when they become reality, will radically alter the way the British political system is configured. It is difficult to object to the proposals put forward by Gordon Browns government even though their timing can provoke a few queries. There cannot be any intellectual justification for an institution that is based on aristocratic privilege.        
	There can, however, be a utilitarian justification. The House of Lords, despite its curtailed powers, has often been a restraining influence on the the House of Commons. Even those who oppose in principle its existence, acknowledge that the House of Lords is often a repository of wisdom, grace and common sense. These are not virtues that can be easily ignored in todays Britain. It is also true that the intellectual level of debates in the House of Lords is inevitably superior to the one that prevails in the Commons. The idea of a Upper House has much to commend it. The abolition of the House of Lords  a part of the project to level British society  should not be carried out for the wrong reasons and in unseemly haste, and certainly not with populist electoral gains in mind.

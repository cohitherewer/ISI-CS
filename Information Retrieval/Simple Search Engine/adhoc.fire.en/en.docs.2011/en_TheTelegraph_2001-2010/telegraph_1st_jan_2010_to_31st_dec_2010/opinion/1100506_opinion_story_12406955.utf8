The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | scrap it out
                      5                                                                                        SCRAP IT OUT                                  Bikash Sinha                              
	Cobalt-60 is one of the most dangerous radioactive menaces that the world has known. Its radioactivity is natural and man, as such, has no control over it. It just goes on radiating gamma rays, some kind of special X-rays, lets say. The highly intense gamma rays cause minor to major damage to human cells. If unprotected, this may lead, in extreme cases, to death, as it indeed happened in Delhi.        
	It being naturally radioactive, man finds easy access to Cobalt-60 and goes on to use it for a whole range of activities, from radiation therapy for cancerous cells to biology to defect studies in material to even radiation damage to materials.        
	Cobalt-60 looses half its strength (half life in technical terms) in 5.6 years. Assuming all the cobalt in Delhi University was installed more than 20 years ago, the original strength must have been quite huge to last at this level of radiation after such a long time.        
	The Delhi incident is not unique. Radiation hazard from Cobalt-60 has been surfacing off and on over the years. In the late 1980s, in the scrap market (again) of Calcutta, an even more intense cobalt source was found. Fortunately, awareness has been heightened over the years  the public is at last sensitive to some extent.        
	The irony is that most people are not aware of the hazards of radioactivity in practical terms. Usually, the source is housed in a box, made of thick lead to shield the radiation. From outside, all one sees is a nice little lead box. Those who sell the box in the scrap market usually sell it for the price of lead, not for the source. They are least bothered about the source once the material reaches scrap level.         
	They ignore regulations for two reasons. Our own Atomic Energy Regulatory Board cannot regulate the whole of India unless the source persons alert them. Second, the AERB does not have the jurisdiction on all and every body.                
	Dumping ground        
	The scrap dealers are interested in the lead and not concerned about radioactivity. So when they tear apart the lead box for sale, radiation from the source has a field day. The gamma rays, now let loose, do their job nicely, causing avoidable radiation-induced hazards.         
	To my mind, the great tragedy of the cobalt menace lies in the area of cancer therapy. The radiation from cobalt is not especially focused. When it is used to radiate out the cancerous cells, the radiation, at the same time, burns the good cells of the body, obviously not a very good scenario. I have been advocating the scraping of cobalt units for the electron linear accelerator or Linac. I have had a difficult time installing Linac in one of the cancer centres I have been associated with. I am sorry to say that even the much-flaunted Bhabhatron of the department of atomic energy still uses the cobalt unit.        
	Electron Linac, for this purpose, is relatively easy to build and can be switched off whenever one likes. An Electron Linac produces radiation from the accelerating electrons and the electrons are accelerated in the Linac in a linear direction.         
	Indian industry can easily take up the challenge of manufacturing both the low-powered Linac, doing all the jobs that a Delhi-type cobalt unit does and even more, as well as a slightly high-powered Linac for cancer therapy. No amount of legislation can do away with the cobalt menace. It has to be scrapped altogether and replaced with Linac . It may be difficult in the beginning, as it was with lead-free fuel for transport. But then the idea will take root, as with lead-free fuel, now recognized as environment friendly despite the initial hue and cry.        
	Over the years, India has become the dumping ground of cobalt from the rest of the world. That is precisely the reason for easy access and low cost. The West has gone the linear way a long time ago. India should not receive scrap from the West in the form of cobalt units, but follow the linear path.

THE ARTFUL POSE (Mapin, with Dr Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum and The Alkazi Collection of Photography, Rs 1,200) is the catalogue accompanying the exhibition of Early Studio Photography in Mumbai c. 1855-1940 organized earlier this year in Mumbai. The fascinating documentation of castes and tribes by British officials is interspersed with vintage studio photography by pioneers such as S. Hormusji and Shapoor N. Bhedwar. Left shows the grandsons of Begum Sultan Jahan of Bhopal. Top Right is an experimental portrait by Bhedwar called A Page from Shelley. Below it is an albumen print by Chunni Lal Bhawani Ram showing hijras. The essays by Partha Mitter (on the history of studio photography), Akshaya Tankha (ethnographic photography), Suryanandini Sinha (women in Bombay studios) and Rahaab Allana (on Bhedwar) add value to the book.

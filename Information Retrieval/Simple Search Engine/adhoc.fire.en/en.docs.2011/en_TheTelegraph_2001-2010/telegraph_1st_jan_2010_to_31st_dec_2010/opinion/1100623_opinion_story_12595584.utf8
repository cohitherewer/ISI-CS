Kumara Swamy                          Not civil: O. Ravi (centre), an IAS officer arrested recently on charges of corruption                                  
	If you thought the Indian bureaucracy was plagued by inefficiency, corruption and non-accountability, take heart. A new bill, the Civil Services Performance Standards and Accountability Bill, proposes a set of reforms that will hopefully usher in a bureaucracy that is not only more independent, but also responsive to the needs of citizens.         
	The bill, which has been in the works for almost three years, aims to make the bureaucracy professional, neutral, merit-based and accountable. It will codify the rules of conduct and regulate the appointment and conditions of service of public servants. A draft bill will soon be presented to the Union cabinet before it is tabled in Parliament. According to cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar, the bill is being prepared by the ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions.         
	At present, the ethical norms for civil servants are enumerated as conduct rules in the Central Services (Conduct) Rules under Article 309 of the Constitution. Some rules are also contained in provisions of other laws. However, most of these are in the form of generalities such as maintaining integrity and absolute devotion to duty and not indulging in activities unbecoming of a government servant.         
	A salient feature of the draft bill is the establishment of a Central Public Services Authority (CPSA) that would act as an interface between the government and the bureaucracy. The CPSA would consist of three to five members of eminence in public life with enough experience to deal with problems related to public policy and management.         
	The body would be in charge of transfer and promotion of bureaucrats and also formulate a public services code of ethics. Those found in breach of the code would be eligible to punishments ranging from fines to demotion to even dismissal.        
	Advocates of the bill believe that setting up a body like the CPSA would help reduce political interference in the bureaucracy. We are under constant pressure from politicians, and we have been asking the central government to let us function according to the rules without fear or favour. Hard workers should be rewarded and the laggard and the corrupt punished. I hope the new law will do just that, says an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer serving in Kerala, who did not wish to be named.        
	Adds M.N. Buch, an IAS officer who quit the service in 1984 and is at present the chairman, National Centre for Human Settlement and Environment, Bhopal, A public servant can function without fear or favour as long as he is on the right side of the law. But not everybody can do it for fear of annoying the political masters. So a central authority will help. According to Buch, honest civil servants are often sidelined by their political bosses. Politicians want pliant officers who can do the dirty work for them. They promote these mediocre people while shunting out strong and independent-minded officers, he says.         
	In 1983 the L.K. Jha Commission on Economic and Administrative Reforms concluded, What we have in our system is essentially accountability for error and wrong doing, and not for non-achievement or inefficiency. But that will change if the new law is implemented, says an official of the department of personnel and training. With the CPSA being set up, all the best practices will be put in place and erring civil servants will be pulled up. The body will be the governments eyes and ears, says the official.         
	However, Buch points out that the bill should have included interlocking accountability where the bureaucracys chain of command can be hauled up for any wrongdoing by a junior officer. This will result in fast decisions and efficient officers will come to the fore, he says.         
	The bill also attempts to promote efficiency by overhauling the appraisal system of bureaucrats.         
	A performance management system aimed at putting merit, performance and integrity above all else is being proposed. The current system of annual confidential report (ACR) has been found to be ineffective and more often than not, upright officers find their ACRs tinkered with by politicians and their cronies in the bureaucracy. Even the second Administrative Reforms Commission had questioned the system where senior officers write the ACRs of large numbers of employees, some of whom they may not even know personally!               
	The government is apparently looking to replicate the performance appraisal system adopted by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Under this, the assessment takes into account over 15 desirable attributes, each of which carries 10 points. The employee does a self-grading which is appraised by a superior. The final appraisal is done by the management.         
	The bill is also significant in that it links the appraisal of civil servants to the tasks and goals of the organisation. If this is implemented, officers will be on their toes as they will be forced to look back on their performance vis a vis their goals and justify their failures, says a serving IAS officer.         
	Promotions based on seniority alone are also likely to be done away with. Putting seniority above everything is the biggest disincentive for honest and hardworking officers. Only efficiency and achievement of goals should matter, says Buch.         
	However, though the bill lays down stringent rules for civil servants, it also has provisions to protect them from harassment when the officers act in good faith. No suit, prosecution or other legal proceedings shall lie against any person for anything done in good faith or intended to be done under this act or any rule made under this act, says a previous draft of the law, which, according to a source, has been retained in the new bill.         
	But not everybody is excited about the bill. The law may be well-intentioned, but it will be only cosmetic as what we need is a radical shake up of the bureaucracy rather than mere patchwork, says Jayaprakash Narayan of the Hyderabad-based Loksatta Party, formerly a civil society initiative in the field of governance reforms.         
	According to Narayan, instead of shifting them from department to department, civil servants should be made to specialise in particular fields. The government should also bring in talent from the private sector. More and more private citizens should be brought into the bureaucracy to shake up the system. The only thing that should matter is competence, he says.        
	Narayans suggestions may not materialise just yet. But if the draft bill is implemented, it will go a long way in reforming the civil services and making civil servants more accountable to the public they are supposed to serve.

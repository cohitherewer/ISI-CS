The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Preparing for Obama
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PREPARING FOR OBAMA                          - How can both India and the US bring something to the table?

	Barack Obama will come visiting in November this year. No American president has been to India in his first term in office, so the trip assumes somewhat greater significance. But symbolism alone will not suffice. Both sides will be keen to deliver on substance as well. A steady stream of American officials and influentials has started to arrive in preparation for the visit, starting with the American national security advisor, General Jim Jones. What can we expect from Obama? What should India want out of the visit and what can it give?        
	The central message of American visitors has been that the Obama administration sees the visit as an opportunity to affirm and deepen the strategic partnership. The administration is well aware that Indians regard the relationship as having gone off the boil ever since the new president came to office. The Obama team is keen to change that view. In doing so, it will be careful not to suggest that the United States of America and India are moving towards an alliance aimed at anyone or that the two countries agree on everything.        
	Certainly, there will be no attempt to cuddle up to India by criticizing either China or Pakistan. To do the former would be impolitic for both the US and India. As for the latter, the US needs Pakistan too much with regard to Afghanistan to risk any hard statements on that countrys behaviour. So it is clear that Obama will not emulate the forthright words of the British prime minister, David Cameron, on Pakistans support of terrorism.              
	What we can expect is for the American president to use the term, strategic partnership, a lot, essentially to signify a deep engagement with India across the entire realm of relations. Looked at from a historical point of view, this is not surprising. India and the US, even in the worst years of the Cold War, were deeply involved with each other across a number of sectors  military, diplomatic, economic, cultural, scientific, educational. It is in this sense that the India-US relationship can truly be called a strategic partnership. The US has invested in a huge effort, in essence, to build capacity and resilience in India. George W. Bushs stated goal in dealing with India was to contribute to its rise as a great power. The Obama administration will want to underline that interest when the president arrives in November.        
	When he speaks publicly, New Delhi will be hoping that the president will find a way to say that Indias unity and territorial integrity are vital to the US. At a time when Indian unity is threatened from within in Kashmir and in some of the northeastern states, this would be a powerful message. It would be a message not only for separatist groups, but will also be heard loud and clear in Islamabad and Beijing. Pakistans army has, for many years, been dedicated to the disuniting of India, partly to pay India back for the separation of East Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh in 1971. The USs affirmation of Indian unity and territorial integrity will have implications for the future of Kashmir. China also, over the years, has fomented separatism in India. It does not do so now in any significant way, but it does hold claim to large swathes of Indian territory. The US, over the past two years, has held back from saying much about the India-China dispute. It has conspicuously not taken sides. A statement on Indias territorial integrity will be an indirect message on the conflict between Asias two giants.        
	While India-US relations quite properly range over a number of areas and sectors, a strategic partnership cannot ignore strategic matters in the narrower sense. There are all kinds of strategic issues on which the two sides could work together  alternative energy and space technologies, other high- technologies (computer software and hardware, biotechnology, materials), non-proliferation and missile defence, to name just a few.         
	However, there are at least two big and more immediate items of interest. The first is, of course, Indias quest for a permanent seat in the United Nations security council. There are those in India who are sceptical about the utility of a permanent seat and think it will bring more trouble than good, but it is fairly clear that having a place at the high table matters to the Indian middle class, that in the competition in Africa and Latin America with China it would help, and that it would increase Indias diplomatic confidence in a general, all-round sense. New Delhi will certainly be hoping that if strategic partnership means anything, it means much stronger US support for Indias permanent seat. We should expect Obama to come up with a formulation that will signal a firming up of Washingtons stance.        
	The second crucial strategic issue is US arms sales to India. The fact is that after 60 years of Independence, India does not produce any major weapon systems except missiles and nuclear bombs. It, therefore, will continue to need foreign systems in plenty. The door has opened for big US arms sales, but problems persist on both sides: the US remains suspicious of Indias willingness to honour an end-user agreement; and India worries that the US is an unreliable supplier. In addition, there is the tortuous Indian procurement procedure. To the extent, however, that the problems are in Washington, New Delhi will be looking for a message from Obama to the effect that delays and doubts will be dealt with and that there will be an easing of export controls.              
	A partnership implies that both sides have a sense of being equal participants in negotiating their engagement. It also implies that both sides bring something to the table. What can India bring to the table? Primarily, India will be expected to deliver on things economic, which are about the only things it can deliver. The most vital material gain from a relationship with India is access to its market. During a possible double-dip recession in the US, increasing market access assumes special importance. Far beyond the nuclear liability bill, which, as passed, will probably attract few, if any, foreign investors, is the USs interest in the liberalization of trade, a tougher approach to intellectual property rights, the opening up of retailing, and a friendlier investment regime. In all probability, India cannot do anything dramatic here  that is the nature of its domestic politics. Washington will understand this. After all, it too cannot deliver immediately in terms of Indias UN ambitions and the sale, licensing, or co-production of armaments. But there must be signs that India will move perceptibly in areas of US economic concern if the partnership is to be balanced and is to bloom.        
	The Obama visit will not be iconic. Indians admire Obama and will receive him with warmth, but they will be looking at the package he leaves behind. If there are no gaffes on either side, and if they can reach a solid, meaningful set of agreements in areas of concern for both countries, the visit will come to be regarded as a major success.

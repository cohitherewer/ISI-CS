	The rescue is often not the happy ending of a trafficked girls story. It is, rather, the beginning of a more difficult and baffling chapter. Yasmin Khatun (name changed), a 16-year-old girl from a village in Bengal, seems to have been saved from a life of sexual exploitation and violence in Delhi largely through the courageousness her stepmother. But has this woman got her stepdaughter back? Do restoration and rehabilitation naturally follow rescue? If not, why not? Yasmin appears to be unwilling to go back to her family and village. Why? She has made allegations of sexual violence against her father. But her rescuers and counsellors cannot take her word for it at face value. She is also afraid of being ostracized by the community she will be returning to, some of whose members may even have colluded with her traffickers.         
	In a sense, these are realities of victimhood that are easier to fathom, although by no means to deal with. What is more unfathomable is the rescued person appearing to prefer the life of a sex worker to being sent back to her family or to a government home. Usually, the rescuers inability to comprehend such a choice arises out of their unfamiliarity with the actual experience of poverty. In what circumstances can a life of what appears to be sexual indignity and danger to most people be preferable to the other options available to the victim? That the material comforts a regular and sizeable income brings could put in place, and render relatively acceptable, the things one has to do to earn that income is perhaps beyond the pale of a certain kind of respectable and well-intentioned imagination and morality. This also explains the inspectors surprise when Yasmin asked for a napkin when given dinner. Besides, she is still a child in the eyes of the law. This makes it impossible for the State to endorse her choice of where and how she was going to live now. But can the material, the legal and the moral be kept apart in an absolute way while deciding what the best option is for her?

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CAUGHT IN THE NET                                  Neha Sahay                              
	A successful criminal lawyer from Beijing was convicted last month of falsifying evidence in an unusual case that has stirred up lawyers. The complainant against Li Zhuang was his own client, the gangster, Gong Gangmo, of Chongqing.        
	An industrialized, massive provincial municipality (like Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin), run directly by the Centre, Chongqing is currently the centre of attention for an anti-corruption drive launched over the last six months by the local party chief. The drive has seen many heavyweights, including the deputy police chief, arrested and sentenced, after a long public trial where they were paraded in handcuffs. Outside the court stood hundreds of people, many of them with photographic evidence of brutal murders of their family members by powerful party bosses and builders, killings that the police had refused to investigate.        
	Naturally, the residents are thrilled with Lis conviction. But lawyers wonder what the conviction may mean for a legal system not particularly known for its independence from the executive.Gong Gangmo turned against his lawyer after a series of meetings with him where, he alleged, the lawyer told him to lie to the court, to say that the police had tortured him to extract a confession, and that he was threatened to pay up to his partners in crime. His wife was instructed to produce proof that he was a good citizen. His gang partners were instructed to transfer the ownership rights of his nightclub to someone else. Another policeman-turned-lawyer hired for the case was asked to produce witnesses to the alleged torture. His lawyer told him he would ask for medical examination of his injuries due to the alleged torture, and if the court refused, would stage a walkout. Gong would then insist that he would not take any other lawyer. This would delay the trial. Finally, he was asked to say I dont know to all queries about his crimes. Lawyer Li boasted to him that his gangster clients had never got the death penalty.                
	Bitter truth        
	All this, of course, came for a fee. By the end of the consultations, the gangster had paid his lawyer 2,450,000 yuan, with a promise of 30 million when he finally escaped the death penalty. So what made the gangster turn against his lawyer?         
	In an interview to China Youth Daily, Gong said he was afraid that all these lies would rebound on him if he was found out. Also, the lawyer made him sign many blank power-of-attorney sheets, and that made him suspicious that the man would usurp his money. Finally, he hoped that by turning him in he would get a lighter sentence.        
	In an exclusive interview given before his trial, Li said, Everything I did was within the framework of the duties, rights and obligations under the Law regarding Lawyers. I raised both hands for the campaign against organized crime. But crime-fighting must not destroy procedural justice. I am willing to exchange my freedom for a small step towards building the rule of law in China.        
	Lis trial was held on December 30 last. It lasted 30 hours. Li pleaded innocence, and said that he never met his client without the presence of policemen  which is against the rules. However, Gong said Li would convey what he wanted with gestures and winks. After Lis arrest, 20 lawyers wrote to the countrys top law-making body to complain about the way China Youth Daily had branded Li a liar and published a totally one-sided story fed by the police. They demanded that Li be tried outside Chongqing.         
	After the trial and conviction, lawyers say that few of them would venture to defend gangsters, and those who do, wont try very hard. Now thats probably what the authorities wanted.

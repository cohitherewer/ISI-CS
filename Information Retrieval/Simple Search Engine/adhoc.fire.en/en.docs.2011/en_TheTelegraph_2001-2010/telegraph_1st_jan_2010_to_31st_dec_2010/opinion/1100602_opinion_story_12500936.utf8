	Deadly act                  
	Sir  The alleged attack by Maoists that resulted in the loss of at least 150 lives in the tragedy involving the Howrah-Kurla Jnaneswari Express needs to be condemned by one and all (80 die as derailment triggers crash, suspicion on Maoists, May 29). It is unfortunate that the railways minister, Mamata Banerjee, was extremely casual in her approach to the whole situation during her visit to the accident site. In her statement after the disaster, she cited a bomb-blast as a possible reason for the mishap without checking the facts properly. This has, once again, exposed her political immaturity, which she has exhibited a number of times in the past as well. It is unthinkable that Banerjee and her party have opted to shun all contact and cooperation with the present Left Front dispensation, which is a legitimately elected government.          
	It is imperative that the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and the railways minister sit together and discuss the security aspects of running night trains through Maoist-infested regions. The suggestion of cancelling all night trains in these specific areas is absurd, to say the least. In a democratic set-up, not all government employees or officials working together can belong to the same political party. But that should not be the cause for pointless boycotts and refusals to attend important meetings on issues involving public safety and development. Hopefully, Banerjee will learn from her mistakes and take proper care of the railways by devoting quality time to the ministry under her care.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Terror seems to have become a part of the lives of the common people living in the Naxal belt of eastern India. The Maoists have targeted the common people yet again in order to have their voices heard. The various attacks in the past, as well as the most recent one on the Jnaneswari Express, clearly show that the Maoists can go to any extent in order to make their point. But it is still not clear what these people actually want, what their demands are, and what it is that they are fighting for. The home minister is constantly holding meetings with the chief ministers of Naxal-affected states to redress the problem. He has even asked these groups to lay down arms and put forward their charter of demands.          
	The Maoists may have their own reasons for what they do. But it cannot be denied that they are using heinous methods to attain their objectives. They have managed to instil fear in the hearts of the ordinary people. Their activities have sullied the image and weakened the structure of our nation state. Moreover, India cannot expect to fight terrorism at the international level unless it is able to eradicate terror from within its borders.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Ayon Sarkar, Jamshedpur

                
	Sir  With reference to the mud-slinging between political parties in the face of a mishap as gruesome as the one involving the Jnaneswari Express, what is really amusing is the fact that some politicians are insisting that Mamata Banerjee should resign from her post as the railways minister. If this is considered honourable in the aftermath of such disasters, then it logically follows that chief ministers of all states affected by Maoist atrocities should resign as well. At times like these, instead of laying the blame on one or more individuals, leaders of all political parties should come together out of respect for those who were killed in accident.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Annapurna Sanyal, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The Maoist attack on the Jnaneswari Express in the wee hours of the morning last Friday will make it easier for the State to justify its retaliation against the rebels with renewed vigour. In that event, the Gandhians with guns, as the Maoists have been described by the Booker-prize-winning author and activist, Arundhati Roy, may soon realize that violence is counter-productive. Like the massacres in the past, this carnage too is not about the poor and the downtrodden registering their protest; it is about some people demonstrating their ability to replace the Indian State with a Pol Pot-like regime under which it is possible to strike anywhere and at any time with deadly accuracy and devastating consequences. Whether we like it or not, this is a war that has to be fought and won, irrespective of the collateral damage. Any self-doubt will lead to a further loss of innocent lives and make the State look pathetically powerless.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
J. Akshobhya, Mysore

                
	Sir  The recent ghastly rail accident that led to the loss of many lives on the Jnaneswari Express stresses the fact that the Maoist uprising in this part of the country has surpassed all possible limits of tolerance. The rebels, after feasting on members of the security forces and political affiliates for quite some time, have now started snuffing out the lives of ordinary people. This is no rebellion; this is war and needs to be dealt with firmly.           
	The ongoing blame game between the top two parties of West Bengal will encourage the Maoists to continue with their devious agenda. The statements made by the police after the incident also reveal the defensive mindset of the security forces. But given the circumstances, an aggressive attitude is the need of the hour. Such a strategy will also assure the people of their well being and collective safety.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kisholoy Roy, Calcutta

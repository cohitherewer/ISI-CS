	There is no denying that there was an extra edge in the voice of the Pakistan prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, when he recently warned Robert Gates, the secretary of defence of the United States of America, that Mr Gilanis government could not prevent another 26/11 on Indian soil. Mr Gilani was reacting to Mr Gatess assertion in New Delhi that India was unlikely to show restraint if another terror attack emanated from Pakistan. Pakistans response to any attempt, whether international or Indian, to make it own up to its responsibilities has been growing noticeably shriller. Mr Gilani has taken this note several notches higher by announcing that Pakistan could not be expected to guarantee that tragedies of the scale of Mumbai would not revisit India when it could not prevent terror attacks on its own soil. This sabre-rattling  which invariably draws unqualified adulation in Pakistan  would have covered Mr Gilani with glory had he not paired it with the admission of an enormous failure of governance. Mr Gilanis words may be taken to mean that a government which has failed its people cannot be trusted with the job of ensuring peace in the region. This is a matter of shame that no government would have worn as a badge of honour. Unfortunately, in Pakistan, the exception is the norm.        
	If Mr Gilani cared to look beyond the brownie points that his jingoism scores for him, he would have perhaps noticed that the reason terror attacks may go on, within and without Pakistan, is his governments obduracy in refusing to follow the pointers which the Mumbai attack has revealed. The event and its aftermath have repeatedly shown up the links between terror organizations  such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba, the Jaish-e-Mohammad and the Sipah-e-Sahaba among others  operating as a syndicate as also the links between these and the Pakistan establishment. Yet the Pakistan government has acted against only a few of these that it sees as going against national interests (mostly on its northwestern frontier) and steadfastly refused to clamp down on those which are believed to further Pakistans strategic advantage. Despite the many dossiers from India, Gilanis government is yet to throw the LeT kingpin, Hafiz Saeed, behind bars and has repeatedly hindered the trial of the other terror suspects. To prevent terror, Mr Gilani needs to recover his will to act, and not merely his voice.

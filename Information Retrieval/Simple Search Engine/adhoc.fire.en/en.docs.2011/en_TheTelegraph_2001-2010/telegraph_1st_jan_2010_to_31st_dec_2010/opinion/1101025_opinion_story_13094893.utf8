	The worlds financial power structure is changing; if evidence is needed, it is there in the names of the places where the financially powerful meet these days. In the past, they would have got together in Washington and London, Pittsburgh and Paris; today they meet in Gyeongju and carry on their conversation in Qingdao. They fly around in captive jets; but if anyone wants to follow them, he would need to buy an expensive atlas, and learn enough Chinese and Korean to follow airport announcements. They also have no difficulty in talking to one another since they fly around with captive interpreters; and they have been arguing volubly about who is responsible and who is guilty.        
	The primary fight is between the Americans and the Chinese. Timothy Geithner, the treasury secretary of the United States of America, has been urging the Chinese to stop keeping the renminbi down; Wang Qishan, the Chinese vice-prime minister, no doubt accuses the US of keeping the dollar down by running a huge deficit and flooding the markets with dollars. As others may watch the fight, they must be worried, for the big countries tricks to keep their currencies down push up other countries currencies. Britain has decided to find a solution at home by reducing its fiscal deficit and deflating its economy. That may improve its balance of payments, but will do nothing to make the pound more competitive, and it will certainly push up unemployment. Not every country is so altruistic; many countries will be tempted to try out policies to depreciate their currencies. That is going to be the talking point of international negotiations in the coming months  how to prevent competitive devaluations.        
	Country negotiators will have no difficulty in agreeing on the principle; but they will find it difficult to define what self-control measures they must take. In particular, if a country is suffering from deficient demand and high unemployment, stimulation by means of fiscal deficits is the recommended remedy. That such a stimulus also tends to worsen the balance of payments and depreciate the currency is an added benefit  and is likely to be resented by other countries for that reason. So what they would have to negotiate is international controls on national stimuli; they would have to work out common rules about how much stimulus is justified, and the limit beyond which it becomes a predatory tactic. Some countries will be reined in by fear of national bankruptcy. Not many nations will want to take the risk of being the next Iceland or Greece; and even if they were tempted, they will not find saviours in other countries as readily as those two did. So any rules countries may agree on will be modified by expediency and opportunity. The only thing that is certain is that the world economy will be in a chaotic state for some time to come.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the fine art of survival
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE FINE ART OF SURVIVAL                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The scene enacted in Parliament from the recent drama, Lalit Modi ko gussa kyun ata hai, was hilarious. You had the corrupt calling the corrupt, corrupt! It was amazing to hear them blatantly call for honesty, having led the corruption brigade for decades, looting whatever came their way. Then the finance minister stood up and announced that no defaulter would go unpunished under any circumstances. Hypothetical question: if a member of a party that is a coalition partner is implicated, will the ruling party be willing to sacrifice the government, making way for integrity and honesty? Or will it use the information to conveniently blackmail the partner every now and then?        
	Consensus and carrying a disparate team through a diverse political jungle with many constraints can be defined and manipulated in various ways. But somewhere, probity must take precedence and prevail over all other compulsions, even those of retaining power. That is what highlights the sharp difference between opportunism and good governance. Will all the other named or benami men in cabinet and in the council of ministers who have stakes, not only in cricket leagues but in other businesses that have recently been taken off the fast-track clearance list, be eased out? An Opposition that was in complete disarray till recently, has managed to discredit the ruling party in some measure, even though players in their dispensations are equally guilty of similar shenanigans. Because they are not in power, they remain protected for a while.        
	The ruling party and its United Progressive Alliance government are complacent, arrogant, insecure and divided. All these adjectives that describe them are contrary and these extraordinary contradictions need deft handling. The Congress is split down the centre with the Congressias on one side and the Congressmen on the other. The traditional Congressias, leading the revolt within, against their colleagues holding office, know well that if they do not assert themselves now, they will lose their place in the sun.                
	Faultlines        
	The Congress seems comfortable wallowing in supreme indecisiveness that has permitted corruption to enter the processes of governance. To protect itself and its inmates from exposure, it has closed ranks, nurtured chamchas, disallowed differing opinions within party forums, and for all practical purposes created a court, where favoured courtiers have spoken, on behalf of their rulers, half-truths to create an intricate web of confusion. This has made the worst amongst them indispensable. New members who are uninitiated novices in this court, are watched by wily, seasoned operators. The vulnerable are ensnared with promises of protection from the law and upward mobility regardless of competence.        
	The Congressias are well practiced in the art of mouthing the politically correct rhetoric we have heard for decades, but alas, without much result on the ground. They will abuse the powers that be and virtually in the same breath, genuflect when in their presence. The hypocrisy is palpable, a trait of the survivor. They have learned well how to talk for the poor and have delivered little. They have mastered the art of being opaque. They have protected the unacceptable, feigning innocence when confronted with corruption, and failed to comply with the law.        
	Pretending that their internal opposition represents the voice of the future dispensation, these aging politicians will do anything to grab a share of the pie. They are unable to reach out to their opponents in the structure and therefore indulge in loose talk. If both Congress factions take the discourse towards a consensus that puts India above all else, India will, in turn, salute the party in power.

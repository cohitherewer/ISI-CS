The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | lessons from the past
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LESSONS FROM THE PAST                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	The forthcoming assembly elections in Bihar could well turn out to be the most important in the state. This is the first time, almost since Independence, that development has emerged as a major issue. It remains to be seen how the people respond. Will they acknowledge the fact that after many years they have seen a government that is actually trying to improve their lot? Or will they stick to caste equations and ignore all other considerations? If the former is the case, Bihar may well claim to be the first state in what is known as the cow belt that decided to break all shackles and come forward.        
	But caste will remain a factor when Bihar goes to the polls. Over time, it has come to be an identifying force not just in north India but also in the south. But in the southern states, caste is not the only consideration; people look beyond it as well. In Bihar, so far, they have not much to look forward to. Things were made worse by the V.P. Singh government at the Centre that brought the Mandal Commission recommendations out of the mothballs, thereby further deepening the caste divide. Lalu Prasad thrived on it for well over a decade. In the last five years, Nitish Kumar has shown that life is just not about gathering under caste banners. This he has shown through his administration, not by raising slogans against the caste system, which, in any case, he could not have done. The message may well have reached the Biharis, particularly the younger generation. If it hasnt, Bihar will only have itself to blame for continuing with a mindset associated with feudalism.        
	Politicians, of course, find it difficult to change themselves. A common feature of any pre-election scenario in Bihar is people changing sides for personal gain, and that is happening this time as well. Two prominent upper-caste members of the Janata Dal (United) have ditched the chief minister, and speculation is on whether this means that they have read the writing on the wall.                
	Uneven equations        
	Actually, it may well turn out that the two have made a mistake. Whatever the numerical strength of the Lalu Prasad-Ram Vilas Paswan combine, it does not present the picture of a viable alternative, and the average voter must be aware of this. There is a lot of talk about how Nitish Kumar had gained five years ago because the two had fallen out. In politics, however, two and two do not always make four: the coming together of Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan does not automatically imply bad news for Nitish Kumar. Especially, since in the last Lok Sabha polls, voters had turned away from both.        
	More important, what have the two got to offer against what the Nitish Kumar government has already given Bihar  namely, a measure of peace and accountability on the part of the administration? Anyone who has lived in Bihar will agree that such gifts cannot be dismissed as mere baubles. Also, public memory may be short, but not so short as to make people forget that the same Ram Vilas Paswan who is now projecting Lalu Prasad as our chief minister had only the other day been at loggerheads with him. Paswan had been a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, and is now eyeing the Congress. So much for unity and principled politics. As for the Congress, it is seeking to project a clean image with assistance from the likes of Sadhu Yadav and Pappu Yadav. Sadhu had to be disowned by Lalu after tremendous pressure from within his party, and Pappu is an accused in the Ajit Sarkar murder case.        
	All this, of course, will be kept in mind when Bihar goes to the polls. But Nitish Kumar will be much happier if people also keep in mind what they have experienced in the last five years. In any other state, that experience may not have been much to write home about, but not so in Bihar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Where theres a will, theres always a way
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHERE THERES A WILL, THERES ALWAYS A WAY                                  DARK HABITS      There is only one solution to Calcuttas traffic problem                                                  
	The chaotic traffic situation in Calcutta needs a closer look to be understood. In old pictures of European cities, one sees chaos, with citizens thronging the streets. However, with the advent of fast-moving vehicular traffic, order seems to prevail all over Europe, the United States of America, Japan, Singapore and Australia. One does come across the occasional jaywalker or a motor-driver gone berserk, but matters are soon taken care of. What holds India  and particularly Calcutta  back? One hears that the standards of traffic safety in Delhi, especially after the Commonwealth Games, have gone up. It is to be seen if they will remain so.        
	When I was in school, World War II was raging. At that time, Indian behaviour meant a free-for-all at ticket counters, shops and bus stations. We were bemused by posters displaying the virtues of queuing. Over the months, we noticed a transformation as patient queues began forming. The most noticeable ones were at the ration shops. Soon, the habit spread.        
	About 50 years ago, before Singapore became the epitome of disciplined living, I was put up there at a guest house a few miles from the city. The road from the city was a dual carriageway throughout. There was a gap in the carriageway when driving back. It was about ten yards up but opposite the factory gate; the next gap was a mile away. Every night, as we returned late, our driver never once cut across to the right but did the entire mile and back. We now take pride in our Golden Quadrilateral highways which are wonderful to drive on, but one has to be careful about vehicles often coming at a high speed from the opposite side, down a wrong lane. As a frequent traveller, I notice this happening most often on the Burdwan bypass, within city limits.        
	It is amusing to observe important road junctions during the various drives and weeks we love to organize from time to time, supposedly to raise public awareness of road safety. The Park Street-Chowringhee corner at busy office hours has a posse of police officers with ropes holding back pedestrians from crossing the road when they are not supposed to. Yet, one also finds jaywalkers sauntering in or making diagonal crossings. When pointed out, a police officer replied, They simply wont listen!        
	We can bring order into our streets if we ruthlessly penalize offenders. If Delhi can do it, so can we. If we can brook oppositions from trade unions supporting errant taxi- and autorickshaw-drivers, can we not make a beginning with jaywalkers as well? The queuing system is a good reminder that people will behave reasonably if necessary coercion is used.        
	Yet, the police are improving every year when it comes to managing the city during the Durga Puja. There is advance preparation, citizens are briefed, necessary security arrangements made and punitive actions taken. Why can this dedication and efficiency not be replicated everyday?                          ARABINDA RAY

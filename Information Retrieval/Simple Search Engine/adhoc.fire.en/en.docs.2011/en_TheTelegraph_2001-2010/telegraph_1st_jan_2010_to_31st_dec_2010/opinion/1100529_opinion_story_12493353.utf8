	This is the basic idea behind Gallery Sanskritis exhibition, Nature Revisited (April 21-June 1). The individual approach of various artists to nature is what enriches the exhibition, and raises it above a politically correct green show. Technology advancing by leaps and bounds has turned nature into man-made objects as in Anjum Singhs aluminium flowering trees, Rajan Krishnans paintings of metallic trees and Jagannath Pandas rather garish endangered species composed of brocade with floral motifs. Marie Antoinette as a shepherdess would sure have appreciated this.        
	Forms from nature inspired Debnath Basu to create the phantasmagoric images of trees for his khwabnama series with graphite powder on paper. The grey images with hints of glitter stress the elusiveness of his exquisite drawings. The arboreal form turns into a menacing mushroom cloud in one double-edged image. Death haunts Tapas Biswass intricately-crafted bronze sculpture of a leafy arbour. But skulls notwithstanding, symbols of regeneration appear on top of this structure that is as complex as a filigree.        
	References to Gandhi and commercialization in a private gallery  any private gallery  may make a viewer feel uncomfortable. Neither gallerists nor artists hold exhibitions for the unalloyed love of art alone. Manisha Parekh was researching Gandhian philosophy when she conceptualized these forms of jute that echo natural forms. This misgiving apart, these are beautiful forms made of the golden fibre, which is fraught with resonances for West Bengal. They are displayed against a backdrop of rust that highlights the natural lustre of jute.         
	From afar, K.S. Radhakrishnans sculpture (picture) resembles Hokusais The Great Wave off Kanagawa if it were composed of stick insects. From close quarters it turns out to be a sea of humanity. This ambivalence and the perfect poise with which the gravity-defying figurines are frozen make this one of Radhakrishnans most arresting works. Ambivalence is also the hallmark of Adip Duttas forms crafted with steel and copper threads. The serpentine coils of steel wool and the cocoon of copper threads trigger off a thread of associations. Death and pain leave their mark on Mithu Sens watercolours, which recall illustrations in childrens books.         
	The original concept of the exhibition reaches its logical conclusion in Jayashree Chakravartys larger paper works crawling with the drawings of parasites that are as alluring as they are destructive. It works fine, but Chakravartys earlier paperwork and her large canvases with their illusion of shifting images were superlative works. Yet, this is a rare exhibition where the agenda holds the key to the show.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        KNOT NOW, BABY                                  The current law to prevent child marriage needs more teeth if India is to root out the evil practice, argues V. Kumara Swamy                          Dolls house: The vice of child marriage continues to afflict India                                   
	Even as world leaders and activists gather at the United Nations, in New York, to examine the progress on the Millennium Development Goals, one of the things that is bound to be discussed is the huge problem of child marriages around the world. The practice is widely prevalent in India as well. And activists are calling upon the government to revisit a law that it passed in 2006, which was aimed at preventing child marriages, but, in effect, did little to put an end to the practice.         
	One of the features of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006, which replaced the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, is that it makes such marriages void if either one of the parties seeks an annulment in a court of law. Section 3 of the PCMA states that child marriages shall be voidable at the option of the contracting party who was a child at the time of the marriage.         
	It also lays down that this can be done within two years of the child attaining majority.         
	Significantly, though, the PCMA, does not make a marriage invalid if one of the parties, or both, is underage        
	Since the law states that the marriageable age of girls is 18 and that of boys is 21, a girl can seek an annulment uptil 20 years of age and a boy can do the same till the age of 23.         
	Activists feel that this provision has been inimical to tackling the problem of child marriages in India. First of all, most child marriages occur because parents force their children into them. Surely, it is a little too much to expect either one of the couple to approach the courts to get their marriages annulled. Besides, by the time they attain adulthood and approach the courts, they could have had children, whose future could be in jeopardy in case of an annulment, says Kirti Singh, senior advocate, Supreme Court.         
	Several court judgements have refused to annul marriages of girls who were barely into their teens when they got married. The PCMA is at best a law that is aimed at preventing child marriages. But once the marriage occurs, even the courts are helpless and one cannot blame them for their judgements, says Singh.        
	According to experts, the law is also in violation of Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that makes it a crime to have a sexual relationship with a child under 15 years of age. Child is defined as any person below the age of 18 in the Indian Majority Act and The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000. Yet, strangely, the age of consent for sexual intercourse for a girl is 16.        
	The National Commission for Women (NCW) recently stated that it is in favour of making both the marriageable age and age of consent for girls the same. Others say that any marriage that takes place below the legal age of marriage should be declared invalid. Any marriage below 18 for girls should be strictly declared as illegal, says Bharti Ali, founder and co-director, Haq Centre for Child Rights, Delhi.        
	But Girija Vyas, chairperson of the NCW, sees a problem if a marriage below the age of 18 is made void under the law. Many girls, who could be days or weeks away from turning 18, elope and marry and they could be in trouble because of this change. We should look for a more nuanced approach, says Vyas.        
	Data from the National Crime Research Bureau show that only 99, 96 and 104 cases of child marriages were registered in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. But experts believe that the actual figures are many times more. In fact, the National Family Health Survey (2005-2006) indicates that nearly 47.4 per cent of women aged 20-24 were married by the time they were 18.        
	The main argument against child marriage is of course the fact that it is particularly harmful for the physical and psychological health of underage brides. When girl children are married off, the chances of them facing sexual violence are much higher compared to that in normal marriages. This can have a psychological impact throughout their lives. Their reproductive health is also seriously compromised, says K.G. Santhya, associate, Population Council, Delhi. Santhya conducts research on adolescent girls reproductive and sexual health.              
	Activists are now suggesting that the government should go ahead and make the law against child marriage more stringent and also adhere to international conventions that it has signed. For instance, the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women, which India has ratified, specifies, among other things, that the age of marriage for both men and women should be 18.        
	Having different marriageable ages for girls and boys is a very patriarchal rule. Internationally, the age for both men and women is set at 18, and I dont see any reason we should not have the same system, says Ali. Even the NCW had pleaded for a similar change in a petition before the Supreme Court in 2006.        
	The compulsory registration of marriages is considered to be another antidote against child marriages. But though the Supreme Court made this mandatory in 2008, the government has as yet been unable to implement it on the ground.         
	In April 2010, a consultative committee of Parliament attached to the ministry of women and child development admitted that the law enforcement machinery was lax in implementing the legal provisions related to curbing the practice of child marriage in our country. Moreover an internal report of the ministry of women and child development says that child marriages are a social phenomenon which cannot be tackled by legislative interventions alone. There is a simultaneous need to step up awareness by undertaking drives highlighting the evil effects of this practice.        
	Agrees Vyas. There are problems with the law, but amendment alone will not solve the problem. We should spread awareness about the dangers of child marriage, she says.        
	Experts say that the government should now seriously look at some of the suggestions regarding child marriage made by the Law Commission in its 205th report in 2008. Besides advocating that all child marriages below 16 years of age be made void, it also suggested that those marriages of children between the ages of 16 and 18 be made voidable at the option of one of the parties. The commission had also suggested that the definition of child should be a person who has not completed 18 years of age.        
	The commission also laid down that both boys and girls should have the same legally marriageable age. The age of marriage for both boys and girls should be 18 years as there is no scientific reason why it should be different, it said.        
	Clearly, if India is serious about putting a stop to child marriages, it has to resolve the contradictions in the law and take stringent steps to implement the legal provisions aimed at rooting out this egregious practice.

	Some situations turn celebrations into warnings. July 11, World Population Day, celebrated first in 1987 when the worlds population touched five billion, cannot cheer any Indian who knows that he belongs to a population of 116.1 crore. By 2026, at the present rate of population growth, 371 million more Indians will be sharing the resources India has at present. This is one area in which India can overtake China  in becoming the most populous country in the world. It is a sad irony, for the Indian government has been evolving one policy after another to check population growth since Independence. After its efforts hit a bad spot with the controversial sterilization programme in the 1970s, the efforts picked up again in the following decades, shifting the focus from just family planning to a national population policy. There has been a decline in the rate of increase since, although the addition each year in absolute numbers is still staggering. Only half the states are expected to meet the millennium goal of two children for one mother by 2015.        
	Indias situation is distinctly peculiar. In developed countries where the population growth rate has stabilized, such as Japan, the population is greying rapidly while fertility rates are low. In comparison, India seems happier. A country poised to become an economic power can rejoice in its huge young workforce. But that large workforce would need to sustain itself on rapidly depleting resources. Even though fertility rates have declined to an average of 2.68  that is, three children to one mother (in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh that number is still four)  older people are living longer, exactly as in the rest of the world. It is as if India stands between two opposing forces, one pulling it back while the other pushes it into the league of developed nations.        
	That the efforts of so many years have not had the desired effect suggests that the policymakers have been missing certain things. To look at one of these, it is only recently that there has been acknowledgment of the fact that womens empowerment may have something to do with birth rates. It is not just that population growth has been checked in areas where women are literate or educated  although that is the first big step. Two related hurdles are minor marriage and dowry. Girls should mature mentally and physically before they become mothers, and they must feel empowered enough to decide how many children they want. They must also be more confident in their gender, and not feel worthless till they produce a son. This cannot happen unless dowry is completely eliminated, as the preference for sons is both economic and social. The womans empowerment would also mean, of course, her access to healthcare and nutrition, which would bring down mother and child mortality rates  still one of the worst in the world. New policies are slowly taking these into account, but nothing can happen by magic. And nothing would work unless the men are educated too.

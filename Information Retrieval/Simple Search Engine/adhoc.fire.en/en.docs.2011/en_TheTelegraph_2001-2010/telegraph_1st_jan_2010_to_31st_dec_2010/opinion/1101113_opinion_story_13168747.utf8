	Whats in a game?                  
	Sir  One cannot really understand the hoopla over the game show at IIT Roorkee (Lipstick game glare on IIT, Oct 30). The students of the Indian Institute of Technology are not imbeciles. The game was played among consenting adults, who are intelligent enough to understand the effect of their actions. It was, moreover, played for pure fun and was not meant for the public. As for the sadhus, one hears that every year some people become ascetics after failing to crack the joint entrance examination. One wonders if the agitating sadhus were some of these.           
	Yours faithfully,         Tapan Pal, Batanagar 
        
	Flop show          
	Sir  Ashok Mitras Rich and falling behind (Nov 5), is an incisive look into the gradual weakening of the economy of the United States of America because of the liberalization drive it has supported in a host of nations to make full use of the ensuing benefits. But the unhindered economic growth in these nations, particularly in an Asian giant like China as also in a resurgent India, has inconvenienced the US severely. There is now a whopping trade gap between the US and China. Mitra attributes the US economic crisis to inflexible factors such as high wages, a high standard of living, lack of skilled labour, a deficient education system and the reluctance to combat economic recession with hard corrective measures.           
	Mitra compares the dismal scenario in the US with the economic buoyancy of China. He shows how Chinas wage structure, 15 times lower than that of the US, has unsettled US plans to cash in on economic growth elsewhere. The East now has unbeatable advantages such as cheap skilled labour and technical proficiency. The US, which is trying to convince China to further appreciate its currency, has to think differently in order to reduce its trade deficit. It must implement bold measures to put its shaky economy back on the right track.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Total mess          
	Sir  Although I fully agree with the argument of the editorial, Hell gate (Nov 9), I cannot understand how passengers can be blamed for the inhuman lack of concern among the airport authorities. Passengers at the airport just want to reach their destinations on time. It would be too much trouble if they miss their flights trying to help other passengers. Besides, who is going to listen to them when total chaos reigns at the airport? Politicians are fully responsible for this state of affairs in Calcutta.           
	Yours faithfully,       
H.K. Sinha, Howrah 

                
	Sir  All airports need to be upgraded every five to ten years, if not regularly. The infrastructure of the Calcutta airport was created in the early 1970s. Since then, nothing major has been done to improve the infrastructure other than some renovations and the addition of a few terminals. Labour unions led by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions earn a livelihood at the expense of helpless passengers. At every opportunity, the Citu lets loose its cadre to block development projects.           
	Filthy toilets and bad services have combined to make a mess of the Calcutta airport. The state government, the Airports Authority of India, and the civil aviation ministry should wake up to this fact. Calcutta is not only a megapolis but also the business hub of eastern India. Its airport must be big, efficient and have direct air connectivity with global cities for the benefit of eastern and north-eastern India.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Tushar Kumar, New Delhi

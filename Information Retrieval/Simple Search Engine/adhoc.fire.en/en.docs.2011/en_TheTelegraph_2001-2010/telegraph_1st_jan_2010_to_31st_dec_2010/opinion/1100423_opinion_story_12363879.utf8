	WAR AND PEACE IN MODERN INDIA: A STRATEGIC HISTORY OF THE NEHRU YEARS   By Srinath Raghavan, 
  Permanent Black, Rs 750  
	Srinath Raghavan has written an important book on a much-neglected subject. In most accounts of Jawaharlal Nehrus years as prime minister, his foreign policy is seen as a reflection of his grand vision or it is seen through the prism of the Sino-Indian conflict of 1962 and the military disaster this entailed. Raghavan avoids both these approaches and tries to locate Nehrus strategic thinking in terms of how he managed the crises that his government faced in Junagadh, in Hyderabad, and in Kashmir in the immediate aftermath of Independence; in Bengal in 1950 following the refugee influx; and the border dispute with China in Ladakh and the Northeast.  
	In all these episodes of Indias contemporary history, Nehru was forced to think about the use of force  how much of it to use, when to use it, and how to match it with the use of diplomacy. During the Nehru years, India never went into a full-scale war but on a few occasions was on the brink of it, what the author calls a twilight zone between peace and war.        
	Underlying the analysis in the book are two intellectual positions. One concerns the notion of strategy. According to the author, strategy is the use of available military means to achieve desired political ends. This definition somewhat narrows the concept of strategy by tying it down in the last instance to available military means. It is possible to think of uses of strategy where the use of military means is not a factor. Such situations can be thought of in the exercise of foreign policy. The Indo-US nuclear deal, which involved an enormous amount of strategic thinking on both sides, comes readily to mind. Raghavan categorizes strategy into consensual, controlling and coercive. In most of the episodes discussed in this book it was the coercive element that came into play since they involved the threat of force or limited use of it to influence the opponents choices.        
	The other assumption is more debatable. It is the authors views that an analysis of strategy  in this case, foreign policy  should be based on an attempt to understand the choices open to the principal actors. He wants to cut out hindsight and tries to think inside out. Thus, he tries to reconstruct how Nehru thought when faced with a given situation. This somewhat diminishes the historians task. Analysis is always post facto  Minervas owl, as Hegel said, flies only after dusk. To believe that it is possible to retrieve all the inputs and thoughts that contributed to the making of an individuals choices in real time is to believe in the impossible. The past, even the recent past, is, by definition, never fully retrievable. Thus the historian is always forced to fill in gaps either through his imagination or through logical thinking. This is why history writing is a creative and an ongoing process. Once it is accepted that Raghavan or any other scholar has been able to retrieve and place in context all the factors that influenced Nehrus decisions regarding a given problem, then analysis would come to a full stop. There is thus a problem embedded in Raghavans assumption or even attempt.        
	These reservations apart, this book is thoroughly researched and extremely lucidly written. The writer, at times, stays too close to Nehru, but this is understandable given the nature of his project.        
	There is much that is completely new in Raghavans presentation and analysis. For one thing, I cannot recall anyone pointing out before how close India and Pakistan had come to an armed encounter in 1950 during the refugee crisis in Bengal. The situation was also internally volatile because the persecution of Hindus in East Pakistan had produced the inevitable backlash in West Bengal and elsewhere. Nehru was apprehensive that if sectarian violence was not stopped, India would be veering towards catastrophe. He was also under considerable pressure to take action against Pakistan. Such was the pressure, that in March 1950, Nehru exploded thus: Cabinet or no cabinet. So long as I am the prime minister, I will carry on my policy  it will be my policy. I may consult them, but the policy will be mine. Nehru was against war but this did not stop him, as Raghavan documents, from mobilizing the Indian armed forces from the beginning of March 1950. He believed that it was this show of force  the coercive strategy  that made Liaquat Ali accept a pact by which both governments would provide complete equality of citizenship and a full sense of security to minorities. India or Nehru won the round but would it be an exaggeration to suggest, in the light of subsequent history, that victory in terms of strategy was no more than a Pyrrhic one?        
	The remarkable failure of the coercive strategy occurred, of course, with China where the forward policy from the end of 1961 to counter Chinese moves along the border completely backfired and proved to be a military disaster. Raghavan pulls no punches in his analysis of this episode.        
	It is a pity that Raghavans definition of strategy, laced as it is with the military, precludes an analysis of Nehrus handling of such issues as the Suez Crisis or the Soviet invasion of Hungary where his vision of non-alignment was called to the test and perhaps found wanting.        
	This book is a major contribution to the making of contemporary India. Raghavan deserves our gratitude for making us think on issues that are often taken for granted.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Forgotten icons                  
	Sir  On July 29, 1911, Mohun Bagan Athletic Club  comprising 11 young, barefoot, Bengali footballers  defeated East Yorkshire Regiment to lift the IFA Shield. The victory is considered to be a milestone in the history of both Indian sport and the nationalist movement as it goaded Indians to fight for independence from the British. Sadly, the centenary celebrations of this memorable event has been a relatively quiet affair. Shibdas Bhaduris team definitely deserves better recognition.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Rajdeep Deb, Serampore, Hooghly
        
	Blame game          
	Sir  Abhijit Bhattacharyya seems to be far removed from the truth about Indian politics (Points to ponder, July 28). Isnt Bhattacharyya aware that New Delhi has handed over its foreign policy decisions to Washington ever since the United Progressive Alliance came to power?          
	Bhattacharyya wants President Barack Obama to look into the pending issues related to the Bhopal gas tragedy. But the Indian State seems to be only interested in increasing the compensation, that too by opening its own purse strings. One must also remember its dubious role in ensuring Warren Andersons safe return to America and in meting out token punishment to Indian managers working in Union Carbide. The draft of the nuclear liability bill has also come under pressure from Uncle Sam. We are awaiting another Chernobyl  this time in India.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Abhijit Bhattacharyyas unhappiness with the American president is evident from the following passage: If Obama can get angry with BP for an oil spill that has not caused a single death and manage to extract $20 billion in one week, why should he not help the strategic partner of Washington DC? The fact is that Obama did not seek help from the British government after the accident. Neither did he blame the British prime minister for the oil spill. So why should Indians point an accusing finger at the American president, especially when the failure to punish the errant American company is entirely their own? It is common sense that companies operating in a particular country are governed by its own laws. An American president cannot be blamed for a misdeed committed by a US company in India. The matter rests entirely between the foreign company and the home country.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

                          
	Beauty returns          
	Sir  It is really exciting to learn that the cheetah may make a comeback to India (Wait for cheetah with three sites, July 29). India should keep in mind the importance of species such as the cheetah and undertake measures to protect it in a better manner. The cheetahs return will surely boost the countrys tourism prospects and enthuse conservationists and nature lovers. But at the same time, the authorities should manage the national parks properly and be vigilant against the threat posed by poachers. Heres hoping for a better and brighter Indian jungle, which is set to get back such a beautiful creature.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Moumita Roy, Calcutta                        
	Erratum          
	Bubul Boses name was inadvertently spelt as Bulbul Bose in Talk shop (July 28). The error is regretted.          
	 The Editor

	One of the areas of taxation that the direct tax code tries to rationalize is tax exemption for deserving causes. As it explains, a reformulation is necessary because the current method of taxation lacks clarity, efficiency and equity. The code proposes 15 conditions an institution must satisfy to obtain special treatment; qualifying institutions would be required to pay 15 per cent on the sum of their profits and capital gains. The code writers begin with confusion; some of the conditions are qualifying, others administrative, and still others unnecessary. For instance, they begin with the condition that qualifying institutions must be established for the benefit of the general public. Then they state that institutions must not be run for any caste; the first condition implies that, and there is no reason to spell it out. The elaboration raised the question whether an institution could be run for the benefit of any religious group. Religious institutions, which enjoy complete exemption just now, were agitated, and under their pressure, the new paper clarifies that they would continue to be exempt from tax. Thereby it creates a new inequity: why should religious institutions be exempt and non-religious institutions that are in the same activities be taxed? Why does the government want to create a bias in favour of religious institutions? Indians would have thought they lived in a secular country. As if this were not enough, the government intends to empower itself to exempt non-religious institutions altogether  to make them holy, so to speak. This is the height of arbitrariness.        
	Apart from being taxed, the non-religious organizations will be subject to a number of vexatious restrictions. It is absurd that they should have to follow cash accounting. This primitive system of accounting went out of use long ago, after double entry made it possible to keep track of assets and liabilities. The only institution that does not use it is the government. That is because it is too lazy to change over; there is no reason why it must force its antiquated ways on non-profit organizations.         
	The restrictions on carry-forward are equally irrational. The government proposes to tax the income of non-profit organizations; what then is the need to limit their freedom to carry forward that taxed income to future years? Having decided to tax them, the government thought it would do non-profit organizations a favour by providing for a minimum exemption limit. A limit makes sense in the case of personal taxpayers  it takes millions of them out of the clutches of the tax department. But in the case of non-profit organizations, it will only lead to their proliferation, as it will make it profitable to keep them below the exemption limit. The government must give up the distinction between religious and non-religious charities, and those it taxes should be given the same freedom of operation as commercial firms.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In two boats
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN TWO BOATS                                                    
	Can straddling two boats be a clever mode of progress? In India, everything is possible, and there is certainty about what the two-boats-mode can actually achieve. It can leave observers guessing as to the direction of the movement  backwards, forwards, sideways or floating becalmed. In Kerala, the Indian Union Muslim League has evolved guidelines for women candidates contesting the local body elections that include a dress code according to Islamic norms. The IUML calls itself secular  which has nothing to do with imposing religious discipline on women. Evading the word, burqa, takes nothing away from the message, especially when combined with strictures to the female candidates regarding self-control while interacting with men and preserving decorum during election meetings. The secular party reportedly tried to swap the 50 per cent seats reserved for women with other parties for general ones  and failed. But it feels the need to ensure that its women candidates follow religious orders and do nothing to harm the family set-up by entering politics.         
	Evidently, the government has involuntarily enforced the double-boat mode. Without the mandatory 50 per cent quota for women in local bodies, it is doubtful how many political parties, purportedly secular or no, would have made space for women candidates. For behind the strictures lies the desire to keep women in control, and not allow them to step out of their family set-ups if it can be helped. That state is normal: the women candidates in the IUML have been asked to behave like normal Muslim women. This party had religion to hand; it is less smooth for parties whose names and principles exclude religion. In this instance a government regulation has helped point the way along the thorny path of democracy and equality. But the backwash of inequality, in gender and culture, is still too strong for a single boat to carry all forward. The IUML in Kerala has merely made that obvious.

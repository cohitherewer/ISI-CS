The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | When boundaries dissolve
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHEN BOUNDARIES DISSOLVE                                                                        
	ONE AMAZING THING																														 By Chitra Banerjee   Divakaruni, 
  Hamish Hamilton, Rs 450
    
	Nine people trapped in an Indian visa office after an earthquake. All from different places, they wait under the rubble, faced with death. One of the characters, Uma, a literature student of Indian origin, had come armed with a copy of Geoffrey Chaucers The Canterbury Tales. Like Chaucers pilgrims, the characters must tell their stories to pass the time. In her latest novel, One Amazing Thing, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni evokes the redemptive power of storytelling. There are no spices, no arranged marriages, mystical powers and other exotic paraphernalia that Divakaruni seems to be so fond of. On the whole, despite an apologetic nudge at karma, Gandhi and the Taj Mahal, she tells the story straight, no chaser.  
	There is, however, multiculturalism  lots of it. Divakaruni mentions in an interview that she sees herself as a listener, a facilitator, a connector to people. In this novel, she evidently takes the art of dissolving boundaries very seriously. A visa office offers a conveniently plausible space in which to collect people from diverse backgrounds; there are four people of Indian origin, two of Chinese, a white American couple and a black American man. Uma, perhaps reminiscent of a younger Divakaruni, steps in as facilitator when she asks people to share one amazing thing that has happened to them.         
	What results is a crush of stories. In her anxiety to depict a variety of cultures, Divakaruni borders on a kind of tokenism. The Muslim youth who grew up in America has, of course, become a religious fundamentalist spewing wrath at the American establishment. The Chinese own a large grocery store and the middle-aged white couple pop pills as their marriage falls apart. In a bid for political correctness, the black man with a violent past is transformed into a messiah-like figure. Divakaruni may be in danger of replacing one set of clichs with another. Jiang, the old Chinese woman who left Calcutta when the Sino-Indian war of 1962 broke out, has a fascinating story to tell. One is curious to know more about it, yet the structure of the novel does not allow Divakaruni the space to develop the thread.        
	There is an attempt to emphasize the act of storytelling, partly through inflections of the narrative voice. The story of the cold, middle-aged accountant, Mr Pritchett, is told in third person. There had been a nakedness about Mr Pritchetts story, we are told. Malathi, a Tamil woman who works at the visa office, commands Mr Mangalam, a co-worker and compatriot, to translate her story, warning him not to change her words. At times, the authenticity wears thin as voices get tangled up in authorial commentary. It is hard to imagine, for instance, a headstrong Chinese teenager observing dispassionately, My parents thought my metamorphosis from charming caterpillar to stinging wasp came from teenage angst combined with evil American influences, but they were wrong. The two Tamil immigrants are almost reduced to caricature, redolent of hair oil and a lively fear of damnation. Uma, on the other hand, who has grown up in America and studies literature, is privileged with a more mature, introspective voice.        
	In most cases, the one amazing thing that each character finds to recount turns out to be, quite frankly, a damp squib. Frustrated relationships and failures fall rather short of being life-affirming, as the blurb had promised. Telling tales in such a complex and cataclysmic world may be a darker project than Chaucers pilgrims could ever have imagined. The Wife of Bath and her companions share a common history, a sense of community. Divakarunis characters, who come from different cultures and societies, suffer from a crisis of identity that stems from the very dissolution of boundaries. Like the earthquake that has brought them together, deep and painful fissures remain. The notion that stories could heal such a world comes across as a piece of wishful thinking.                          IPSITA CHAKRAVARTY

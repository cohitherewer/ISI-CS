                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE MINORITY QUESTION                                                                  
	More than 150 Muslims were killed in the Jos region of Nigeria in January this year, leading to fresh riots, killing hundreds more in the following months. The remains of almost 100 unidentified Kurdish children, victims of the Anfal genocide, were exhumed and given a proper burial in the town of Chamchamal, Iraq, in April. Official statistics suggest 117 Uzbeks were killed in one of the bloodiest incidents of ethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan. Nearly 100 Ahmadis were killed in what has been called one of the the deadliest pogroms in the history of Pakistan.        
	Rhetoric from the past five decades is packed with condemnation of the chameleon policies of superpowers supporting corrupt governments and condoning abuse and persecution of ethno-religious minorities in friendly nations. The more useful you are, the less likely they are to air bomb you or feign indifference. As citations in Lokman Mehos book on the Kurdish question in American foreign policy says, When Saddam rolled over the Kuwaitis, the world shivered with horror and dispatched half a million troops. The Kurds dont control any oil, so when Saddam gassed them, nobody paid much attention. In the Saddam-free and US-occupied Iraq, though, the dictator is convicted for crimes against humanity and the Kurds emerge as indirect benefactors hailing Americans as their liberators. The States accountability to the United States of America has become a factor in the position of minorities in many countries, including Pakistan.        
	Nationalists and conspiracy theorists in Pakistan draw up images of the guillotine if the country were to disappoint the US in the war on terror. In an interview with CBS, Hillary Clintons recent assertion of very severe consequences, had Faisal Shahzads Time Square bombing attempt been successful or if any successful attack were to be traced back, was more than just ominous  it was an ultimatum. A high-level diplomatic source is supposed to have said that if something were to go wrong in this scenario, momentum could shift and public opinion in the States could demand more action. With the USs list of expectations increasing manifold, Pakistan is finding itself in a damned if we do, damned if we dont situation. The US, on the other hand, is desperately trying to change its perception on the ground. By providing humanitarian and social relief, it hopes to lessen the appeal of the Taliban-inspired anti-West attitudes amongst both the masses and the literate class. They are finding the tirades on jihad and condemnation of Western policies coming from new-age media clerics and their pop-star brand ambassadors difficult to ignore. The US is also assessing the possibility of using rather than fearing the moderate mullah and his madrasa to spread a more acceptable version of Islam. On Hamid Karzais visit to the US, President Barack Obama, in their joint public address on regional issues, spoke of Pakistans growing recognition that they have a cancer in their midst; the extremist organizations... now threaten Pakistans sovereignty. With distrust increasing between the provincial and religious parties, with drone-wary Pashtuns, with Baluch activists declaring Pakistan a terrorist State, and ethnic rivalries being endlessly played out on Karachi streets, it seems Pakistan is indeed in the terminal stages of its disease.        
	The case for religious minorities is a glaring human rights issue because of the lack of political consideration it receives. Second-class citizens in the land they call home, and with a widely accepted bias choking them, the Ahmadis, Christians and Hindus struggle to retain some semblance of their traditions and beliefs. Nonetheless, the token permissiveness of the government is shown through the celebration of Bahuchara Mata at Hindu temples in Karachi and ubiquitous Christmas decorations and jingles that adorn shopping malls, fill radio airtime and television screens come December, portraying how progressive and liberal Pakistan is. But where are the Ahmadis in all this? The invisible minority that Pakistanis do not want to acknowledge  who decides the fate of these persecuted few million? Is the government choosing to look the other way as mullahs continue to unleash fatwas against Ahmadis on TV channels, reaffirming their status as wajib-ul-qatl even after the bloody massacre? Once again, so-called democratic governments show the folly of their perceptions regarding the impact of their silence. The world is watching closely, and with the US entrenched deeply in Pakistans social and ethno-religious problems, the day of reckoning is near.        
	In the past, the death toll of minorities remained low enough for the government to avoid sustained international pressure to take action. In the wake of May 28, attacks on Ahmadis and the coincidental re-emergence of Pakistan-trained jihadis attempting attacks on American soil, the scenario has changed. Particularly in the aftermath of the findings in the Waldman report issued by the London School of Economics, suggesting that close ties continue between Pakistans intelligentsia and both the Haqqani network and Quetta Shura, and more importantly, that there are personal assurances from the president of Pakistan to the Taliban militia. The only hope remains in the answer to the question: how soon will the US demand proof of de-Islamization in Pakistan, thus indirectly benefiting the minorities? The report may be dismissed as slanderous, but it is nonetheless raising a few eyebrows in Washington and Pakistan. Safeguarding the rights and lives of the Ahmadis is certainly not on top of the governments priorities, but satisfying the USs concerns is.        
	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts that human rights are universal and inalienable, preceding State authority. As Pakistan has continually avoided committing itself to the declaration, maybe its time that the US nudged its ephemeral friend to take not cosmetic actions against its cancer but viable and enduring ones. Pakistan is accepting help from the forces that freed Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Americans, motivated primarily by self-defence, are there to do the needful, ideally without the same kind of collateral damage. At least, Pakistan will not be condemned to spread religious terrorism, which is tearing apart communities in Nigeria and Gaza, neither of which, it seems, has enough of what it takes to warrant international intervention. Pakistan does not have oil, but it does have the jihad-touting Taliban.                          ZAINAB MAHMOOD

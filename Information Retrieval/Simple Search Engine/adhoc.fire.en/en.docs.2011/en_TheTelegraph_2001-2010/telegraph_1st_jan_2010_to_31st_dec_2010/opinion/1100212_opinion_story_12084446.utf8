	Minority report                  
	Sir  Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees decisions are becoming increasingly absurd. He has been following in the footsteps of his predecessor, whose policies were quite reckless as well. As a member of todays youth, it is my opinion that the decision to implement an additional 10 per cent quota for economically, socially and educationally backward Muslims in the OBC category is one of the worst ever made by the chief minister (OBC quota for Muslims, Feb 9). Our state has an abysmal education system. The employment rate is not very high either. Bhattacharjee must concentrate on these aspects if he wants to ensure that jobs go to meritorious people. As we all know, previous decisions pertaining to Bengals education have generally been disastrous, the worst being the move to eradicate English from primary schools.          
	It is evident that a rapid change is taking place at present. In the elections to student bodies in colleges, the popularity of the student wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has been badly hit. A total of 45 per cent reservation in the state leaves candidates from the general category with very little room to prosper. Reservation should be considered irrelevant in todays world. If the state government wants development, it must improve the standard of education and increase employment opportunities.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The high court in Andhra Pradesh vetoed a law that guaranteed 4 per cent reservation for some Muslim groups in jobs and education. But the Bengal government decided to implement a 10 per cent quota for the community in the state. To a seasoned political observer, the announcement will not come as a surprise, considering the rapid decline in the electoral fortunes of the CPI(M). This latest measure is nothing but a desperate attempt by the party to wean away the traditional Muslim voters from the Congress and the Trinamul Congress, in a bid to preserve its rapidly crumbling bastion of over three decades.          
	 Yours faithfully,             Arun Malankar, Mumbai                      
	Sir  Politicians exploit issues such as caste, language, region and religion to deflect attention from problems like poverty, unemployment and the disenfranchisement of the poor. It should be noted that for most poor people, proper healthcare is a distant dream, although they frequently fall ill because of the lack of nutritious food and from drinking polluted water. Politicians like the Thackerays provoke regional sentiments. Others such as Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati fight for the interests of their respective communities. Still others dwell on minority issues. Reservations and quotas are expected to draw votes. Political parties will always try to increase their vote banks in order to ensure that their strongholds remain intact even during acute economic crises or natural calamities like droughts.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Agartala                    
	Sir  The West Bengal government has played a dirty political trick by announcing reservations for minorities in government jobs in keeping with the findings of the Ranganath Mishra commission. Significantly, no other minority community apart from Muslims will benefit from the new measure that has been proposed.          
	The reasons behind the provision are political, and therefore dangerous. Reservation cannot be provided on the basis of religion. The desire to appoint people from weaker sections, Muslim or otherwise, is perfectly understandable. For this purpose, we need to provide proper education from the grass root level. Government jobs in West Bengal should be kept free of reservation on the basis of religious identities.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad                       
	Sir  West Bengal announced 10 per cent reservation in state government jobs for economically, socially and educationally backward Muslims. According to the Supreme Court verdict, there is supposed to be 27 per cent reservation for OBCs. West Bengal, however, has only implemented a seven per cent quota. As a result, a large section of the states OBC population has been neglected. This is unfair to people who need affirmative action in order to foster socio-economic growth. One of the recommendations of the Mishra commission report was the recognition of Dalit Muslims. The Bengal government has ignored this. One fears that its latest decision will meet the same fate as the proposal for a four per cent quota for Muslims in Andhra Pradesh.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Samim Ahmed, Calcutta

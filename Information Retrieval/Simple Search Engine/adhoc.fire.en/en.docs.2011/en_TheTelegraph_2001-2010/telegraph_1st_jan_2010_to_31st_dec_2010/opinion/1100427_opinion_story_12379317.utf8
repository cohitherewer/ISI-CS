                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LIVE NOT IN FEAR                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Watching the sordid shenanigans of the closed-door club, the prestigious and politically powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India/Indian Premier League, it is crystal clear that our political bosses are not in the least bit concerned about Bharat or charged up by the possibility of changing the face of this emerging economic power by ensuring that the delivery mechanisms of progress are redefined and modified to make civil society a living truth. Instead, they are desperate to make money, money and more money, and partake of sleaze that seems to be their definition of an upwardly mobile good life. The deterioration of administrative calibre from what it was in the 1950s to what it has become today has been phenomenal. Personal agendas, family uplift, wheeling and dealing for friends seem to be the motivating factor for a majority of the members of parliament, legislative assemblies, and legislative councils. The same debilitating disease has permeated through the ruling classes, and people are nauseated by all this. They are delighted with the unravelling of this veil of insular, exclusive governance.        
	Ironically, it is only the mother-son duo, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, who stand out in this ocean of opportunism, in sharp contrast to their colleagues, with a selfless and calibrated design for giving India a lease of life, a revival of sorts, and are relentlessly working to ensure that some basic changes happen. Most politicians do not want to revisit the horrors they left behind when they moved to greener pastures in state capitals and New Delhi. They are neither driven by an ambition to rectify the situation on the ground nor by the challenge of leadership. They have one agenda  to grab at the shrinking pie at all cost even if it means breaking the law and raping the land. Every day dawns with this breed of Indians shaming us with some uncouth act unworthy of mention. Decent men and women in public life infused with a sense of purpose, integrity and dignity, are few and far between. From the manner in which they conduct themselves, be it in their interaction with the public or opposing colleagues, to the way they live and aspire, they have become a series of caricatures mocking civilized behaviour.                
	Speak easy        
	With the mindless obsession over the IPL, and now phone-tapping, television channels have forgotten all else  from the spouting ash to the killing fields of Naxal India  which only goes to prove how irrelevant TV programmes can be. Thank heavens for the newspapers and the diversity. On the issue of phone tapping  it is one of the many tools of rajniti where before the advent of telephones and tapping machines there were trained human eavesdroppers who carried information, usually intrigue and private nuggets, to the king. We all know that intelligence bodies, surveillance departments, spies and sleuths, tapping and bugging, all intrude upon personal domains and breach privacy. My simple question is why do honest serving men and women get all hyper if their conversations are revealed? Surely those in public office, allegedly being tapped, are honourable individuals doing only that which is legitimate? Leaders, political and civil, should not, in any circumstances, be indulging in activities that they are ashamed of, and must courageously stand by their conviction relayed in spoken or written word.        
	If Sharad Pawar has had conversations with Lalit Modi, he should be confident that the dialogue was kosher and there is nothing he has said that goes against the law. The same goes for Digvijay Singh. Surely, stalwart public figures should not be deterred by phone-tapping and carry on doing what they profess they believe in, be inclusive and transparent, fight for their beliefs, and change the narrative of our times?

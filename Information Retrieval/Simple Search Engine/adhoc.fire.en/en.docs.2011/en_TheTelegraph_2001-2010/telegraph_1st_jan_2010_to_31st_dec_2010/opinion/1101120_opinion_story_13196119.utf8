                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OUR BOREDOMS, THEIR BOREDOMS                                  VISUAL ARTS: Aveek Sen                                                  
	Four contemporary artists are brought together in a tightly curated show called Where am I? at the Experimenter gallery (until December 4). The title asks a precise, seemingly mundane question, but one that could shoot off in different directions if you started thinking about it. All four artists are youngish and from Germany, and the gallery is small. For the curator, Barbara J. Scheuermann, these are an advantage, ensuring sharpness of focus. But the compactness of the show also feels like a limitation, reducing the range and variety of each artists work to just one or two pieces. So the exhibition is served up a bit like aeroplane food  neat, hygienic, cold and too quickly digested. There is a somewhat sparse assortment of vaguely interesting samplers, but they dont add up to enough to get the mind really going. And the stirring of the mind is important, since the appeal of all four artists is primarily cerebral  though conceptually, what we get here is standard Kunstverein stuff.        
	This is the overall effect of the show, also brought about by a certain flatness of lighting, perhaps to match the self-consciously deadpan tone of most of the works. This deadpan, typographic quality has become fairly predictable in the school of photography, originally from Dsseldorf, that has emanated from the classic work of Bernd and Hilla Becher, represented here by Sebastian Stumpfs photographs and by Stefan Panhanss Items for Possible Videosets. Even without knowing each artists other bodies of work (they have hardly ever shown outside Europe or the West), Ive a feeling that this impression of blandness, or slightness, that you could carry away from the show may not be entirely fair to each artists achievement. Its a curatorial problem. (Perhaps fewer artists and more works by each is the solution.) This is certainly true for the subtlety and precision of Claudia Wiesers work, in which a modern and metaphysical preoccupation with geometric form and architectural space engages with the found materials of Old Europe (reminding me of some of Tacita Deans Berlin-based work). What was the point of showing just one of Wiesers fine pencil drawings on pages taken out of antique books, when the effect of this work is so obviously serial, and when there was enough space on the wall to show a few more without cluttering the display?        
	Anja Ciupkas poem on the wall, Me, and her metal balls moving freely on the gallery floor, Butterfly Effect, also risk banality and the obvious, simply because we havent seen enough of what else she has done (the relational art of her Passionate Single show of 2008, for instance) for the complexity of her idiom to communicate itself to us. So, one has to rely on the wall-texts giveaway paraphrase to make sense of things, which doesnt challenge the viewer enough. Perhaps wall-texts should be printed upside down  like the man walking on his head in Stumpfs Marcher  lenvers, or like crossword-puzzle solutions  so that we are forced to do a little more work without falling back on the lazy option.        
	Panhanss eight-minute video on a loop, Sorry (2010), shows a stream of policepersons and droll impersonations of celebrity (I recognized Johnny Depp) endlessly squeezing past one another in the aisle of a train compartment. The train doesnt seem to be going anywhere, the windowpanes are totally dark, and the passengers look jaded, monumentally bored, indifferent, yet automatically polite, to one another.         
	This is a post-Kabaret, post-Petra-von-Kant, post-Nina-Hagen, post-Kraftwerk, post-Bauhaus, post-Beuys world of sadly absurdist neo-gothic and rococo masquerade. Nothing Ever Happens here, apart from grey, minimalist urban or suburban architecture  the antiseptic museums, galleries and public spaces where the artist is allowed to perform or install his State-aided, politely transgressive antics. This is a world where everyone is free, its impolite to stare in public, and Multikulti is officially dead; but the desire to attract attention, to be different, and to shock persists in those who are generously allowed to call themselves artists.        
	So, Where am I? asks the artist. Near Gariahat, says a voice. May not be a bad thing after all.

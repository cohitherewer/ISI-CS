The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the fine art of delay
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE FINE ART OF DELAY                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	Why is the Rashtrapati Bhavan steadily falling apart, deviating from all the mandatory norms of maintenance and upkeep, both as a carefully-planned estate and a fine building? We continue to operate like an underdeveloped nation wallowing in all manner of intellectual, cultural and professional insecurities, managed by babus who neither have the experience nor the sensibility required to conserve our habitat in the best possible way. We, as a nation, have failed miserably to stall the continuing degradation. And no one in power is actively attempting to change the reality.        
	Edwin Lutyens built by incorporating many elements from indigenous traditions of architecture. He has been criticized by art historians for his condescending comments on India. But strangely, his work is far more oriental than that of Le Corbusier, who influenced the sterile horrors of the public works departments or of the local Delhi Development Authority. Post-Independence India has the worst architecture imaginable, led by State-sponsored ugly buildings that have pockmarked an otherwise stunning landscape. In our desperation to ape Western sensibilities, we created monsters upon urban monsters. In the bargain, the government agencies that dominated this realm of manmade heritage destroyed the best by turning a blind eye to the mutilation and destruction. Conservation and protection continues to mean nothing to the authorities.        
	The pivot of our republic, the Rashtrapati Bhavan, has become a mishmash of babu style and bad taste. Public properties such as this one must be managed by professionals, and the babu must be prohibited from intervening. Incumbent representatives, who live in these properties for as long as their term permits them to, must be given their private quarters where they can live as they like, but must be compelled to live within public rules in the public spaces of the manor. Our Raj Bhavans are like the worst and tackiest guest houses. In fact, some of the finest homes overseas that the government of India has acquired for Indian embassies and residences are in deep neglect, with ghastly interiors and decaying structures.                
	Good housekeeping        
	We present ourselves as a confused, careless, nation-state that has no self-respect, no pride and no commitment to excellence. The home reflects the person and the mindset. Ours need to be cleaned up and overhauled. Secretaries to the government of India who have till now ruled the roost must give way to the experts. A stringent rulebook needs to be conceived and established. No president or prime minister, minister or secretary, can be permitted to interfere in the basics.        
	Suggestions must be brought to the committee of pros and then decided upon. Let us clean up the act both metaphorically and physically. Let us begin with Rashtrapati Bhavan, where the committee continues to be overruled by the babu, who just does not follow the orders, and by staff who know the fine art of delay. The degradation from the days of S. Radhakrishnan and Zakir Hussain to today is stark and disturbing. Accountability needs to be activated immediately. Let us not lose our legacies and cultures.        
	As an emerging economic power we must understand the importance of showcasing the material heritage that is our larger and more profound legacy, the strong plural foundation on which rests our unusual civilization. These are the inheritances that have bound the polity and its organic federal structure. Let us purge the corruption of our lives, starting at home. And force the babus to deliver the goods and services, law and order, and thereby, civil society.

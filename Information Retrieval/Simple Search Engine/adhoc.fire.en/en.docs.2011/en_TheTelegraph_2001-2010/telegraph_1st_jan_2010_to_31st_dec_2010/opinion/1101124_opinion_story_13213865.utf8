	Q: A marriage under Section 13 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, took place between an India-born Canadian citizen and an Indian citizen in India. After marriage, the Indian citizen moved to Canada. After seven months she came back to India. Both parties now want a divorce. Can the divorce proceedings be initiated in Canada? Is there any mandatory period of separation if the process is initiated in India?        
	P. Dasgupta, Calcutta              
	A: Yes, the divorce proceedings can be initiated in Canada since the parties last resided together in Canada. To file for divorce by mutual consent under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, the mandatory period of separation is one year.              
	Q:A promoter sold a flat in 1988. After 10 years the owner sold it off. I bought it from the second purchaser in 2000. After a few years the municipality stopped accepting property tax from me, saying that taxes from 1988 were due and that I would have to clear them first. Could the earlier owner have had the flat mutated without paying the dues? I have his original mutation certificate. Am I liable to pay the arrears?        
	B. Raman, Calcutta              
	A: Mutation is the recording of the name of the owner but not proof of tax payment. Before purchasing the flat you should have seen the latest tax receipts of the previous owner and verified with the municipal corporation as to whether the tax was paid up. Being the present owner of the flat, the liability of the payment of pending taxes is on you. But if you can show tax receipts from 1988, you will be relieved from paying the tax.              
	Q:My brother-in-law, who was a bachelor, died without leaving any will. He had a flat in Calcutta, but he used to live with his younger brother in Shillong. Although he has two older brothers and sisters, it is really the younger brother who should inherit his flat and his money. How can he go about staking a claim?        
	S.K. Som, Calcutta              
	A: Since your brother died intestate, his legal heirs will inherit his assets/estates equally irrespective of the fact that his younger brother took care of him. However, if the legal heirs forfeit their claim over the said assets by gifting their share to the younger brother, he will become the sole owner of the assets.

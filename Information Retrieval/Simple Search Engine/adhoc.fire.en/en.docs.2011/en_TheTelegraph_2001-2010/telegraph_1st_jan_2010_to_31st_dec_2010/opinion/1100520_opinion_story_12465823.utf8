	A bad peace is often the prelude to another war. The patch-up between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha has all the necessary conditions for a future break-up. The idea of each party getting the chief ministers post by rotation could be the least of the alliances problems. Unusual though it is, the experiment has been tried out elsewhere. But the main problem about the agreement in Ranchi is that it smacks of bad faith. The BJPs aim of wresting the chief ministers office from Shibu Soren has been achieved only partially. But the party has clearly not been able to settle scores with him the way it wanted to. The JMM, on the other hand, will continue to smart from the loss and bide its time to get even with its bigger partner. There is no surprise, therefore, that the arrangement has left many in both camps unhappy. The voices of dissent are likely to grow louder once the new chief minister begins the allocation of cabinet portfolios. There are also signs that the choice of Arjun Munda for the post may upset other party aspirants for it. The compromise is more a desperate gamble for power than a serious attempt to restore governance in the state.         
	The unstable relationship between the BJP and its allies in Jharkhand raises a more important question about the partys ability to run coalition governments. The saffronites obviously lack the skill and flexibility in using coalition politics which the Congress seems to have acquired over the past few years. For several decades, the Congress had been used to running governments at the Centre and the states by itself. But it took lessons in coalition politics once it realized that the scope for one-party governments was becoming more and more limited. It is curious that the BJP has been such a slow learner in alliance politics, considering the fact that the partys strength and spread in the states were always smaller than the Congresss. In Jharkhand, the BJPs failure to run the coalition smoothly has caused a huge vacuum in the administration. The endless one-upmanship games between the BJP and the JMM have demoralized the police and the administration. This is a dangerous drift in a state that faces the twin threat of abject poverty and the Maoist rebellion. The problem is that the new chief minister may be more anxious to ensure his own survival in the post than to address issues of governance.

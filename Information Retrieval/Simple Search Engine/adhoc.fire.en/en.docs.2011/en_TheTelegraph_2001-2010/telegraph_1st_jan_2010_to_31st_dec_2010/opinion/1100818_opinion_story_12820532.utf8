                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        JUST PAY                                                    
	The proposal to raise the salaries of members of parliament fell through the crack between principle and expediency. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, deferred the decision on the matter. But no one had opposed the proposal on grounds of principle. Those who raised objections argued that the timing was wrong. It would look odd, it was said, to raise salaries of MPs during a time of hardship. Other doubts were voiced regarding the quantum of the hike that was proposed. In other words, there was no quarrel on the main issue that salaries of MPs should be increased, but it should be done later and the amount of the increment should be tinkered with. It would appear that the so-called conscientious objectors to the proposed hike are not proceeding on their consciences at all. On the contrary, they are taking positions based on populist considerations. It is surprising that the prime minister went along with such sentiments and shelved the proposal with the implicit assumption that it would be brought forward again at an opportune moment when times of hardship are over.        
	The principle underlying the proposal to increase the salaries of MPs is actually a simple one. The executive, the judiciary and the legislature are all equal pillars of the State. There is no logical reason for discriminating among the three of them. It is apparent that the salaries of MPs  the principal legislators  are much lower than those of bureaucrats and judges. The MPs deserve to have their salaries raised to be on a par with those of their peers working in other arms of the State. The question of salary hike of MPs should not be confused with whether MPs behave themselves on the floor of the House or are seen to be in regular attendance when Parliament is in session. Persons given the responsibility by the electorate to make laws that govern the Indian republic should be compensated in terms befitting the august responsibilities that they shoulder. Aberrations of individual behaviour should not be considered in this matter. MPs, on their part, as they prepare themselves to receive their new scales of pay, should devise ways to make themselves more accountable and more responsible. They perform one of the most important jobs in Indian democracy and they cannot afford to make themselves look ridiculous for their own sake and for the sake of the Indian nation.

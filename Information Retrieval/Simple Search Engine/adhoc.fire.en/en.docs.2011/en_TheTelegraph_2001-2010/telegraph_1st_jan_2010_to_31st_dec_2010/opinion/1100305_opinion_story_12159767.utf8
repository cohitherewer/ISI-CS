	Hardly a boon                  
	Sir  The hike in the prices of petroleum products announced by the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, is unacceptable (Not radical but sound, Feb 27). It will end up increasing prices of essential commodities. The aam admi, already struggling with price hikes, will only be burdened further. An increase in fuel prices will also mean a hike in bus fares and transport costs. The revised income tax slab of 10 per cent for those falling within the income bracket of Rs 1.6 lakh-Rs 5 lakh per annum, however, will be welcomed by the salaried classes.           
	Measures for arresting inflation are conspicuously absent in the budget. There is also no mention of long-term growth or of generating employment opportunities for the unemployed youth. For the aam admi, the budget brings no cheer.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Sravana Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	Sir  This years budget has been one of the first not to sidetrack the rural and agricultural economy (Solving problems away from the limelight, Feb 27). There is greater focus on welfare measures. Provisions such as the outlay on improvement of irrigational facilities in dry land as well as farmers loan and interest relief are laudable. Better healthcare, water supply, educational facilities and a shift to nutrient-based subsidy augur well for the farming community. The middle-class, salaried public also have a share of the perks.          
	Although the corporate sector will face a hike in the minimum alternate tax rate from 15 per cent to 18 per cent, there will be a concession on corporate surcharge. All things considered, the budget has been in the interests of the nation. The increase in excise duty was inevitable since the stimulus package needs a calibrated phase-out.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashok Jayaram, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  The rise in petrol and diesel prices announced in the Union budget signals an increase in transport costs which will indirectly affect the price of all commodities. However, it is also true that a fall in fuel prices does not mean a corresponding fall in transport fares. The only way to curb inflation is to conduct raids on traders and manufacturers who are deliberately creating scarcity to push prices up. Since the government reiterates that there is no shortage in production, and that it is proud of the growth in the rates of the gross domestic product, the prices of all goods and services need to be regulated. So far, in the name of reform, the administration has only given businessmen an opportunity to earn more profit.          
	The budget offers token relief to certain sections of the people through income tax cuts. However, a majority of Indians, who earn less than a lakh per annum, are struggling to make ends meet after the hike in fuel prices. The governments much-vaunted common man has been left at the mercy of traders and corrupt officers.          
	Subsidies granted by the government only create scope for the diversion of funds through the forging of relevant documents. This is applicable to the money set aside under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act or to subsides for industries and various loan schemes funded by the government. In the past, media exposures of government scams have not been enough to check them.           
	Private companies have been allowed to set up local banks in all towns and villages. These banks are bound to exploit rural people the way moneylenders used to before the nationalization of banks. The government policy of consolidating banks is at odds with the decision to grant more licenses to private banks. Even existing non-banking financial companies elude government control. Every year, there are instances of NBFCs shutting shop when hapless depositors demand the money that is owed to them.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Danendra Jain, Agartala 

                
	Sir  Despite claims to the contrary, this years budget is inflationary, bound to stunt growth, and not people-friendly. The hike in fuel prices will ensure rises in price in all sectors. It is hoped that Thomas Isaac, the finance minister of Kerala, will check the impact of the Union budget on the people of the state by bypassing the additional excise duties on petroleum products.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, 

      
	Alappuzha, Kerala                    
	Sir  The budget is never good news for the common man. Through direct and indirect taxes, he has to pay the price for the governments faulty policies, its wasteful expenditure and corruption. All concessions go to industries, presumably because of their high running costs. For the aam admi, the mere absence of additional tax burden is to be considered a boon.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Mahesh Kumar, Delhi

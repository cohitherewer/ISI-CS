The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Think before you speak
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK                                  THIS ABOVE ALL - KHUSHWANT SINGH                          All smiles                                        
	All politicians are glib talkers  they have to be able to win peoples support. Indian politicians go further: they say one thing, mean something else and do what suits them. The best examples of this brand of double-speak are the speeches of Mohan Bhagwat, head of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. He maintains that the RSS is a social organization that has nothing to do with politics. He repeated this not so very long ago and told the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party to sort out their differences. A couple of weeks later, he ordered L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh to relinquish their posts of the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the BJP president respectively. Bhagwat went further and said that the new leaders should not be Dilliwallas but should hail from other parts of India. Lest people had any doubts left in their minds, he nominated Nitin Gadkari, a fellow Brahmin from his home-town, Nagpur, and a successful minister of the public works department in the Maharashtra government, as Rajnath Singhs successor. Very dutifully, the BJP leaders made suitable speeches accepting Bhagwats diktat, but quickly passed an amendment to their constitution and created a new post for Advani while preparing to welcome Gadkari. The latter arrived in Delhi, was duly garlanded by everybody, warmly embraced, had pedas popped in his mouth (he is fat enough), and all appeared hunky dory. Bhagwat then retreated to Nagpur and reiterated that the RSS does not meddle with politics.        
	You can be sure that Gadkaris attempts at refurbishing the image of his party will be thwarted not by the leaders of the opposition but by men like Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley. Advani has no intention of retiring gracefully. The word, sanyas, does not exist in his dictionary.        
	Gadkari says that he will instil the spirit of national culture in the people. That sounds nice. But while doing so he must tell us whether he approves of the demolition of the Babri Masjid, as does Bhagwat. It is not an outdated or an irrelevant question: it is in the minds of most Indians. It is the acid test of secularism. Gadkari must spell out the role of religious minorities  Muslims, Christians and Sikhs  in the BJP. Giving two or three Muslims important posts in the party will not fool anybody. The BJP has had three showpieces on its rolls  Shahnawaz Husain (member of parliament), Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, and Najma Heptullah (member of the Rajya Sabha). None of the three carries any weight in their own community.        
	The same applies to the Sikhs. The BJPs partnership with the Akali Dal is one of convenience, as they have nothing in common. The BJP has two Sikhs to display: the cricketer, Sidhu (MP), and S.S. Ahluwalia, once chief noisemaker of the Congress, now chief noisemaker of the BJP. I have not heard him make one coherent speech in the Rajya Sabha, and Navjot Singh Sidhu is better known for his wisecracks on television shows than for his speeches in the Lok Sabha. Both men are self-promoters without any political principle.         
	Gadkari has to find genuine supporters of his ideology from the minority communities or do without them. I wish him luck in contending with leaders of the ruling party as well as with detractors in his own party.                
	The incredible Desais                
	Whenever Lord Meghnad Desai and his wife, Kishwar, come to India, they spend an evening with me. I have known Kishwar for quite some years in different incarnations. First, as Kishwar Rosha, daughter of the head of the Punjab Police, and acknowledged as Chandigarhs beauty queen. Then as Kishwar Ahluwalia, wife of a senior executive of some company and mother of two sons. The marriage did not work out well, so she earned her living writing and making films. For a short while, she was a friend of Jairam Ramesh. In the course of her media career, she met Meghnad Desai. They decided to live together. They divorced their respective spouses and got married. I have not met a couple who look so happy. And productive  churning out books and films as if they were the easiest things to do. Quite evidently, second marriages do better than the firsts.        
	Kishwar brought Meghnad into my life. I had read a great deal about him. He is a Gujarati, born in Baroda. After graduating from Bombay University, he went to Pennsylvania University and got a doctorate in Economics. Then he went to England to teach at the London School of Economics. He is now the Professor Emeritus of the school. He became a British national and worked actively for the Labour Party. In 1991, he was conferred a peerage and became Lord Desai of Clement Danes. He never lost contact with his motherland. He was awarded the Bharat Pravasi Puraskar, and then the Padma Bhushan in 2008. He has the best of the two worlds and three homes: in London, Goa and Delhi.        
	Meghnads interests are extensive: Indian politics (he writes a weekly column for The Indian Express), Hindi films (he wrote a biography of Dilip Kumar), Marxism, Islamic fundamentalism, fiction, and much else. His latest book is The Rediscovery of India, which was released in Delhi a couple of weeks ago.         
	Kishwar is not lagging behind. Her first novel is due to be released next month. She has brought the film rights of the story of Noor Inayat Khan ,who was shot by the Germans for spying for the British during World War II. She has also assembled all the material she needed to write the biography of Saadat Hasan Manto.         
	The best thing about Meghnad Desai is that, besides the latest book he has published, he brings me a bottle of the House of Lords, the best Scotch, specially distilled for the peers of the realm.                
	God bless                
	Lines written at the back of an autorickshaw in Punjab:        
	Satguru teri ote,        
	Khan nu de rotiyaan,        
	Te kharchan nu de note,        
	Wahguru sab da phalaa kare,        
	Par shuru sadey to karey.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Madness in the air
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MADNESS IN THE AIR                          - Notes on a nation at war with itself        Mrinal Pande                                                  
	A Manichaean vision has come to prevail about both Ayodhya and the Kashmir valley in the country that insists on seeing things as white or black. The moment any citizen stands up to comment on either issue, the general assumption is that he or she must be one thing: a Hindu or a Muslim, with us or against us. Clearly, openly, unhesitatingly. Even in academic debates, the earlier liberal-democratic traditions that left room for healthy doubt, accepted grey in all its gradations, seem to have all but evaporated in this context. Television debates are being organized night after night in studios or against heartbreakingly picturesque outdoor settings. But instead of debating the gradual evolution of the problem from an honest historical perspective and apportioning blame or credit where it is due, the focus remains unwaveringly on the immediate and the extreme: arson, demolitions, stone-pelting, curfews, white-flag marches and the number of dead as of today. Ageing fellow midnights children and their children imply, sometimes kindly and mostly irritably, that India must move on. Chill out. That past does not matter.        
	But it does. Like an infant picking up language, anyone who wishes to understand communal incidents must first submit to a slow learning process that moves from syllables to words to articles of speech and then the grammar. How many of us had heard of Mir Baqi before the Ayodhya conflagration, or sentences like Jan bhavnaon ka prakatikaran (Vajpayees clever phrase meaning a sudden outburst of popular feelings)? How many of us would really have understood that stone-peltings or slogans like Quit Kashmir, street-firings and house arrests are not random incidents, but systematic day-to-day occurrences in the Valley? It takes time because we digest such information not intuitively but most reluctantly. It still makes no sense to most of us that after six decades our subcontinent is falling into madness again.              
	Because madness is in the air, the 24x7 news media, blogs and YouTube will, and do, manipulate public opinion in India so easily. The fault does not lie with the media alone. The Indian preference for myth to hard reality  for acquiring (quotable) informed opinions instead of going out and seeking hard (and often painful) information themselves  is equally to be blamed. Indolent, passive, unimaginative folks on both sides have proved time and again how they will prefer simplified, embellished and nonsensical interpretations over hard and factual details. It is a pity that this is still happening in the age of the information revolution when hard historical details and scientifically accurate facts are available to anyone with access to the net.        
	It is for this reason that fact-finding missions by all-party delegations, United Nations observers or foreign journalists are turned into freak shows by the organizers and their rivals. Urns containing ashes of dead karsevaks, burnt shops with a childs half-burnt school bag, people burning flags and effigies, a school-going child with bullet injuries on a hospital bed, women beating their breast and weeping at funerals: the list is endless. At the end of the day, what do such visuals teach us? Only to be angry, more and more angry, with our perceived adversaries. And anger kills sound logic and reason each time before people sit down across tables for a dialogue. What do we do with more and more tales of death and skulduggery, none of them fully reliable and most beyond the realm of credibility?        
	The Valley lies on top of a 60-year-old faultline. I dont know what you mean by ethnic cleansing. The Hindus left the valley voluntarily, we cajoled them to stay back. We promised to protect them, but they still left, one hears again and again. Likewise, we are told that the mosque in Ayodhya had ceased to be a place of worship years ago. Muslims never came there to pray. It was only a disputed structure (vivadit dhancha).        
	When the call of the wild comes, writes the Serbian writer, Ivo Andric, the bonds of civilization turn out to be surprisingly weak. The wild beast is a patient survivor, waiting in the wild grass of history, ready to pounce at the right moment.        
	The right moment came when, in a curfew-riddled capital, the state government suddenly chose to be lenient. First came the release of a hardcore separatist like Musarat from jail. He was allowed to revive his nefarious Quit Kashmir movement by seeding the Valley with a deep hatred for the Indian State. Then, a month and a half later, the hawkish Mirwaiz was permitted to divert the Eid congregation at Eidgah in the old city to downtown Lal Chowk. Mayhem ensued. Then the Central government waited for almost 90 days before it called for an all-party meet.        
	How come events that were so patently unreasonable are being presented as reasonable both by the media and the government? On the one hand, Omar has a point and, on the other, Mehbooba is not wrong either, and of course, Mirwaiz must also be heard, for he too has a valuable insight to offer!        
	We know that the situation is not balanced but absurd, tragic and venal, and we think that a 12-member delegation can land there for a day and bring back a formula for a magic solution to Delhi, where the fate of all states must be decided.        
	We forget that in areas with such a long and confusing history of sectarian violence, communalism, and not history, comes to shape the psychology of children because the virus of communalism never really dies. It only recedes into the spores it has created in the body politic and then mutates. Whenever resistance is low, it erupts again, now in the Valley, then in Ayodhya, and later in Kandhamal or Ahmedabad. By then, it is much more resistant to earlier antidotes because hatred laced with a sullen suspicion for the Other has slowly become a self-seeding growth in those areas.        
	The young there think not historically, but in images of communal violence. Unlike the elders who have lived through normal times, they view both the present and the future only through a filter of the immediate past, thinking constantly about how they have survived a holocaust. They begin to live only for revenge.        
	Why do you weep for your dead kin now Draupadi? Krishna asks her at the end of the terrible fratricidal war, Didnt you say to me once, O Krishna, they are nothing to me?              
	The blind cult of force, whether backed by the State, armed insurgents or TV channels claiming they are the fastest draw in town, disdains nuances, reflections or half tones. It pokes fun at prolonged discussions or emotive appeals. It does not like compromises that may be arrived at only after genuine all-party consultations over withdrawal of force, but prefers to clamp down immediately on the adversary. All those who are full of hatred and gestures and fear vociferously support the time-tested formula of lets-go-and-show-them-once-and-for-all-who-the-real-boss-is. A system that continues to offer old ideas for new situations simply cannot work in any long-term sense. It fails to see how much violence people it seeks to crush have absorbed from it over the years.        
	A population weakened and exhausted by battling decline in living standards, diminishing incomes and increased threat of violence, whose demands for simple justice swiftly rendered are never heard properly and with care, is vulnerable to manipulators that represent armed ideologies and always lie in wait in the margins for this moment of rift. It then acts swiftly, violently and with sudden crushing power. It would be unforgivable if consensus arrives too late and offers too little.

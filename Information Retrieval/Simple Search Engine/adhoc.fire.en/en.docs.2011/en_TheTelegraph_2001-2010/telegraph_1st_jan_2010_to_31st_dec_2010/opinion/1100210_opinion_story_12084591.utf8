	The decision of the government of West Bengal to reserve 10 per cent of government jobs for the disadvantaged sections of backward class Muslims is a dubious one. On the face of it, it violates the Constitutional position that reservations cannot be created on the basis of religion. The West Bengal government seems to be aware of this danger since it clarified that reservations would be made on the basis of social, economic and educational backwardness. Notwithstanding this clarification, it needs to be pointed out that these criteria will be applied, so far as this new reservation of 10 per cent is concerned, only to Muslims. This somewhat muddies the governments declared policy. It raises uncomfortable questions about its motives and intentions. By now, it is all too evident that the Left Front governments performance in the handling of backwardness of Muslims has been pathetic. The report of the Sachar Committee exposed this. The Left paid heavily for this neglect in the last parliamentary elections, where its debacle was attributed largely to the alienation of Muslims. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government is now trying desperately to compensate for this neglect. The vacuity of Mr Bhattacharjees thinking is obvious from the fact that he could think of no other instrument to do this save reservations.        
	The prevailing atmosphere of political correctness and the relentless pursuit of populist electoral gains prevents political parties and intellectuals from criticizing this decision of Mr Bhattacharjees government. Any criticism, the fear is, will be interpreted as being anti-Muslim. Yet this move bypasses the fundamental problems of Muslims in West Bengal. It does not provide them better education, and like all poor people of the state, they are exposed to one of the worst healthcare systems in the country. Reserving jobs for Muslim backward classes may win the Left Front a few votes but it also means that government jobs will not be open to merit as they should be. Reservations provide an artificial cushion for those who are backward in society. There would have been no need for reservations if for the last thirty odd years the Left Front government in West Bengal had relentlessly pursued policies to improve the conditions of the poor, and especially of the Muslims, in the state. The policy that has been announced is, in fact, an admission of failure.

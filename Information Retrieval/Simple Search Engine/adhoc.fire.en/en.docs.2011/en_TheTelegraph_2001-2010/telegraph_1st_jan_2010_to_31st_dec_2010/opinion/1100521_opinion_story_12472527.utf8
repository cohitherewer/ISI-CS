	The other side of India                
	The face you were afraid to see: Essays on the Indian economy (Penguin, Rs 250) by Amit Bhaduri is an important book of essays that examines Indias present economic and political reality. This reality, Bhaduri argues, is characterized by a frightening chasm that separates the urban, prosperous classes from the teeming impoverished sections in the hinterland. What is of considerable import is the role that the State plays in widening this chasm. Bhaduri maintains that in a globalized India, the welfare State has transformed itself into the protector of the rights of large corporations. On their behalf, it has taken on the responsibility of gobbling up large tracts of land, and unleashing an unequal development that has brought in its wake the displacement of the poor, destruction of livelihoods and the steady corporatization of agriculture. The media and the middle class also do their bit to sustain this cunning game for the sake of progress.        
	The essays, with their lucid prose and incisive observations, raise uncomfortable questions. A Failed World View shows how economic theory has been appropriated by the ruling classes to sell a one-dimensional model of prosperity. Development or Developmental Terrorism? delves into the practice of State terrorism in the name of development while Predatory Growth, as suggested by the title, exposes Indias iniquitous growth curve. It will not be easy to dismiss Bhaduris arguments as mere leftist rhetoric. To understand why large parts of India are bleeding because of peoples uprisings, one may have to turn the pages of this book.                        
	Short Takes: Stories from Bangladesh (Frog, Rs 150) by Tanvir Malik casts a critical look at the components that make up life in Bangladesh. Most of the stories are set on Dhakas streets that come alive with their throng of traffic, beggars and smoke. Dramas are enacted on these stretches, and through these exchanges, one is supposed to decipher the composite image of a nation and its people. In The Ancient Freedom Fighter, Raihan comes across an old beggar who, having fought for the countrys independence, has now been reduced to a pauper. Auto-drivers, beggars and an upwardly mobile individual make their customary appearance in A Lesson Learnt as well, while Gifts chronicles the evil influence of dowry. The unimaginative plots are disappointing. One also wonders whether the complex web of life in Bangladesh can be captured through a few vignettes of the capital city.          
	Innovate! 90 days to transform your business (Penguin, Rs 299) by Rekha Shetty is one of those do-it-yourself toolkits that help business organizations flourish by ushering in a culture of innovation. This 90-day wonder plan promises to empower employees, start initiatives to rake in profits, build young, proactive teams and also explore options to establish long-term culture change. Entrepreneurs will be greatly impressed by this book, but lay readers may get tired of the corporate jargons.                                
	The Great Depression of the 40S: A Novel (Penguin, Rs 250) by Rupa Gulab is not about struggling economies. Instead, it is supposed to be a witty take on mid-life crisis and the strange ways in which people deal with it. Forty-three-year-old Mantra decides to chuck her job and soak in the pleasures of retirement. But her plan hits several hurdles in the form of a husband with high cholesterol, her diminished libido, a sister-in-law obsessed with a spectral love, a neighbour who aspires to be on Page 3 and a surly cook. Mantras battles against all of them, we have been assured, will raise a laugh riot, deepening the lines on the faces of those in her age-group.

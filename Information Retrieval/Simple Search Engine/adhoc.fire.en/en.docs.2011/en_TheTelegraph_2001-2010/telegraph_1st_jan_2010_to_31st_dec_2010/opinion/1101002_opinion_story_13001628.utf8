	A recent evening of Tagore songs by Sreyashi Mitra at the Rabindranath Tagore Auditorium, ICCR, brought several questions to mind. Maybe the 150th anniversary of the poet-composer is as good an occasion as any other to address some of them.        
	Though hypothetical, would it be an altogether speculative exercise to try and imagine how Tagore himself would have liked to be sung today? Would the traditional performance format of a singer seated with her accompanists on a platform, playing the harmonium and singing one song after another, have met with his approval? Especially since he is known to have broken more traditions than he cared to acknowledge, musically and otherwise? Wouldnt Rabindrasangeet singers  and we know how their tribe is forever burgeoning  have done him greater service by taking their role as communicator more seriously and allowing the word, experiment, to co-exist in their minds alongside tradition?        
	The pontificating could continue ad nauseam. But so could the performance format. And the performances themselves. On this occasion, Mitra chose to sing 17 songs from various sections of the Gitabitan. To her credit, she has the clarity of diction, technical virtuosity and the pure gayaki of one who is organically linked to Tagores music. Her rendition of the wonder-filled paean to monsoon, Kakhan badal chhowa legey, evoked the seasons splendour, while Mori lo mori, amay banshite dekechhey ke was replete with longing for the beloved whose address is unknown. She did justice to Tagores own ode to autumn, Tomra ja bolo tai bolo, extolling the quiet grandeur of the season. Her rendering of Ami roope tomaay bholabo na in the tappa style was an appropriate expression of the profundity of love.        
	Mitra stayed close to the notations, gliding effortlessly over the notes and rarely going out of her way to embellish musical phrases. However, it would have to be pointed out that there were some lapses in her performance too. Her voice sounded dim in places, failing to rise to the dramatic possibilities of songs such as the wonderfully introspective Aaji jharer raatey tomar abhishar. In the song, Sranto keno ohey pantha, the expression, tribhuban daraye, was erroneously and ludicrously replaced with tribhuban jagaye on a couple of occasions. Also, Basanti hey bhubanamohini in the Carnatic style would have sounded better if words like basanti were sung together as single words and not broken up into units such as baso and onti. A singer of Mitras calibre can surely do away with these shortcomings.        
	She could also think of more interesting ways of presenting Tagore songs. With so much of experimentation happening around Tagore, why should a live performance of Rabindrasangeet be so devoid of colour?

	The Constitution of India, unarguably the republics most hallowed text, represented a great churning of ideas. That churning itself was the product of the bigger social, economic and political upheaval articulated in the Indian national movement. But nationalism did not tie down the makers of the Constitution. They tried to enshrine certain universal values that they considered to be important for democracy and for India. The result was a huge, and perhaps even an over-written, document. Unfortunately, the intellectual response to the Constitution has been somewhat tardy. There have been points of procedure that have been debated but, other than the famous Kesavananda Bharati case that reiterated the supremacy of the Constitution and rejected the idea of absolute parliamentary sovereignty, very few really fundamental issues relating to the Constitution have been discussed in any intellectual or academic forum. The case just mentioned threw up the notion of the basic structure of the Constitution, which is inviolate. This notion is itself a contentious one since an ambiguity inheres in the idea of a basic structure.        
	The prevailing ambience is that the Constitution is a closed book. This may well be a travesty of the intentions of some of the founding fathers who wanted the Constitution to be the subject of debate since it is the fount of democracy. In more ways than one, independent India has failed to live up to the intellectual challenge held out by the text that enshrined the spirit of independent India. There have been attempts in the recent past to set up a body to review the Constitution, but these have always lacked the intellectual weight to carry out such a project. The requirement is not for people who know the details of the Constitution sub-clause by sub-clause, but for persons capable of unravelling the philosophical assumptions that underpin the Constitution. What is demanded is the courage to question and debate these assumptions. To take one example: what was it that prompted the founding fathers to opt for bicameralism, and has the Upper House served the purpose for which it was established? Questions, however uncomfortable for the status quo, need to be asked. Their absence would suggest that Indian society has become intellectually sterile and is not pursued by self-doubt. Nothing could be more dangerous for democracy.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BACK TO BASICS                              Jayatsen Bhattacharya      Music                                                
	Given her classical training and her choice of genre for her performance, Clare Michaud did a commendable job to tame her coloratura. Her concert at the American Center, Calcutta, on February 2, courtesy the US Consulate, was indeed, as Michaud sought to label, a session of revisiting chestnuts  and thankfully so for the citys fusion-weary jazz buffs.        
	There is always something nice about small concerts. They are usually big on intent. Even Michauds concert-opener, Orange coloured sky, happily spoke of her yen for traditional standards, all of which were peppered with her subtle variations and smart phrasing. While All of me, delivered with a Vaughanesque con brio, was deftly accompanied by pianist, Pradyumna Singh Manot, the less melodically ornate The way you look tonight highlighted, as a much gratified Michaud put it, the virtuosic meeting of scales between her and Paddy. Manot, again, more than held his own, enhancing even, Michauds urgency  round-throated and elastic  during The man I love.        
	Her interpretative fervour, restrained and most often timely, came to the fore during a number that seldom betrays its weakness for the bossa nova and other related beats: The boy from Ipanema. Michaud chose an energy, impish and beckoning, that reassured on another level as well: her belief in the traditional format of allowing her robust accompanist ample solos, a riveting instance of which greatly beefed up Night in Tunisia, straddling variegated layers, tempos and emotions. Java Jive, again, the mere mention of which kindles the intensely harmonic version of The Manhattan Transfer, proved an amusing tribute to Michauds must beverage as she toyed with the melody, employing, this time, her sound lower registers as well.         
	But truth be told, it was not before the concert had entered its final phase that Michaud actually produced a jewel, despite its cracks. It was the sophisticated Cry me a river that saw her vocal finesse combine with the right dollop of soul and pluck, a near-perfect merger that ensured even the odd moments of discordance did not mar her rendition. She equally impressed with Georgia on my mind  which has manfully weathered singers as diverse as the raunchy Ray Charles and the excessively suave Dean Martin. Hers was a starkly soft approach, schmaltzy in parts, but her humility, towards her art and the Great American Songbook, compelled a memorable version.        
	Humility makes for good balladeering. Michaud used a bit of her classical timbre, oodles of her inherent grace and a good lot of her higher scales to serenade her friend, the US consul general, Beth Payne, with Ill be seeing you. One hopes she included us too.

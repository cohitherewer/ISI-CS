                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ROAD SHOWS                                                    
	A spectre has come to haunt public life in India  the spectre of street politics. For most politicians in India, what ultimately matters is how they perform in the street plays. Mamata Banerjees annual rally in Calcutta on July 21 has become as much a citizens nightmare as the endless street shows of her rival, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Given her recent electoral successes, her lieutenants will leave nothing to chance to make Wednesdays show a spectacular one. The worrying thing is that the tendency to use the street and hold public life to ransom is increasingly becoming the all-important thing in Indian politics. And the tendency cuts across political parties and their leaders. Ms Banerjee is a member of the Union cabinet, holding charge of a major ministry like the railways. But the responsibilities that go with a public office do not seem to deter the politicians antics on the streets. Take the case of N. Chandrababu Naidu. As chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, he behaved like the chief executive officer of a corporate entity. It seemed that he, for a change, equated political power with governance. But, once out of office, he shrank into a street politician. His arrest last week during a road show is a telling commentary on the state of Indian politics.        
	This reduction of politics to inane street shows is certainly not what democracy is about. The irony is that, for all the disruptions these cause to public life, they are sought to be defended in the name of the people. If anything, they violate the peoples basic rights and are often organized with open disregard for the law. Worse still, ordinary, law-abiding people feel helpless in the face of their leaders show of strength in public. It is almost a case of their own leaders holding them to ransom. There must be something seriously wrong with a political culture that makes the people fear their leaders tactics. The dominance of the politics of the street is also taking its toll on other institutions on which democracy is supposed to be built. If street shows are all that matter, dialogue and debate cannot be of much importance. The decline of debates in the state legislatures is thus directly related to the rise of the public spectacles. But the worst consequence of this brand of politics could be a crisis in governance. Sadly, the politicians seem to love their antics too much to bother about that.

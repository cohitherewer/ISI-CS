                              Brewing trouble        
	 The Ayodhya verdict turned out to be a false alarm, but not before causing a lot of consternation among variously interested parties. Political leaders across the spectrum were suddenly shown up in their true colours. The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, the formidable Mayavati, demonstrated her administrative skills. She ordered the Bahujan Samaj Party cadre to spread a message down to the panchayat level: that the high court judgment merely concerned a property dispute. At a meeting of the divisional commissioners, she dictated several dos and donts  each beginning with Mein...  which were dutifully scribbled on official notepads.      
	The Bharatiya Janata Party, however, remained cagey. Unusually, the party seemed to lack the conviction to take a firm stand on the prospective verdict. Insiders believe that this has something to do with the fact that the current leadership  consisting of Nitin Gadkari, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu, Anant Kumar, and the rest  was not on the forefront of the events of December 6, 1992. Those who spearheaded the Ayodhya movement  LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Kalyan Singh, Uma Bharti, K Govindacharya, Sakshi Maharaj and others  are no longer in the picture.      
	The Congress showed its characteristic masterly inactivity and yet had its way. Officially, the United Progressive Alliance kept saying that it was ready to meet any situation even as anxiety spread all over north and central India. People, stricken with panic, bought and hoarded essential commodities. And, as luck would have it, a certain petitioner in the Ayodhya dispute met Digvijay Singh, the general-secretary of the All India Congress Committee, last week. Then suddenly, in the apex court, the gentleman found himself in the company of a distinguished lawyer to plead his case!                              
	 Trust Amar Singh to be everywhere. Recently, at a reception, Shashi Tharoors wife, Sunanda Pushkar, revealed that she had met her future husband at a party in Dubai for the first time, where Singh was also present. The expelled general-secretary of the Samajwadi Party had quipped, even before Sunanda could go any further, Par dekho, dilwale dulhania le gaye.                            
	 Prabhat Jha, the state chief of the BJP for Madhya Pradesh, had shot to fame sometime back. The reason? He had turned down two bottles of expensive liquor gifted to him by Vijay Mallya. In his letter of refusal, which was released to the media, Jha had taken a high moral ground, insisting that liquor had no place in his life as per his indoctrination by the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Last week, the tables were turned on Jha rather shockingly when his son got involved in a furious pub brawl in Raipur. Apparently, this seedy joint in the Chhattisgarh capital has quite a reputation  including the unbecoming conduct of bar dancers.                            
	 With the coming of the monsoon, a protracted battle has started between the chief minister of Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot, and his predecessor, Vasundhara Raje. At the beginning of the season, the former CM first dubbed Gehlot a bad omen, claiming that his visits to various parts of the state led to a shortage of rainfall. Oddly, Gehlots trip to the United States of America in mid-July actually ushered in heavy rainfall in Jaipur and elsewhere. And curiously, as he returned home, the wet weather did a vanishing act. But the CM is still having the last laugh. At the end of the season, Rajasthan seems to have had more than its usual share of rain. Only three districts have not had sufficient rainfall, two of which, ironically, are closely associated with Vasundhara  Jhalawar, her own constituency, and Dholpur, which is her sasural.                            
	 24 Akbar Road is witnessing a close friendship between the AICC gen-sec, Janardhan Dwivedi, and the party treasurer, Motilal Vora. Many a time, they travel together in the same car when they have to attend some function. Their amity, however, is not going down too well with the other occupants of the Congresss national headquarters. There are whispers that Dwivedi, who also doubles as Sonia Gandhis speech-writer in Hindi, is planning to push the veteran Vora as the next vice-presidential nominee. Given Voras loyalty and proximity to 10 Janpath, he can be a candidate in 2012 if the current vice-president, Hamid Ansari, is pushed towards Rashtrapati Bhavan. But what if Dwivedi is game and gain?                         
	 Remember that wondrous creature, who was, until a few weeks ago, making grown-ups hysterical with one decisive move of one of its eight tentacles? Paul the Octopus took everyones breath away by correctly predicting the outcome of many of the matches of the Fifa World Cup. It seems Paul may now have a rival, albeit one who hasnt really managed to surprise many with his own soothsaying. His name is Mani Shankar Aiyar, and he had predicted the Commonwealth Games debacle as early as 2008. On the eve of the CWG opening ceremony, with footbridges collapsing and guests fleeing from the uninhabitable games village, Aiyar seems to be having the last laugh. But he has no reason to feel complacent. Many of us knew things would come to such a pass all along, didnt we?

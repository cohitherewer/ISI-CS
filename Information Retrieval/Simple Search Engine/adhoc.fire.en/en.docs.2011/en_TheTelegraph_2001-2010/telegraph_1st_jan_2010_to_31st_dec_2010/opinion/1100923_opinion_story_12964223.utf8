	For the first time, Chinas economy surpassed Japans in the second quarter of this year. Chinas real achievement lies in the way it has created a vast reservoir of trained manpower with a certain standard of public health and food production to support it. China has also built an adequate infrastructure. These have made it a formidable exporter, which has made developed nations fearful of China, since they run huge trade deficits vis--vis China, with the United States of America topping the list by far. They have been clamouring for a stronger yuan, which they claim to be artificially low. China has a colossal foreign exchange reserve of $2.45 trillion with legal restrictions on movement of funds into and out of the country, and buys $1 billion worth of foreign currency a day to keep the yuan from rising. So, can China let the yuan rise significantly and, if so, will this reduce US trade deficit sizeably?        
	The Chinese economy grew by 9 per cent on an average between 1978 and 1993, and the poverty ratio fell sharply from 52.8 per cent in 1981 to 20 per cent in 1993. This had happened before the big thrust towards exports was given by devaluing the currency by 35 per cent in early 1994. Consequently, the ratio of net exports to gross domestic product became 2 per cent by 1995 from -2 per cent in 1993 . Later, it rose sharply from 2004 to reach 9 per cent in 2007 and dropped in 2008 due to the crisis. Thus, it was internal factors  reforms in agriculture, rural industrialization and egalitarian distribution of land-cultivation right, apart from developed infrastructure  that resulted in growth, exports and poverty reduction. The benefits of globalization followed after 2001, when China joined the World Trade Organization. Predictably, the social composition of the Communist Party underwent a radical change during this period. Today, workers and peasants constitute less than 30 per cent of the partys membership as against 66 per cent in 1978, the year China adopted the path of state capitalism.                
	Reverse swing        
	The huge reserve of $2.45 trillion is inflationary because a corresponding amount gets released in the domestic economy. It earns a low return since nearly 70 per cent of Chinas reserves are in dollar-denominated, low-interest assets. Yet, China has allowed the yuan to rise just by 0.5 per cent last June in spite of strong international pressure. Exporters have amassed immense wealth and political power to block a significant rise in the yuan. This would displace workers who cannot be absorbed easily elsewhere, considering that China needs to employ more than 10 million young people every year.        
	US-China trade data shows that Chinas imports and exports were at the same level in 1985. Only once did Chinas exports fall from $337.8 billion in 2008 to $296.4 billion in 2009. In 2001, it rose by 2.3 per cent. In other years, it rose sharply between 10 to 35 per cent primarily because the average US real wage rose 3 times over these 25 years. China took full advantage of this unprecedented prosperity by devaluing the yuan by 80 per cent in stages between 1990 and 1994. But the US failed to increase exports in the expanding Chinese market commensurately. Between 2005 and 2008, the yuan rose by 21 per cent, yet Chinas exports grew from $196.7 billion in 2004 to $337.8 billion in 2008. China managed to cut costs despite the global price rise and stayed competitive even with a higher yuan.         
	The US recovery of 2009 is now fading away and US consumers are spending less. So a significant rise in the yuan can make a sizeable dent in US trade deficit by making Chinese goods dearer in the US and US goods cheaper in China. But it would raise US inflation, given the range of Chinese imports, and it might increase the sale of Southeast Asian goods and European machinery rather than of US goods.

	Stuck in the moment                  
	Sir  One wonders why it takes more than eight months to process the pension papers of retired teachers of state-sponsored colleges in West Bengal. The ordeal faced by the ex-teachers can hardly be exaggerated. The chief ministers slogan, Do it now, has been reduced to a joke by government employees. Their insensitivity to the plight of teachers is appalling. An index of civilized society is the way it treats its senior citizens. Whatever our leaders may claim, it is apparent that we have hardly moved forward on this score.          
	Yours faithfully,        Rudrashis Datta, North Dinajpur
        
	Wasted opportunity          
	Sir  It is difficult to see any justification behind the recent bandhs in West Bengal to protest against the rise in petrol prices (Bad politics and bad economics mix, July 6). The Left Front, in fact, called two bandhs in one week on the same issue, accompanied by the Bharatiya Janata Party. The bandhs inflicted the usual torment on the people  stranded passengers, forced unemployment on the unorganized sector  but what else did they achieve? Nobody believes that bandhs will result in rolling back the prices or stop further rises in future. Since India is a net importer of petrol, which is at the mercy of the producing countries, it is inevitable that Delhi will not be able to subsidize prices ad infinitum. It is also elementary economics that too much dependence on subsidies is ruinous to the economy as a whole.          
	Subsidies, ultimately, lead to sudden and disastrous price rises. Poland in 1970, then in the Soviet Bloc, is a case in point. State subsidies and fixed prices, two cardinal items of faith for the Left, made the Polish economy so stagnant that it was compelled to import food and other items. On the eve of Christmas, the government ordered drastic increase in the prices of food items. This led to protests in industrial cities on the Baltic coast, even though communist governments do not tolerate dissent. The government fired on workers, even as they were returning to the factories, killing and wounding hundreds. Within a decade, the Solidarity Movement rose from the dockyards, the precursor to the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, and ultimately in the Soviet Union.          
	The bandh on July 5 would not have had much success beyond Bengal, had not the BJP jumped on the bandwagon. Yet, when Bengal raised electricity tariff by more than 25 per cent at one go, last year, nobody called a bandh. Bandhs are outright partisan forms of protest, causing losses to the national exchequer and untold suffering to the people. The BJP, instead of trying to harass the government in tandem with the Left, should aim at forming a consensus against frequent bandhs.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  An issue like price rise gave an opening to the opposition parties to find a common agenda for an adult discourse on how to evolve a pragmatic approach meant to benefit the aam admi. Yet, the parties had neither the originality nor the leadership to pool their minds together for a major cause. Instead, they ended up paying lip service to the cause and going back to a time-worn tamasha, limited to the one objective of reaching out to their respective vote banks.           
	If we have a government that is less than sensitive to the concerns of the people, we have a greater worry in the form of an Opposition that is short on maturity and vision. The one scourge of this nation has been the lack of an Opposition worth its salt. For this alone, Indias stature as a democracy remains wanting.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

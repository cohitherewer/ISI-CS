Desai                                                      
	I have been driving through Maharashtra, stopping by in villages. It was in the Konkan  a region I was unfamiliar with although I grew up in Poona. Being a hillbilly, I had the impression that Konkan was one long, flat, boring strip. Actually, there are hills all over it. It is also much greener than the Poona region, which lies in the rain shadow of the Western Ghats. And I was just a step ahead of a cyclone, so the weather was stormy. It was beautiful  less lush than Bengal, but more variegated.        
	I attended some official ceremonies, so I can testify that our governments brand of democracy is alive. Every village had an elected panchayat, with a sarpanch. One was a woman; I am quite prepared to believe that the proportion of women sarpanches reaches the officially mandated ratio of one-third. There was a panchayat office in every village  usually a two-or three-room house. But no village had a hall for large meetings. One cannot expect halls big enough for the entire population, which ranged from hundreds to a few thousand. If the villagers wanted to discuss something, they had to find a neem or tamarind tree. But the most inviting shelters for meetings and other social activities were the schools. In some villages, these were barracks with half a dozen rooms, verandahs and some open ground. Meetings could not be held there without disturbing the school routine. The school became the centre of village political activity faut de mieux; this was great for politics but not so great for the school.        
	Most villages had a temple, some two. Where there was a temple, there would be prayers, which could attract large crowds. So some villages had built sheds to shelter a couple of hundred people. Maharashtra has many holy days; and if prayers were held, there would be prasad, sweets, lunches and dinners. They left their telltale marks; used leaf cups lay scattered on the ground, and some way away, there was usually a rubbish dump, conspicuous for its brightly coloured plastic bags.              
	They are a ubiquitous scourge in India. Delhi is settled on the holy Jumna. Its pious people do many pujas; afterwards they would gather the garlands, put them in plastic bags and throw them into the river. Bags were clogging up the river. So the Supreme Court, which likes to think of itself as the nations missing conscience, took cognizance of the menace and told the local authorities to protect the river. They erected tall mesh fences on both sides of every bridge. The river was saved from direct hits of Delhiites bags; now they must approach the river in a more oblique fashion. And the Supreme Court has not ordered the fencing of bridges outside Delhi, so plastic bags continue to be thrown off the hundred-odd bridges in UP, Bihar and Bengal. But symbolic action has been taken, and the nations conscience has been salved.        
	The strewn leaf cups and plastic bags in the villages told another story  that they were not being cleaned. That is surprising in a country where entire castes are devoted to cleaning; and those castes were clearly not absent in the villages. In fact, some of the villages were clearly demarcated into mohallas for different castes. The distinction was not just between high and low or forward and backward; amongst the erstwhile untouchables, there was a neighbourhood for each pariah variant. There was even one for Buddhists; their conversion did not eliminate caste, but apparently created a new one. And if the castes were residentially segregated, there could be no scope for intermarriage; intermarried couples would have no neighbourhood to live in, if they were allowed to stay alive. So the caste of sweepers persists, but not the sweeping.        
	Seeing the geography of the villages, I understood why the supposedly secular Congress is in practice so casteist, why it blatantly rewards backward castes and perpetuates them. They are indelibly delineated on the maps; all that the Congress is doing is to use the villages geography to its advantage.        
	The reason why we live such clean lives in cities is water out of the tap, and drainage; neither is there in the villages. There is no tap water because there are no overhead tanks; and there are none because electricity is sporadic, if available at all. And without running water, there is no point in piped drainage; the water just runs into open, dirty puddles. And it is because of the lack of electricity, water and drainage that people like us will never live in villages  why, they will never be civilized. This is what the Congress has achieved with nationalization of electricity.        
	And with bank nationalization it has achieved lack of capital; I saw no bank branch in the villages. One can park savings with the post office; but one cannot raise finance for enterprise. For that one must go to the village moneylender; the Congress has been his best friend.        
	The villages I visited are not far from Poona or Satara. So I was surprised to find that hardly anyone had gone to work in cities. The money-order economy, so evident in villages of Bihar, does not exist in those villages of Maharashtra; young men do not go and work in cities and send money. Why not? I suspect there is no work for them. City populations are expanding, and are creating local service jobs for themselves. But there seem to be no growing industries which could absorb youth from the countryside. And, remarkably, there is not much diversification in the villages either. When asked what they did, the villagers said they grew rice. It is subsistence agriculture, just a hundred miles out of Maharashtras cities.              
	But the national product is supposed to have grown at least six per cent a year for the past 17 years; that is over 2.5-fold. Surely it cannot have been entirely jobless; surely those who had plush urban jobs did not appropriate all the benefits of that growth. The successive rounds of the National Sample Survey give no grounds for inferring such concentration; income distribution has not worsened, and unemployment has not grown. In fact, they show diversification in rural job structure away from agriculture. How can I square this national evidence with what I saw in Konkans villages?        
	My present guess is that economic transformation is happening in some regions, and has left others untouched. The contrast between the Goa and Maharashtra I saw was palpable; the further one travelled from Goa, the more static and rural the villages seemed to be. I travelled earlier in south India, where there is evidence of labour migration to towns, and of rural labour shortage in the conversion of rice fields into coconut plantations. There is similar evidence in Gujarat; a high proportion of Surats gem cutters, for instance, is made up of farmers and their sons. So the explanation for the radicalism and sectarianism of the Congress is to be found in the geographical concentration of growth. The country has prospered, but in patches, leaving cesspools where the mosquitoes of radical hypocrisy continue to breed.

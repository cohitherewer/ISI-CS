	Thanks to my children Ive been watching the latest British sensation on YouTube, which is a three-minute clip called Gap Yah. An upper middle-class student, Orlando, is talking on his mobile to his friend, Tarquin, in west London. Orlando is apparently in Burma, travelling the world in his gap yah  gap year  which is what students with rich enough families tend to do between school and university. You might call it poverty tourism. He tells his friend that in Tanzanah, meaning Tanzania, he met a woman who had like, flies around her eyes and who looked at him with this vacant stare but with this sense of enduring hope, yah? For a second he recognized her as a fellow human being. And then, he tells Tarquin, he vomited all over her. Thats what Orlando does: he skips through poor countries, has adolescent insights into their condition, drinks too much, throws up, and then chortles cheerfully at the mess. A hundred years ago a similar young man might have had I say you fellows, what a lark! as his verbal tick. Orlandos equivalent is a lazy way with vowels and consonants, so that yah can mean year or yes.        
	Orlando is, of course, a parody. A young actor and writer, Matt Lacey, created him to satirize, in Laceys words, the great number of people who seem to be leaving these shores to vomit all over the developing world. In Britain, theyre known as Rahs and what they have in common is a private education and a place on offer at one of the older universities: Durham, St Andrews and Bristol are among the favourites, though Oxbridge can never be ruled out. Their sense of entitlement often outweighs their intelligence.        
	None of this is new. You can catch glimpses of Orlandos riotous ancestors in the memoirs of William Hickey which record with a fascinating detail and candour Hickeys adventures in Calcutta in the late 18th century. Like many of his compatriots in Bengal at that time, Hickey drank astonishing quantities of claret and brandy (a detail I remember is his spewing from a carriage window, perhaps in Chowringhee) and persisted with a heavy English diet of roast beef and dumplings however hot and unhealthy the season. Diet alone should have secured him an early resting place in the Park Street cemetery, but he survived to live a long and happy retirement in London.        
	The moralism of the Victorian empire put an end to this kind of public excess  the whoring and gambling as well as the eating and drinking  though the English upper-class buffoon survived as a comic element in literature. In this way, you can see Orlando as a character updated from the novels of P.G. Wodehouse and Evelyn Waugh, as the latest twist in a long tradition. The surprising thing is that despite all that has happened to British behaviour in the years since  the changes, for example, produced by pop culture  the stereotype still endures. How many people are like Orlando? Quite a few, because my children recognized him as a type immediately and its the parodys accuracy that has made it such a hit.        
	And now a paradox: Orlando and his kind are the butt of popular comedy, and yet within a few weeks it seems likely that Britain will elect a new government that has at its heart a group of men who in their youth were just like Orlando. If all goes well for the Tories, the new prime minister will be David Cameron and his chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne. They and quite a few of their expensively educated colleagues share a common background: prosperous families, the very best schools and Oxford University. At Oxford, Cameron, Osborne and Boris Johnson (now the Tory mayor of London) were all members of the celebrated Bullingdon Club, a socially exclusive dining society the purpose of which, so far as any outsider can tell, is to trash restaurants in drunken sprees and then pay handsomely for the damage. Members dress up smartly in dinner jackets and waistcoats. History records quite a bit of throwing-up. The dry-cleaning bills must have been expensive.        
	Today, nobody in the Tory party is keen to remember the Bullingdon Club. Copies of official club photographs from the 1980s showing Cameron, Osborne and Johnson can still be found on the web, though the Tory party is reported to have tried hard to have them withdrawn. Their membership is excused in terms of a youthful indiscretion. Being an Orlando doesnt win votes.        
	How then not to be like Orlando? The answer is to sound more ordinary  no more yah-ing, chuckling and braying, no mention of previous pastimes such as hunting and shooting, a new emphasis on pop music and other demotic pleasures. Cameron now likes to be known as Dave, just as his political model, Blair, was known by all as Tony. Osborne is rumoured to have taken lessons to down-class his voice. The most notable example, however, comes with Camerons wife Samantha  SamCam in the tabloids  who has an impeccable social lineage. Her father is a baronet and her mother by a second marriage is Viscountess Astor. The family has large estates in at least two English counties, and Samantha was educated at one of the best girls boarding schools. And how does Samantha sound now? Her vowels are those of a woman who grew up in a London suburb and attended her local state school. Orlando, we laugh at; Samantha, we like. If her husband wins, as he looks very likely to, hell know that he owes his victory at least partly to social disguise.              
	*************              
	According to the philosophical scientist, James Lovelock, human beings are too stupid to prevent climate change. Lovelock is the sprightly 90-year-old who invented the Gaia theory about the earths enduring ability to sustain life, though not necessarily human life. I dont think were yet evolved to the point where were clever enough to handle [such a] complex situation, he says in a recent interview. The inertia of humans is so huge that you cant really do anything meaningful. One problem is modern democracy, which has to cater for so many views and interest groups. Even the best democracies agree that when a major war approaches, democracy must be put on hold for the time being, he says. I have a feeling that climate change may be an issue as severe as a war. It may be necessary to put democracy on hold for a while.        
	What he means, probably, is that the best minds should use the best science to decide the wisest course of action, and then act  to build the seawall, destroy the oilfield, ration the food  and let the dissenters go hang. It may yet come to that: the dictatorship of the scientifically enlightened, backed by the armed forces. This is almost too depressing to think about, but Lovelock usually has a cheering footnote to his prognosis, which is that Britain is better placed than many nations to survive global warming. Its an island, and therefore more defensible against migration; quite a lot of it is high ground; and climate change might make it warmer, wetter and more fertile  as opposed to the aridity forecast for southern Europe and much of Asia and Africa.        
	Admittedly, this is cheering only if you happen to live in Britain, and not very cheering at that. After a talk by Lovelock, his audience is inclined to leave wondering how they should go about buying a few guns, so that their grandchildren can defend their hill of potatoes from hungry North Africans come 2055. But I am coming to believe his pessimism or realism, and to appreciate the frankness that comes with his very great age. The one certain thing is that he wont live to see it, lucky him.              
	**************              
	An envelope has just been pushed through the front door. I open it to find a letter from the Labour Party, pleading with me to come back as a member. They must send out many thousands of such letters because so many of us have left. Will I? Could I? The causes of disaffection run deep: the Iraq war, self-interested parliamentarians who would sit easily in the legislative assembly of Bihar, an unquestioning belief that financial trading was how Britain would make its way in the world. Still, its a mark of how unattractive the prospect of a Tory government is that Ill sit here for 30 seconds and at least think about it. Watching Gap Yah on YouTube has left its mark.

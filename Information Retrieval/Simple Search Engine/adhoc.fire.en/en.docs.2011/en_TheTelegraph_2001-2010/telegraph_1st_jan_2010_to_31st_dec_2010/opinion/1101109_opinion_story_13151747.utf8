	The ongoing rhetoric against Barack Obama for not verbally assaulting Pakistan in his speeches, hysterically voiced on some Indian television channels, leaves one bewildered. Surely, our senior journalists and some leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party understand that Pakistan needs all the help it can get to stem the rot that has overwhelmed it? Pakistan is in a socio-economic and political situation one would not wish upon ones worst enemy. Vast multitudes of people living there are in turmoil. As an immediate neighbour, and with Kashmir being a congenital problem, we have no option but to join hands with the United States of America to work out a strategy for peace and stability in the region. Therefore, to expect the president of any country in the world to damn Pakistan from a public platform in India is juvenile, jingoistic and makes no sense at all.        
	We have to work hard to ensure that the US, its allies, and India together put a substantive process in place to compel a movement towards the restoration of normalcy. If we do not trust the US, we should not partner it. If we do trust that nation and its leadership, we need to generate ideas, initiatives and dialogues to find solutions, both short- and long-term. India needs a stable Pakistan, a settled Afghanistan, an economically buoyant Bangladesh, a peaceful Sri Lanka, a secure Maldives, a confident Bhutan, and a vibrant democracy in Nepal. Only then will this region of South Asia garner the respect it deserves and make the impact it has the strength to make on the rest of the world. We are one of the largest markets. By dividing ourselves, we are only allowing ourselves to be exploited by a declining West. We are making a mockery of ourselves, and of our composite culture.                
	Heal the wounds        
	Pakistan lobbies have been overactive in Washington for decades. The US had a rather perverted foreign policy in the subcontinent and, over the years, created many a monster in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In the process, it disturbed the region, assaulted its plural cultures, created enemies for life, and destroyed vast areas that were the cradles of several extraordinary civilizations. The USs strong-arm tactics have scarred the people of this region. They are now taking revenge, to put it simplistically. This psychological destruction has to be undone, the minds of those who have been ruthlessly exploited must be cleansed if a fresh start is to be made with the aim of peaceful coexistence. Muslims across the Middle East and South Asia need to be included in the process of renewal. They must trust US initiatives. This will only happen if the larger community feels safe and engaged with.        
	It is for this fundamentally humane reason that India has to be careful when partnering the US in strategic engagements. The often unthinking endorsement of political positions taken by the US, particularly on the defence front, is dangerous, to say the least. Diluting our relations with Iran due to US demands is equally fraught with problems. We cannot afford to alienate a large number of our citizens because of such partnerships.        
	Careful calibration of the relationship is imperative to prevent a backlash from within as well as from our immediate neighbours in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. Joint military exercises between India and the US will most certainly leave India vulnerable to terrible militancy and similar consequences. India should be playing a pro-active role in attempting to change the political trajectory in the region. Obama needs to turn his foreign policy upside down and concentrate on building faith, forging genuine partnerships, reaching out to those areas where few dare  and thereby, live up to his Nobel Prize.

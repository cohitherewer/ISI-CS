	The president of Mexico was furious. Criminalizing immigration, which is a social and economic phenomena, opens the door to intolerance, hate, and discrimination, Felipe Caldern told a meeting of Mexican immigrant groups. Jos Miguel Insulza, the head of the Organisation of American States, was equally angry. We consider the bill clearly discriminatory against immigrants, and especially against immigrants from Latin America, he told a news agency. His point seemed to be that by treating illegal Mexican immigrants as a police matter, the new Arizona law is attacking their human rights.        
	The new law that is causing such outrage requires Arizona police to question people about their immigration status if they suspect they are there illegal. Day labourers face arrest for soliciting work if they are in the United States of America illegally, and police departments can be sued if they fail to enforce the law. Illegal immigrants will face jail sentences of up to six months and fines of up to 2,500 dollars before being expelled from the US.        
	The flow of illegal migrants to the US provides a vital safety valve for the Mexican State, which would otherwise face the discontent of millions of Mexicans who cannot find decent jobs at home. Their remittances are a great help to the Mexican balance of payments. But the widely-held Mexican belief that illegal immigrants have rights in the US is most peculiar. It arises from the fact that for a long time the US has deliberately kept the border with Mexico porous, so that large numbers of Mexican illegals can enter the US to provide cheap labour for American agribusiness.        
	Each year the number of permanently resident illegal immigrants grows: even in Arizona, where there is not a huge demand for agricultural labour, there are now an estimated 460,000 illegal Mexican immigrants. Some argue that they are doing jobs nobody else wants, but that is only a possible reason for letting them stay. It certainly does not give them the right to stay.                
	Mend the law        
	Yet the Mexican government reacts with outraged indignation whenever the US government, or in this case an American state, talks about enforcing the law against illegal immigrants. It has come to think of the nod-and-a-wink arrangement that allows large numbers of illegal immigrants to cross the border each year as the natural state of things.        
	Arizona is calling time on that system, and actually intends to seek out and send home people who are in the state illegally. In most parts of the world, that would not be regarded as unreasonable. What is different in Arizonas case? The implicit charge is racism. The assumption is that American citizens of Mexican origin, and legitimate Mexican visitors will also be stopped and asked to prove that they are in the US legally  and that they will be chosen for questioning on the grounds that they simply look Mexican.        
	President Caldern himself would never be inconvenienced by such a policy, because he does not look Mexican. He looks like your average white American, as does a large majority of the Mexican upper class. But it is true that most poorer Mexicans, including both legal and illegal Mexican immigrants to the US, are of mixed white and Indian ancestry. In other words, the concern is that they will face constant demands from the police to prove they are legally in the US.         
	But the solution for this is simple. Simply enforce the same rules that apply in airport security queues to ensure that nobody feels they are being profiled because of their ethnicity. The Arizona police should be instructed to stop 13 white, black and Asian people and check that they are legally in the state for every person they stop who looks Mexican.Then nobody will have anything to complain about.

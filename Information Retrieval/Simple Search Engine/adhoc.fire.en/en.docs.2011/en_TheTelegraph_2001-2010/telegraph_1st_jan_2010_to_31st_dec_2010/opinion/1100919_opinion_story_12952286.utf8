                              Smooth ride        
	 Trust the Bharatiya Janata Party president, Nitin Gadkari, to spring yet another surprise. The other day, Gadkari hopped on to a solar-powered cycle- rickshaw and went for a merry ride inside the party office! Moved by the experience, he quickly dialled the chief ministers of the BJP-ruled states and asked them to consider including the vehicle in the partys Antyodaya programme that is meant to help the poor and the needy. Officials of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which designed and manufactured the rickshaw, were stumped when Gadkari demonstrated a keen eye for detail and asked them difficult technical questions. The Delhi unit of the party has been ordered to procure these solar rickshaws and then distribute them to the poor. After Jairam Ramesh showed the way, India seems to be full of environmentally conscious politicians. Hence Gadkari cannot afford to be seen as someone who has missed the green bus.                              
	 With the Commonwealth Games approaching, there is no let-up in action on the political front. Aslam Sher Khan, a Congressman and a former Olympian, has already declared that the CWG is a complete waste of money. Not to be left behind, the BJP chief minister of Madhya Pradesh boycotted the arrival of the Queens Baton, describing it as a sign of slavery. Ironically, many of his cabinet colleagues fought to have their pictures taken to commemorate its arrival even as the CM thundered his disapproval. Meanwhile, Mani Shankar Aiyar, who had predicted that the CWG will run into rough weather, literally and metaphorically, is being regarded as some sort of a soothsayer these days. While some Congressmen are gushing about Aiyars special powers, others are of the opinion that he should use them a little more discreetly.                            
	 Still with the CWG. The army is busy guarding Indias borders and fighting dreaded militants. Now, we hear, it may be called in to battle an equally deadly enemy  mosquitoes. These insects have been responsible for creating the dengue menace in Delhi, which will soon be playing host to athletes and dignitaries on the occasion of the CWG. Not just mosquitoes, but the men in battlegear may also be asked to drain out stagnant water from a ditch near the Games Village, the proposed home of the sportsmen. Expectedly, regulars at Delhis Gymkhana Club  a favourite watering hole of retired and serving officers  have been aghast by the news. The air in the club is apparently thick with derisory remarks aimed at the inept civilian authorities who seem to have botched up this simple task as well. Admittedly, given the paucity of time and the inordinate delays in the completion of games-related projects, the government is mightily worried. But pleading with the army to rescue the people from militants and mosquitoes alike has riled conscientious souls who think that it would have been better to postpone the Games.                            
	 The celebrations to mark Sonia Gandhis re-election as the Congress president threatened to turn into a damp squib, but only for a while. The skies opened up on the day Madam was supposed to arrive at Akbar Road to collect her certificate. The situation turned critical, and even the precious document had to be covered in plastic. But the downpour failed to dent the enthusiasm of the Congress leaders. One of them, Janardhan Dwivedi, who can seldom resist an opportunity to display his oratory skills, pointed to the sky and remarked that the days events had shown that the Congress has the strength to overcome all kinds of unfavourable situations.                            
	 The direct tax code bill had been placed in the supplementary list so that the honourable members would be able to scrutinize its details before it was placed in the Lower House. When the MPs got their copies, they were in for a shock. Unlike ordinary bills, this one was 400-pages long and contained countless clauses. On seeing the size of the document, some parliamentarians got busy checking its weight. Others did not dare open a single page.      
	However, some bravehearts decided to turn a few pages. But having failed to find out the important and relevant clauses amidst the deluge of information, they wisely left the ponderous matter to be settled by their party leaders.                        
	It is time to add one more name to the list of Didis critics. No, we arent talking about one of those dyed-in-the-wool Marxists, but of Varun Gandhi. He seems to be convinced that everyone in the UPA government, including the railways minister, is conspiring against him. Varun was recently travelling by train to Ranikhet. During the journey, the train unexpectedly took a wrong turn. Instead of entering the designated platform, it ended up reaching a godown meant for storing goods in Kathgodam. An irate Varun alleged that this was a grave security lapse on the part of the authorities. There could have also been an attempt at hijacking the train, he added. Railway officials, however, ruled out the possibility of any mischief and said it was a case of negligence. But havent these lapses become far too common these days?

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE ROAD AHEAD                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                                    
	The last administrative reforms commission that looked into the ways of redrawing the failed structures of governance presented comprehensive solutions, systems and processes that would get rid of the untenable practices that have suffocated this nation. No one can comprehend the reasons why the prime minister of India mdash; heading the United Progressive Alliance government, with many distinguished and competent ministers in the cabinet mdash; cannot take a concerted decision to implement the reforms that have been submitted. To fall prey to a bureaucracy that sees merit in zero change and no merit in the radical overhaul of a defective system it has operated for decades is unwarranted and detrimental to the future of India. It is degrading to stall renewal in this careless fashion. 
    
	Veerappa Moily led the commission, and is today the minister of law and justice. Surely, he could demand that reforms be initiated with strict time-frames to enable this government to return to power with a full mandate for the Congress in the next elections? The post-election upbeat mood has begun its downslide. The unexpected mandate of more than 200 seats for the Congress on its own was a signal from the people to the party, asking it to prove its capabilities and begin the delivery of goods and services. The signs of that happening have dimmed considerably. A lacklustre attitude to the challenges of bringing change in the fundamentals of governance is corroding the reputation of the Congress. Subsidiary partners at the Centre may have personal agendas that prefer a status quo. But surely, the Congress has a desire to re-establish its supremacy across the country? Why is the party not driven? Why does it want to destroy itself before handing the machine over to the next generation?           
	Spell out        
	With a cast of characters such as P. Chidambaram, Pranab Mukherjee, Kamal Nath, Kapil Sibal, Salman Khurshid, Shashi Tharoor, Ambika Soni, C.P. Joshi, V. Moily, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and younger incumbents such as Jyotiraditya Scindia or Sachin Pilot, all led by Manmohan Singh, India is actually poised to bring about a reorganization of the administrative machinery. These people have the intellectual and other qualities required to enforce change and ensure inclusive governance. They understand the many complicated issues and could work with ease to transform a moribund reality. There is no excuse at all for the seeming lethargy.         
	What stops the prime minister from wielding the whip? After all, he was ready to resign on the issue of the rejection of the nuclear deal. Why not use the same mechanism now to ensure administrative reforms? The latter could transform the lives of ordinary people across the economic and social strata. India needs an answer to this critical query. Start by restructuring the hire- and-fire policy. India does not deserve to be exploited any longer. Basic infrastructure needs to be provided to this energetic and entrepreneurial people who have made good, survived and grown, added to the larger wealth, despite faulty, corrupt governance.        
	When Parliament reconvenes, the prime minister needs to spell out his agenda for India and compel change. A statement to this effect in the Lok Sabha would bring about the corrective required, and encourage sane, intelligent discourse on issues that affect all, regardless of caste, creed, gender or faith. Weigh the options, whip the bureaucrats into action, and sweep away the useless. That is the excitement of leadership. Why allow an inept bureaucracy to hold the country to ransom? The sabotage needs to be exposed. Surely, the ruling political tsars of India want to leave behind a worthwhile legacy?

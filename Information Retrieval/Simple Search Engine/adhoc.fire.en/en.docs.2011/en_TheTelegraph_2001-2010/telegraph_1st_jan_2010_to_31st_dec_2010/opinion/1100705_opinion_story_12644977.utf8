	The word sin strikes the ear as peculiarly old-fashioned, so out of use as to be almost absurd. Yet it has been rather aptly used, conjuring up distant Hippocratic shadows, by a senior physician at a panel discussion on medical ethics in Delhi. The issue was the growing tendency among doctors to accept cash, gifts, travel or hospitality expenses from pharmaceutical companies, which was banned by the government last year. The sin lies in enjoying family jaunts, accepting exorbitant gifts or funds to travel to exotic locations, and, ultimately, incentives to influence research. Patients need to be protected from the biased medical practices that follow from these sins. Yet many senior doctors feel that a ban that insists on penalties for any doctor accepting an incentive worth more than Rs 1,000 is impossible to implement. The medical regulator should at least frame rational and easy-to-follow rules that can be enforced.        
	The other matter for real concern regarding the ban is that drug companies also fund trips for conferences and training. Some doctors feel that an overall ban would harm the funding for continuing medical education and research that may come from drug companies. Learning new medical technologies is essential for doctors  and sponsors, whoever they are, are always welcome. The resources from these companies can actually be used to improve patient care. The head of the new governing board of the Medical Council of India has acknowledged that this search for the middle way poses a challenge. Actually, the challenge is simple and fundamental: it lies in ethical conduct, something that no transparent or rational guideline can enforce. Rules can help, perhaps, but in the end, everything will depend, as the senior physician said at the panel meeting, on doctors regulating themselves. Sin has to do with the soul.

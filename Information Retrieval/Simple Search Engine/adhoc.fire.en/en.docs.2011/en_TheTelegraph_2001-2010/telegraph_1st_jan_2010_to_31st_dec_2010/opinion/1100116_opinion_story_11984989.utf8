                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        REASONS TO REJOICE                              Fauzia Marikar      Music                                                
	The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, held at St Pauls Cathedral on Sunday, December 20, 2009, with the message of goodwill to all people, was in itself a revelation of dedication. It was a joyous musical celebration inspired by the spirit of the Christmas season.        
	The first verse of the opening carol was sung by the hauntingly pure soprano of Shubathra Joshua. The choir was well-balanced and disciplined. This was not surprising since Anjali Sengupta was the choir director. She managed to blend musical harmony with graceful choreography. One must not fail to mention her genius in taming the ancient and recalcitrant Bechstein, which the cathedral has treasured with little maintenance for perhaps a 100 years, and which now refuses to stay in tune.        
	Significantly beautiful was the traditional Good Christian men rejoice! sung solo by Reverend James Stevens who, over the years, has not lost the rich timbre of his lovely baritone. Also singing solo was Sudeep Pande with The star of Bethlehem in his clear tenor, which was rather overpowered by the robust piano accompaniment of the veteran, Conrad Matthew, while the remains of the noble Bechstein fought back with every fibre of its being.        
	It is time the cathedral was given a new piano for the future encouragement of the very talented people who form the choir. Is anyone listening out there?

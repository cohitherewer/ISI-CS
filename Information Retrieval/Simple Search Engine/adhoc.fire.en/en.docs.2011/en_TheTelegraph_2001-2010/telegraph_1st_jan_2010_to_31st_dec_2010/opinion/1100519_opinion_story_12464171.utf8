	Q:Owing to my husbands abusive behaviour, I moved to my mothers house and lodged a general diary against him. However, I often go to our marital house, a joint property, preferably when he is not there. But my husband will not let me keep anything there. He breaks the door if I lock one of the rooms. Does he have the right not to let me use my room or to throw my things out? Dont I retain my rights even if I do not live there but visit the house regularly?        
	Aesha Chakrabarty, via e-mail                
	A: If your marital house is a property owned jointly by you and your husband, then you have equal rights. You are entitled to use the house as well as keep your things there as long as your husband does not obtain a divorce or an order from the court restraining you from entering the premises.              
	Q:The final measurement of the flat that I had booked in 1995 was made by the promoter and me in the presence of witnesses in December 1999. A statement was drawn up and the promoter, the witnesses and I signed it. The promoter then locked the flat, although he had given me the possession letter, and vanished. I filed a suit and won the case ex-parte in 2007. The day after I took over the flat from the bailiff, one witness filed a suit, claiming that the promoter had sold him the flat in August 1999. He also put an advertisement in a newspaper in May 2000 declaring that the original owner of the plot, on behalf of the promoter, had registered the flat in his favour and that hence he was its legal owner. He got an injunction restraining me from selling or renting out the flat. However, during cross-examination he has admitted that he is a signatory in the statement of December 1999 and was aware of its content. What is my legal position regarding the flat which is now under my physical possession?        
	Sibnath Pyne, Calcutta                
	A: Since your case is sub-judice it would not be appropriate to comment on the value of the statement made by the witness or the merits or demerits of your case. You may note that there has to be a registered deed of conveyance with regard to a flat or a property and mere physical possession without a deed of indenture is meaningless and does not make you the owner. In case your flat is not registered, it would be wise to try for a settlement with the other party. Otherwise you could continue to contest the case and wait till the final judgement is passed.

	Reportedly a regular visitor to Ralph Milibands house in Primrose Hill, London, with other well-known left-wing thinkers and activists in the 1970s, Tariq Ali is pessimistic at the prospect of either of the brilliant Miliband offspring leading the Labour Party. In his view, the elder, David, is so tarred with the New Labour  Blairite  brush as to be unable to build an alternative image for the party, possibly one reverting more to old Labour roots, while he writes off younger brother, Ed, as weak and indecisive. David was closely associated with all the Blairite policies, and any hint of Labour change currently being touted by the brothers is, he feels, pure pretence, whatever their intellectual socialist background.        
	As for the other leadership contenders, he does not see Ed Balls as a breath of new air, Diane Abbott is damned as well-meaning but inadequate, and Andy Burnham as Blairite to the core  and same old, same old.... Diane Abbott is at least a familiar face on television, Burnham is, in reality, the least high profile and well-known of the candidates, and his role in the race is probably little more than the effect he may have on vote shares that may upset someone elses apple cart. I doubt many of us would recognize him if we saw him in the street.        
	Ali believes that the unions may still determine the leadership in spite of a record of collaboration with New Labour. Unison, the biggest public sector trade union, has come out in support of Ed Miliband, but the unions no longer have their powerful block vote as decided by their leaders. So individual members voting in secret postal ballot are still in a position to make up their own minds.              
	I wrote in May, after a conversation with the former Conservative Party chair and now chancellor of Oxford University, Chris Patten, of his view that if David Miliband wins the Labour leadership, he may reinforce a new collegiate style of politics at Westminster with less of the unending party tribalism and point-scoring of the past. Patten and Ali were contemporaries themselves at Oxford; their views on a more symbiotic relationship between parties are strikingly different. For Patten, greater party consensus means less time-wasting and improved policy implementation. For Ali, it means swerving towards a one-party State, a situation that he foresees in the United States of America as, aside from the diehard extremes, Republicans and Democrats converge, and likewise in other countries, as ideology is subverted by pragmatism and the essential voice of genuine opposition and alternative is barely heard.         
	He is, of course, right that as everyone looks increasingly alike and moves in a similar direction, we may be lulled into a sense of false security where an easy, non-combative atmosphere in Westminster pervades the country like soothing syrup until other ways and other arguments are smothered and we find ourselves with no alternatives when we need them  or perhaps just forget that alternatives may exist. The argument must be kept going, a questioner is always needed and we should never become so apathetic as to allow the itch to be scratched for us and an unchallenged government to know best.        
	Unlike Andrew Rawnsley, Ali believes that while the New Labour government may be dead, New Labour is alive and kicking and vested in the new party leader, whichever candidate wins that role. The party, with an eye to future power in five years or so, will avoid antagonizing the financial or military establishments and, instead, just bide its all too similar time, waiting for the coalition to break down. As things currently stand, the coalition is doing a better job in some areas where Labour might previously have expected to shine, and there is no doubt that we have reached an odd moment when the Conservative lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice, Ken Clarke, attacks a bang em up prison culture and is accused by his shadow and former Labour home secretary, Jack Straw, in the pages of the press bulwark of the Right, The Daily Mail, of going soft on crime.        
	In fact, so far the coalition government is proving itself a good deal more liberal on civil liberties, reducing CCTV surveillance and looking for change in other areas where the New Labour government pandered happily to the Daily Mail readership. In the current economic situation of course, the Opposition is able to throw accusations at the government of changes driven by cost-cutting imperatives as opposed to a more forward-looking Conservative ideology, especially with regard to crime and punishment.        
	Somewhat flummoxed by Alis generally disappointed view of the end of all things in political argument, I clean forgot to ask his view of our economic problems, remembering only to question him briefly on Afghanistan, never far from our thoughts, and, this week, with the international conference in Kabul and more bodies of young British soldiers arriving home, once again the headline of choice. Not surprisingly he feels, like most of us, that the Afghan war is another disaster like Iraq and one the coalition is aware that we need to get out of. The war is lost or, put another way, is unwinnable. And it is massively expensive.              
	On a small note of greater optimism, the clear and untrimmed evidence of the former head of MI5, Eliza Manningham-Buller, to the Chilcot inquiry, supporting Alis view that our involvement in Iraq had radicalized young Muslims in this country to the extent that an attack like 7/7 in London was inevitable, has led Ali to think that, for a change, the inquiry may not be the sort of total whitewash we saw over the events of Bloody Sunday, as discussed in my last piece, where the truth has taken 30 years to emerge.        
	Finally, and with a view to my recent of his book, The Third Man, I wondered whether Ali did not after all feel that the rash of their-side-of-the-story autobiographies or histories of the New Labour experiment were not laying that ghost to rest or at least offering putative new Labour leaders a chance of a slate wiped clean? The answer was clear: not at all, they are neither here nor there. If they think they are feeding the myth, they are not; neither are they exorcizing the spirit of Blair.        
	Nothing has changed, and whether or not the coalition is fiddling with details, nothing in the political world, here and abroad, is getting better, nor is there any sign of anything new under the sun in our Labour Party whatever it decides to call itself, whoever its leader and whatever smooth face it attempts to present to the public.

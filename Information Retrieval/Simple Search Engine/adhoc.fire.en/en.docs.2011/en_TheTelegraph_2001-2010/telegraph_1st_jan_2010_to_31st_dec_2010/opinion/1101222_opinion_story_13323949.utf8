	The right to free speech is precious and rare. Governments hate it; all of them, not just the one-man or one-party sort. Witness WikiLeaks: the rulers of both America and France, self-advertised cradles of human rights, plainly find Julian Assanges doings on the Web worse than anything he may have done in Swedish bedrooms.        
	Theyre wrong, but they have a point, as he might feel if he found his pillow-talk broadcast to the world. And the issue is a live one. Free speech, till now, existed largely in theory. Anyone could say what he liked, but to whom? His friends, a crowded meeting maybe, but seldom wider: you wont find much Marxism in capitalist media, or anarchism in the States. But no longer: on the Web, you and I today can talk (and listen) to the world.        
	Thats a gain for freedom. But not an unmixed one. Read a few blogs, and youll find logic, common sense, restraint and decency butchered. And the language; at least if its English, and, Id guess, Russian or Cantonese.        
	Is this merely how language grew, from the speech of the common man into the glories of Shakespeare? No: the Web is special. In daily life, few of us give much time to raucous self-assertion and abuse of others who disagree. Too many bloggers do, and they coarsen English.                
	Big question        
	Really? Read the comments on any newspaper website. Indias included, though its English-language readers dont plumb American depths; partly because loud-mouthedness is a very American trait (and by now, in the blogosphere, a British one), but more, maybe, because Americas commonest men speak English and Indias dont.        
	The trouble is not that bloggers are inarticulate; pity they arent. Nor that many never met grammar and cant spell. It is that they use language as a club, not a rapier. If they disagree with someone, its not in their eyes and prose  that he and his views are wrong, but that he is one obscenity and his views another.        
	That opens the big question about free speech: just how free it should be. Its not just governments that want some limits. A British television comedian recently made vile jokes, one crudely sexual, about one specific victim  who is both autistic and just eight years old. The audience laughed. The TV company argued that there must be space for humour like this, and he was just pushing the boundaries. I can think of several obscenities for comedian and company alike. Publicly, Ill just call them mistaken.                
	Not wise        
	Of course, political correctness, which is often mere decency, can be pushed too far. How far that is depends on the context. Was it wrong to write in an email we have a chimpanzee in the White House? Many Afro-Americans might think so. So do I, but only mildly. It was, after all, in a private email (though no wise ambassador in Washington would use it; one can WikiLeak both ways). And who wrote it? Sarah Palin? Some Ku Klux Klan nutcase? No, the wife of brown-skinned Binayak Sen, at whose Raipur trial it was cited, absurdly, as evidence of links with anti-American terrorists.        
	And in fact, as maybe she knew, unlike most who took offence, the phrase arose long before Americans even thought of electing even a faintly coffee-coloured president. I still dont think it wise, and one bloggers use of it shows why: most Obama voters would be happy with a chimpanzee in the White House, they wouldnt know the difference. But its not plainly racist like, say, nigger in the woodpile: a phrase that no context or history can justify, born, alas, long before the Internet.                    thewordcageyahoo.co.uk

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DELICATE BALANCE                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke to a few carefully selected senior media people at his residence the other day to put forth his views on issues that are besieging India. What emerged from press reports left the reader no wiser about whether a reinvented peace process was being pursued in Kashmir, or if there was a clear position on the rape of the environment by big businesses, many of which have begun mega-projects before getting legal and statutory clearances. Attitudes and aspirations have changed, but unfortunately, the men who control the offices of the top leadership seem stuck in a time warp, allowing access only to the converted and keeping away all those who question decisions or demand answers and explanations.        
	We are not a homogeneous group that lives by one faith under one intellectual mindset. Every single corporate chief, NRI or Indian, who wants an appointment with the prime minister, gets it easily. How often does an ordinary professional or a member of an NGO, dealing with the aftermath of a criminal corporate operation as the one in Bhopal, get to meet him? Both constituencies must have equal access if we are to overcome the many divides and forge peace and development, growth and stability. One without the other is disastrous and will only polarize positions, which is unhealthy for a democracy. A prime minister must be accessible to his people, must hear and listen, explain the dichotomies and bring a delicate political balance into play. His team must be cohesive, sharp, open-minded and intelligent, and make the larger governance inclusive. It cannot be seen as pursuing one simplistic line.        
	The exclusive encounters that are put together every now and then, without careful and meticulous planning, prove to be more detrimental than the status quo. The unnecessary and faulty spin given on differing opinions and contradictions, within the government and between the government and the Congress Party, lets down the office of the prime minister. The explanations further accentuated and reinforced the prevailing divide between party positions and government decisions.                
	Against all odds        
	The veiled attack on the minister of state for environment had the corporate world delighted, particularly with the announcement of a cabinet reshuffle before the winter session of Parliament. Multinationals, as we all know, are happy to wait. I was stupefied  how could a minister of state have overruled his prime minister on the small-dam project on the Ganga and Vedanta? Surely, the prime minister forcefully backed the decision. Therefore, why demean a colleague?        
	In fact, 90 to 95 per cent of power, irrigation, mining and other such projects have been cleared over the last year. Why are the editors and senior journalists unaware of this truth? The ones that have not been cleared are Vedanta in Niyamgiri, Posco in Orissa, coal mining in Tadoba, roads running through statutorily declared sanctuaries, the Navi Mumbai airport et al, highlighted by the press because of reasons well know to the public at large. Surely, that is the balance that the prime minister mentioned. He should be delighted with the work done by his minister against all odds.        
	I was surprised that none of the journalists asked about the spiralling corruption that is a huge deterrent for rapid industrialization and good business practice. India has a shameful record of wheeling and dealing, of strong-arm tactics being used against those who do not fall in line. No one questioned the role of the babu in a changing society. Why no debate, no fresh ideas on agriculture vs industrialization in an agrarian society to thrash out a strategy for both to bloom? Surely, it is important to raise such questions with a prime minister who is actively pursuing a higher rate of growth?

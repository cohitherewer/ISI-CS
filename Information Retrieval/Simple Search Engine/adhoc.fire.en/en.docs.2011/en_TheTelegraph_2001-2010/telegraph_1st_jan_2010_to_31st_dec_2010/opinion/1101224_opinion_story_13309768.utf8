	Dearness allowance                  
	Sir  The price of onion has gone up threefold in the market this week (Export ban in onion tear fight, Dec 21). While onion was being sold at around Rs 25 to Rs 30 per kilogram last week, it is now being sold at Rs 90 to Rs 100 per kg. This has made life miserable for the aam admi, who survives on cheap vegetables like onion and tomato. With both becoming dearer, people are having a hard time.          
	Fuel prices have increased by over 17 per cent in the last six months, leading to the increase in the prices of all other essential commodities. The United Progressive Alliance government was voted to power for the second time in the hope that the dreams of the aam admi will be translated into realty. All those expectations have been crushed. The UPA government has not taken any notable step to contain the rise in the prices of essential commodities. For over a year, prices have been on the rise, and this will have a telling effect on the results of the next general elections.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Sravana Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	Sir  The increase in onion prices has helped the merchants of Kerala make a quick buck. On the morning of December 20, the price of onion was Rs 50 per kg. By evening, it had become Rs 80. Although onion is not essential for survival, some gourmands got into a panic over possible onion shortage, and a few unscrupulous merchants made full use of the opportunity. The government of Kerala acts with unwarranted enthusiasm on certain matters, and goes into hibernation on some others. While the office of the minister for food showed no interest in the onion shortage, it tried to sale uneatable items through civil supplies outlets.          
	The Central government at least tried to adopt suitable steps immediately after the price rise. The Kerala government, on the other hand, just sat on the matter. As a result, despite assurances from the concerned ministry that onion exports would be banned till January, and notwithstanding the 13 trucks of onion that arrived from Pakistan, vegetable vendors continue to quote any price they like for onions.           
	Yours faithfully,      
K.A. Solaman, Alappuzha, Kerala

                
	Sir  Considering the fact that untimely rain had destroyed some quantity of onion in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, the agriculture minister should have banned the export of onion at least a month back. The Union minister for agriculture, Sharad Pawar, has failed miserably in discharging his duties. When the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, reshuffles his cabinet the next time, he should either drop Pawar or give him the sports ministry, where he is sure to excel.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The rising price of onion is bound to leave consumers in tears. The weather god has been unkind this year, adversely affecting the produce of the crops. As a result, prices are soaring, and hoarders and speculators are having the time of their lives. The Centre needs to take punitive action against hoarders. Suspending exports till January 15, 2011, and raising the minimum export price are only temporary solutions to the problem. The Centre should fix the maximum price of onions so that the common man can heave a sigh of relief.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ashok Jayaram, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  The Union finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, patted himself on his back saying that lower food prices indicate the declining rate of inflation (Inflation declines to 7.5%, Dec 15). From where does Mukherjee get his statistics? If you go to the market, there is no vegetable available below Rs 40 per kg, while onion prices are now Rs 80 and above. We must be living in an India different from the one Mukherjee spoke of. The finance minister should visit his neighbourhood market the next time he talks about inflation. He also said that by March 2011, inflation should be six per cent. One has to swallow this pronouncement with a fistful of salt since many Marches, Junes and Decembers have passed in which various leaders had hoped that prices would fall. But nothing happened.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

                
	Good work          
	Sir  On behalf of all the hill people, I would like to express my appreciation for the action taken by the Darjeeling police against smokers (Police swoop on hill smokers, Dec 14). Although the ban on smoking in public places has been in place throughout the country since 2008, the law has lost its teeth because of a lack of initiative on the part of law-enforcement agencies. So we are proud of Indrajit Thapa, the inspector in-charge of Darjeeling Sadar police station, who swooped down on smokers at Chowrastha in Darjeeling, arresting 24 people and slapping a fine of Rs 200 on each. People smoking in public places not only harm themselves but also those around them.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Pritten Sherpa, Darjeeling

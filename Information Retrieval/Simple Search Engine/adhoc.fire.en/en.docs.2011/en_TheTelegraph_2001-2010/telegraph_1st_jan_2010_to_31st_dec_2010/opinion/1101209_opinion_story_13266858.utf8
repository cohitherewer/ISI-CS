	Growth pangs                  
	Sir  In Civility will not do (Dec 3), Ashok Mitra criticizes India for slipping down every year in the human development index... even as it attains the dubious distinction of having the largest number of billionaires after the United States of America. It is pertinent here that Mitra has not provided the correct statistics in this respect. As it happens, communist China has more billionaires than India. According to a recent report by Forbes, China has 128 billionaires while India has only 69. That makes China  not India  the country with the largest number of billionaires after the United States of America.          
	The number of billionaires in a country does not reflect its rate of growth or the standard of living of its citizens. The US, despite having the largest number of billionaires in the world, has more or less been able to provide Americans with a good life. On the other hand, Cuba, with no billionaires, has mostly failed to give its citizens even the basic amenities. A countrys development and the welfare of its people depend on a number of other factors, which Mitra ignores.          
	Regarding Mitras inference about the 2G scam, one is tempted to quote the noted economist, Jagdish Bhagwati, who recently said, It is easy to exaggerate corruption we have today. In India, public figures are considered to be corrupt unless they prove to you otherwise. His statement has some truth in it. The media are often too quick to accuse public figures of corruption. Consequently, people start condemning them on the basis of flimsy evidence.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has rejected the inference that Amit Bhaduri draws in his book, The Face You Were Afraid to See. But Mitras rejection of Bhaduris viewpoint is not altogether justified. It is true that despite destitution, malnutrition, illiteracy and joblessness, a small percentage of Indias population  comprising industrial tycoons and politicians  enjoy wealth and power shamelessly. Indias economy focuses primarily on the production of goods and services, neglecting agriculture, which is a source of livelihood for the majority of Indians. Moreover, the evolution of modern technology has made workers more vulnerable to exploitation.           
	Mitra and Bhaduri both decry this model of growth in India. Mitra says that this model will persist as long as the people fail to protest, and till the West has no reservations about outsourcing. He believes that the combat against the States hegemonic power should take place on a political plane. But Bhaduri does not seem to have faith in political parties or trade unions, and believes that a political solution can never work. He has his faith pinned on civil society groups which, he expects, will come together and accomplish the heroic task of smashing to smithereens the conspiracy hatched by corporate bosses and their crony politicians. His vision might be a tad idealistic, but Mitra has also been too rushed in rejecting his views.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Not forgiven          
	Sir  It is bewildering that after 34 years of Left rule, when the political situation is changing and the Left seems to be in its last lap, the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has suddenly realized that his comrades are hotheads (Hot air, Nov 30). But it is still somewhat reassuring that the leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) have started to acknowledge their follies. At the same time, one has to remember that had they not faced several electoral defeats, the status quo would have remained unchanged.           
	Bhattacharjee has never sounded so critical before. Earlier, his haughtiness was more than apparent in his public meetings. Following his example, his comrades  be they senior leaders or grassroots workers  adopted an arrogant stance that has alienated them from the people. The CPI(M) leaders have always tried to lord over their constituents, and any voice of protest has been harshly silenced by them.          
	Despite my ideological differences with the Marxists, for the last 30 years, I have not been able to cast my vote in favour of a candidate from another party as the Burdwan South constituency has traditionally been a Left stronghold. Before 2008, election agents of the CPI(M) used to keep a watch on the proceedings in the booths, where ballot boxes were kept. The situation improved only in 2008 during the Lok Sabha polls, which were largely free and fair. At the age of 73, my father has had to walk in political processions at the beck and call of local party leaders in order to save the family from harassment. Absolute power has corrupted the CPI(M) leaders completely. Immunity from accountability has also emboldened local CPI(M) workers to harass the common people with impunity.          
	Bhattacharjee was in Burdwan a few days back to address a huge rally in the course of the Democratic Youth Federation of Indias district conference. He called for the hotheads to leave the party and apologized to the people for the wrongs inflicted for 34 years. But his repentance will probably go in vain as the people will find it difficult to trust him and his party again. Senior leaders of the CPI(M) should have taken their rectification programme seriously. Any damage-control measure now is unlikely to yield results.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  This refers to the highly informative article by Prabhat Patnaik (The birth of freedom, Dec 7). But it suffers from what in formal logic is called the Fallacy of Composition. The fallacy arises from assuming that what is true of the parts is true of the whole. Thus, if parts of the Indian Administrative Service are corrupt, the whole of the IAS is not corrupt; and vice versa. In terms of how often this assumption is made, it is second only to the Post hoc, ergo propter hoc error (after this, therefore because of this).          
	Yours faithfully,

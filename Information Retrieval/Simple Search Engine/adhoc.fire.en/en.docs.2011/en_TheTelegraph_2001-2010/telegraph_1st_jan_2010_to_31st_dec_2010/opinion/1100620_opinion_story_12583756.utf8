	 Even before Nitish Kumar made it evident that he was not too keen to share the frame with Gujarats superhero, Narendra Modi must have known that he cannot take his popularity for granted. But being slammed within his party? Well that cannot be news either for a man who is accustomed to the jealousy his phenomenal rise has created among his colleagues. Modi seems to be all set to be drafted into the Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentary board. The prime mover of the plan is none other than the partys patriarch, LK Advani. But, and quite expectedly, many of Modis contemporaries dislike the idea. Since it would be foolhardy to oppose the move directly, they have been pointing to several other performing CMs, who, they argue, should not be left out. But many others feel that Modis presence in the parliamentary board would inspire quick thinking and avert faux pas such as the one that happened in Jharkhand. To know who is with Modi and who is not, perhaps all we have to do is carefully study the group photos.                 
	 Rahul Gandhi turned 40 yesterday, and things could not have been going any better for him. The political graph of the young AICC gen-sec seems to be soaring. Soon after the first meeting of the reconstituted National Advisory Council, half-a-dozen members, including apolitical academics, policy experts and civil rights activists, called on Rahul to seek his direction. At his 12 Tughlak Lane residence in Delhi, it is not uncommon to spot the likes of Jairam Ramesh, Anand Sharma and others seeking an audience with the prince whenever he is not busy with his political hunt in Uttar Pradesh.                             
	 The birthday celebrations notwithstanding, these are testing times for the Congress. Arjun Singh continues to maintain his studied silence over the Bhopal gas tragedy. While most of his colleagues appear to be on the verge of losing patience, Singh is a picture of calm. When a close aide called on him at his residence and enquired whether the veteran leader was about to invite disciplinary action upon himself, the former Union minister is said to have smiled and informed his harried guest that silence cannot draw any punitive action.                             
	 Shahnawaz Hussain is no longer the picture of gloom that he was only a few days back. He seems to have got over the shock of being appointed as the party spokesman, and not a gen-sec. Just before the Patna executive meet, he had his first press conference where he was cheered by mediamen. Gushing praise came from Arun Jaitley as well. But what may have triggered this change of mood may be Hussains inclusion in the partys central election committee. Being the only member from Bihar, Hussain is in a position to distribute party tickets in the manner he chooses. What may have been more thrilling for him is that none of his dissenters  Ravi Shankar Prasad or Rajiv Pratap Rudy  has been included in the committee.                             
	 In Shastri Bhavan, the importance of a certain Rawat can never be undermined. Rawat is a peon in the HRD ministers office, but he is an old hand who has seen many ministers occupying the high chair vanish into oblivion. Legend has it that when Arjun Singh was HRD minister and PV Narasimha Rao prime minister, Rawat had accompanied Singh to meet Rao. When the delegation walked in, Rawat is said to have been greeted more warmly than the minister or senior ministry officials. Rawat had perhaps done a good job when Rao was HRD minister in Rajiv Gandhis government. Anyway, the praise does not seem to have made much of a difference to Rawats official status. From 1986 till now, he remains a peon despite the fact that he serves a ministry that claims to monitor human resource development.                             
	 The Union home ministry wants to have a construction force of its own to build roads and bridges in Maoist-infested areas . The cabinet committee is understood to have cleared the ministrys proposal on the matter. The initial proposal  to deploy the Border Roads Organisation to the sensitive areas  has been dropped. Maoists extract money from the contractors engaged by the PWD, and since the state governments do not provide protection to the contractors, it was felt that the home ministry itself had to pitch in with its own security apparatus and its own organization.

	 Close watchers of the BJP have unearthed the formula that LK Advani used to revive the party. It goes thus: Get into the plane and get ready to come back. The aerial connection was made when Advani took along Uma Bharti on a special flight to Raipur to attend a programme. Earlier, he had flown with another rebel, Jaswant Singh, to Jaipur to attend the funeral of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat. Days later, there was talk of the duos return. Jaswant is almost certain to return, but there still remains a hitch regarding Bharti. The Madhya Pradesh state unit is unwilling to accommodate her, fearing all hell will break loose once again.

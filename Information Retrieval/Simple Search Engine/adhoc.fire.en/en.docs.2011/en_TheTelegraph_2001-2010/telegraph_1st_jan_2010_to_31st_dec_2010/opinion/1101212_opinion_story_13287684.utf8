                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ROYAL LET DOWN                                                          
	Lewis Carroll would have done the scene justice. As the Rolls Royce carrying the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall sailed blindly into the heart of an excited mob of protestors, the prince tried waving at the mob through a partially lowered window and giving the thumbs-up while pushing down the terrified duchess and protecting her with his arm. A brick smashed against the car seconds after he had put the window up at a request from one of the escorting officers. Nothing could have demonstrated better, or more comically, the princes incomprehension of  and distance from  what his country is about. What is even stranger is that the protests in which he was caught had not sprung up that day. It was one of a series of students demonstrations that had been gathering in momentum, spread and fury over the last three months, organized against education funding cuts and the huge increase in higher education fees. The movement, now spread among many groups but overseen mainly by leaders who discuss with the police the routes of their rallies, is not only protesting against the deprivation of numerous students who will find universities inaccessible, but also against the duplicity of politicians who go back on their pre-election promises of never allowing fees to rise.         
	The growing violence in a movement that began as fairly peaceful may make the citizens of West Bengal nostalgic. Maybe more so because the anger has gained a sharper edge at the polices alleged high-handedness. One student had brain surgery after being injured by a police baton; students have complained of being abused and called names; the kettling or containment of the groups of protestors for hours in the cold of November 24 was done apparently without drinking water or toilet facilities in spite of what the police said to the media, and the comment of the Metropolitan Police commissioner that during the last incident some among the royal escort were armed and acted with restraint contained an unseemly threat. The suspicion that professional troublemakers are now mingling with the students in creating havoc merely adds spice to the nostalgia.        
	But the closest connection Calcutta may feel with the recent scene in London is the surpassing inefficiency of the royal couples police escort. Although the police commissioner was aggressively defensive  and West Bengal is only too familiar with both tone and rhetoric  to lead the car into a frenzied mob was either insane or quite ethereally stupid. There would have been a clamour for dismissals in West Bengal in a similar situation, however pointless. It seems that dear Mr Goon has multiplied in his native country. Hi-tech communications and riot gear have just made his bumbling more dangerous.

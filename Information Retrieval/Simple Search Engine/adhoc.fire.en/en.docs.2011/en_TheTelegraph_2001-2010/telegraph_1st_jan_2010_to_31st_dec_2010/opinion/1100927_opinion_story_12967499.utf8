	Sir  Rahul Gandhis successive visits to West Bengal this month seem to have led to controversy (Rahul in air, Mamata sees cuckoo, Sept 14). However, his visits probably had less to do with provoking the Congresss prospective poll ally, the Trinamul Congress, than with rejuvenating the Congress in the state and mobilizing his partys youth segment just before the assembly elections in 2011. In his meetings here, Gandhi left no stone unturned in highlighting the Communist Party of India (Marxist)s misrule of over 30 years. He spoke of the violence inflicted by the CPI(M)s cadres on the people of the state, the partys squandering of the Centres money and its inability to do anything tangible for the economic and industrial growth of West Bengal. While speaking of the Congresss alliance with the Trinamul Congress, he heaped praise on Mamata Banerjees leadership skills, but made it clear that his party will not sacrifice its self-respect at any cost.          
	Gandhi seems to have adopted a tough stance in order to place his party in a better position, should a poll alliance and the prospect of seat-sharing with the Trinamul Congress become realities. He should recall the outcome of the municipal elections, where the Trinamul Congress had a convincing victory. The Congress is far behind the Trinamul Congress, and even the Left, in terms of popularity in the state. The West Bengal voter is politically conscious and is unlikely to waste votes on the Congress if it cannot thrust the Left out on its own. A few visits from Rahul Gandhi are unlikely to change that. How far the Congress will be a real force in bargaining for seats with the Trinamul Congress in 2011 remains to be seen.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Mamata Banerjee has become a very seasoned politician. One has to agree with her when she says that she is no seasonal bird like the cuckoo. Her efforts to make her presence felt among the people of the state over the years stand out, as opposed to Rahul Gandhis whirlwind visits to Bengal as part of the Congresss election campaigns. Banerjee is likely to garner more support from the electorate than Gandhi.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Rajiv Gandhi had once called Calcutta a dying city. Yet, since then, the Congress does not seem to have made any real effort to improve the condition of West Bengal, or attempted to oust the corrupt Left government. It was Mamata Banerjee who broke away from the Congress and formed the Trinamul Congress. Her party worked tirelessly to enable people to speak out and exercise their rights. The Congresss stand on preserving its self-respect led the Trinamul Congress to contest the municipal elections on its own, but it was the latter that won. The Congress cannot win the elections alone. If it wants to end the Left Fronts rule in Bengal, then an alliance with the Trinamul Congress is the only way it will be able to do so.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir The editorial, Uneasy allies (Sept 21), correctly analyses the factors governing a possible revival of the Congresss prospects in the state in the context of Rahul Gandhis recent trips to West Bengal. Gandhis integrity and charisma have led him to become very popular with the masses and with young people. His visits provided the boost that the Congress leaders in the state required. The latter should tide over their differences for the greater good of the state.          
	It is true that the Congress is a national party with not just a history but also an ideology that makes it distinct from regional parties in India. The state needs to be freed from the Left Fronts rule that has successfully prevented any form of progress for 34 years. While Mamata Banerjee has been able to garner the peoples support, her party cannot oust the Left on its own. The leaders of both the Congress and the Trinamul Congress ought to put aside their differences and work together to revive the state.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Unlawful presence          
	Sir  December 31, 2008 was the final deadline for the two-stroke autorickshaws of Calcutta to have been taken off the streets. However, even a year-and-a-half later, these autos, distinguishable by their black and yellow colouring, are not hard to spot. Last week, while visiting Krishnapur, I witnessed at least ten of them plying the streets fearlessly. Moreover, there were passengers crammed inside each auto, despite people being aware of the ban.          
	It is well known that these autos are environmental hazards. Most of them have very old engines, emitting gases that add to the pollution. The government needs to take drastic measures to implement the ban on these vehicles. The real power, however, lies with the people. If all members of the public refuse to travel in two-stroke autos, this will go a long way in helping the government get rid of these vehicles. The masses need to be made aware of how harmful these autos are for the environment.          
	Yours faithfully,

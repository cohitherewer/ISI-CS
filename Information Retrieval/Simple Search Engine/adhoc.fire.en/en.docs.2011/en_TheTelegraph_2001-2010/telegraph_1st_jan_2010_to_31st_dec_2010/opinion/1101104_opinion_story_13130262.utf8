The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dont ask for too much
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DONT ASK FOR TOO MUCH                          - A long-term agenda for India and the US        Kanti Bajpai                                                          
	In the build up to President Barack Obamas visit to India later this week, there is a growing view that we should not expect too much from either side beyond the speeches and the symbolism. The question to ask is: what can the two sides want out of each other over the longer term? Running a quick eye over Indias strategic needs suggests that where the United States of America can help India is to build Indian power over the next 30 years. India can do much less for the US. Perhaps the best it can do is to stay engaged with the US, to remain united and to be a bulwark of pluralism, secularism and democracy.        
	Indias strategic challenges over the next three decades are internal security, regional peace and the development of Indian power in terms of the economy, energy, technology and the military. It is only with respect to the last need that the US can substantially contribute. We shall have to judge the Obama visit mostly by what it has helped to lay in place for this last requirement.        
	Indias internal security challenges consist of separatisms in the borderlands, Maoist violence, externally aided terrorism and religious disaffection and violence. The US is not in a position to help the Indian government with any of these except terrorism. On Kashmir, the US can help by not saying or doing anything foolish but little else. On terrorism in India, more generally, given Pakistans sensitivities and Washingtons concerns about global and domestic terrorism, cooperation between India and the US, as we have seen over the past decade, must be limited. Internal security is primarily New Delhis responsibility, and we cannot expect the US to help.              
	With respect to regional peace, the US, once again, is not in much of a position to help India. The best we can hope for is that Washington does not do anything untoward and hostile, wittingly or unwittingly. Our greatest regional security problem is Pakistan. Its support of terrorism, its internal chaos, including growing Islamic extremism and the safety of its nuclear weapons, are huge worries. Its military is not a massive concern: India can deter and defend itself against Pakistans conventional and nuclear forces and will continue to do so. Washington is so heavily dependent on Islamabad for its fight in Afghanistan, and is so worried about its export of terrorism to US shores or the shores of its Western allies, that it cannot push Pakistan beyond a point on terrorist attacks against Indian targets, its internal political arrangements or its nuclear weapons. Probably the best thing the US can do for regional security is to get out of Afghanistan as fast as possible. This will help arrest anti-Americanism and Islamic extremism, and give Pakistani moderates some space in which to recoup and push back radical elements.        
	Indias second regional worry is China. Chinese power is now a global worry, but India has to worry not just about Chinas power in the long term but rather its intentions closer to home  primarily along the border. Except for a brief moment in 1962, Washington has never been of much help here. It has not supported Indias case on the border, and it is unlikely to do much to change its stand. During the second half of the Cold War, it was an ally of China. After the Cold War, both Bill Clinton and Obama have made unhelpful statements in public about a US-China partnership on managing South Asia.        
	The much bigger concern for New Delhi is that in its obsession with Iraq and Afghanistan, Washington has missed the strategic woods for the trees. While the Americans have been preoccupied with the war on terrorism, the Chinese have grown massively economically and militarily, they have bullied every major Asian power (India, Japan and Vietnam) over the past five years, they have frightened all the Southeast Asian states with their most recent behaviour in the South China Sea, and they have introjected themselves into Africa, Latin America and, most recently, with the Greece bailout, Europe.        
	The difficulty for New Delhi is that Washington does not look likely to turn things around in the near future. The US political system is in a logjam between right-wing forces and a more moderate centre. President Obama is in deep trouble domestically and will arrive in India after a drubbing in the midterm elections in his country. The economy has not recovered from 2008, and no one in the US knows whether it is better to fix the deficit and encourage the market or to spend more in an effort at revival. The US military is in some confusion after Iraq and Afghanistan. Opinion polls show that Americans are deeply pessimistic about the countrys future and are already conceding that they will have to play second fiddle to China. In short, the US has lost its lan and its sense of mission. While India does not want an overweening, rampant US, it does not want China to have that role either, and a solid, long-run balance of power between the two leading powers is vital for its interests.        
	The most useful thing that the US can do for India is to slowly, steadily and as unobtrusively as possible build Indian power. India needs economic growth at the rate of 8-10 per cent over the next 30 years if it is to take its hundreds of millions out of poverty and to match Chinese power (China is currently four times Indias size economically and could soon be six times as big). It needs foreign trade and large infusions of capital. Indian power in the future requires technology  military and, more particularly, non-military. Without a huge supply of non-renewable and renewable energy, India is going to run out of steam, and its economic growth will grind to a halt. Renewable, alternative energy is the biggest challenge ahead. Finally, India has to have a robust military.              
	The US can help in all these areas over the next 30 years. It must try to work with India on maintaining an open trading system and responsible use of finance capital. It should try as quickly as possible to lift as many of the technology controls and limits on Indian entities, private as well as governmental, and to collaborate on joint projects. The two countries must see how they can encourage their private sectors to develop and make various alternative energy systems commercially viable. The USs arms sales to India in key areas, without breaking the Indian exchequer, is another area of cooperation, and the necessary agreements paving the way for this should be signed.        
	Washington must find its way of doing all this without much hope that Delhi can do a great deal in return. A united, prospering, stable, pluralistic and secular-democratic India is crucial for regional and world order and for US security interests. No Indian leadership can be too ostensive about a relationship with the US, given suspicion of the US. In that sense, a modest, workmanlike, undramatic presidential visit is better than one that has too many flashy agreements which will ask too much of any Indian leadership.

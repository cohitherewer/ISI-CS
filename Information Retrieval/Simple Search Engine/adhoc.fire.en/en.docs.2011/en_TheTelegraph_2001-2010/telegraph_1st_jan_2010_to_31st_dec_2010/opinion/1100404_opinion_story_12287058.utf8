	Difficult journey                  
	Sir  The Metro extension to Garia has benefited many passengers. But it has also increased the load on the existing infrastructure. Even being able to stand comfortably inside the Metro compartment has become a luxury. Overcrowding inconveniences all passengers, especially women and senior citizens. New trains should be introduced and the frequency of trains increased. Plans should also be made to have separate bogies for women and senior citizens. This will certainly benefit the commuters.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Large gaps          
	Sir  It is a good idea to educate all children between the ages of six and 14, but one should also keep in mind some of the basic problems faced by the common people of India (Right to school but halfway, April 1). Most people in this country do not have a large income. For them, food and shelter are the primary needs, not education. A starved child needs food first and books later. Besides, child labour is still a prominent phenomenon in India. How many of us will allow our domestic help to study by freeing them from their daily chores? If the governments aim is to spread education among the underprivileged, it should first take steps to ensure that these people earn sufficiently to lead a decent life.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Right to education has been made a fundamental right for all children between six and 14. Is this new law intended to make a fool of citizens? Can this fundamental right, by itself, get rid of illiteracy? There are many other fundamental rights, but to what extent are the people of India able to exercise them? The right to education will hardly benefit the children who are victims of child labour and other heinous practices. Few people living below the poverty line prioritize their childrens education over better living conditions. They often force their children to do menial work or sell them. For proper implementation of the law ensuring the right to education, poverty must be eradicated, superstitions need to be wiped out and mindsets need to change. This calls for a government that has foresight and zeal, and one that believes in immediate action.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Bad deal          
	Sir  From the news report, Dowry: own up and escape (March 20), it seems that the revised anti-dowry law is providing the brides family with an option to first pay dowry and then lodge a police complaint against the grooms family. Why should dowry be paid in the first place? The brides family can refuse to agree to the marriage if dowry is demanded. Moreover, how can it be proved that the brides family had given cash and valuables as dowry? Even subsequent demands for dowry may be difficult to prove.           
	The case of the girl from Burdwan who walked out of her marriage after dowry was demanded is an exception. Also, in this instance, the girl protested only when the grooms family insulted her father as he could not arrange for the entire sum. Had her father been able to arrange for the full amount, the incident may not have taken place. Complaints by a third party may also not hold good when both the families involved endorse such transactions. The menace of dowry cannot be done away with so easily. It is a social evil that can be rooted out only by raising awareness in society.                    
	Yours faithfully,

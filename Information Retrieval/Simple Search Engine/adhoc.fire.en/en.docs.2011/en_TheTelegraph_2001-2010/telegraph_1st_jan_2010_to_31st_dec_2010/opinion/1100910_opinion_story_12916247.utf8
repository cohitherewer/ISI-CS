	With the Union cabinet approving the revocation of presidents rule in the state, Jharkhand will finally get another elected government. But that is no guarantee of either a stable regime or an effective administration. Since its creation as a separate state in 2000, Jharkhand has had eight governments. Political instability has gone hand in hand with the gradual collapse of the administration in the state. This was no surprise because the short-lived governments were always busy with all kinds of manipulations in order to survive and had little time for governance. And this happened irrespective of the parties or alliances ruling the state. Arjun Munda, who is to head the next ruling alliance of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and several smaller parties, should know what it takes to keep a government in Ranchi alive. His predecessor, Shibu Soren, who had headed three previous governments, had allied with the Congress and the BJP at different times. But corruption and other criminal charges against Mr Soren and Madhu Koda, a former chief minister, showed how the leaders betrayed the tribal peoples dream. However, the two national parties had no qualms about using such leaders in order to grab power in Jharkhand.        
	The return of an elected government should at least stop the drift in Jharkhand, one of the most lawless states in India. The Maoist insurgency has fed on the vacuum that non-functioning governments and a self-serving bureaucracy created. Yet, good governance is crucial not only to the people of Jharkhand, who are among the poorest in the country, but also to Indias new economic agenda. Three states  Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa  have the largest share of Indias reserves of coal, iron ore and other minerals. How the country exploits its mineral wealth may largely decide the future of its economic growth. The irony is that the poorest of Indias poor, mostly tribal people, live in this mineral heartland. There is an inseparable link between the new era of mining in India and the rise of Maoism. Reducing the level of poverty among the people in this vast hinterland has thus become more important than ever before. Indias new development paradigms are on test in states like Jharkhand. A responsible regime in Ranchi is a matter of national interest.

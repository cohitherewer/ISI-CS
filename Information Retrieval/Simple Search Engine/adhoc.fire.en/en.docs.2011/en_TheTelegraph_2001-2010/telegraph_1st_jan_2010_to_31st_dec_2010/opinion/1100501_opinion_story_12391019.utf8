	Two puny figures, probably a man and a woman, are about to disappear round the bend of a forested mountain path, which itself is slowly vanishing in the rising mist. The forests of the night are incandescent in the flickering glow of fireflies, and seem to sway eerily with the moving light. Inscribed in Santanu Roys canvases is a feeling of movement that is almost akin to stillness (The Soul of Nature, Academy of Fine Arts, April 22 -28). This sense of the fluidity of the immobile is a peculiar characteristic of mountains, which Roy paints again and again.        
	Roys watercolours exude the scent of greenery. The artist can capture the way in which different shades of green merge with one another, or lose themselves in black and blue on mountainsides. The dark colours induce an effect of gloom and closeness which is set against the impression of freedom in the white of the sky or of the mists.        
	In one of the watercolours, a white gash in the middle of what looks like a bamboo grove opens the door to another world of shadowy shapes. Seen from a different angle, the white seems to assume the form of a contorted, elongated face trapped within the mossy green. This painting has the quality of those dreams which torture the dreamer with a vague sense of menace that cannot quite be put into words.         
	Roy has mastered the art of painting in watercolours with which one rarely experiments these days. His art is unassuming but no less remarkable for that.

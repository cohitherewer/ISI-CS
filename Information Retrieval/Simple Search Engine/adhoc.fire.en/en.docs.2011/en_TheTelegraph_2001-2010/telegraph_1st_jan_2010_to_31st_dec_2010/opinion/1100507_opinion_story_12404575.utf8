	Trust deficit                  
	Sir  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met his Pakistani counterpart, Yousaf Raza Gilani, at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation meet in Thimphu, prompting a positive change of mood among Indians (Singh, Gilani set for Thimphu date today, April 29). However, it should be noted that history repeats itself. In this case, it is a history of attempts at dialogue that have all ended in a fiasco.          
	To begin with, democracy in Pakistan has always been fragile. In a country plagued by military coups, hardly any democratic government has been able to complete its term. In the years following the Simla Agreement, the then prime minister of Pakistan, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, was deposed and replaced by General Zia-ul-Haq. Later, Benazir Bhutto, who had engaged in peace talks with Rajiv Gandhi, was removed from power on charges of corruption. In 1999, the much-fted Lahore bus service was inaugurated and the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, started the peace process with Pakistan. The upshot was the Kargil war, in the wake of which there was a military coup, replacing the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, with General Pervez Musharraf.          
	It should be kept in mind that the Pakistan government has limited power to make decisions for the country. The Inter-Services Intelligence and the army play an important role in determining the course. It is also well known that the ISI is active in creating unrest in India. The Pakistan government is powerless to take positive action, in spite of being given proof that Pakistani elements have been involved in terror acts against India. Terrorist attacks continue and Pakistan has become a haven for smugglers and criminals on the run from the law in India. All Indian efforts at extraditing these miscreants have failed. Nevertheless, India hardly ever raises these issues during talks with its neighbour. In international fora, Pakistan professes to be anxious for peace with India, but there are doubts about its sincerity. Perhaps it is time to include the ISI and the Pakistan army in bilateral talks. Indian leaders, however, seem to lack the force and vitality to take firm steps against Pakistan. They are satisfied with dialogue that is bound to end in failure.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The front-page report in The Telegraph, along with photographs of bonhomie between Manmohan Singh and Yousaf Raza Gilani, made for an amusing read (Blanket signal for Pak talks, April 30). Such scenes of amity are prominent after every international meet, and make good material for circulation among the Indian public. Two factors must be brought into consideration when viewing this rosy picture. To begin with, Pakistans actions are largely guided by a desire to placate Washington. In reality, nothing has changed in Islamabads attitude to New Delhi. Even now, Pakistan is not anxious to establish normal relations with India. Secondly, the Indian prime minister may also be playing to the gallery. He has affirmed that he is willing to walk the extra mile to restore peaceful ties with Pakistan and is even prepared to overlook terrorist activities in India sponsored by its neighbour. This soft attitude towards Pakistan may be partially motivated by considerations of the Congresss minority vote bank in India.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Honour at stake          
	Sir  It is a matter of shame that even today, when inter-caste marriages are commonly accepted, a tragedy like the death of the Delhi-based journalist, Nirupama Pathak, should occur (Dad invoked God to scare daughter, May 5). India, however, has always been fraught with bloodshed and mayhem arising out of caste and religious bias. The recent incident continues this gory tradition.          
	In this case, the main cause of dispute was that Nirupama, a Brahmin girl, dared to dream of marriage with Priyabhanshu Ranjan, a Kayastha. Nirupama postponed her marriage and tried repeatedly to convince her parents to consent to it. Her father, however, remained adamant that an inter-caste marriage would fail. Shortly afterwards, Nirupama was found dead in her home in Koderma.          
	It is preposterous that incidents like this should occur at a time when India has begun to feature prominently in the global scene. It is ridiculous that they are being allowed to take place. In recent times, there has been a furore over allegations of corruption in the Indian Premier League. Meanwhile, genuine social problems in the country remain neglected. All this makes one laugh at Indias vanity about being one of the fastest developing economies in the world.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Tuhin Bhattacharjee,Belur, Howrah

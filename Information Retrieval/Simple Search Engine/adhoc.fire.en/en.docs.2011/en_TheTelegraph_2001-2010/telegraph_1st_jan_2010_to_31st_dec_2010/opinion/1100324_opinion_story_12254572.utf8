	Q: I had bought a flat in a building complex in 2005. The promoter gave the completion certificate to the flat owners although some major work was still pending. Meanwhile, he has been collecting maintenance charges from us. He has not handed over the job of maintenance to our building association on the pretext that some flats are yet to be sold. Can he keep the maintenance in his control for an indefinite period?        
	Janaki Nath Bera Calcutta        
	A: Since the promoter has executed sale deeds in favour of the flat owners and thereby conveyed his right, title and interest with respect to the building, it is implied that he has surrendered all rights to the flats, including that of maintenance. Moreover, since the flat owners have formed an association, the promoter should not continue to control the maintenance of the building. If a few flats are yet to be sold, the promoter can participate in and become a part of the association but cannot arbitrarily control it.        
	Q: My original tenant died about 25 years back. The tenancy passed to his wife, who stayed on with her children till her demise last September. Will the children have the right to remain as tenants? If not, should I issue a legal notice for eviction?        
	Durga Ghosh Calcutta        
	A: Yes, the children do have the right to stay on as tenants but for a period not exceeding five years from the date of the death of their mother, who had inherited the tenancy. Hence, you cannot send a notice for eviction to them unless you can establish any other grounds available under the provisions of The West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1997.         
	Q:I had bought a flat in my wifes name but she passed away before the mutation could be done. I have only one married daughter and want to transfer the flat to her name. How should I go about it?        
	Sambhu Nath Banerjee, Madhyamgram North 24 Parganas        
	A: Since you and your married daughter are the only legal heirs of your late wife, you are now joint owners of the flat in the ratio of 50:50. If you wish to transfer your share of the flat to her, you would have to execute a registered deed of gift in favour of your married daughter in accordance with the provisions of The Registration Act, 1908.

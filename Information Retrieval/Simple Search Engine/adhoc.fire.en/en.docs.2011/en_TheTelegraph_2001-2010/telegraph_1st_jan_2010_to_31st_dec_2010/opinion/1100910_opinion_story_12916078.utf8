	THE OXFORD BOOK OF   PARODIES    Edited by John Gross,     Oxford, 16.99  
	The simple definition of parody is an imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist or genre with deliberate exaggeration to evoke ridicule. Sometimes imitation can also be a form of flattery. The historian, David Cannadine, once reviewed a book of essays by A.J.P. Taylor in the latters characteristic prose style. Parody often does border on the burlesque but it can also be affectionate, a send-up as a salute. But this should not blunt the fact that parody can be a very sharp instrument of satire and lampoon.  
	John Gross, who has put together this enjoyable anthology, is not tied down by the knotty question of definition. He keeps it broad, thus allowing himself to include a large variety. One problem with the full enjoyment of a parody is knowledge of the original. Most parodies, Gross notes, are aimed at a writers general style rather than at a specific work. Gross indicates the original, including sometimes a quotation from it. This helps when the work is unknown or unfamiliar to a reader.        
	The anthology opens with a gem from two master parodists  Sellar and Yeatman, who wrote the greatest ever spoof on history textbooks in their immortal 1066 and All That. In the section, Anglo-Saxon and Medieval, we read the following from the duo: Syng a song of Saxons/ in the Wapentake of Rye/ Four and twenty eaoldermen/Too eaold to die.        
	Moving across time and staying with rhymes, here is a parody of A.A. Milne by J.B. Morton called When We were Very Silly: John Percy/said to his nursy,/ Nursy, he said, said he/ Tell father/Id much rather/He didnt write books about me./ Lawkamercy!/ Shouted nursy,/ John Percy, said she,/ If dad stopped it,/ If dad dropped it,/ We shouldnt have honey for tea.        
	Imitating Bertrand Russell in Portraits from Memory, Alan Bennett and his colleagues in Beyond the Fringe wrote, One of the advantages of living in Great Court Trinity, I seem to recall, was the fact that one could always pop across any time of day or night and trap the then young and somewhat beautiful G.E. Moore into a logical falsehood by means of a cunning semantic subterfuge. I recall one occasion with particular vividness. I had popped across and knocked upon his door. Come in, he said. I decided to wait awhile in order to test the ethical consistency of his proposition. Come in, he said once again. Very well, I replied, if that is in fact truly what you desire.        
	Everyone will find his or her own favourite. Students of literature tired of reading postmodern literary criticism will revel in Frederic Crewss spoof of that genre. They will also enjoy how Wordsworth would have remembered Little Bo-Peep (this is by Percy French and I give only the first verse), I walked with her upon the hill,/ Her grief was very deep,/ Her tears were running like a rill,/For she had lost her sheep. Keep this book by your side to dip into whenever you want a laugh and to marvel at talent.

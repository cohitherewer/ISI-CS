The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Not exactly thrilling
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT EXACTLY THRILLING                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Comedy thriller? An oxymoronic hybrid that, understandably, finds success more difficult to achieve than either of its parents. Even the formidable Neil Simon couldnt make Rumours (1988) match the ultra-long runs of his top box-office hits. In fact, it turned out neither a comedy nor a thriller, more a satirical farce. By setting it on the wedding anniversary of New Yorks deputy mayor, Simon gave it a delectable political edge, as upper-crust guests arrive to discover their host shot in the earlobe and hostess missing, and try to cover up what they think is a scandal.        
	Theatrecians Indianization omitted this angle, though it could have hooked our audiences, accustomed to politicians peccadilloes. Kanak Gupta directed for pure entertainment, oblivious to Simons late-age serious aims. So, the jokes became pointless beyond a certain point. But Gupta did give a break to several fresh faces. Rukmini Sircar handled the meatiest, sincerest part maturely. Yamini Periwal, after a natural performance as Honey in Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, again characterized a trophy wife here, so must work on variety. Tathagata Chowdhury portrayed a Bengali-accented shrink as if himself in need of therapy (the three of them pictured above). But Rahul Prasads caricature of a Punjabi entrepreneur relied heavily on horse laughs, while the two cops formed the weakest links, shown as stereotypical clowns.        
	Sangit Kala Mandir and Sanskriti Sagar presented Stage Fusions Road to Hell, a title that honestly indicates the route the production took. Based in Guwahati, Stage Fusion has grabbed a foothold in Calcuttas clubs, but evidently aspires to higher turf. They can postpone this goal until they improve their play selection. The West End source, Gerald Moons Corpse! (1984), had little to commend it, and their amateurish adaptation even less. A down-and-out actor plots to kill his rich identical twin by hiring a cash-strapped former army major. Ridiculously incredible things happen. If the evil sibling hates his brother so much, why does the latters portrait adorn his wall, and why doesnt the hitman ask him this very same question? Any number of fingerprints remain on the scene, of both the murderer and his employer (who never wears gloves). To top it all, since the former is eventually exposed as the prodigal father, surely he should have behaved more circumspectly about the situation from the beginning?        
	Obviously the twins meant a promising double role, but Bijoy Chaudhuri could only distinguish them by donning spectacles for one, while his costume remained intact! He didnt even attempt to differentiate voices or gaits. Manash Das transformed the unlikely assassin into a nervous numskull. The director, Rupa Hazarika Som, acted the drunk landlady forgettably. If all this was supposed to be funny, it had the opposite result.

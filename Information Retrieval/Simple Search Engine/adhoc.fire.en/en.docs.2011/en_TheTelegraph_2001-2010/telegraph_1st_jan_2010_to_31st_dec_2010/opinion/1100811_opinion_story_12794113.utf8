	For all its flaws, democratic politics can help where other measures fail. For the hapless people of Lalgarh, death, fear and despair have stalked their besieged lives for over two and a half years. It has not been their fault, but they have been forced to suffer from the battle between the security forces and the Maoists. Adding to their woes was an incompetent government which withdrew at the first sign of unrest in the area. It is too early to say how much, if anything, would change in the lives of the people of Lalgarh after Mamata Banerjees rally there on Monday. But her decision to hold the public meeting there has already effected a big change. She has successfully demonstrated that it is possible to initiate the political process there. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, should have actually welcomed the initiative. He and his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), never tire of underscoring the need for reviving the political process in Lalgarh. On the ground, however, they seemed to depend almost entirely on the anti-Maoist operations by the police and the paramilitary forces. Ms Banerjees triumph stands in stark contrast to the governments  and the CPI(M)s  failures in Lalgarh.        
	True, the support publicly extended to Ms Banerjees rally by the Maoists and the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities raises some questions. Some of these can even be embarrassing for the United Progressive Alliance government, of which she is a member. It is also possible that her campaign in Lalgarh is aimed at scoring political points with the CPI(M). But none can object to her call for peace and development in Lalgarh or her appeal to the Maoists to abjure violence and join negotiations. The UPA governments policy on tackling the Maoists also hinges on dialogue and development, even as it carries on the battle against them. Not long ago, the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, made a similar appeal to the rebels to give up violence and join peace talks. Irrespective of what Ms Banerjees political aims are, she would serve a national cause if she can persuade the Maoists to give up arms. For the people of Lalgarh, the important question is not which political party gains control of the area. What matters to them is what matters to people everywhere: peace, freedom and a life of dignity.

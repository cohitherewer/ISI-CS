                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SORRY PLIGHT                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	The production of combat aircraft in India simply refuses to take off, the investment of millions notwithstanding. Every fighter plane of the Indian Air Force continues to be of foreign origin. The sole indigenous fighter programme, Tejas  the feasibility study of which began in 1983  is expected to have its initial operational capability declared with delivery of half a squadron at the end of 2010, and full operational clearance is likely to be had by December 2014. By then, it would be more than 31 years since India started the enterprise to launch its indigenous fighter aircraft.         
	As if the ceaseless failure to build our own fighter was not bad enough, there is now the distressing news that India cannot even produce basic trainers for its budding pilots. Hence, the IAF will begin field trials with at least six competitors to supply New Delhis desperate need for basic trainers.         
	But the fact remains that India, despite being one of the top five military powers which can manufacture nuclear weapons, cannot design or produce fighters and basic trainers for its air force. If foreign suppliers take this fact for granted, they will not only fleece India but will also never supply the best and the latest at any given time. Also, when the customer is at the mercy of foreign manufacturers, do not expect any concession on the price tag of the imported stuff.         
	Understandably, India will rue her failure to match, or catch up, with the Chinese aviation industry next door. The success of China in this regard is a reminder of Indias lamentable lack of enterprise. Yet the situation was not like this even a few years back. In the early 1980s, both India and China had a more or less similar development curve. For all her faults, Indira Gandhi was keen on indigenous enterprise.                
	Easy path        
	Thus, the HJT-16 trainer aircraft was designed by an Indian team led by V.M. Ghatge to meet the needs of the IAF. India also was to build the HAL Ajeet tandem two-seat operational trainer. On top of all, however, was the development of the HAL HPT-32 fully aerobatic piston engine basic trainer, which is now grounded.        
	The Chinese too were trying to be self-sufficient in aircraft production. They took the Soviet-origin designs of MiG-17, MiG-19 and MiG-21 while attempting to come out of their dependence on imported military hardware and technology. Thus Chinas Shenyang Jianjiji-8 (fighter aircraft) was the subject of an advanced combat programme initiated by Beijing in the early 1970s. China also launched her Harbin Hongzhaji-5, the equivalent of the then Soviet Ilyushin-28 tactical light bomber.         
	Thus, in spite of a modest beginning, Beijing soon gave a fascinating and fierce demonstration of its determination to dominate the airspace with an array of home-grown flying machines. The contrast with India is stark, real and wide. And it is widening by the day. Today, one of the main features which distinguishes China from India is that whereas Beijing faces numerous restrictions, embargo, sanctions and the like on military hardware and technology transfer from the West, India does not face any such hurdle. When cash-rich India gets the best straight off the shelves, why should it even attempt to be better than the best?        
	Today, India is at a crossroads on defence hardware acquisition. What began long ago as a cherished dream to attain self-reliance in defence technology appears to be fast giving way to the easier path of import. This easy path to defence modernization constitutes an even easier path to prosperity through acts of commission and kickbacks for which the country is famous. The unending imports and the absence of indigenous technology create a win-win situation both for Indians and rule-breaking foreign arms dealers.

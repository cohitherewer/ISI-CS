	Two plays by Girish Karnad are on at Padatik, both directors having similarly altered the authors designs, giving us occasion to discuss interpretive licence which overshadows the fine performances themselves.        
	The home company invited Rajinder Nath to direct Bikhre Bimb  Padmavati Raos Hindi translation of Broken Images  which had premiered under Karnads own direction in 2005. The original had proved a tour de force, simply because Karnad incorporated a large screen on which, suddenly and eerily, we found the actress in live-feed video talking back to the taken-aback actress on stage. Cleverly innovative as always, Karnad declared, The 21st century is the age of the electronic image ... [here] without warning, her own image decides to play confessor, psychologist and inquisitor.        
	However, Rajinder Nath writes, video in theatre is to admit the limitation of theatre  the image becomes larger than life and the Actor is diminished. The first objection is purist and absolutist; in fact, Piscator and Brecht began inserting footage in productions as early as 1925, subsuming film to theatrical objectives. The second point is precisely the challenge that a stage actor must overcome; Karnad virtually throws down the gauntlet and, in his own production, Arundhati Raja picked it up and showed herself equal to the task. But Anubha Fatehpuria and doppelgnger Chetna Jalan (picture) do not get this chance to confront the only magic in this monodrama; technology.         
	In OGLAMs version of Hayavadana, in Sankha Ghoshs Bengali translation, Janardan Ghosh splits Padmini between two actresses to convey her opposite desires. As a result of this schematic direction, we lose her characters complexity. Ghosh prevents Antara and Simran from exploring and expressing Padmini fully because each must portray half of her. Ironically, therefore, Krishnendu and Rana (Devadatta and Kapila, respectively) appear stronger performers, supplemented by their martial-arts ability  though their fight should never be equal because one has greater strength than the other.Ghoshs best decisions are depicting Kali, the most coveted role next to Padmini, as a paan-chewing cynic and discarding the problematic textual indication of Padminis death by sati. He presents an intro and an outro outside the hall, where an artist sculpts masks, but his own explanations there are unnecessary. Instead, he should allow Karnads script to complete itself: he stops it at the close of the inner tragedy, whereas Karnad goes on to draw a full circle to the frame stories as well, of Hayavadana and the Bhagavata. Nevertheless, we notice a marked maturity in OGLAMs development.

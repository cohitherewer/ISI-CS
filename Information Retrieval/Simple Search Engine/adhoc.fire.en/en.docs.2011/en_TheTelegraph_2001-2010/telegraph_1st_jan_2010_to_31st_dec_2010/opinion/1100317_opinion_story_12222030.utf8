The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The art of deception
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE ART OF DECEPTION                          - Nirupama Raos visit would serve notice on the Obama administration        Diplomacy -   K.P. Nayar                                                        
	Camouflage, sometimes bordering on deception, has been a part of diplomacy since the earliest record of diplomats among mankind in Mesopotamia in 3,000 BC. There was a time when the United States of America, with its infinite resources, mastered the art of deception as an instrument of its foreign policy.        
	A high point of such diplomacy was the secret trip made by Henry Kissinger to China through Pakistan to facilitate Richard Nixons historic opening to Beijing under Mao Zedong. Since then, smaller men have attempted poor copies of such deception, as in the case of Colin Powell who went to New Delhi in 2004 professing Americas friendship only to fly to Islamabad a day later and gift General Pervez Musharraf the status of Washingtons major non-Nato ally.        
	Whenever India attempted camouflage as an instrument of its external affairs, these efforts have ended, more often than not, in disastrous consequences. One such attempt was a secret meeting in London in April 1994 between Indian and US officials for a non-proliferation initiative in South Asia. The meeting was exposed when a woman Indian foreign service officer, who now holds a very senior position in the government, carelessly walked into a party at the Indian high commission in London in very casual clothes. An alert reporter, who knew that the lady officer ought not to be in the United Kingdom unless something special was going on, immediately contacted his editor in New Delhi, who ferreted out details of the secret talks in London for the next days newspaper. The uproar that ensued made sure that it was the end of P.V. Narasimha Raos non-proliferation initiative.        
	More recently, when he was foreign secretary, Shiv Shankar Menon went on a secret trip to Madrid to meet the Bush administrations point man on the Indo-US nuclear deal, Nicholas Burns. That was when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee, the United Progressive Alliances nominee for negotiations with the left parties on retaining their support for Singh, were telling Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) that India would not approach the International Atomic Energy Agency for a Safeguards Agreement, which would have taken the nuclear deal forward in Washington. Menon met Burns in secret to assure him otherwise.              
	But Menon did not take anyone in his ministry into confidence or hand over responsibilities during his travel to Spain. When some senior officials in South Block found out, they felt let down. They leaked what was happening. It was this camouflage, which alerted Karat that the UPA was double-dealing the CPI(M), and the countdown for withdrawing support to Singh began.        
	This week, the foreign secretary, Nirupama Rao, engaged in her brand of camouflage diplomacy in Washington, but she appears to have got away with it. Rao is in Washington ostensibly for a meeting of the Indo-US High Technology Cooperation Group, but her real reasons for visiting the US at this time are entirely different. The HTCG was important in Indo-US engagement when it was formed in 2002, when a range of sanctions against India were in force and the country was finding it next to impossible to obtain dual-use civilian-defence items from America  even a Cray computer for the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.        
	Because the Group was already up and running, it helped India steer through a crucial phase of the Next Steps in Strategic Partnership when it was launched in January 2004. The NSSP was the precursor of the nuclear deal, bilateral cooperation in space and high technology trade. But the HTCG meetings are no longer of any great policy interest to India. In fact, they now primarily benefit US commercial interests, but New Delhi goes along with its meetings simply because the mechanism exists. The foreign secretary said as much when she told the Groups industry-to-industry session on Monday that the US industry has brought up policy constraints in this forum that have, in their perception, hampered their high technology exports to India.        
	The last time an HTCG meeting brought any policy benefit for India was at its fifth meeting in February 2007, when Menon secured a commitment from the US that its high-technology exports to India that still need licences will be in line with the requirements of Americas closest allies: Israel and the UK.        
	The real objective of Raos visit to Washington was to serve notice on the Obama administration that the way things are going in Indo-US relations, it can no longer be business as usual unlike during the UPA governments first five-year term. This she did in her own understated style, without being offensive or moralistic as New Delhis visiting envoys to Washington  including some previous foreign secretaries  can be.        
	It was not lost on the Americans that Rao emplaned for Washington a day after the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, left New Delhi for home. Putins was a brief working visit. Yet, despite the complete absence of trappings of a State dinner or a State visit  designations used by the Obama administration to pander Indias ego  Putins one-day stay in New Delhi produced results that far outstripped what the Obama administration has been able or willing to work out with India during its 14 months in office.        
	The Americans are aware after what Rao has been telling them this week that unless they change their ways of dealing with Singhs government, Barack Obamas forthcoming State visit to India will be a pale shadow of Putins working visit last week. It ought to make those from Obamas administration at the HTCG meetings  who are engaged in a comprehensive reform of US export control systems through its National Export Initiative  sit up and note that while Indian companies are still on their Entity List for restricted dealings, Putin, for instance, agreed not only to let India use Russias famous Glonass global positioning system for military purposes but also signed a joint-venture deal to produce the navigation equipment.        
	Rao did not mince words when she told the HTCG that it is anomalous that a body like the Indian Space Research Organisation, which is developing several collaborations with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, should continue to be on this list. When Obamas defence secretary met A.K. Antony in January, the defence minister told Robert Gates that while the US wants India to buy its defence equipment, three units of the Defence Research and Development Organisation and the defence ministry-owned Bharat Electronics Limited and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited are still under US sanctions. Putin, on the other hand, had no hesitation in tying up with India for jointly developing a fifth-generation fighter plane or for the supply of MiG-29s worth $1.5 billion.              
	Rao put on a brave front when she said in public that we are in the process of operationalizing the (Indo-US nuclear) agreement through close coordination between our two governments. But the fact is that at yet another recent round of talks on reprocessing arrangements under the deal, the inclination of US negotiators was to raise new problems that will need one or more rounds. Putin, on the other hand, agreed to the construction of at least 16 atomic power plants without making the heads of Indias nuclear sector jump through more hoops, US-style. The governments decision on Monday not to go ahead with the civil liability for nuclear damage bill was the right signal to Washington even as the foreign secretary was discussing the issue with the Americans.        
	It was on Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran  which Rao recently visited  that she did the most plain-speaking with her US interlocutors. She may have convinced the White House and the state department that if the US looks at Afghanistan through unifocal Pakistani lenses at this critical juncture, other countries such as India, Iran, China and Russia, which have interests in Kabul, will fight that trend with some degree of coordination. But the problem is that the Obama administration is in a bind. The swagger among Pakistanis that they have had their way in Afghanistan is proof that the US has surrendered beyond redemption to Rawalpindis army general headquarters on Kabul.        
	Raos honest report back to New Delhi ought to be that while India is assiduously courted by the Obama administration, it is not respected unlike China, Russia, or even Saudi Arabia for that matter. That situation will change only if the UPA government resolves to stand up for itself a little more without worrying about what they will think in Washington. But it is a report that the Prime Ministers Office may not want to hear.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The Long Wait For Justice
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE LONG WAIT FOR JUSTICE                                  GWYNNE DYER                              
	In the aftermath of the bloody events on the aid ship, Mavi Marmara, where nine pro-Palestinian activists were killed by Israeli commandos on May 31, Israel has set up a judicial inquiry into the affair. Since the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who chose the members of the inquiry, has already described the victims as violent Turkish terror extremists on a ship of hate, some people doubt that the investigation will be impartial.        
	On June 15, the second inquiry into Bloody Sunday in the Northern Irish city of Derry, where 14 civil rights marchers were killed by British paratroops on January 30, 1972, delivered its report. The first people to see it were the relatives of the victims. On the whole, they seemed satisfied. The British inquiry was chaired by Lord Saville, a former high court judge. Since the inquiry involved the British army, the other two members were senior judges from New Zealand and Canada, not from Britain. And the Saville inquirys report was utterly damning.        
	It said that none of the casualties had guns, and that the paratroops gave no warning before they started shooting, and a number of soldiers afterwards knowingly put forward false accounts in order... to justify their firing. The report also said bluntly that the soldiers had lost their self-control, forgetting or ignoring their instructions and training, and failing to satisfy themselves that they had identified targets posing a threat... There was a serious and widespread loss of fire discipline. Neither their commanders nor the British authorities wanted to kill innocent people, but they were to blame for it nevertheless.                
	Bitter truth        
	If a similarly impartial tribunal inquired into the events that occurred aboard the Gaza-bound aid ship last month, it would probably come to identical conclusions. We know enough about confrontations where none of the soldiers or police dies, but lots of the demonstrators/rioters do, to understand the psychology and the crowd dynamics of it. That impartial inquiry would probably conclude that there was a loss of fire discipline among the Israeli commandos. It would also probably find that few, if any, of the activists had weapons, or acted in ways that justified killing them.        
	All of this may come to pass in Israel  in 2048, 38 years from now. Because that is how long it took the British government to get from the Widgery report, which was produced only months after the Bloody Sunday massacre, to the Saville report. Lord Chief Justice Widgerys report in 1972 was a shameless cover-up that blamed the victims: There is a strong suspicion that some (of the dead and wounded) had been firing weapons or handling bombs. And, of course, it exonerated the soldiers.         
	Those lies stood for 38 years, which is why the first people to be shown Savilles report this week were the victims families. It wont bring the dead back to life, but it is a reckoning of sorts. The British government is a slow learner, but it does learn.        
	Israel has appointed ex-supreme court judge Yaakov Tirkel, retired Israeli army officer Amos Horev, and Shabtai Rosen, an Israeli professor of international law, to the current inquiry, but the only two foreign members are observers who have no vote, so this will probably be Israels Widgery report. There may be an Israeli version of the Saville report eventually.        
	Who knows? By 2041, only 38 years late, the United States of America may even hold an inquiry into the loss of fire discipline by US paratroops in Falluja in 2003; the massacre of Sunni Arab youths sparked off the Iraqi resistance to the American occupation of Iraq. But not yet. Sovereignty means never having to say youre sorry. Or at least not for a long, long while.

	To squint in the sun is to obliterate perspective, writes Roland Barthes. It is to disrupt the known relations between things. And in this pressing of the eyelid on the eye, in this potent disarray, new possibilities emerge and new relations are born. Bishan Samaddars photographs, displayed at the Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre (Nov 16-Dec 18), seemed to be shaped by this trick of the eye. The photographs will appear in a new English translation of Incidents, Barthess diary of his visit to Morocco and of his life in France, by Teresa Lavendar Fagan.         
	In most of the works, two or more photographs are juxtaposed against one another to form a compound image. In each image, the photographs interact with the text and with one another, with startling results. There is Barthess daisy pinned on a background of grass. Squint, and the white petals turn into the pale, raw flesh of chickens, laid out on a bed of salad. Often, there are different perspectives on the same scene  a marketplace or a room full of people  as if to say, this is so, but this could also not be so. Sometimes, disparate pictures are grouped together, bringing into focus a certain texture of skin, a colour, an object. As associations are forged, objects emerge strange and new. In Incident 25 (picture), the intense red of heart-shaped balloons is repeated in plastic chairs placed in the sun. The bare male torsos in Incident 30 are replicated in sculpture. The old-rose light of dusk is suggested in flowers creeping up a wall. A distant moon becomes a baleful light-bulb.        
	As colours, textures and objects are repeated and connections are made, narratives begin to form. Each image seems to tell of an incident that had taken place. In the strongly visual language of Barthess Incidents, text often becomes a rapid succession of images, a barrage of fragmented impressions. For a fleeting moment, each image is incident on ones perception. In Samaddars photographs, image becomes text. Filled with narrative detail, it ripens to an incident. At times, it is Barthess text that provides this perspective. Incident 27 shows streaks of light curving upward in the dark. The accompanying text speaks of people during Ramadan waiting for the light of the minaret to shine. Suddenly, the curves of light could be arms outstretched in prayer.         
	Some images are more direct, and perhaps a bit too literal as representations of moments in the text. Nevertheless, Samaddar engages with the text and with his subjects in exciting ways. In doing so, he succeeds in drawing the viewer into the process.

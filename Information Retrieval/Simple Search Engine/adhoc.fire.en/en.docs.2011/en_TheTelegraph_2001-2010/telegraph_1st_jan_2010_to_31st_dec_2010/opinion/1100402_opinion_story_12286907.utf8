	Publishers pay authors their royalties three to four months after the annual stock-taking at the end of March, despite the fact that both accounts and inventories are fully computerized now. Publishers explain the delay by blaming the external auditors and booksellers, who return unsold stocks long after the expiry date. Are these excuses for lack of liquidity, or are there genuine reasons for the delay?        
	Unlike most other businesses, books are sold mostly on credit. Again, books sold to booksellers can be returned after a certain period, which is not spelt out, but it should definitely be before the end of the financial year. These returns are adjusted against the firms sales of an authors books, on which royalties are calculated.        
	Publishers have to purchase paper  the costliest item in book production  against cash, usually payable in advance when ordered directly from paper mills as they offer lower rates than local wholesalers. Even if we keep the other overheads aside, there is always a cash crunch at any given time. Publishers can do nothing to reverse the terms of trade of either of these two factors because they have been long established.        
	But what they can do is cut down on the quantum of books to be returned and the time taken to send them back to the publishers. Both are manageable if returns are strictly monitored. If this is not done, it is because publishers tend to oversell in their desperation to achieve targets. This is also why they accept books long after they are due, hoping that the returnables will eventually be sold. Publishers have to take the rap for overstretching themselves.        
	Moreover, publishers have complicated their job by revising the terms of royalty, now calculated as 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent of the net returns to the publisher, that is, the amount he receives after allowing the trade discount. Since discount structures vary from book to book, publishers are not clear on what net price the royalty should be worked out.        
	Also, publishers are now burdened with at least two sets of contracts: one with the old rates and the other with the post-1995 ones. Accountants have to go through both sets to calculate the royalties.        
	It is fashionable to blame publishers for the delays but the real crisis is that of overproduction of books. There are far too many of them chasing far too few customers. Sooner or later, publishers will be compelled to concentrate on niche markets.

	The storm in a teacup regarding what Shashi Tharoor did or did not say about the foreign policy of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru actually hides the signs of a tempest that could sweep away the well known characteristics of the Congress party. It is obvious from the reactions of some of the leaders of the Congress that they are not willing to countenance any kind of re-evaluation of past Congress leaders. Dissent, in other words, is going to be stifled within the Congress. There seems to be a tendency to make the Congress into a replica of a communist party with a line on everything, and on all subjects. If this were to happen, the Congress would become a monolithic and a doctrinaire party. This has not been the Congresss character over the years; neither has it been the Congresss charter. The Congress has always had an umbrella character: under that umbrella, many have been called  from Gandhians to socialists to champions of capitalism and, even at the worst of times, opportunists. Opinions of various hues and shades are voiced within the Congress and criticisms formulated. The Congress has never been known to have a line. This has been the Congresss strength, and this has added to the richness of Indias political tradition and discourse. To abandon this would be to court disaster for the Congress. It would also mean the intellectual impoverishment of India.        
	It cannot be anybodys argument that Gandhi and Nehru  or for that matter any other major and charismatic Congress leader  are above criticism and historical re-evaluation. Such a view would be as absurd as it would be totalitarian. Every generation looks at past historical figures in its own terms. This is one of the unchanging principles of democratic discussion. The Congress, ever since its inception, has been part of such discussions and has always upheld debates in the best democratic tradition. The past must be open to interpretation: history cannot be frozen. Unfortunately, some elements within the Congress in a bid to display their loyalty are trying to overturn democratic traditions and turn the Congress into a party to which many are called and one voice is heard. It is necessary to nip these totalitarian tendencies in the bud. Otherwise, the Congress will catch a tartar. The argumentative Indian is an integral part of the Congresss past and present. Let him remain there in the future.

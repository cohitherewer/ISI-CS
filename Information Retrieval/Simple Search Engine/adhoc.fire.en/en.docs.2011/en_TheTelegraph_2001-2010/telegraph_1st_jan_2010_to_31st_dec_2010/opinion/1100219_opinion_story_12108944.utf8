	William Golding: The Man who wrote Lord of the Flies By John Carey, Faber, 25        
	John Carey, ever an astute judge, has clearly sized up his reading public before they have even opened his massive, eagerly-awaited biography of William Golding. The subtitle, printed on the books cover, tells us that this was the man who wrote Lord of the Flies. In a postscript, Carey describes his choice of subtitle as both ironic and purposeful. Effectively, it ties Golding unequivocally to the fate history designed for him, to become known as the author of a modern classic  that is, a book of which even the most ignorant must have heard. That Lord of the Flies became a school text within a couple of decades of its composition in 1952 was surely the most comprehensive piece of irony that its author, himself a schoolmaster for 16 years, could have imagined.         
	But it is not simply as the author of Lord of the Flies that Carey portrays Golding, a complex, difficult personality tormented by self-loathing and spiritual doubts. In 1987, he said to audiences in India that he regretted leaving Simons supernatural experiences, on the advice of his Faber editor, Charles Monteith, out of the published version of Lord of the Flies (originally called Strangers from Within). It was Monteith who discovered the 42-year-old Golding, rescuing a manuscript from a provincial schoolmaster that had been rejected by four publishers and one literary agent. John Carey was able to draw not only upon the untouched Golding family archive, containing unpublished novels, two autobiographies, early drafts and projects, and a 5,000-page journal that he kept every day for 22 years, but also upon the correspondence between Golding and his Faber editor. In his biography, Carey creates a remarkably rich, full and exhaustive account both of the man and his work. For those who admire Goldings other novels  The Inheritors, Pincher Martin, Free Fall, Rites of Passage  more than the one that made his name, it is that larger account which will draw them to this masterly biography.         
	Being human was one long nightmare according to Golding, who found room for self-directed misery and hatred in his otherwise unremarkable life. Inexplicably, and frighteningly, he thought of himself as a monster: I have always understood the Nazis because I am of that sort by nature. As a schoolboy he took pleasure in bullying other children, and he documents the near-rape of a 15-year-old girlfriend when he was himself an undergraduate at Oxford. At his Oxford college, Brasenose, he appears to have been something of a misfit, cruelly categorized by the university appointments committee as NTS (Not Top Shelf). His war experiences in the Royal Navy  he commanded a craft during the D-Day landings  seem to have left deep scars on a sensitive, even neurotic, personality. Settling into the life of a schoolteacher, he was nicknamed Scruff by his pupils, though he appears to have been reasonably competent. His married life was happy, and he was a devoted father, despite bouts of drinking in which he abused his family and insulted his friends. Whatever tribulations he suffered, in personal or in professional life, were turned to extraordinary and profoundly creative account.        
	Most of Goldings novels are moral allegories, uncompromisingly focusing on what he saw as the unregenerate heart of man. Yet, as A.S. Byatt said in a radio review of The Scorpion God, the best things in his fiction are the descriptions: there was no one like him for shifts of light and new angles of vision and consciousness. These effects are achieved almost wholly through the intense imaginative concentration of his work, the willingness he shows to submit his mind to the visitations of a haunting, uncanny, and deeply disturbing vision of human life. At its core, it is a religious vision, though it is difficult to claim Golding for orthodox Christianity. Frank Kermode said that Golding was fascinated by the revelation that human consciousness is a natural asset purchased at terrible price  the knowledge of evil.        
	As a novelist, he enjoyed his initially undreamt-of success, though he found the Nobel ceremony a dead bore and the banquet afterwards ghastly. He travelled extensively, and was moved and delighted by the physical contrasts of landscapes and vegetation even when kept to a punishing schedule of lectures and book-signings. In private life there were many family trips, punctuated by a disaster when his boat was struck and sunk by a Japanese freighter in the English Channel. He learnt Greek, developed interests as far removed as archaeology and orchid-growing, and composed Latin elegiacs. But if A.L. Rowse, the Tudor historian and maverick Shakespeare scholar, was one of his neighbours in Cornwall, so too was Pete Townshend of The Who, who took him out sailing and helped him get over the trauma produced by his earlier near-fatal experience.        
	Careys portrait is respectful, loving, and as faithful as we can imagine a biography to be. The writing of a biography requires both author and reader to participate in an act of imaginative understanding. It is required, Carey might say, that you do awake your faith. Since this is the first account we have of Goldings life, based on unprecedented access to the private papers, it has to discharge an extraordinary responsibility to the writer and his life. John Careys task was to make the enigma of William Golding comprehensible to posterity, not only by documenting the life but also by showing us why the lived life is not enough: why the writers own fears, doubts, self-distaste, anger, anxiety, must be recovered from the archive of the everyday. It is these that can help us understand why the work is what it is.         
	Carey explores Goldings personality with great tact and judgment, though in the end we are still left with the puzzle of genius. Audiences in India asked Golding repeatedly why his work was so pessimistic. He denied the charge of philosophical pessimism, explaining that the dark strands showed up more in his work. So too, Careys biography would be deeply misunderstood if we only remembered what it reveals of Goldings early cruelties and his tormented conviction of his own, and humanitys, wickedness. The capacity to look as deep as he did, the resolve not to spare himself, were what made Golding the writer he was. John Careys biography makes this point magnificently.

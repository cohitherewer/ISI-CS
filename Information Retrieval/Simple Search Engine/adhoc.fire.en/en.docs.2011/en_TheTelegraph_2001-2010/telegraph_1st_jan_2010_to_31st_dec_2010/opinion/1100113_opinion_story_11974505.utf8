	When in trouble, most politicians invent or manipulate issues. There is thus nothing new about Nepals Maoist leader, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, inventing threats to his countrys sovereignty from India. What is a little more curious about his charges is the fact that he has connected the threats to Nepals sovereignty to those on his own life. The latest developments within the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) would, however, suggest that the charges have more to do with Mr Dahals own problems. It has been known for some time that he has major differences with his deputy, Baburam Bhattarai. But now, Mr Dahal, better known as Prachanda, has given the inner-party feud a strange twist by calling his deputy an Indian agent. At the same time, he has alleged that those who threatened Nepals sovereignty also posed a threat to his life.         
	The anti-India rhetoric may be an overused tool in Nepals domestic politics, but using it in order to settle scores with a rival leader within the party can have disturbing consequences. New Delhi depended much on Mr Bhattarai to strike a deal between the Maoists and other political parties to end the armed insurgency in Nepal. But he had Mr Dahals approval for the negotiations with New Delhi. The Maoist chiefs latest volte-face thus shows his desperation since his resignation as prime minister. His attempts to whip up anti-India sentiments are meant to recover lost ground both within his party and with other parties now running the government. The Maoists are still a major force in Nepals politics, and their role is crucial for stabilizing the new republic and its nascent democracy. Mr Dahals politics of confrontation  over the integration of the Maoist army with the regular armed forces and other issues  is not a good omen for Nepal. His devious campaigns are the worst threats to the countrys peace and stability.

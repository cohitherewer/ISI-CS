The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The preachers predicament
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE PREACHERS PREDICAMENT                                  THIS ABOVE ALL: Khushwant Singh                          Tricky questions                                        
	The denial of visas by the British and the Canadian governments to the Islamic preacher, Zakir Naik, on the ground that he preaches hatred and violence is manifestly unfair. At one time, I watched his TV programme regularly and read all I could find written by him. Not once did I hear him preach hatred and violence. However, I feel it was wise of both governments to deny him entry as what he says will further confirm the anti-Muslim bias that pervades the Western world: that Muslims are backward-looking and, therefore, unable to integrate in modern society. In the long run, he does grave injustice to his own people.        
	Let me elucidate. The scene at his lectures was always the same. The hall in which he spoke was always packed. Women in burqas with flaps thrown back sat in one corner near the entrance. The two front rows were occupied by celebrities, including a couple of Hindus who always put questions to the speaker. On the platform sat his brother to conduct the proceedings. Naik arrived punctually on the dot. He wore Western-styled coat and tie with a skull cap and did not sport a gnostic beard. The proceedings began with him chanting a verse from the Quran and explaining its meaning. Every time he mentioned the name of Jesus or the Prophet Mohammad, he added: Peace be upon him. All devout Muslims do that but scholars rarely do so.        
	Islam is the most scientific religion on earth. Eighty per cent of everything written in the Quran has been proved to be scientific, he asserts. I have read the Quran in English translation four or five times. I never understood what its being approved by scientists meant. To me, it was largely in praise of the Creator. Rules of social behaviour, whether you may or may not marry, laws of inheritance, the meaning of jihad, and the most ecstatic of passages in praise of Allah. However, to prove his point, Naik had Christian clerics answer to what he had to say about the contradictions in the Old Testament and about the origin of life. The audience enjoyed the clerics discomfiture while Naik scored brownie points, one after another. He took good care not to say anything offensive about Hinduism. On the contrary, he found that it had a lot in common with Islamic beliefs. He often mentioned Bhavishya Puran, forecasting the triumph of the faith of Prophet Mohammad in India. He is perhaps not aware that there are dozens of Bhavishya Purans, each one providing divine support to upcoming leaders.        
	Naik is a strong advocate of the burqa. He backed his case by asking his audience to imagine three women on a stroll  two wearing burqas and one in Western clothes. Who do you think will roadside Romeos not make lewd remarks at? The sisters in burqas or the sister without it? Question: Should a sister in burqa respond to a greeting by a Hindu? Answer: It depends on how he says assalam alaikum. If he says it in a mischievous tone, then she should ignore him, if its in a polite tone, the sister may reply alaikum assalam.        
	The learned doctor is not bothered by the fact that if the burqa is made compulsory, hundreds of thousands of his Muslim sisters would be thrown out of their jobs, or by the fact that several European countries, including France, Holland and Denmark, have made burqa-wearing a penal offence.        
	In one of his publications, Naik lists 19 diseases that can afflict people who eat pig meat. He does not mention that beef-eaters can get mad cow disease and chicken-eaters bird flu. In any case, what has eating got to do with religion? Religion should concern itself with right and wrong, truth and falsehood. Why, then, does he enjoy such a huge following? I can only explain it by the low mental level of his admirers. When Barkha Dutt had him in her programme, What being Muslim means to me, with the film star, Shah Rukh Khan, and a few eminent Islamic scholars and other celebrities, no participant took much notice of Naik being among them.                
	Room service                
	A young and pretty chambermaid at a five-star hotel asked the upstart client she had just shown to his room, What time would you like to be woken up sir?        
	At seven oclock, replied the oversmart guest, and with a kiss.        
	Very well, sir, said the girl as she retreated down the corridor, Ill leave your message with the night-watchman.                
	Bombed relics                
	A fighter pilot based at the Tezpur air force station took his six-year-old son to a famous local park. There he showed his son ancient ruins, ornamental stone pillars, shapely dancing girls, beautiful flowers, all carved in stone. Some of the sculptural relics were partly damaged and disfigured by the wear and tear of centuries.        
	The boy was amazed. Arent they wonderful? the pilot asked his son. After a pause, pointing at some damaged stone images the boy asked, But Papa, who bombed them?

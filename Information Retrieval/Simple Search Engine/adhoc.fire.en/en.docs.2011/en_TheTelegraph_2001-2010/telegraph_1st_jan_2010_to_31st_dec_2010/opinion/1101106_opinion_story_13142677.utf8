The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In search of a new vocabulary
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN SEARCH OF A NEW VOCABULARY                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                          Chandrima Bhattacharya, Mrs Roy, How Does Your Garden Grow?                                        
	The concept of visual alphabets was articulated by the artist, Adip Dutta, in an exhibition he curated earlier this year. Drawing, Dutta explained, is a structural expression of perception appearing in the form of motifs used almost like visual alphabets. Based on a similar idea, the recently concluded exhibition at Gandhara Art Gallery,Visual Alphabets (October 24-November 4), brought together the drawings of some promising artists.        
	Although much of the work on display is arresting, the artists seem to have largely ignored the concept note. This is perhaps not such a bad thing after all. For a majority of the claims made for drawing in the note are either general or too vague to provide any specific guideline. It is true that drawings are, at one level, direct, almost unaffected responses which record like a seismograph... the slightest stir in the artists reactions and responses and presents them in the purest possible forms. But then, this is no less true of any artistic practice worth its name. It is also somewhat misleading, if not nave, to extol drawing as an unselfconscious activity involving automatic elements. Doodles and sketches are indeed the first tentative stages in the making of a work of art, but most drawings that find their way into a gallery are finished products, carefully thought through and executed with a degree of control that is conspicuously absent in the first drafts.        
	For instance, Adip Dutta, a participant in this show as well, presents a series of seven small-format works that is both technically and intellectually accomplished. Beginning with the world of circumstances  embodied in everyday objects like scissors, bottle, fork or comb  Dutta gestures towards a symbolic order. A mutilated torso, a severed hand, an inkwell and a snake form a Freudian montage. With barely legible words written all over, this fluid stream of consciousness captures the tussle between visual and verbal codes. The insistent cacophony of words seems to get sucked into a spiralling form in the grand finale.        
	Unlike the mystical elegance of Duttas vision, Chandrima Bhattacharyas excellent pen-and-ink composition teases us with a different, though no less inscrutable, charm. The poetic lilt of the title, Mrs Roy, How Does Your Garden Grow?, resonates in this exquisitely composed portrait of a lady with an adventurous sartorial taste. Dressed in what looks like haute couture, she seems to teeter on the brink of a chichi overkill, but manages to carry off her flamboyance with an enviable panache. Her vibrant eyes and suppressed smile seem to be concealing some secret  which might well be the case if her right hand, tapering into stairs that lead to a nowhere land, or the severed palm (presumably her own) peeping out from behind her, is anything to go by.        
	With Chhatrapati Dutta, we return to the visceral realities. Skeletal shapes and broken contraptions suggest decay and disintegration. A disembodied set of teeth rattles in a mockery of speech. A monstrous crane, made of bones, crushes a gigantic fly to death. If the somewhat hackneyed spectre of modernity returns to haunt us, it also forces us to exert our imagination afresh. Such, however, is not the case with Kazi Nasirs surreal composition, which, although expertly rendered, looks like an academic exercise that has been pulled off by a clever student. It may also be an act of kindness to spare the priest-king of Mohenjodaro, who has been mocked into a clich by artists from this part of the world. Debashis Mannas emaciated man, wallowing in misery, is remarkable, if only for his similarity with many such figures who appear in Somnath Hores work. In Mallesi HVs Blown Out, a cityscape is distorted as it is viewed through bubbles in transit. Though impressive in scale, the work needs more space to come alive in its full expressive potential.        
	Sunil Padwal, somewhat unusually, uses white ink on black paper to create leaping, dancing, graceful human and animal forms. Debnath Basu chooses industrial graphite powder on paper which makes it difficult to decipher what exactly goes on in his work. One detects certain affinities with the cartographic abstractions of Rm. Palaniappan, but beyond that it is impossible to read the words densely written all over Basus drawing.        
	Manjari Chakravarti is also interested in the role of language in art. Her work has the flavour of an intense thought experiment, which we discern in Duttas fragmented meditations as well. In one of her drawings, a female nude sleeps on a mattress, on which the word, vocabulary, is inscribed. Underneath her are boxes  variously patterned  arranged in layers. They make up, as it were, the multiple strata of the mind, where shards of thought  made of fact, fiction and fantasy  are hidden away.

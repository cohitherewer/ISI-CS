	Losing a friend often saddens one more than losing a relation  particularly if the friend happens to have been someone you admired. This happened to me when I read of the death of Manohar Malgonkar at the age of 97 in his estate in Jagalbed in north Karnataka. We had known each other for almost half a century. The first time we met remains fresh in my memory. I was working in the external services of the All India Radio. He told me of his past. He had been in the army during World War II. He rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Maratha Light Infantry. After retirement, he became an avid shikari. Having slain eight tigers, he became a professional conducting big-game hunts for eminent foreigners. Then a sudden change came over him. He swore not to kill anything anymore. He became a passionate preserver of wildlife. He told me of a handsome young tiger who used to display himself sitting in the middle of a forest road in broad daylight. He was a sitting duck for my tiger killer. Malgonkar would drive me to him and fire a few shots to frighten him off. The tiger learnt not to trust humans and lived a full life. When Malgonkar finished his story, I asked him to put it on paper. He did. I broadcast his story and had it published. That is how his career as a writer began. He graciously acknowledged it by always referring to me as Guruji. Then came a series of novels: Distant Drum, A Bend in the Ganges, The Combat of Shadows, The Devils Wind, many short stories and film scripts. His style of writing reminded me of Bhowani Junction by John Masters. It was racy and highly readable.        
	Malgonkar was highly conscious of his Maharashtrian heritage. He wrote a biography of Kanhoji Angrey, Puars of Dewas Senior and Chhatrapatis of Kolhapur.        
	Malgonkars writing career ended when manganese was found in his estate. He became a rich man and got involved in mining manganese. He lived in princely style in a palatial mansion, with many acres of garden. He often invited me to stay with him but I was never able to accept his offer of hospitality. My son spent some days with him and told me what a wonderful time he had had with Malgonkars small family.                
	All mixed up                
	Tabish Khair is a Bihari settled in Denmark. He is Professor of English Literature at Aarhus University. He keeps in close touch with his motherland and visits it once a year to see his parents, writes regularly for Indian papers like The Hindu and Outlook and many others in England and America. He has also published many books like Where Parallel Lines Meet, Babu Fictions, The Bus Stopped, Filming: A Love Story, all of which I reviewed favourably because I found them lucid and absorbing. Now I have his latest Man of Glass (HarperCollins) and find myself like one lost at sea. It has Kalidas, Mirza Ghalib and H.C. Andersen all mixed up. Kalidas he read in the Sanskrit original at school. Ghalib was always with him because his mother tongue is Urdu. Andersens fairy stories for children, which he must have read as a child, acquired special significance after he became a Danish national.        
	I do not know Sanskrit; all I have read of Kalidas is in English translation. Whatever I read by Andersen I forgot long ago. Only Ghalib remains with me. However, Tabishs transcriptions do not tally with my reading of Ghalibs couplets. To start with take the first few couplets of his Diwan:                
	Naksh fariyaadi hai kis ki
  shokhi e tahreer ka        
	Kaaghzai hai pairhan har
  paikre-tasveer ka        
	Khair renders the lines as:
  Such richness fills the
  aspects of this earth,
  Each mans a beggar
  seeking alms of worth.                
	I dont think any student of Ghalib will agree with Khair. My own reading is it means that every picture speaks for itself; it does not need a learned explanation.        
	Likewise, the second couplet:        
	Kavikave sakht jaani haai tanhai na
  puunch
  Subah karna shaam ka laana hai
  juye-sheer ka                
	Khair renders it as follows:
  Dont claim to tell the lonely back of work,
  To turn night into day, replenish
  dearth.        
	This is as far-fetched a transcription as I have ever seen. The couplet reminds us of the romance of Shireen and Farhad and the condition imposed by her father on him to let him have access to his daughter. The same obscurity is found in all his transcriptions. I repeat that the primary object of writing is communication. In his Man of Glass, Khair fails to communicate.                
	Words are deceptive                
	Sign outside a Path Lab: For you it may be your urine and stool, but for us it is our bread and butter.                
	**********        
	No smoking here        
	Customer: It is strange you sell cigarettes in this store, but you dont allow the customers to smoke here.        
	Sales girl: Dont talk about what I sell. I also sell condoms but I dont permit anyone using them here.

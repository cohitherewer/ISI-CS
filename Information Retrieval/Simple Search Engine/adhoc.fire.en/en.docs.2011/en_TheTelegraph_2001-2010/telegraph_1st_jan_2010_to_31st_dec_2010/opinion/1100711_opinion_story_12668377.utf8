	Football lovers in Bengal are more emotional than rational. They are thus in mourning that their two favourite teams, Brazil and Argentina, will not be playing in the World Cup finals to be played tonight. The two South American sides have lost because they played bad football. But this was related to a more fundamental reason: they did not have balanced and good enough teams. Their defeats were thus foretold. There is another reason linked to the manner soccer has developed over the years. This is being missed in the wave of emotions and the surge of pseudo analysis. Football, for all the top footballers in the world, is no longer a mere sport. It is a full-time career. The players make a living by playing football, and the very good ones make considerable amounts of money. This money does not come to them, however, by playing for their countries. They earn it by playing for a club, from sponsorships and from endorsements. Football for top players like Messi, Kaka or Ronaldo is a job, and their clubs are their employers. It stands to reason therefore that the players put up their best showing when they don the colours of their clubs. Patriotism is not even an idea for them. On the football pitch, the nation state has suffered a quiet and an unsung death.        
	This has important implications for the way the teams have performed in the World Cup. It means that a top footballer, during his playing career, spends only a few months playing for his country. Appearing for his club is his bread, butter and jam; it makes or breaks his reputation. It would be only a foolhardy player who would risk an injury while playing for his country as that would jeopardize his performance for the club. Thus, a Messi or a Kaka would be reluctant to go all out wearing the colours of their respective countries. The same argument from the opposite end holds true for the performance of Germany, which has a team composed of many new players who are not regulars in any of the top club teams. The names of Klose and Ozil come immediately to mind. These footballers are playing to establish their reputation, which will enable them to fetch a high price in the football mart. Club prevails over nation.        
	The outstanding performance of the Spanish side  Spain is considered the favourite by many in tonights finals  can be attributed to the fact that as many as six of the current squad play for the same club, Barcelona FC. Their understanding and rhythm have been established through repeated appearances for their club. Tournaments like the English Premier League and the UEFA Champions League have emerged as the real strength of a footballers talents and skills. Football retains its stars; only their firmament has changed.

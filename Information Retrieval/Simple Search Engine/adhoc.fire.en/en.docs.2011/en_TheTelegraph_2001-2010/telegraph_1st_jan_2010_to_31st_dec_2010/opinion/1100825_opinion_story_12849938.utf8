	Viswanathan Anand has said that he wants his country back. But why should the question of what his country happens to be matter at all to awarding him an honorary doctorate by a university in India or anywhere else in the world? Also, why should such an academic decision be overseen by the State? These are questions that ought to be raised within any modern and mature democracy, especially by institutions upholding intellectual excellence and freedom. The process by which the Union ministry of human resource development stalled the Central University of Hyderabads awarding of a doctorate to the grandmaster reveals the perils of being a Central institution in India, where bureaucracy exerts, and is allowed to exert, a ridiculous degree of authority in areas that should be entirely free from it. The proposal to honour him had been made about a year ago by the executive organizing committee of the International Congress of Mathematicians. It was enthusiastically supported by the University of Hyderabad, and Mr Anand had also agreed to accept the degree.         
	The matter should have ended there. Instead, it had to be passed from the vice-chancellor of the university to its executive committee, and then to the chancellor, after which it was forwarded to the HRD ministry, which questioned Mr Anands nationality (since he lived in Spain) and demanded the involvement of the ministry of external affairs. Each stage of clearance took three to six months. Meanwhile, the situation had become more complicated because the university also wanted to honour another distinguished American mathematician together with Mr Anand. So, the HRD ministry began looking at the situation as one involving foreigners, and therefore requiring a specially vengeful tightening of bureaucratic screws. Endless red tape and paperwork followed, expectedly of an unsavoury kind, simply to establish that Mr Anand was an Indian citizen. Eventually, the ministry has managed to defer the clearance so indefinitely that the awarding of the degree has been shelved by the university and the congress. Just as the State should get out of its habit of meddling in these matters, institutions like universities, however Central they happen to be, should also get out of their ingrained habits of obedience and subservience to such regimes of interference and control. Only then would such embarrassments be avoided.

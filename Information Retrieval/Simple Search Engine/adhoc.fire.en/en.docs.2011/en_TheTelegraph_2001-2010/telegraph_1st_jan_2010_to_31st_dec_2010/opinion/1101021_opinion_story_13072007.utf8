	Dramatic return                  
	Sir  The Chilean government and other agencies involved in the operation to rescue 33 miners trapped in a mine in Chile for 69 days deserve to be applauded (Happy history above ground, Oct 16). The miners made their 2,041-feet ascent in a rescue capsule through a manhole-sized opening, thus triumphantly concluding the two month-long ordeal. The rescue of the miners finally ended the agonizing wait of their families and friends.          
	The Chilean President, Sebastin Piera, has rightly said that this operation is without comparison in the history of humanity. It is unlikely that a rescue operation of this magnitude has been attempted before. The success of this endeavour is all the more significant because survival rate is low in most mining accidents. This remarkable operation displayed the triumph of the human will, and proved that a lot can be achieved if people use technology to their advantage and work united for the greater good.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The rescue of the Chilean miners was very dramatic. People across the world, glued to their television sets or the internet, were watching this live event with rapt attention. All were full of anxiety about the fate of those 33 miners trapped more than 2,000 feet below the ground, who resurfaced after more than two months. The world rejoiced as they emerged.          
	The Chilean government, its president, the mining minister of Chile and other groups involved in the rescue efforts should be heartily congratulated. The scale of this operation, conducted in a small copper and gold mine in Copiap, Chile, was amazing. The coordination was excellent. Luis Urzua, the shift-in-charge of the trapped miners, was especially brave and strong as he boosted the morale of the miners and helped them survive the long period during which they had been unable to make any contact with the outside world.          
	Chiles rescue efforts also marked a significant step in disaster management. The operation carried out at the mine in Copiap has inspired the world to make mining safer. We should learn a lesson from the terrible experience of the trapped miners.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Faded glory          
	Sir  The Calcutta Metro needs urgent restructuring and modernization (Please be patient, Oct 17). Since a substantial part of the route is now above the ground, the existing rakes need to be replaced by air-conditioned ones. For this, the power supply system should be upgraded. The Metro Railway authorities had earlier assured us that they would replace the dysfunctional ticket turnstiles with upgraded ones, but that promise was never fulfilled. The extra load on the rapid transit system resulting from the extension of the Metro network can be mitigated by increasing the number of rakes, with a concomitant increase in frequency. The Calcutta Metro had been projected as one of the best in the world in terms of operation and maintenance after its inauguration a few decades back. We, as the citizens of Calcutta, must appeal to the concerned authorities to take steps to improve it and restore its status.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Ashok Kumar Ghosh,Calcutta              
	Sir  The Calcutta Metro used to be the pride of the city. It was an efficient transport system that provided relief from the rapidly deteriorating surface transport network. Passengers were protective of the Metro Railway. It is unlikely that people have suddenly lost their love for the Metro, or that the Metro has suffered because of political bickering.          
	It would be clear to any unbiased observer that the Metro authorities are the ones responsible for the deplorable state of this transport system. There is no reason why the Garia extension took so long to build. Meanwhile, no effort has been made to improve or modernize the Metro. The inauguration of a new stretch without the necessary technological support could have only had disastrous consequences.           
	The present situation displays the authorities lack of foresight. They have announced that the new air-conditioned rakes cannot be put to use as yet since the power supply system is not equipped to generate the extra power required for those rakes. It is preposterous that the power requirements were considered so long after the upgrading procedure had started. These instances prove the lackadaisical attitude of the people at the helm. The Delhi Metro can perform much better because of its administrative authorities, who are efficient enough to handle it. Tremendous advancement in many fields has been made in several parts of India. There is no reason why this could not happen in Calcutta. But then, the political leaders and administrative authorities of Bengal care little for the people.          
	Yours faithfully,

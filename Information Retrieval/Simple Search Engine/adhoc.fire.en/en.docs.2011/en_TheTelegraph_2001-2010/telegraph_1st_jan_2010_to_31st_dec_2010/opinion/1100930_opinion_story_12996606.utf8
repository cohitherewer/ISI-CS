	Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow who was unceremoniously sacked by the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, is a study in contrasts. A relic from the Soviet past, Mr Luzhkov spent close to two decades running the capital of his nation in a spirit of absolute authority. With the funds earmarked for civic development, he refurbished the many grand palaces and statues that dot the Moscow skyline. Sadly, his aesthetic sense fell hopelessly short of the task. So, under Mr Luzhkov, Moscow turned into an embarrassingly disneyfied megalopolis, crowded with ugly structures. The rich got richer, the poor poorer. One of the key founders of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, Mr Luzhkov probably believed that he was immune from State censure. He came down on gay-rights activists like a ton of bricks, turned away from orphaned children living on the streets, and denied helping his wife secure a billion-dollar fortune. At the height of the devastating forest fire that rendered thousands homeless, he fled Moscow and spent more time tending to his bees than thinking about the common people, getting choked by the smoke and ash. But he had no qualms identifying himself as one of the progressives responsible for modernizing Russia.        
	So it is no surprise that Mr Medvedev decided to do away with the imperious Mr Luzhkov  a move that was almost certainly endorsed by Vladimir Putin, the prime minister. It is difficult, however, to applaud the Kremlins decision just yet. Days before his dismissal, the mayor of Moscow had not only complained to the president in an open letter about the media campaign to expose his misdeeds but also questioned Mr Medvedevs commitment to democracy. Mr Luzhkov even invoked the unmentionable ghost of a Stalinist fear while expressing his disaffection for the present regime. True, Mr Putins vision of a new Russia may be based on his revaluation of the geopolitical situation post-2001, but his working methods often hark back to an earlier era of Soviet supremacy. Russias desire to be the political taskmaster in Central Asia, especially its explosive relationship with its Muslim-majority fringe States, has posed a threat to its own internal harmony. The recent blast on the Moscow metro by Islamic insurgents is a case in point. Merely shaking off Mr Luzhkov will be of small use, if Mr Putin continues to cling to the legacy of a sordid past.

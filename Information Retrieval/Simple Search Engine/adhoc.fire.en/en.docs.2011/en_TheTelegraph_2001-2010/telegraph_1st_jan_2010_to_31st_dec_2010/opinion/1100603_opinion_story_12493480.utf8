The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To no ones credit
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TO NO ONES CREDIT                                  CLOSE-UP      It is an injustice when an address decides if a person can get a loan or a credit card                                                  
	The papers were perfect, the address was not. Khalid Ahmed, 28, excitedly filed the application for a home loan. A professional with no prior debts, he furnished an address proof and tax returns. The bank manager, who denied him the loan, said, Sir, everything is perfect. Sorry, our bank does not provide loans in your area.        
	S.K. Bablu spent three months in jail. A case of mistaken identity and, again, the wrong address: Calcutta-23. The young vegetable seller was arrested without a warrant last year. Too poor to afford a lawyer, he waited in jail till it was established that his namesake had committed the crime and escaped through political connections. The police had arrested Bablu to show they were doing their duty.        
	Twelve-year-old Marufa spends her time at home. The daughter of a labourer, she can neither afford the school fees, nor is she comfortable with the Bengali medium. Again, Nazma went to Matri Sadan to deliver her baby  only to find that the doctor was on leave. She just managed to survive.        
	What these stories have in common is not misfortune, but just the address. Calcutta-23 represents Kidderpore, Ekbalpore and Mominpore, and comprises ward numbers 77 and 78. Most residents are Muslims who speak Urdu, Bengali and Hindi. According to a survey, the average monthly income per household is Rs 3,276, and 34 per cent of the people have casual jobs, or are in tailoring, sales, petty trading and so on. What plagues Calcutta-23? Have its problems been discussed in the current polls? Kidderpore evokes mixed feelings. Taxi drivers refuse to go there. Parents are not comfortable if their children want to work in NGOs in Mominpore. Passengers on public buses suddenly become alert while travelling from Mominpore to Kidderpore.        
	A host of stereotypes has developed around this region. Banks refuse loans for houses and cars and do not issue credit cards to the areas residents. They claim there is a long list of defaulters here. How can there be defaulters when no loans are given? Strangely enough, while people from Calcutta-23 are denied loans, uneducated young people from there are recruited for loan-recovery from defaulters elsewhere.        
	Marufa is not the only drop-out. As far as educational infrastructure is concerned, the area presents a paradox. In the Kidderpore area, there are several well-known English medium schools, such as St Thomas Boys School, St Thomas Girls School, Loyola High School, St Pauls School, Vidyabharati, and so on. They cater to the needs of the children of the rich and upper-middle-class, who are usually also members of the upper castes in the majority community. There is also a polytechnic college. Yet few local families can send their children to these institutions. The conspicuous absence of affordable schools for members of the minority community in Calcutta-23 needs to be questioned.        
	Nazma was lucky. The area is surrounded by at least five world-class hospitals , but people from the locality hardly get a chance to be treated in them. These hospitals are too expensive for most of those living close by. But Matri Sadan caters to the needs of thousands of pregnant women every year.        
	As the civic polls became the most important topic of political conversation recently, there was also a competition among political parties to give tickets to minority candidates to woo the communitys vote. But the big questions, relating to real development, remain unanswered. Why is educational infrastructure so poor that the children of the area have to drop out of school? How can midday meals and special stipends for minority students help change the situation? Why do people in Kidderpore continue to suffer from the stereotypical denial of credit facilities? Why is the health service for the poor so bad?        
	If the situation remains the same even after the elections, it will be a great injustice. An injustice signals the failure of democracy. Does Calcutta want to uphold democracy at all?        
	Sabir Ahamed

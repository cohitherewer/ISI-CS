	Stand up unaided                  
	Sir  Reservation is not a good thing. If one believes in merit, then having seats reserved for any gender, class or caste should be anathema to him. Further, in a country with so much diversity, one never knows what other demands a particular reservation might trigger off. Empowerment of women is essential in a patriarchal society. That must be achieved by letting women compete independently. But then, this is perhaps too much to ask of Indian society, a section of which still kills the girlchild in the mothers womb.

	Show of power          
	Sir  The picture of Mayavati with a garland of currency notes published with the report, Uproar over Mayavatis money mala and rally bill (March 17), was revolting. Mayavati seems to consider herself above the law of the land and the equal of deities. As if littering the whole of Uttar Pradesh with her own statues was not enough, now she is indulging in new antics at the cost of the public exchequer. Her party has come up with ridiculous explanations for the monstrous garland made of 500- and 1,000-rupee notes, but the media have bared the truth.          
	It is shocking that only a few kilometres away from the venue of the Bahujan Samaj Partys Rs 200-crore anniversary celebration rally is the violence-hit town of Bareilly, for which Mayavati has no money to spare. She calls herself a Dalit ki beti, but indulges in such extravagance. This sends out a very disturbing message. Also, disfiguring currency is a punishable offence, and the guilty must be brought to book.          
	However, Mayavati is just one name in the long list of Indian political leaders who show off their princely lifestyle. Only a few months back, the governments austerity drive was met with much disapproval from a section of the netas who felt they were doing the common man a favour by being austere and by travelling cattle class. Now that there are no elections coming up, these leaders seem to have reverted back to their lavish lifestyles.          
	There should be a law that puts a cap on the spendings of parties on rallies and campaigns. Why is it that every time a politician is accused of breaking the law, it is labelled a conspiracy against that leader? After an initial blame game, the matter is often forgotten. Corruption has penetrated every strata of the political machinery. The judiciary must take stringent measures against such vulgar showing-off by politicians who are making a mockery of democratic principles.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Mayavati has been garlanded with currency notes at a rally to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the BSP. The garland, allegedly, contained notes worth Rs 10 crore. Two hundred crore has been spent for the rally. Why did the garland fail to attract the attention of income-tax officials? Has the BSP accounted for this money? When the country is reeling under inflation, it is unbecoming of a leader to spend so lavishly.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Ramachandran, Ooty 

                
	Sir  The last line of the editorial, Moneyed glory (March 18), is apt. No political party in India is absolutely honest and selfless. Mayavati has earned the wrath of the media because she did not camouflage her act with hypocrisy that is typical of other leaders. Now the media will probably call her brazen. But that might end up making her even more adorable to the Dalits.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Sanket Biswas, Noida, Uttar Pradesh

	As a tribute to the Mother Goddess, Chitrakoot Art Gallery organized an exhibition of Early Bengal paintings. The exhibition, called Devi in Various Incarnations (October 7-20), displayed works by anonymous artists. The paintings are from 50 to 200 years old, collected from old houses across Bengal. They dwell on mythological themes, with Durga in her many forms as the predominant figure. These images were mostly painted for religious rituals, but the skill and the imagination of the painters go beyond religiosity to attain a deeper visual resonance.        
	The paintings have a discernible European influence. Most seem to belong to the Dutch-Bengal genre prevalent in 19th-century Bengal. Local artists had picked up styles and techniques from their European counterparts, then based in zamindari households as portrait artists, and started producing their own brand of work. The genre that evolved was unique in more than one way. Not only did it create an East-West fusion, but it also formed an important body of folk art.        
	Some of the images seem to carry layers of connotation. One shows Durga emerging from Shivs navel as Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshwar and Indra watch. Two women  one dark and the other fair  flank the emerging Durga. Another image is that of Shiv and Kali emerging from the navel of Shiv himself, with three more Shivs at the base. One interpretation would be that Purush and Prakriti are both born out of Purush  but that might be too simplistic.        
	The range of myths explored in these works is striking. While there are Durga, Kali, Shiv-Parvati, Annapurna, there are also rarer gods like Krishna-Kali (Kali in the form of Krishna), Chamunda and Ganga. But one painting provides much food for thought both mythologically and historically  a fair-skinned, naked goddess on a lion fighting a battle. She is like Durga, but her posture seems to be that of Kali. She could be Gour-Kali, a goddess of ancient Bengali folklore who is now almost forgotten. What is remarkable is her unabashed nudity; she does not even have a garland of human heads as partial cover. This one provides a pertinent historical context for the debate around M.F. Husains paintings of nude goddesses.        
	It is lamentable that the works of Early Bengal have been largely ill-kept, many of them destroyed. Here is a species that desperately needs preservation. Chitrakoot, with the help of Udhriti Das, has made an effort to restore the paintings on display. But loopholes in that effort showed up in the cracks, worn-out colours and termite-eaten patches of some of the paintings. Nevertheless, the exhibition had a lot in store even for those not particularly interested in mythology.

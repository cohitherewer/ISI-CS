	Britain is facing its next general election  the date is likely to be May 6  in an interesting state of political apathy. No matter who wins, the recipe for the next decade of British life seems clear enough. Public expenditure will be cut savagely and taxes will rise: hard times for all, the hangover after the party. That sense of inevitability does a lot to dull public interest in the elections outcome and, therefore, in having some say in it by voting, but it isnt the only reason for disaffection. On the one hand, you have the Labour Party, in government now for 13 years, tired, haunted by the hideous mistakes of Iraq and the misplaced faith in the money markets, and by and large bereft of any ideology or even a programme (far less a vision). And on the other hand, you have the Tories, equally free of ideology or solutions, and historically no less committed to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and Londons role as the global headquarters of financial capitalism. Differences between the two there may be, but they arent at all obvious.        
	Nevertheless, it should be a walkover. The easy, superficial things should count. The Tories are much less weary than their Labour counterparts and like all oppositions they can attack and ridicule the record of the party in power. David Cameron, the Tory leader, has far higher personal popularity ratings than the prime minister, Gordon Brown. Even more important, we live in a media age where politics has become an entertainment and the young and new always disadvantage the old and familiar. Most newspapers support the Tories. Rupert Murdoch supports the Tories. And yet opinion polls suggest they may not win. The Tory lead has fallen to only two per cent. A hung parliament, in which no party has an outright majority, is currently predicted. Financiers like clear-cut verdicts and strong governments, so the pound has fallen as a result.        
	So what are Labourites doing right, or the Tories doing wrong? My own impression is that people dislike Brown and disbelieve Cameron almost equally. The first man is too pious and wooden, the second too fluent and slippery. None comes out of what you might call the mainstream of English life. Brown is Scottish, the son of a kirk minister. Cameron was hatched (he often looks as though hes broken fresh out of an egg) in the upper reaches of the English elite, and despite many attempts to disguise it  by professing to like the pub game of darts, for example  he shines with the polish that comes with old money and an Eton-Oxford education. He and his Tory associates, many of them from the same narrow background, keep insisting that their class shouldnt matter, while remaining acutely aware that it does.        
	Brown, however, is liable to a more damaging and personal allegation. Years ago, when he was Tony Blairs chancellor of the exchequer, someone close to Blair described Brown as psychologically flawed. The phrase stuck to him. Translated, what it seemed to mean was that he was highly ambitious, distrustful and controlling  hopeless at delegation and easily mired in detail. A sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde picture began to emerge, with the tell-tale detail of the private Mr Hyde to be seen in Browns fingernails, which were usually bitten to the quick. Just before Blair stood aside in his favour, a backbencher, remembering Jane Eyre, begged Blair to think again about letting Mrs Rochester out of the attic. There were stories of his appalling temper, when he would throw mobile phones across the room, and his unattractive habit of ordering his PR men to brief the press against members of his own cabinet.        
	None of this was good for Browns public image as a compassionate moralist, but it was nothing compared to the detail in a hostile insider account of Downing Street by The Observer journalist, Andrew Rawnsley, published last month. Brown, according to Rawnsleys anonymous sources, can be a foul-mouthed bully who rages at humble office assistants, with a temper sometimes so out of control that he repeatedly stabs his ball-point into the upholstery of official cars.        
	Then a woman who runs a charity phoneline for victims of bullying appeared on the BBC to say shed had one or two calls for help and advice from staff in Browns office. And this, oddly enough, was when things began to look up for the prime minister. The woman had broken the sensible convention that protects the identity of people who call helplines, whether theyre potential suicides or merely smokers wanting to quit. Her behaviour was fiercely criticized by other charities and Browns allies spread hints that she was politically motivated. Meanwhile, cabinet members denied Rawnsleys allegations and portrayed Browns rages as evidence of his passionate commitment to the countrys future. The feeling grew that he was being unfairly got at  and also that his assistants, if indeed they had complained to the helpline, must be wimps. A story that began with Brown as deranged weirdo ended with him as a politician of quivering intensity who is simply impatient with slack timekeeping and typing mistakes.        
	Not everyone believes the respray version, of course. But what has to be admitted is that the more Brown looks like another Bront character, the strange-yet-strong Heathcliff, the better his party seems to do in the polls.              
	************              
	Reading last week about Mamata Banerjees first railway budget, I remembered another railways minister from Bengal, Ghani Khan Choudhury, and two visits to his Malda constituency that I made in the early 1980s. For the first I was on my own and on my way from some town in north Bihar (possibly Kishanganj) to Calcutta. My train arrived at Malda in the late evening and my connection left early the next morning. I tried to find a bed in the retiring room. Endless questions from the official in charge. Why hadnt I reserved a bed by telegram, why had I changed in Malda, what was my business in Malda? Endless shakings of the official head followed by a brief statement: no beds were available. This was hard to believe. I produced a 20-rupee note. Suddenly beds were very much available. I entered a large dormitory that was entirely empty, with every sheet squarely folded and every mosquito net neatly furled.        
	A month or so later I was back, and this time in the company of Ghani Khan Choudhury who had agreed to an interview. Id hitched a lift on his special train from Sealdah, which I think had the same status in the Eastern Railways codebooks as the train used long ago by the viceroy. Its saloons rattled through north Bengal non-stop, every signal winking green. Strolling along the platform at Malda in the ministers entourage, I met the man whod taken the bribe before he allowed me a bed. Sir, sir, forgive me, I was only doing my duty, he said, with supplicating hands. Of course, I said there was nothing to forgive, but for a second or two I had the thrilling sensation, rare for a foreigner in India, that I held some power over a government clerk.              
	The moment passed. I was taken to see a silkworm farm and a mango orchard and a small park near the station  it may have had a name like the railway park  which, in the evening, was bright with coloured lights and where entry cost a rupee. This was Choudhurys doing, as were the offices of the railway recruitment board, which opened in Malda soon after. He died three years ago, and his obituaries also credit him with the building of the Calcutta Metro. Perhaps they exaggerate his role  I hope not because, if true, it dents the idea that all railways ministers are good for is feathering their own constituency nests.              
	*************              
	The steelworks at Redcar in north-east England have closed. In southern England, the Premier Leagues bottom club, Portsmouth FC, is dangerously close to liquidation. Theres no connection between the steelworks and the football side other than foreign ownership: the first belongs to Tata and the second to a tangled web of creditors, including entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and the Gulf. But Im not making a chauvinistic point. So many British businesses are now owned elsewhere  our domestic water, gas and electricity supplies, for example  that the fact has ceased to be remarkable. The interesting aspect of the Redcar and Portsmouth crises is the difference in scale of their media coverage. A failing football club attracted ten times the column inches of a steelworks closure that has thrown a couple of thousand people out of jobs and ended a northern industrial tradition stretching back into the 19th century. Feed Portsmouth FC into a search engine and you get 5,910,000 results. Feed in Redcar steelworks and you get only 287,000. This may reveal something about modern Britain. Ill leave you to decide what.

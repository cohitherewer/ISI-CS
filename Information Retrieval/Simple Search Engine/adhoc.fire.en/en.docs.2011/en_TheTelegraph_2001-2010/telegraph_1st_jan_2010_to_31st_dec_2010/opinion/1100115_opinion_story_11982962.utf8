	An earthquake measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale would be calamitous anywhere in the world. Even the richest nations are likely to crumble before its might. So, in a failing state like Haiti, best known for being the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, a natural disaster of such proportions is bound to be catastrophic. While there may be impeccable logic in such reasoning, one cannot take any comfort from it. Even considering the cyclones, hurricanes and floods that have played havoc with this Caribbean nation for years, Tuesdays earthquake and its trail of destruction were unprecedented. Around 100,000 have perished as scores of buildings, including the presidential palace, have been razed to rubble. As thoughtless neoliberal policies practically finished off the agrarian sector in the 1970s, Haitian farmers were forced to move into congested urban slums. Fragile shanties huddled along deforested ravines made these people an easy target for natures fury.        
	Although the evidence linking earthquakes to global warming is still untenable, that does not exculpate the sins of the bigger nations. The United States of America, which invaded Haiti in 1915, is by far the chief architect of all the evils afflicting the latter. Unemployment, violence and illegal migration run high across Haiti, as disbursal of foreign aid remains structurally flawed. Billions of dollars are liberally spent on funding new projects, but precious little is done to maintain existing infrastructure  a crucial stretch of road had to be rebuilt thrice in 25 years, last time with a $170m loan, but needs repair again. In 2006, the US Congress passed the Haitian Hemisphere Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act, and gave it a suitably feel-good acronym  Hope. This legislative move has secured some of the best trade deals for Haiti, giving it a chance to move on. But years of US meddling in the internal affairs of the state has effectively scotched any chance of Haiti radically reinventing itself. As the former president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, put it, Haiti has finally moved on from absolute misery to a dignified poverty. But that is clearly not enough, as its woeful unpreparedness in the face of the latest crisis shows. Until there is political stability in Haiti, no amount of aid will alleviate its suffering. Haitians may be vulnerable to natures wrath, but they deserve a chance to face it in their own terms.

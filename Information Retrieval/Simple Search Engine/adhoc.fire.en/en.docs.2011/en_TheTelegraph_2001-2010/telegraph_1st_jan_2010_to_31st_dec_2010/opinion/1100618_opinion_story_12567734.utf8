	Local elections in one of the 28 states constituting the Union of India should not ordinarily be of any significance. The outcome of the recent municipal polls in West Bengal has turned out to be an exception; it has created an existential crisis for the Left at the national level. The kind of outrageously unequal society the countrys rulers are hell-bent on building calls for the safety valve of a viable Opposition working within the contours of the constitutional framework. The Left preferring to walk the parliamentary path fills that role. Any weakening on its part may cause some short-term jubilation in the ranks of the conventional parties on the right and the middle but the real beneficiaries will be the non-parliamentary Left out on the lawless road.        
	As in nearly everywhere else, the parliamentary Left in India has been steadily in retreat in recent decades. Its main constituent, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has been, in effect, pushed back into the sanctuary of three states, Kerala, Tripura and West Bengal. Tiny Tripura can be passed over. Kerala, the land of A.K. Gopalan and E.M.S Namboodiripad, is, of course, a vastly different proposition. Even so, the heavy influx of gulf money has introduced otiose factors in its social infrastructure; it is now more of a swing state, the Lefts hold is no longer as sure as it was in earlier days.              
	West Bengal, in contrast, provided the impression of a Left continuum. The CPI(M) succeeded in welding together formidable mass organizations representing major segments of peasants, workers and the middle and lower-middle classes, including from among the minority communities. It could take legitimate pride in its phalanx of dedicated cadre deeply imbued with ideological conviction. The West Bengal electorate voted decisively for the Left Front under the stewardship of the CPI(M) in the post-Emergency assembly election in 1977. That mandate was renewed, in poll after poll, at different levels, for the next 29 years. This enduring confidence reposed on it was on account of the Left administrations series of measures supportive of the weaker sections, including land reforms which ensured land to the hitherto landless and legal status to share-croppers. Much ahead of the rest of the country, it introduced the three-tier panchayat system based on adult suffrage. The Left Front government also saw to it that a hefty chunk of the funds earmarked in the state budget for development work flowed to the local bodies, including the panchayat. Its initiatives in the industrial sphere  so crucially important for curing the scourge of joblessness  were hamstrung because of the lack of resources at the disposal of a state regime. It therefore spearheaded a searing national campaign for re-structuring Centre-state relations which could provide the states with more administrative power and financial resources.         
	A long tenure can generate complacency. That apart, the state CPI(M)s rustic approach to things was not always conducive to administrative efficiency. Nor did its ministers occasionally not fall prey to such bourgeois vices as hauteur and sycophancy. The continual renewal of the mandate, however, proved the point: on a balance of considerations, the West Bengal electorate was reasonably satisfied with the performance of the Left Front.        
	Perhaps influenced by the doubt expressed in some quarters over the genuineness of the electorates repeatedly renewed confidence in the Front regime, the Election Commission enforced extraordinary surveillance during the state assembly polls in 2008. The Front nonetheless once again emerged triumphant, winning 235 seats out of a total tally of 294.        
	The Left had ushered in no El Dorado in West Bengal. But it re-established a measure of social tranquillity so missing in the state for some time and it steadfastly kept the interests of the poor in the fore. For the immiserized and exploited masses across the country, the Left regime in the state indeed offered a ray of hope. Globalization had shrunk the space for radical initiatives, whether the poorer classes lived or perished was no longer on the agenda of those who had taken charge of the national polity. West Bengal offered a base from where those on the other side of the class barrier could hope to launch a counter-attack. The Left hinterland in the state, it was assumed, was indestructible.        
	That assumption was torn asunder, in the course of two swift years between 2006 and 2008. A critical proportion of the traditional supporters  roughly one decile or thereabouts of the total electorate  walked away from it in the wake of the crass insensitivity exhibited by the Left Front regime on the issue of land requisition for industrialization under private auspices. Arrogance on the part of the new generation in charge of both the state government and the CPI(M) state party apparatus, coupled with their total disregard of Left ideology and praxis, caused strong resentment often mounting to fury. Those with umbilical links with the party grumbled silently. But thousands, who had supported the Left come hell or high water for decades on end, were determined to take revenge on the betrayers of their trust. They voted against the CPI(M) in the panchayat polls in 2008 and the Lok Sabha polls the following year. Their ire, the results of the local body elections held last month indicate, has not abated one bit.        
	What is most bizarre is the apparent inability of party leaders and ministers to comprehend the magnitude of the catastrophe they had brought upon themselves. And they have the gall to persist with the claim that the reverses suffered in the Lok Sabha polls were exclusively on account of the CPI(M)s decision to withdraw support from the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre on the issue of the India-United States of America nuclear deal, a decision which supposedly did not receive public approval. But had not an alienation of voters on the same scale already taken place in the panchayat elections which took place a full 15 months before the withdrawal of support to the UPA? Would these discredited leaders also venture to suggest that the voters had rewarded the Left in the Lok Sabha poll in 2004 with as many as 60 seats because they were sanguine it would form a post-poll alliance with the Congress?        
	Inanities of ministers and leaders gone wayward can be treated with the pity these deserve. Far more relevant is to search for an answer to the query, whether, despite the significant erosion that has taken place in the Left hinterland, the damage is reparable. Admittedly, the immediate prospect does not look at all cheerful. It appears nearly inevitable that the of-late most-talked-of lady is going to grasp the reins of state administration once the next assembly elections are held. Her campaign hysterics, including wildly irresponsible statements, have frightened the daylights out of many who are otherwise peeved no end with the Left Front. She may change, but habits and propensities die hard. Demagogues, especially those who under-emphasize the task of building, brick by brick, the network of an organization, are prone to self-destruction; it might not be different in her case either. The Left could then be presented with another opportunity to provide the state and the country with a radical alternative. The ground reality would thirst for such an alternative, for meanwhile gross domestic product growth fetishists would have continued their vicious onslaught against the peasantry, the working class and the lower middle classes.              
	But this possibility of a Left revival in West Bengal hinges on an important assumption. No point in being polite about it, what has happened in the mindset of a not inconsiderable section of the electorate is a meshing of subjectivity and objectivity. They have come to identify some faces as much with the outrage of the land acquisition episode as with the general wobbliness of the state administration. Till as long as these faces are not substituted, any chance of the Left staging a quick comeback in the state would remain wobbly.        
	Every extra day, the Left Front government stays in office, it actually alienates the people some more, quite apart from the fact that its effectiveness has now touched zero, as is abundantly evident in its failure to save its own supporters from Maoist depredations. To put it even more bluntly, so that the Left can hope for a restoration of its fortunes in the longer run, the present Left Front government needs to terminate itself without further ado.              
	There is a parallel problem with the CPI(M)s state party leadership too. The huge army of party cadre, loyal and honest to the core, is no less keen to have a new set of sentinels who could lead them out of the cul-de-sac they have reached. Unless the present leaders step down on their own, the structure of discipline within the party will stand in the way of that transition. Curiously enough, given the overwhelming dominance of West Bengal in the party, the central leadership too will fail to remove the current leadership in the state. Obduracy of the latter might then imperil the Left all over the country.

	Q: This is regarding a probate case. There have been several adjournments to the case and now the witnesses are too old and infirm to be able to attend proceedings. Is there any provision by which their testimony can be recorded (in writing or on a tape recorder) and used as evidence?
  Prantik Sanyal, Calcutta                
	A: If the witnesses are not in a position to depose before the court you could make an application for appointment of a commissioner for witnesses to be examined in their place of residence.                
	Q:I am a senior citizen and have been living in a rented accommodation since my retirement in 2002. While in service I had rented out my house to two persons. Both stopped paying the rent 10 years back and demanded huge sums to vacate the house. I had filed suits against them in 2003 but since they sought adjournments repeatedly on various grounds, the judgment is yet to be delivered. What legal recourse do I have now?
  P.K. Das, Calcutta          
	A: Since your matter is sub judice, you can do little but wait for legal proceedings to take its course. However, as you are a senior citizen, you can apply before the high court seeking a direction upon the trial court to complete the trial within a specific time frame. This would expedite your suits.                
	Q:Is a completion certificate and an occupancy certificate one and the same thing? While I am told that no one can occupy a flat without an occupancy certificate, the promoter says that the completion certificate is sufficient. What is the significance of these documents? What is the fee payable and to whom?
  Naushad Anwar, Calcutta          
	A: A completion certificate certifies that the execution of the building has been completed in accordance with the completion plan. It is on the basis of this certificate that the municipal commissioner grants permission for municipal water connections, drains, etc. An occupancy certificate, on the other hand, is a document certifying that the building is fit to be occupied and is in habitable condition. The municipal commissioner issues both the certificates once the conditions stipulated in the Kolkata Municipal Act and Kolkata Municipal Building Rules are fulfilled.

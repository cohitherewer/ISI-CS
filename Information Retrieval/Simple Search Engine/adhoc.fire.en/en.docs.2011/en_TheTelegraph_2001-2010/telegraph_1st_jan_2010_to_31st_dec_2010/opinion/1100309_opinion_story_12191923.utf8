	A special status, because it is special, always carries with its privileges the hidden threat of reversal. Some of the best Christian academic institutions of the country have found that they may lose their minority status. They could perhaps argue that their respective levels of achievement could not have been reached without the comparative autonomy they enjoy on the basis of their religious denomination. The National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions, however, has announced that, in order to claim minority status, a minority educational institution must have at least 30 per cent of its students drawn from that particular community. Most Christian educational institutions do not. It is beside the point that the NCMEI had earlier bequeathed minority status to numbers of institutions without any such condition. The NCMEI chairman, M.S.A. Siddiqui, now thinks that minority institutions should have a minimum, reasonable percentage of students belonging to the relevant community. Thirty per cent is Mr Siddiquis own idea of minimum, reasonable. That is, the government, or its appointed body, will ensure that a minority institution goes minority with a vengeance.        
	Here it is not just a question of the government interfering with education, assailing institutions with possibly well-meaning but completely uncomprehending legalities, and thus laying education to rack and ruin. There is some of that, and also the hypocrisy latent in giving some institutions autonomy and then dictating how many students they are to take from which community. Christian institutions will find themselves hard put to find 30 per cent of their students from the community when Christians are two per cent of the population. It would also mean virtual quotas in special status schools  a stifling of openness and a vertiginous narrowing that seems surreal. But far more important than these specifics is the question of special status. The granting of autonomy to educational institutions run by various religions has a divisive edge. The imposing of percentages and conditions is the reverse side of what goes for affirmative action in this country. It shows up the stinginess at the heart of Indian thinking about education. Why cannot all institutions, majority, minority or deliciously mixed, have the freedom to choose their students, teachers, syllabi and fee structures?

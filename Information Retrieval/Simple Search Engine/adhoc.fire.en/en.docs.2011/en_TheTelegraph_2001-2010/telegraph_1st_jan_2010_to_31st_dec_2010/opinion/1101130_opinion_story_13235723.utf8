                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PULLING APART                                                    
	It is indecision that has killed the cat for the Congress in Andhra Pradesh. The high drama that began with the resignation of the former chief minister, K. Rosaiah, continued through the anointing of a new chief minister and culminated in Jaganmohan Reddys breaking away from the party would perhaps not have been enacted had the party been able to make up its mind about a few essentials soon after the death of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy. One, whether it rooted for dynastic politics or the politics of merit that encompasses talent, public appeal and experience. Two, whether it subscribed to centralized party politics or one that allowed regional units the freedom and initiative they deserved and demanded. The Congress has yet to decide on these questions. Hence, it finds itself in muddles like the one in Andhra Pradesh. The party could have saved itself the embarrassment of being ditched by a political greenhorn had it nipped the dynastic ambitions of Y.S.R. Reddys son in the bud and given Mr Rosaiah the backing and confidence to deal with Mr Jaganmohan Reddy. Instead, the party ducked responsibility and settled for the convenient strategy of letting the younger Reddy turn into a rebel. If a cause was missing, the party gave it to him by playing up the divisions in the party and the family in order to isolate the threat. The political game has left the Congress and Mr Jaganmohan Reddy joint claimants to the legacy of Y.S.R. Reddy  which has given the party two state governments and sufficient strength in the Central legislature. A rift in the Congress vote bank can only be to the advantage of the Telugu Desam Party, which has found itself in political wilderness for more than half a decade.        
	The departure of Mr Jaganmohan Reddy, however, simplifies the issues before the incumbent chief minister, Kiran Kumar Reddy, who, unlike Mr Rosaiah, will have a freer heart and hand to take on a political challenge from outside his own party. The chief minister hopes to use Y.S.R. Reddys social schemes to counter secessionism. But here again, the partys ambivalence on the Telangana issue may hamstring him. In any case, the partys dragging of feet on dissidence has left him with insufficient time to prepare for the storm that may be unleashed next month with the Srikrishna committee report on Telangana.

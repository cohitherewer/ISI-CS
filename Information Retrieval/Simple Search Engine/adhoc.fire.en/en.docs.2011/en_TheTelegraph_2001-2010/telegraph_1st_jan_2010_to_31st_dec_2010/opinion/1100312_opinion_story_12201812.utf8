	Women rule                  
	Sir  The controversial womens reservation bill is unlikely to fulfil its intended purpose of ensuring that women have more say in the countrys politics (Bill for change?, March 10). Parliamentary legislation will not ensure the political empowerment of women.          
	The initiative for greater representation of women must begin at the party level. All major political parties should make it mandatory that at least a third of its members are independent and qualified women. Moreover, dummy candidates, like the wives and daughters of men who vacate political posts, should not be allowed (Whip on hubby quota hazard, March 7). A constitutional amendment will only lead to more proxy female members, controlled by the men who have placed them there. Women should not fall into this trap.          
	Yours faithfully,       
K. Venkataraman, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  Despite India making giant leaps in the worlds of agriculture and industry, the women in the country remain marginalized and subjugated. India, therefore, is still a developing country. Although women are making advances in several fields, many still live in misery.          
	Exploiting the 50 per cent reservation for women in civic and local bodies, many sarpanch patis play puppet-master to the women actually occupying the seats. The government seems to have only just woken up to this problem.          
	Evidently, most policies to help uplift women have proved to be futile, largely due to corruption, bribery and a lack of sincerity in implementing them. All this can be rectified by changing conventions and perceptions about women. The clamour for womens reservation stems from an urgent need to integrate more women in the countrys mainstream. It is very difficult to change age-old notions overnight, but one should acknowledge that just as a country needs to coordinate all spheres of development, it must also ensure the equal participation of both genders in order to move forward.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The first International Womens Day was celebrated in 1911, and in 2010, on the eve of its centenary, the womens reservation bill has been passed. It is perhaps unique that the president of the country, Opposition leaders and the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance government have all worked together to get this bill passed.          
	Although the reservation for women in the panchayats is laudable, the practice of men actually running the show for women in panchayats as well as in municipalities must be stopped. One hopes that once the 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament is implemented, more women will get elected on the basis of merit and be able to participate actively in decision-making, and the phenomenon of sarpanch patis will also come to an end.          
	The bill will give women a platform to voice their opinions, something that the late Rajiv Gandhi particularly wished for. It will realize the dream of thousands of women still fighting discrimination every day.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,

	Sir  While it is heartening that the womens reservation bill has been passed after years of politicking, several politicians cut a sorry figure when they attempted to block the bill on the pretext that it did not provide sub-quotas for minorities (Ruckus puts off quota vote by a day, March 9).          
	The 33 per cent reservation will not do away with the existing reservations for minorities. In fact, if there are sub-quotas within reserved categories, then there is no reason to have separate reservations for minorities. Several established politicians would take advantage of sub-quotas by fielding women from their families for the seats while they continue to make the actual decisions. The Indian mindset does not seem ready to shed the tradition of restricting women to the home.          
	It is unwise to create divisions between women through demands for sub-quotas. The bill is aimed at womens empowerment as a whole. A social malaise such as dowry and other atrocities on women are not restricted to backward sections of society. They prevail in all social strata. The present legislation should also incorporate the two-child norm, already popular at the panchayat level.There is no reason yet to believe that the bill will do away with gender discrimination, which is deeply embedded in Indian society. It may be years before the practice of female foeticide ends and the right of the girl child is established. In a patriarchal society, women can only be empowered if they have a say in the decision-making, both in government as well as at home.          
	Yours faithfully,

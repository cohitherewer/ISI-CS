                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	All in the family                  
	Sir  The introduction of Aditya Thackeray, grandson of Bal Thackeray, to politics proves that most regional parties in India are run like family businesses. The same logic lies behind Lalu Prasads induction of his son, Tejaswi, into the Rashtriya Janata Dal. Politicians strictly adhere to the bloodline in selecting their political heirs. An upper age limit of 65 should be fixed for contesting elections. This will bring in talented and deserving young men and women into the political system.           
	Yours faithfully,         Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 
        
	Too much fuss          
	Sir  Ajmal Kasabs wry smile and yawn, on prominent display in front of the camera, indicate one thing  he has full faith in the legal machinery of the largest democracy in the world (A smiling Kasab appears on video, Oct 22). Under this system, he can rest assured that his life is secure for at least a decade from now. The government of India has so far spent a whopping Rs 30 crore per annum of the taxpayers money to protect this prized catch. By the time this dreaded criminal is sent to the gallows, the amount spent on his security would be sufficient to finance a medium-sized powerplant in the country.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Arun Malankar, Mumbai 

                
	Sir Why do we have to agonize so much over the trial of Ajmal Kasab? The administration goes into a tizzy on each day of Kasabs trials, shutting off roads or imposing heavy security. When the trial is not on, Kasab remains in his cell at the Arthur Road jail and then shows off in front of the closed circuit television when the trial is conducted. The United States of America, meanwhile, is said to have already concluded the trial of the man accused of planting a bomb at Times Square. Kasab killed without compunction and deserves a death sentence. India should stop using Kasab as an exhibit and the media should stop giving so much coverage to an anti-hero.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa 

                          
	Mucked up          
	Sir  A high-level, multi-pronged investigation has been ordered by the prime minister to look into the irregularities in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games. Corruption is at its zenith in all spheres of public life. It is, in fact, legalized because we have almost accepted that 10 to 20 per cent of all funds earmarked for development projects will be misappropriated. India has seen innumerable commissions of inquiry which take an indefinite period of time to come to a conclusion. Justice delayed is always justice denied.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Wazir Hossain, Calcutta

                          
	Come together          
	Sir  Calcutta and its citizens deserve kudos for maintaining harmony during the just-concluded Durga Puja. Durga Puja has become a festival that goes beyond religion. For a visitor like me, it was wonderful to witness various linguistic groups and communities coming together for the celebrations.           
	When the mandir-masjid dispute is threatening to tear apart the secular fabric of the nation, a Muslim, Shahid Ali, acted as the priest at the Five Star Club puja of Munshiganj in Kidderpore. Reports said that Ali has been observing the rituals of puja according to the Hindu shastras for the last eight years, including observing a four-day fast.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Jyoti Lal Chowdhury, Silchar, Assam

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A leader to be reckoned with
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A leader to be reckoned with                                  THIS ABOVE ALL : Khushwant Singh                          Clearly the best                                        
	The prime ministers first press conference in the second tenure of his office has had a mixed reception from the media. The general trend of criticism is that the pace of progress which marked his first tenure has slackened, and the government has not been able to spell out its course of action as clearly as it should have done. There is some substance in these charges  so I make bold to draw up my list of priorities which need immediate solution.        
	On the top of my list are the high prices of foodstuff  essentials like rice, wheat, lentils (daal), onions, potatoes and cooking oil  that common people cannot afford to pay. They must and can be brought down as soon as possible. No one should go hungry.        
	On the same level is the need for the government to reassert its authority in territories where the Maoists rule the roost. There must be a joint effort on the part of the state governments and the Centre to open dialogue with Maoist leaders, to concede what is justifiable on condition that they give up their illegally acquired arms. The onus for doing so rests more with the state governments than with the Union ministry of home affairs.        
	There is also a pervading sense of insecurity all over the country. Even in the capital, women feel uneasy going out alone after nightfall. There are far too many vagabonds without work who go about snatching purses, handbags, and making unseemly overtures to young girls. Common citizens must cooperate with the police in driving these unsocial elements away from the streets and bazaars.        
	And finally, we have to do something to speed up our judicial processes. Inordinate delays in bringing criminals to justice have spread a feeling of despair. People tend to take the law in their own hands because those in charge of maintaining law and order take far too long to do so.        
	Once agreed on the list of priorities, ask yourselves who is the best person to fulfil them. Go over the names of all you think of as possible replacements for Manmohan Singh. There are quite a few who sound cleverer than him, but is there one who can match his wisdom and sagacity? There are some with more political clout in the regions they come from: but does any of them have as much experience of economic affairs and international relations as he has? Can they be credited with turning round the economy of the country as he did during his tenure as finance minister and later as prime minister? Do not mistake his gentleness for weakness. He has been, and can still be, a leader to be reckoned with. Without exception, all ministers of his cabinet hold him in respect and abide by his judgment. There are no dissenting voices amongst the men and women who rule us. They have delivered the goods  and as Singh himself admitted with characteristic humility: We have done well; we could have done better.                
	One last thought                
	For me, Shankar Sen of Calcutta is a discovery. I had earlier written favourably about his translations of the poems of Shamsur Rahman. I now have his collection of poems, Down Memory Lane. The following lines echo my sentiments and make Sens words read better than mine:                
	For a few moments
  The sun hides
  Behind the clouds
  And the light grows hazy.
  My hear sinks
  I ask myself,
  Is this the end?...
  I have had my fill
  Of the many pleasures
  This world had to offer.
  I have suffered pain, shed tears
  Been betrayed by friends
  And befriended betrayers.
  As the inevitable climax draws near
  One last thought looms up
  On the few unwritten pages still left
  in the diary.                
	Let me not dwindle
  Inch by inch
  Like a tapering candle
  Ending without a flicker.
  Let mine be the exit of a meteor 
  Swift, abrupt,
  One last burst of fire
  Into the realms of unknown.
  Would it please Thee
  To grant this ultimate wish?  
	Battle the blues                
	Santa was angry with the dyer who dyed his turbans because the colour of his turban did not quite match the one he had ordered for. He wanted the blue worn by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, but his turban had been dyed in a darker shade of blue.        
	So he fumed and said, I wanted to look like Manmohan Singh, not like Mana Mohana (Lord Krishna).

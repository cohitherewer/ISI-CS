                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WINDING ROAD                                                    
	It is typically audacious of the government of West Bengal to make tall promises after failing to meet a deadline that was set by the highest court of the land. Last year, the Supreme Court had ordered states to demolish all unauthorized religious structures on public land. In compliance with the order, most states filed reports detailing where such structures exist. But West Bengal, of course, failed to do so. Yet, not to be deterred, it has promised that the list, which could not be drawn up in one year, would be ready in a months time. Even if the government, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), is able to achieve its ambitious goal, there is little hope that putting together a list will entail decisive action. For a party that swears by secularism, the CPI(M) has habitually dithered over taking decisions, even perfectly legitimate ones, that might upset religious sentiments. In the process, it has allowed vote-bank politics to ride roughshod over public good. It is also characteristic of the CPI(M) to use the public as an alibi for inaction, as it has, once again, done in this case.        
	While excusing itself to the court, the government pointed out that it may not be feasible in all cases to summarily execute the judicial order, given the sensitive nature of the problem. It also added that the list, which is being compiled, will mention the extent to which the public want a particular structure to be removed, and even explain possible grounds for sparing it. But what sort of an argument  which is, presumably, an appeal based on reason rather than passion would persuade the administration that a particular case is worthy of exemption? In fact, this proviso clearly reflects the Left Fronts non-commitment to enhancing public safety. Indian roads are already menacingly cluttered spaces, which barely allow much security, let alone comfort, to pedestrians. Sundry structures jutting out in the middle of busy intersections or crowded streets often prove to be potentially dangerous for the common man. So, rather than using the public as a convenient shield against judicial reprimand, the government should try to shield the public from such perils  which is, after all, its proper function.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RULED BY THE LAW                                  Warisha Farasat                              
	The recently released annual report by the under-secretary-general of the United Nations, special representative for children and armed conflict, Radhika Coomaraswamy, has run into trouble with the Indian government. The latter has taken exception that Coomaraswamy has clubbed India with countries in Asia and Africa facing protracted armed conflict. The argument runs along predictable lines: India is not just another Asian or African country embroiled in ethnic conflict, but a mature democracy.        
	India reiterated its stand that there was no armed-conflict-like situation within its borders, implying that international standards applicable to other countries have no bearing on it. Since the report condemns the alleged recruitment and use of children by Maoist armed groups, Indias position is intriguing.        
	In Naxalite-affected areas, complex interactions between caste, class and religion have produced patterns of social and economic inequality. Given the extent of the marginalization of these communities, it is inevitable that deprivation and iniquitous development would find pre-eminence in debates on the Naxal issue. Nonetheless, a civil and political rights prism should not be totally dispensed with. It is here that the report assumes significance.        
	Salient national and international principles of civil and political rights and the rule of law must be adhered to in the fight against the Naxals. Operation Green Hunt should not ignore jus cogens norms regarding the use of military force against a civilian population. The Geneva Conventions prescribe minimum standards applicable not only to international conflicts but also to situations of non-international armed conflicts.        
	Nations are obligated to apply either their own domestic laws or rules that are part of international treaties or covenants to which they are signatories. However, principles, such as those enshrined in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, have attained the status of international law  all countries are bound by these principles even if they have not enacted domestic legislation protecting these rights.         
	Common Article 3 provides that persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion, faith, sex, birth, wealth or other similar criteria. Equally important is the norm against the recruitment and use of children in combat either by State or non-State actors.        
	Therefore, it is misleading to contend that the report attempts to equate the Naxalite issue with other instances of armed conflict. Rather, it aims to draw attention to egregious violations of civil and political rights committed in countries that do not consider themselves in traditional situations of armed conflict. According to Coomaraswamy, there is no one or uniform definition of what constitutes an armed conflict. Moreover, the protection of children in any context is fundamental. So forced recruitment of children by Maoists would fall within her mandate.        
	Much of Indias opposition to the term armed conflict stems from the fact that if conceded, it would then be required to respect the regime of international law in Naxalite areas. While this may be partly true, India should be mindful that post-Cold War, developments in international human-rights regime have meant that a State could be held accountable for crimes committed within its borders even though they do not fall within the formal definition of an armed conflict. Under the Rome Statute, it is sufficient to prove that a widespread or systematic attack is perpetrated against a civilian population. So, armed conflict or not, India remains bound by certain peremptory norms just like everyone else.

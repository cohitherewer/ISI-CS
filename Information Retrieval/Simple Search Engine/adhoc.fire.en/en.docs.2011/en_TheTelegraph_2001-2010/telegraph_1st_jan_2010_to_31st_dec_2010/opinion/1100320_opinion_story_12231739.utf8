Datta-Ray                                                            
	More recently, Lee Kuan Yew said the same thing during the conversations for my book on his role in Narasimha Raos Look East policy. India would have been transformed, he argued, if Mrs Gandhi had continued the declaration of Emergency for ten, twenty years after making the trains run on time. He laughed when I asked why he had not said so publicly at the time. How could I? They would all squat on me! I am already thought to be authoritarian. Here I am supporting a democrat who is turning into a dictator! Lee thought she was trying to do the right thing for India through the Emergency. I didnt think she was trying to do India in, trying to do it for her glory or her wealth. I told him about the comment attributed to Foot and Lee conceded he lacked the audacity to follow the Labour leader.        
	Lees advocacy of strong governance was expected. But it was a surprise from a British social democrat. A common friend, himself an active Labour supporter, explained that in Foots eyes, Jawaharlal Nehru and his progeny could do no wrong. What he didnt add was that Clement Attlee, Aneurin Bevan who was Foots great hero, Fenner Brockway who was born in Calcutta of missionary parents, and other Labour Party veterans of Krishna Menons India League, took a proprietary interest in India. They saw modern democratic India as their creation.               
	All India Radio asked me to interview Bevans widow, Jennie Lee, during the Emergency but warned repeatedly not to raise any political question. The insipid conversation with the dumpy little woman with heavy make-up and an artificial blonde bouffant dragged on until she suddenly took the initiative with, I want to say what a wonderful woman Indira Gandhi is and how much I admire everything she is doing! or words to that effect.        
	I was not surprised. Jennie Lee would not have come to India at that time as the Indian governments guest except to demonstrate solidarity with Mrs Gandhi. The latter must have gloated over the implications of the visit and the bonus of a distinguished British personalitys endorsement of the Emergency over AIR. But I doubted whether Nyes widow had much idea of what the Emergency was all about. She was being loyal to her husband who had been devoted to Nehru. India and Nehru were synonymous.        
	Foot was in a different league, with an intellectual breadth that is rare in the hurly-burly of political life, an authority on Byron, Hazlitt and H.G. Wells, and author of The Pen and the Sword: Jonathan Swift and the Power of the Press. Writing under the pseudonym of Cato in Guilty Men, he launched a withering attack on Neville Chamberlains appeasement of Hitler. He admired and wrote about the radical Tom Paine, one of the fathers of American independence. Foot and Jill Craigie, his wife, made a film at their own expense to expose Slobodan Milosevics atrocities in Bosnia.         
	His reported comment on the Emergency might arguably have been excusable if he had known of the self-interested posturing that it encouraged or the antics of those Indians who feathered their nests by ingratiating themselves with the American human rights lobby. But such cynicism was beyond his comprehension. The smack of firm government remark reflected his goodwill come what may for Nehrus daughter, and perhaps also his fear that India was drifting towards anarchy during those months of civil turmoil that preceded the Emergency.         
	But did he really utter those words? Where you got that from I dont know but I said no such thing! he snapped when I visited his small Hampstead house overflowing with books to find the heart of an ox imprisoned in a frail body in a shabby green jersey embroidered with Old Labours forgotten logo. That was seven years ago. As I wrote in these columns at the time, he proudly recalled he had insisted on visiting Mrs Gandhi against the advice of his friend and colleague, Richard Crossman, Britains foreign secretary, foreign office mandarins in London, Britains high commissioner in New Delhi, and the Socialist International which was concerned about George Fernandes. Foot, who was then Harold Wilsons employment secretary, remained unapologetic to the end about defying the fashionable orthodoxy of the time.        
	As I wrote in 2003, His three-hour tte--tte with Mrs Gandhi served a useful purpose, he says. It forced her to face up to concerns like Sanjays birth control measures, the expulsion of foreign correspondents and Fernandess incarceration, that few others brought up with her. She didnt lose her temper. She didnt give satisfactory replies but didnt refuse to talk either, as everyone had said she would.        
	Above all, she gave the lie to those jeremiahs who had been singing a dirge for democracy. She assured Foot she had no intention of extending the Emergency. Of course, we will hold elections, she said, and well win them. Foots aside that she was probably convinced she would does not alter his conviction that the 1977 election was a momentous event. No exercise in the whole history of democratic politics can compare with it. He is more eulogistic than James Callaghan whose measured praise for Mrs Gandhis decision (while Morarji Desai looked as if he had bitten on a bitter lemon) provided Congress candidates from Kashmir to Kanyakumari with campaign material. He was impressed by her acceptance of electoral defeat and determination to regain her political authority. When Mrs Gandhi visited Britain, he took her to Ebbw Vale, Bevans old Welsh constituency he had inherited.        
	I am not sure there wasnt a tinge of patronage in all this, especially in the belief that he had influenced Mrs Gandhi. It was the way with Labour stalwarts. It came out again when I invited Fenner Brockway to write an article for the paper I edited. Brockway, who famously flaunted a Gandhi cap in the House of Commons and was fond of recounting how only a man and a dog turned up to hear him speak on Indian independence, and the dog was the more attentive of the two, readily complied. But his article began with how, as a child in Bengal, he had no compunctions about mixing with Indian children.              
	Foots political career was not deemed a success. As a minister he failed to forge the social partnership between capital and labour that was his ideal. His 31 months as party leader led to the split that formed the Social Democratic Party and Labours huge defeat of 1983. Today, Labour is mired in scandal. Three members of parliament, David Chaytor, Elliott Morley and Jim Devine, are trying to wriggle out of theft charges by claiming parliamentary privilege under the Bill of Rights of 1689. Among Labours prominent South Asians, one scandal after another dogs Keith Vaz, the first Asian MP since Shapurji Saklatvala. Swraj Paul and Pola Uddin have been caught with their noses in the trough.         
	Michael Foot was above such shenanigans. As Gordon Brown said on Monday, his was a life lived in the service of the greatest of progressive causes. There were no hymns or Biblical tracts but readings from Cicero to Byron and that stirring refrain, Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,/ Well keep the Red Flag flying here. That ode to a lost cause was an appropriate valedictory to a man who sought nothing for himself. Whatever his views on the Emergency, there wont be another like him.

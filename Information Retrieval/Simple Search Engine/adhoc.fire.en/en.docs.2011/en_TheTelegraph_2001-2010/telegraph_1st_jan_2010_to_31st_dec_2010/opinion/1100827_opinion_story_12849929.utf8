	The pen never stops                
	Absolute Khushwant: The Low-down on Life, Death and Most Things In-between (Penguin, Rs 250) has Indias dirty old man, Khushwant Singh, writing about politicians, regrets, love, death, and, of course, sex, though not in that order. He begins the book with the essay, On being a very old man, where he speaks about his experience of being ninety-five. I am not prone to lying down but these days I find I need to rest more often. I am a man of habit and have stuck to the same routine for over half a century. I think its my writing thats kept me going. So this is vintage Khushwant charming and forthright. Never the one to mince words, he calls Rajiv Gandhi just a boy scout, Maneka Gandhi a no-good politician and describes L.K. Advani as the one man who has done more damage to the country than any other. If he unanimously supports the present UPA government, it is because the fundoos have been put down. Candour marks Singhs essays on personal topics as well. He confesses that his marriage was not happy, and that he still loves to fantasize. Of course, my mind is still very active. Though Im not doing it any longer, I can still write about it. Nobody has invented a condom for the pen. My pen is still sexy. The book has an introduction by Humra Quraishi.                                  
	The Little Book of Maths Theorems, Theories amp; Things (Orient, Rs 195) by Surendra Verma brings together philosophy and mathematics. So we have Pythagoras, Bertrand Russell, Felix Klein and Charles Babbage sharing space in this book, which combines facts and trivia in an interesting manner. We get to know how the search engine, Google, gets its name, and the answers to some of the riddles posed by the Gryphon to Alice. Verma shows that one can also have fun with mathematics. An algebraic fallacy can help you prove that youre the Pope, and Godels incompleteness theorems can let you be true and false at the same time.                         
	The Cult of Osiris (Hachette, Rs 295) by Andy McDermott features the Great Sphinx of Egypt, a secret religious society and a hyperventilating young archaeologist, Macy Sharif, who runs from pillar to post, literally, to save the day and a Hall of Records hidden inside the Sphinx. The non-stop action from the beginning till the end can leave you quite exhausted. The book would probably provide the script for a masala Hollywood film in near future.

	Danger, drama and dreams                
	Our Stage (Tulika, Rs 350) edited by Sudhanva Deshpande, Akshara K.V. and Sameera Iyengar brings together an excellent range of articles discussing the Pleasures and Perils of Theatre Practice in India. The papers are based on the proceedings of the Not the Drama Seminar, organized under the aegis of the India Theatre Forum at Ninasam, Heggodu, in March 2008. Divided into five sections  Locales, Experiments, Assertions, Pathologies, New Realities, and Institutions and Training  the seminar touched on ideas involved in cutting-edge theatre research in India. Fine essays by Samik Bandyopadhyay, Aijaz Ahmad and Shiv Visvanathan are supplemented by animated panel discussions and responses from the participants, which have been reproduced.                                  
	Mission Moon (Puffin, Rs 175) by S.K. Das is a useful handbook for young readers interested in the recent expedition undertaken by Chandrayaan I. Part One provides a scientific background, before dealing with the specifics in the following section. The basic concepts are explained lucidly, with diagrams and charts, keeping in mind the intended readership. The book should also appeal to older readers curious about space research.                        
	Dancing Earth (Penguin, Rs 350) edited by Robin Singh Ngangom and Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih is an important anthology of poetry from Northeast India. Important because it is one of the few of its kind, not really because of its literary merit. Although the editors have carefully selected diverse voices writing in different regional languages, the quality of the verse, both in translation and in English, remains mostly pedestrian. There is either a surfeit of nostalgia for a vanished past or homage to the bounties of nature. Worse still are the lines inspired by political turmoil. There are traditions of poetry celebrating nature, creating mythologies, or dwelling on politics. But good verse always transforms the mundane into something rich and strange. Even with a solid introduction, this collection fails to make that mark.                        
	Come, Before Evening Falls (Hachette, Rs 295) by Manjul Bajaj tells a love story set in Haryana of the 1920s. With its lingering threat of honour killing and dangerous liaisons, the tale has a topical colour, although its telling isnt exactly captivating. The ambience of a small village, with its inhabitants trapped in a spidery web of conspiracies, could appear tedious. Even the flights of passion do not help matters much.

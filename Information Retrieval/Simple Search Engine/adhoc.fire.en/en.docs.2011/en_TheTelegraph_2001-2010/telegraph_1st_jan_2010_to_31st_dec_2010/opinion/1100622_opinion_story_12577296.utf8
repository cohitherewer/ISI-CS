	The great escape                  
	Sir  The mystery around the escape of Warren Anderson, one of the principal accused in the Bhopal gas tragedy case and former chairman of Union Carbide Corporation, deepens every day. It is especially difficult to ascertain who was instrumental in ensuring Andersons timely exit to the United States of America. Arjun Singh, the then chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, was undoubtedly aware of the goings-on (Arjun under glare over mystery caller, June 9). This fact has been also corroborated by Moti Singh, who was then the district collector of Bhopal.          
	Arjun Singhs silence at this juncture is inexplicable. This delay can only give rise to more speculations and not help the cause of the Congress, which is desperate to preserve the image of Rajiv Gandhi, who was the prime minister at the time of the Bhopal tragedy. It is improbable that Arjun Singh could have taken an important decision regarding Anderson without the sanction of the government at the Centre. The Congress will find it tough to wriggle out of this embarrassing situation, and the Opposition will undoubtedly hound it for answers.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Adhip Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Warren Anderson was allowed to flee Bhopal to keep the law- and-order situation of the city from deteriorating further, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is reported to have said, adding that the Centre will reconsider the possibility of Andersons extradition from the US. Mukherjee was fielding questions against his party colleague, Arjun Singh. The Congress seems to have made Singh the scapegoat. But it is important to understand that he could not have acted on his own. The Congress needs to explain why Anderson was allowed to escape, and on whose instructions. By allowing Anderson to get away, the Congress has let down the people of the country, especially the victims of the tragedy.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Speculations about a mystery caller from Delhi who sanctioned Andersons release point to a deep flaw in the administration. People are supposed to have trust in the national security and investigative systems. But the lack of transparency has violated this trust.           
	A former official from the Central Bureau of Investigation, who was involved in the Bhopal case, has stated that the government influenced the probe by directing the investigating agency not to press for Andersons extradition (Moily fights backlash on Anderson, June 9). The families of the victims still await justice. If the peoples faith in democratic processes is to be restored, then the mystery behind Andersons release should be unravelled.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is possible that the government is refusing to take steps against Warren Anderson, safely hidden in the US, for fear of losing prospective foreign investment. The whole saga reiterates the truth that the lives of the common people in India are held cheap. It is a known fact that Andersons escape was facilitated by politicians and diplomats in power at that time.           
	The government must take urgent steps to extradite Anderson to India and punish him. It is equally imperative that the government takes measures to rid the water bodies around the Union Carbide plant of contamination. Future generations should not be made victims of a tragedy that happened 26 years ago.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Only a couple of days after the judgment on the worlds worst industrial disaster, there have been horrifying revelations about the ways in which the case was handled by the government and the CBI. This has made matters worse for a nation already outraged by the inadequate punishment meted out to those held guilty. Reports now allege that Warren Anderson, who faced charges of culpable homicide, was let off and given bail. He was then given a ceremonious farewell and ferried out of the country, presumably at the behest of someone powerful (Cops saw off Warren with salutes: Pilot, June 10). The whole process was allegedly facilitated by Arjun Singh and other senior bureaucrats of the state. The CBI also cannot escape censure for failing to get Anderson extradited. The former Union Carbide chief must face trial in India. The Centre setting up a group of ministers to investigate the tragedy and the state government resolving to appeal against the verdict in higher courts may not be sufficient to undo the damage.          
	Yours faithfully,

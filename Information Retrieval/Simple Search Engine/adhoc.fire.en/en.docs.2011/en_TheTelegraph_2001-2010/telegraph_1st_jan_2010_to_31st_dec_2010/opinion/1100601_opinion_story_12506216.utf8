                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT IN INDIA                                                    
	Revas looks are not great; it looks rather emaciated. It belongs to an era before designers began to blow up cars to accommodate bulging bodies. But it is perfectly adequate; it can house an Indian couple in its front seats, while two brats can be easily be accommodated in the back seat. They had better be small, for the total passenger weight should not exceed 227 kilograms, but as an entry car for a newly-married couple, Reva makes good sense. It can make a quick U-turn even on the 12-feet-wide alleys of inner Bangalore. With its improved 70 nanometre torque, it can now manage the hill roads without much trouble. Above all, it is unnecessary to gear the car down as one climbs a hill  Reva is automatic. Despite these plus points, not even 14,000 Revas have been sold in 14 years. In a country which is buying 14 lakh cars in a year, the car can hardly be called a success. And yet, Mahindra and Mahindra has bought the Maini familys controlling share, and promised a cash infusion. What does Anand Mahindra see in this little car? Maybe Mahindra and Mahindra has too much money and is on the hunt for car companies. How otherwise would its interest in SsangYong be explained? No one in India has even heard of it. At its peak, the company produced two per cent of South Koreas cars; now it is in liquidation. It was for sale in 2003 when Daewoo, its holding company, failed; Mahindra and Mahindra had then gone and looked at it, and decided not to bid.         
	But maybe Mahindra and Mahindra sees some way of making money out of Reva. The rush of small cars in the Rs 2-4-lakh range shows that there is a large market as long as costs can be kept down. Charging Reva would be a pain. Whereas it takes five minutes to fill up an ordinary car at a petrol station, it takes two-and-a-half hours to charge Reva up to 80 per cent; the remaining 20 per cent would take another three-and-a-half hours. This can be done overnight; but anyone who wants to do more than 80 kilometres in a day would like to be able to charge the car on the way. So wayside charging stations are highly advised, if not necessary. If Mahindra and Mahindra wants to make a success of Reva, it should think of buying up or building car parks in crowded cities. People are prepared to pay for parking space; if it comes with an electric socket, they will think of having an electric car.

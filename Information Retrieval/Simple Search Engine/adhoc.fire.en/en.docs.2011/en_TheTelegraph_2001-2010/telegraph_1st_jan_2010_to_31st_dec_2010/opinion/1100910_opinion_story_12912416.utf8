	Clothing for liberation: A Communication analysis of Gandhis Swadeshi Revolution By Peter Gonsalves, Sage, Rs 495               
	Books on Indias freedom movement are still of topical interest. Authors have not ceased to exploit every opportunity to write about this momentous event in the history of the subcontinent. But no leader of the freedom movement has occupied so much space on bookshelves as the enigmatic Mahatma Gandhi. Scholars have ventured into all areas of research to uncover the secret to the success of the phenomenon called Gandhi, which shook the foundations of the mighty British empire. Interestingly, the book under review delves into an unexplored area of research. It unravels the unconventional methods of the frail, scantily clad leader who changed the lives of millions of people in the subcontinent.         
	We know of the unusual, sometimes even eccentric, ways in which Gandhi handled the plethora of conflicts that piled up on his political plate. Most of the time he managed to solve them in a way that left even his severest critics gaping in wonder. The irony was that everything was against him  the time, the political cross- currents in the country and the mighty power he thought should quit. Gandhi was a little man with a poor physique. He was shy and had a weak voice. He did not really possess the qualities of a brilliant orator, neither was he a great lawyer who could argue his case well. Yet this totally unassuming man succeeded in driving out from his country the most powerful colonizers of the time.         
	The colonizers decision to depart from India was the first indication that the sun was setting on the British empire. How Gandhi succeeded in achieving his end is still an enigma. His philosophy of love, ahimsa and satyagraha changed the whole language of politics. But few understood that there must also have been a method and a meaning the way he dressed. When Winston Churchill referred to him as a half naked fakir coming to parley on equal terms, he could hardly have known that Gandhi was using a particular weapon, the power of which the English could not withstand.         
	For the first time Peter Gonsalves takes up the question of Gandhis mode of dressing and shows that he used it as a tool for the liberation of his country. The very title, Clothing for liberation, may appear a bit strange. And the phrase that follows it looks no less peculiar  a communication analysis of Gandhis swadeshi revolution. On the one hand the idea is interesting and intrigues searching minds. On the other, it is hardly free from controversy. For who could have believed then, or even now, that such a style could bring a dominant political power to its knees? But Gonsalves takes up the topic to prove the importance of the symbolic potential of Gandhis use of khadi, which helped to usher in unity as well as independence in India. Even his contemporaries failed to understand this potential.         
	Gonsalves takes an unusual approach. Instead of employing the usual straightforward and native approach to analyse Gandhi, he uses foreign perspectives which Gandhi himself might not have approved of. Gonsalves applies the works of thinkers like Ronald Barthes, Victor Turner and Erving Goffman to test Gandhis sartorial ability to lead India to freedom. Out of the five chapters in the book, three are devoted to these theorists. Gonsalves give us their theories in a nutshell. He also effortlessly locates Gandhian thought in the context of the Western theories and shows it in a new light. Though at times it seems to be a bit strained, the idea cannot be brushed aside. Gonsalves shows how it is possible to reinterpret the thoughts of a man who swore by swadeshi from an international perspective.         
	Although the ideas of Western thinkers and Gandhian thought may seem to be completely contradictory to each other, the author has tried to reason that they are not. It might appear to be a surprising approach to take, for Gandhi tried to steer clear of everything that was Western. He invented a philosophy that was not only Indian but firmly rooted in ancient thought. But Gonsalves proceeds with his thesis in such a manner that the reader feels the power of his arguments.         
	The conservative Gandhian may or may not accept the manner in which Gonsalves presents his case. But no one can deny that the work is characterized by an enormous reverence for the leader, whom India seems to be slowly forgetting. Whether one likes it or not, this book is bound to usher in a new chapter of research on Gandhian thought. It proves the power the frail old man still has in a world that is changing every moment, and in which the old order is easily relegated to the realm of antiquity.

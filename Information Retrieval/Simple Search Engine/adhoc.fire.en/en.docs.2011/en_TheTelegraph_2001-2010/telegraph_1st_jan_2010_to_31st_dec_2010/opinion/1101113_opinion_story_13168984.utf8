                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BEYOND THE ROD                                                          
	From its origins in medieval Latin to the present day, discipline is a word that straddles knowledge and power. So, it is a noun as well as a verb. History, say, is a discipline in the sense that it is a system of knowledge, which demands from the historian a set of intellectual and scholarly activities and standards. But when an individual or group is disciplined, the verb refers to a way of maintaining order or control, the extreme forms of which can shade off into degrees of physical punishment and even torture. Historically, these uses of the word, and the forms of action linked to each, have often run into one another. This happens most notably in the activity of teaching (at home or in the classroom), in religious institutions like the church, and in the worlds of the military. So, when a school in Calcutta introduces discipline as a compulsory subject  like English or geography  on which students are going to be marked, then this dual usage becomes part of the decision in a way that leaves room for innovations in the classroom.        
	The immediate context of this decision is the abolition of corporal punishment in schools. So, the practical challenge lies in devising a system of rewards and punishments that would promote and maintain good conduct among students, from the youngest to the oldest, without resorting to physical violence. At this level, the methods of discipline as a subject are perhaps not new. Some schools in the city, especially those of Jesuitical pedigree, have been marking their students weekly for conduct and attention, with corresponding rewards and penalties. They also hold moral science and catechism classes, together with regular examinations, that address similar issues of behaviour and ethics from a religious or secular point of view. Socially useful and productive work  SUPW in short  has long been part of board assessments. So, the easiest thing to do would be to bring all this under a single rubric and call it Discipline.        
	But isnt that a rather mindless, and boringly utilitarian, way of defining a subject, turning a teacher into a bookkeeper or class monitor? For it to work as a subject, discipline has to be fun for both teacher and student. Surely, the point of banning corporal punishment is not only to protect children from getting beaten, but also to root out unthinking habits of punitive teaching, so that positive and creative substitutes for cruelty and the abuse of power may be improvised. A new subject should create new things to learn and new ways of teaching, opening up new forms of thought and expression. In this way, the most engrossing class in mathematics, or a thrilling music lesson, could become a highly effective class in discipline too, teaching a child not only to sit quietly and listen but also to reflect on what it means to be quiet and to listen. For it to be effective, enjoyable and fruitful, discipline as a subject must remain aware of the words dark underbelly and swing it around towards a new kind of light.

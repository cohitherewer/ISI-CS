	TRANSACTIONS IN TASTE: THE COLLABORATIVE LIVES OF EVERYDAY BENGALI FOOD By Manpreet K. Janeja, Routledge, Rs 695        
	Food is not merely something we eat, or merely a part of what we are. Manpreet K. Janejas Transactions in Taste, which is a phenomenological ethnography of normal Bengali food, convinces us that food determines our identity in more ways than one. In this illuminating study, Janeja offers an existential analysis of how food engages with everyday and hospitality transactions of Bengalis on both sides of the border in its distinctive temporal, spatial, corporeal, sensual, affective, discursive and moral ways. Coining a term from Martin Heideggers Being and Time, Janeja highlights food as a crucial component in our being-with-all-kinds-of-others, and describes the multiple modalities of its agency as foodscape. Since foodscape evokes a sense of place, it has a strong bearing on ones perception of desh, and is subliminally related to ones sense of rootedness, uprootedness and transrootedness.        
	In the first chapter of her book, where she analyses the agency of food, Janeja acknowledges her debt to erstwhile anthropological and structuralist approaches to gastronomic practices. Her thesis, she insists, is original on two counts; first, because it highlights collaborative agency of food, and second, because a standard ethnography of everyday Bengali food is virtually non-existent.         
	In the second chapter, she defines three terms (borrowed from A. Gells Art and Agency: An Anthropological Theory) that are used extensively in the rest of her book. These are: an actant, which is an active agent in a foodscape and can be both human and non-human, a patient, which is a potential agent or a locus of agency, and an event, which indicates the hybrid network of human relations creating actants and patients. Thereafter she proceeds to discuss the actants of a normal foodscape that include persons, places and things. Among other things, she makes here an interesting observation that very hot food marks the chhotolok consumers off from their bhadralok counterparts. Janeja also dwells long on the appellation, bhadralok, which, for her, encompasses a broad spectrum of significations, and indicates a Weberian status group rather than a Marxian class.         
	In the next two chapters, topics such as normality of food or the sacredness of kitchen come up for discussion. The moral, even sexual, connotations of food, the idea of purity related to the cooking and storage of food  which is endorsed both by Hindus and Muslims  are insightfully explored. The fifth chapter deals with the subjectivities that food sometimes assumes in everyday transactions in which the food itself becomes the actant, while the human agent, the cook, for instance, is relegated to passivity.        
	The sixth chapter focuses on normal food identities constructed in the sui generis Bengali idle-talk called adda, whereas the last chapter is about the idea of ownership engendered by an authentic creation of a normal foodscape.        
	Janejas ethno-existential analyses of constant and fraught negotiations of food in everyday Bengali life almost invariably draw upon meticulously simulated real life situations, which sometimes exude the flavour of Milan Kunderas novels such as Immortality or The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Her thoughts on food certainly provide solid and savoury food for thought.

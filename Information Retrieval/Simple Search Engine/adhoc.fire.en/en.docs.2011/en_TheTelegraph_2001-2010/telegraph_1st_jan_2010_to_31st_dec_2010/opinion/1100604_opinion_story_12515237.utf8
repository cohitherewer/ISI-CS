	In India, a sense of dj vu, and the utterly predictable, comfortable and unchanging are what persist. There is never a gust of new ideas, a breath of clean, uncluttered thinking from a generation that does not carry the cumbersome baggage of half-baked solutions that enforce a status quo, or of abject failures that have destroyed the vibrant fabric of this civilization. Our elders selfishly clutch on to the baton, disregard the next generation, and only pass on the baton when they die. Letting go is something they do not comprehend at all. The excuse is that the task is unfinished even though we know that nation-building can never, ever be complete. It takes on many fresh avatars with new compulsions in a changing, growing society.        
	Secretaries to the government of India get extensions when they retire. It is convenient to have the old familiar workhorse with the same responses and reactions rather than a person who has worked to reach the top but has never succeeded because his senior has been given an extension. It has become a joke. The older you become, the more secure your job gets. But the younger you are, the more stunted you get in your job and your promotion remains tenuous till death vacates the seat you should have had in the first place.         
	The team of the National Advisory Council has been announced. Strangely, it has all the names I personally had listed for some friends while betting on the fact that the list will be predictable and will have the obvious, albeit very good and competent, individuals. Two names were missing from my imagined list  Farah Naqvi and Deep Joshi. The rest, some ancient and others middle-aged, were there, down to a T, including the so-called new ones  Anu Aga, Harsh Mander, M.S. Swaminathan, Narendra Jadhav, Madhav Gadgil, Mirai Chatterjee  all culled from the national list of the obvious 100 from different disciplines who are shuffled about for either this committee or that.                 
	Step out        
	Hopefully, the NAC will advice the government on immediate administrative reforms to ensure that the many acts and schemes initiated by the United Progressive Alliance I and II assume a sense of reality, dignity and integrity for the neglected and the underprivileged, and bring about new mechanisms for transparent governance to ensure the delivery of goods and services deep into the hinterland.        
	These professionals, brought in ostensibly to think out of the box and to pressurize the government either to change track or to do the job better, are counterpoints to the government, underlining the priorities that need immediate attention. We need to involve the energetic minds of those professionals who are at the peak of their powers. Why do we wait for them to drown in frustration before tapping their valuable human resource? Why do we wait for them to begin their creative descent before we co-opt them into the high office of governance? And if we must look for the retired types with the statutory experience, why not introduce some unpredictable names?        
	Vikram Lal, who heads Common Cause, working for the needs of an anonymous public, Teesta Setalvad, who has used the law as it exists to relentlessly fight for justice on behalf of those who would never be heard, Vineeta Rai, who was the member-secretary of the last administrative reforms commission, with a fine professional career as an administrator, all committed and hugely experienced, would have been unusual but excellent interlopers in the newly appointed advisory. The more people we access for ideas and initiatives, stepping out of what is familiar, the more engaging and fruitful the returns will be. To identify and embrace our hidden treasures is the most important task of inclusive nation-building.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FUTURE PLANS                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	The Congress is reported to be apprehensive of the recommendation of the chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, that elections to the state assembly be held earlier than November, when the term of his ministry is scheduled to end. The cause for apprehension is that an election in the next couple of months will not give Rahul Gandhi the time he needs to revamp the party so that it can singlehandedly take on the Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party combine. The party also feels that if the election is held before the monsoon, it will not be able to take advantage of the routine government bungling in relied operations after the inevitable floods. Both arguments need to be examined.        
	First, the state of the party organization. For well over two decades, the Congress has been in a moribund state. The last time it was in office in Patna in the mid Eighties, factionalism had become so acute that in about three years the state had an equal number of chief ministers  Bhagwat Jha Azad, Satyendra Narayan Sinha and Jagannath Mishra. At present, the Congress has a state unit president who is apparently not wanted by anybody in its upper ranks. Indeed, the situation has become so precarious that the Congress is even thinking of bringing back Jagannath Mishra to the limelight, irrespective of the fact that the man from Mithilanchal had severed his connection with the Congress, and had to spend time in prison in connection with the animal fodder scam. Mishra may not ultimately be projected as the chief ministerial candidate, but this speaks volume of the deep desperation that caused some to even think of him.                
	Fare well        
	What can Rahul Gandhi achieve in this scenario, even if the elections are held in November? At best, he can enroll new members. But will an addition to its ranks make the party more acceptable to the people, particularly in a state where the other backward classes call the shots, and the Congress woefully lacks a leader of the stature of Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad or Ram Vilas Paswan? Also, there is no indication that the upper castes are trying to break away from the BJP. The BJP may be having problems elsewhere, but as a partner in the states coalition ministry, it is in much better shape in Bihar. Indeed, while having rosy dreams about the future, the Congress would do well to take a look at the last Lok Sabha elections, in which it could manage to win only three of the 40 seats. And there is no point referring to Uttar Pradesh in this discussion. In that state, all anti-Congress parties have serious problems of their own  which is not the case in Bihar.         
	Then the post-flood advantages. There had been floods when Lalu Prasad and, later, his wife were the chief ministers, and also in the last four years. But could the peoples discontent build up to any sustainable movement? It could not, because discontent over flood relief eases out with the receding river waters. When voting, people never go by an annual spell of discomfort to which they have become used, but take into account the overall performance of a party. Going by the recent standards in Bihar, the performance of the ruling coalition has certainly been something to write home about. For the first time in many years, the state has a government that is being positive.        
	Having said this, one should also take note of the fact that in the recent by-elections, the JD(U) did not fare as well as expected. But the gainer was the Rashtriya Janata Dal, not the Congress. There should be a lesson in that for the Congress. Instead of trying to create a miracle, it should seek to have a fair presence in the House, for which it should revive its alliance with the RJD as well as with the Lok Janshakti Party of Paswan. To regain past glory, it needs some ground beneath its feet. Doing it alone right now will make that task much more difficult.

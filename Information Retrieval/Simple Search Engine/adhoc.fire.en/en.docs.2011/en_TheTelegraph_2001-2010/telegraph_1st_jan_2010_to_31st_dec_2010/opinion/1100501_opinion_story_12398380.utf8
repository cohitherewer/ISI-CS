The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Brownie points for the young actors
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BROWNIE POINTS FOR THE YOUNG ACTORS                                  Theatre: Sebanti Sarkar                                                  
	Living on the wire, wired for signs of terrorism inside and outside, hoping each moment that the wire is not tripped, and yet determined to strive down to the wire  what better title can an amateur writer pick for his debut play than Wire. Presented at the Harrington Street Arts Centre on April 16 by the Jadavpur University Department of English (Jude), Saravanan Manis Wire captures all the confusion and angst of our times.        
	It is unusual for a university department to present an original play by one of its students, and that too at a venue other than their university auditorium. So two brownie points for Jude even before they started. Saravanan Mani, a postgraduate student of English, has grown up with the Chennai theatre group, Madras Players. Having written short pieces for Jude before, he was entrusted with the task of writing a workshop script, which was subsequently edited by Ananda Lal. The play, directed by Lal, uses basic props, suggestive dcor, live music, some choreography, and English peppered with Bengali, Hindi, Tamil and Spanish. The satire darkens progressively as it throws up various options and perspectives to the situation at hand  which, in brief, is as follows. An international film unit, trying to get the authentic feel for a film on terrorism, camps in the forests of the central Indian foothills. But reality serves up a situation that proves to be way too filmy for the crew to handle. The crew members are held hostage by a pair of armed and masked terrorists. What follows is not just a rescue through many twists and turns, but also an introduction to the various facets of the characters brought out through their reactions to the events.        
	The characters  somewhat hastily sketched  might have acquired more depth if parallels had been drawn between the film being shot and the course of events. Take the lead, superstar Raghav Kanth. Mani said later that he was an ageing superstar on the downslide, but there is very little in the play to show that. Kanth, nevertheless, is an attractive character. Faced with real-life threats, Kanth (played by Uttaran Das Gupta) lives up to his hero status, smuggling in a gun in true filmy style. But for him ethics do not matter when reputation is at stake. Unexpectedly, it is Pappu Gupta, the film producer (played by Samik Dasgupta)  who at first impression is a dull, profit-oriented geek  is the one who is willing to risk everything for the sake of what is morally right.         
	Dhruv Lal shines as the masked intruder and musician, but one feels that the characters of the two terrorists needed to be filled out. Too much was left to the interpretations of the audience. They could be art students out to do a field study on how high art reacts to reality, or extortionist or blackmailers (a real let- down), or siblings out for revenge and (again, sadly) monetary retribution, or they could be just foolish, poor people trying to loot in a filmy style.        
	The women characters, caught up in their own problems of rivalry, love and bitterness, are also sketchy except Ritu Kanth, Raghavs wife (played by Sangeetha Gangadharan). The choreography, when the tables turn and the lone terrorist is at the mercy of the film crew, was effective. The compositions that explored the floor space from various angles went off with remarkable smoothness, thanks to the young actors and the crew.

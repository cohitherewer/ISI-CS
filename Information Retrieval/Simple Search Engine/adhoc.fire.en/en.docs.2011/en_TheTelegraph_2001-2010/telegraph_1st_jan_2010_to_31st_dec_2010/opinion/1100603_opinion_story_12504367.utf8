	Mixed signals                  
	Sir  Given the perfunctory nature of the prime ministers press conference, one wonders why it was held at all (In saddle but not clinging, May 25). Manmohan Singh gave politically correct answers to the questions put to him. About the Maoist menace, he repeated what he had said earlier, and did not come out with a specific plan to deal with the problem. His defence of civil society activists, however, might have sent out mixed signals.           
	On Pakistan, it was the same rehash of his earlier view that dialogue was the best option. He also repeated his previous statements regarding the civilian nuclear deal between India and the United States of America. On the issue of corruption, he gave the standard reply that if corruption is found to exist he will take action. He deftly skirted some issues by talking of the ongoing inquiry, discussions in appropriate forum, and so on. All these answers sounded like common press handouts. There was the mandatory support to Sonia Gandhi, and a little more of paving the way for Rahul Gandhi as the future prime minister. One wonders why the question concerning Rahul Gandhi was brought up at all. The media do go overboard with this issue, and some of their members are rather sycophantic. Many in the Indian media even refer to the Gandhis as the countrys first family.          
	But it should also be noted that the media at the press conference were not vigorous enough. The questions asked, though topical, were mostly soft, generalized ones. There were hardly any tough questions demanding specific, unambiguous answers, let alone uncomfortable ones. If the answers were automated and safe responses, the questions were pale too, with no tenacious follow-up to the answers given.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Manmohan Singhs press briefing to mark the completion of one year of the United Progressive Alliances second term in government showed the prime minister in no extraordinary light. He was his usual sedate, suave and dignified self (Serious play, May 26). He seemed to be confident of his abilities, having confronted a slew of odds on the national and international fronts. While he refrained from saying anything remarkable, Singh did not miss out on rebutting a negative evaluation of his governments performance. Although Singhs achievements fall short of expectations, he has undeniably taken the initiative to transform Indias economy. Whether his efforts brought have about any substantive change that will benefit the common people is a different matter.          
	However, Singh has, indeed, given a new direction to the governments foreign policy with an eye on the rapidly changing global scenario. His concern for setting his priorities right with regard to Indias relations with Pakistan is appreciable. Singh is not unaware of the dangers of the volatile political situation within Pakistan. He is also not devoid of the wisdom of trying to make the powers-that-be in Pakistan realize that continuing with a hostile attitude towards India will not be let off unchallenged. Particularly welcome is the prime ministers insistence that peace talks would not be resumed until Pakistan stops pursuing its policy of going soft on the terrorism originating in its own soil. Also, Pakistans tendency to revert back to its original stance on the Kashmir issue must be avoided to make its intention for peace appear genuine.           
	On domestic issues concerning the greater good of the common people, Singh was tactical enough to exude optimism without indulging in overstatement. It is to his credit that he did not show any penchant for rhetorical flourishes. But then, he also cannot shirk the responsibility of tailoring policies to lift India out of the morass it has landed itself in on many key fronts.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Serious play, has gone overboard in praising Manmohan Singhs style during the recent press meet. The first chink in Singhs armour was visible when he talked about his retirement. He said that he had no intention to retire until he completed his job, but in the same breath, he added, I sometimes feel younger people should take over. As and when the Congress party makes that judgement, I will be very happy to make place for anybody the Congress party may choose. Would any of Singhs predecessors have made such a statement in public, implying that they were occupying the post of the prime minister because of the party presidents decision and not because they deserved it? When asked about the high inflation rate, Singh predicted that it will come down to 5 or 6 per cent by December, without elaborating on the basis of his optimistic forecast.          
	Yours faithfully,

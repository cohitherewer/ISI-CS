                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DESCENT INTO ANARCHY                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	It has become rather painful and dreary to write about the realities of this exploited nation. Every battle that is fought for what is right is lost because those who govern us are perpetuating personal commitments instead of a national agenda looking ahead to the future. Rajiv Gandhi, in his wisdom and integrity, had declared the conservation of the Ganga as one of his national priorities. He was bang on right. Today, the same government that eulogizes him twice a year, on his birth anniversary and on the day he was assassinated, has consistently taken decisions that radically deviate from what was once the mantra of the Congress  the protection of rivers, mountains, forests and fauna for the future of India.        
	The once mighty Ganga has been brutalized in its high reaches by a rapacious approval to build small dams along its upper course. The approval was an anti-environment decision, which was first stalled by the courts. The matter was then referred to the concerned authority for reassessment. Recently, an empowered group of ministers, the bane of our lives, has approved the continuance of this hugely damaging project. Why is the Manmohan Singh government hell-bent on destroying the Himalaya and the Ganga, using the laughable excuse that Rs 600 crores have already been spent? Why the hypocrisy of spending crores to restore the damage already done in the lower course of the river and, at the same time, allow, through an EGOM decision, the damage of the part not destroyed yet?         
	This time, the concerned ministry is not in the hands of an alliance partner. Is the ministry of environment being overruled by the EGOM, when the former could have used this opportunity to show by example that the Congress is a party of integrity that adheres to the environmental laws of the land and abides by the recommendations of the concerned minister? Where is the Congress as the watchdog of its government? Remember Indira Gandhi stopped the dam in Silent Valley. Money had been spent there too.                
	Decline in standards        
	The UPA II must endorse and celebrate the wisdom of Indira Gandhi by continuing the action she initiated based on her emphatic commitment to the country. Why spout euphoric words about her on her birthday and, in the same breath, deviate from her ethics?        
	The march towards an enhanced, destructive rate of growth needs to be damned. The time is ripe for the Youth Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, to take the baton Indira Gandhi left behind and run with it, compelling a restructuring of the prevailing mindset and making essential correctives for a truly substantive socio-cultural rate of growth. The economic rate of growth must not be allowed to take precedence over all else by breaking the rules that are enshrined in the statute books for our protection under the banner of liberalization. When rules are bent from the top, how can any law be enforced on ordinary citizens?         
	India has become an unregulated playground for unregulated projects being executed by unregulated individuals who have access to those who can ask for the laws to be bent to suit needs and priorities that have scant respect for environmental norms and rules. For ordinary Indians, politics and governance are at an abysmal low. Corruption is at an all-time high and rising. At a time when India should take its rightful place as an emerging power with all engines operating on socio-cultural-economic fronts, we are declining at all levels  integrity, ideas, alternatives, solutions and correctives. With a honourable and honest prime minister at the helm, we must urge the reversal of wrongdoings, and learn a lesson from those who once had the will to do so.

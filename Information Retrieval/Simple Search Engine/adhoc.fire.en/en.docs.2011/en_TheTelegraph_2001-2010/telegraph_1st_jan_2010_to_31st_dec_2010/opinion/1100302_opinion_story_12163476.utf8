	Once a principle has been violated, there is likely to be mayhem for a while. The Union human resource development ministrys decision to withdraw the deemed university label from 44 institutions of higher education because they do not deserve that status has created an embarrassing conflict between the ministry and the University Grants Commission. The experts in the UGC, also a government body, have pronounced the 44 institutions fit to continue in their current status, while the ministry has claimed by affidavit in court that it can reject the UGCs positive advice. Why were these institutions granted the coveted status in the first place? That first violation of principle  going by the findings reported by the HRD ministry  may have been prompted by politics or economics or both. Now it has been compounded by the ugly tussle between the ministry and the UGC, supposed to be working together towards the same goals. In all this play of power and ego, of legalese and technicality, it is quite possible to forget that the issue has to do with excellence in higher education, with standards and achievements.        
	This situation is one more reminder that governmental presence in higher education is best kept to a minimum. The market judges standards perfectly well, and generates the momentum for various institutions to better themselves. A falling-off from expected standards is never overlooked. The tendency of governments to regulate and equate often ends up queering the pitch, sometimes reducing dynamic institutions to mediocrity or raising inferior institutions to undeserved glory. No government is free of politics and ideology, or of agendas. Higher education is far better off without these; its quality is determined and judged in its own spheres of specialization. Although the government may have expert bodies such as the UGC, there is little transparency about the mode of appointment to these bodies or about the rationales behind assessments. When two institutions, obviously wildly unequal in standard, get the same grading, one has to credit either the experts special vision that captures invisible flaws and virtues, or extra-academic considerations. Obviously there were too many of the one or the other in the case of deemed universities. As usual, education cannot be left in peace.

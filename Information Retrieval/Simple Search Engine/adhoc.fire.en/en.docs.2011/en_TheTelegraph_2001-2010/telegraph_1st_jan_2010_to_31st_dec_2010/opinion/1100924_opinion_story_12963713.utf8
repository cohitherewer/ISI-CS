	Hugh Trevor-Roper: The Biography By Adam Sisman, Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson, 25        
	When the discussion turns in the distant future to a list of the great historians of the 20th century and the two obvious names  Marc Bloch and Fernand Braudel  have been put right on top, there is sure to be a debate about the name of Hugh Trevor-Roper featuring in such a list. One reason for the debate will be that Trevor-Roper, the Regius professor of History at Oxford from 1957 to 1980, never published the magnum opus on the 17th century English Civil War that everyone, admirer and critic alike, expected from him. Yet it is also true that no other historian of his generation  A.J.P. Taylor, Christopher Hill and Lawrence Stone, to name three with whom Trevor-Roper crossed swords  has experienced the kind of posthumous revival that the former Regius professor has in recent years. The last four years have seen the publication of four books by him (Europes Physician: The Various Life of Sir Theodore de Mayerne, Letters from Oxford: Hugh Trevor-Roper to Bernard Berenson, The Invention of Scotland: Myth and History and History and the Enlightenment: Eighteenth Century Essays). There may be more in the pipeline since Trevor-Roper left behind manuscripts of many unfinished books.        
	One of the questions that Adam Sisman attempts to answer in this marvellous biography  researched in detail and clearly written and argued  is why Trevor-Roper, who was not averse to writing  in fact, he wrote like an angel as Taylor once remarked  never finished books that he promised to write. One reason that Sisman points out is that he was a perfectionist and was thus seldom satisfied with what he had written. He imposed very high standards on himself. He wanted to write like Gibbon  who can ever live up to that ideal? But there were other substantial intellectual reasons related to the way Trevor-Roper saw the historians craft. He wanted to marry in his writings the narrative and the analytical. He also wanted to show how the various factors  economic, social, political and intellectual  interacted. He struggled to find a form that was lucid yet capable of conveying the complexity of this interaction which, he felt, was the essence of good history writing. He was influenced in his youth, as Sisman notes, by Marx and then, as is evident in his essays on the 18th century, by Montesquieu and Hume. This form eluded him in the big book on the 17th century that he wanted to publish, but he showed in his longer essays that it was possible to write history in this manner. He was the acknowledged master of the long historical essay. No other historian of the 20th century wrote with such effortless grace, wit and power of polemic.        
	Sisman reveals Trevor-Ropers loveless childhood in rural Northumberland, his early promise in Charterhouse and his brilliance in Christ Church, Oxford, where he first studied Classics and then History. He read and re-read the Classical writers throughout his life. He loved outdoor life walking, riding, hunting and travelling. Trevor-Roper wasnt elected for a fellowship at All Souls and he never quite forgave the college for this slight. He won a research fellowship at Merton and he used this to write a monograph on Archbishop Laud that won some academic acclaim. Then came the Second World War at the end of which Trevor-Roper became a celebrity.        
	Trevor-Roper worked for the intelligence services during the war and found a lifelong friend in Dick White, another Christ Church man who would later head both MI5 and MI6. It was White who suggested in the middle of 1945 that Trevor-Roper should go to Berlin and attempt to reconstruct Hitlers last days in the bunker. It was an intelligence operation, since it was not clear around September 1945 what actually had happened to Hitler. Trevor-Roper went to Berlin, and without recourse to too many documents, on the basis of interrogations, good detective work and intelligent deductions, he produced what became the book, The Last Days of Hitler. This book has stood the test of time and, as Sisman observes, subsequent research has not altered in any significant detail Trevor-Ropers account. This book launched Trevor-Roper as a leading Hitler expert.        
	His real expertise, however, was the 17th century and the changes that had then engulfed England. Back in Oxford, Trevor-Roper shed his uniform for the dons gown. He emerged as a devastating polemicist who gave no quarter to an intellectual foe. The first to be pierced by Trevor-Ropers rapier was Lawrence Stone who had written a piece on the decline of the Elizabethan aristocracy. Trevor-Roper swore to destroy Stone and proceeded to do that by exposing the latters many errors and misrepresentation of facts. It was in this phase that another familiar feature of Trevor-Ropers intellectual career emerged: promises to publishers to write books and then failing to deliver. It was not that Trevor-Roper was lazy. On the contrary, he worked hard: writing, redrafting and then eventually failing to finish. There always seemed to be other distractions and other books to write and never finish.        
	One major distraction was derived from Trevor-Ropers propensity to be upwardly mobile in terms of whom he wined and dined with. In this he was helped by the fact that his wife, Xandra, was the daughter of Field Marshall Douglas Haig, who had been made an earl. Her first marriage to a naval officer had fallen apart. Trevor-Roper had an affair with Xandra and married her after her divorce came through. She desperately wanted her husband to write the one great book. She loved socializing and it is possible that her extravagant tastes made Trevor-Roper run after money and take on journalistic assignments. Nonetheless, it was a deep relationship and according to Sismans researches, the only time Trevor-Ropers step children had seen him cry was when he was told that Xandra had to be taken away to a home because she was stricken by Alzheimers.        
	In spite of his failure to write a big book, Trevor-Ropers life would be described as a successful one. He was raised to the peerage; he became the Regius professor; he knew all the great and good of his time in Britain (Sisman reproduces a picture of him chatting with three prime ministers  Macmillan, Heath and Wilson); he was a power figure in Oxford (he campaigned hard to make Macmillan the chancellor) and became the Master of Peterhouse in Cambridge. His life had two major hiccups. One was his authentication of the Hitler diaries which were later proved to be forgeries. This nearly destroyed his professional reputation. Sismans retelling of this episode is objective, without any attempt to absolve his subject of his responsibility. The other was the Mastership in Peterhouse where he fell a victim to petty intrigue masterminded by Maurice Cowling and his cabal of fellows. Trevor-Roper was deeply unhappy in Cambridge.        
	Sisman has written a very satisfying book about a historian and a public figure. He has brought out the many facets of Trevor-Ropers life and personality. Trevor-Roper appeared patrician and reserved but he was a very loyal friend and he lived by some strongly-held values. There was also an imp in him. His old age, especially after Xandras death, was sad. He lost his sight and was haunted by visions, but he never lost his dignity and his love of conversation with those who were younger than him. Sismans is a sympathetic and sensitive portrayal without any loss of balance which often stalks biographers. He has an unerring eye for the telling anecdote. His book on Taylor and this one are both delights. Sisman is unquestionably the premier biographer of historians.

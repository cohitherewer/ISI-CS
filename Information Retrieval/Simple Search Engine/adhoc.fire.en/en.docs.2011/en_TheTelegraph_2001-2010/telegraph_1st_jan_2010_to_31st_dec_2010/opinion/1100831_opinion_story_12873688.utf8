	There are doubts if cricket ever was the noblest game. But what is beyond question is that cricket today has become synonymous with corruption. The recent revelations about the involvement of Pakistani cricketers with bookies and the bowling of deliberate no balls only highlight this. The latter is being seen as evidence of attempts to fix specific aspects of the game. The incidence of corruption in cricket is highest in South Asia, especially in Pakistan. It is no coincidence that cricket is most popular in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka; it is in these countries that it means big money. Bookmakers have taken advantage of the popularity of cricket to introduce unscrupulous practices. The ready acceptance of such practices can be linked to certain sociological trends that have affected the game. It is no longer possible that in the subcontinent only those belonging to the upper echelons of society and those exposed to the English way of life get drawn into playing cricket. The popularity of cricket and the fact that the game offers a lucrative opening have widened the catchment area of cricketers. Many of the new entrants are not aware of the values and lore associated with cricket. This results in practices that those who have an exalted view of the game find despicable.        
	The fault-lines of South Asian cricket probably run deeper. Cricketers linked to nefarious activities are often not punished. Society tends to overlook their transgressions. Mohammad Azharuddin, more than whom very few cricketers have been implicated in match-fixing and betting, is now a member of Parliament belonging to the Congress. Obviously, neither the Congress nor the voters took his offences seriously. This is not surprising in both India and Pakistan, where some of the leading figures in public life  the so-called exemplars of society  are known to be thoroughly corrupt. Persons of dubious integrity are allowed to run state-level and national cricket associations. The scandals regarding the Indian Premier League have only underlined this tendency and its consequences. A cleansing operation in cricket may be easier spoken about than done since it might involve throwing out the baby with the bath-water. Also, it needs to be remembered that, in the global context, cricket is a minor game. Only South Asians go mad about it and then refuse to play the game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The long march from fighting to freedom
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE LONG MARCH FROM FIGHTING TO FREEDOM                                  In order to move towards democracy, Myanmar must first come to terms with its long history of ethnic violence, writes Srinath Raghavan   The author is Senior Fellow, Centre for Policy Research, Delhi                                                  
	The forthcoming elections in Myanmar and the accompanying political rumbles have evoked little interest in India. Weary resignation seems to be the dominant Indian response to the vagaries of Myanmarese politics. Yet, the political churning now underway could have significant implications, both for Myanmar and for the region.        
	The election laws adopted by the junta have rightly attracted widespread criticism. They call for the dissolution of the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy, if it refuses to participate in the elections. They also proscribe the candidacy of hundreds of political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, who have been convicted for spurious criminal offences. Members of religious orders cannot contest elections either  a provision aimed at keeping the Buddhist clergy at bay. With an election commission hand-picked by the junta, there is little expectation of anything like a free or fair electoral process.        
	The outcome of the elections is likely to be important just the same. For the army appears keen to use the elections to transition to a different model of political control. Twenty-five per cent of the seats in the new parliament are reserved for the military. Military officers have been engaged in hectic campaigning. In canvassing for votes, they have announced several development projects. Clearly, the militarys conception of its own position and role in the polity is undergoing significant changes.        
	The leader of the junta, General Than Shwe, is going on 79, and has no earmarked successor. It appears that he would prefer not to leave behind in office any single strongman. This has resulted in increasingly sharp differences amongst the military elite about the way ahead. In this context, it might be tempting for the army to remove itself from the centre-stage of politics, whilst continuing to hold all the levers of power. After all, this seems to have worked in Bangladesh and Pakistan  at least in the short-term.        
	More importantly, the junta has set in motion a process of economic liberalization and is demonstrating increasing interest in benefiting from international experience in this area. There have been signs of change in social policy as well. For instance, private players are now being permitted to run schools and hospitals. Furthermore, the junta has begun to repair relations with the West. Branded an outpost of tyranny by the Bush administration, the Myanmar regime is now being engaged diplomatically by Washington. The sanctions, however, are likely to remain in place until the junta shows commitment to furthering democracy and human rights.              
	The Indian government has refrained from airing its views on these developments. This is continuous with its avowed policy of non-interference in the affairs of Myanmar. New Delhi persisted with this approach even during the popular movement against the junta in 2007. In the past decade-and-a-half, New Delhis Myanmar policy has been shaped by economic and security considerations. The estimated 300 billion cubic metres of gas reserves in Myanmar are naturally of great interest to India. Besides, several infrastructure projects are underway, aimed at improving connectivity between the two countries. These will facilitate Indias access to its own northeastern states as well as to other Southeast Asian countries.        
	From the standpoint of security, there are two key drivers of policy. In order to contain the insurgencies in the Northeast, it was essential to secure Myanmars cooperation. Since the mid-1990s, the junta has worked with India to ensure that various northeastern insurgent groups, especially the Nagas and the United Liberation Front of Asom, do not operate out of Myanmar with impunity. The other factor is Chinas growing clout in Myanmar. Since the late-1980s, when the junta drew international censure for its iron-fisted approach, Beijing has been Myanmars most dependable ally. China is its largest trading partner, supplying everything, from military equipment to food grain. Chinas involvement in several infrastructure projects has also been a matter of concern for India. These are regarded as enabling China to access the Indian Ocean region.        
	Notwithstanding these, India could do more to nudge the junta towards a more democratic stance. In particular, it should make the case for a fairer parliamentary election  one that will create the space for Suu Kyi and the NLD to participate in the process. But it would be facile to assume that the problem in Myanmar is merely the struggle between forces of democracy and the junta. Ensuring a democratic transition, however imperfect, will require addressing a larger set of issues. If Myanmar has seen the longest spell of uninterrupted military dictatorship anywhere in the world, it is because the country is also home to the longest-running civil war.              
	From the time it became independent in 1948, Burma was wracked by a swarm of insurgencies. Initially, it was the communist party that took up arms against the government. Simultaneously, there was also an Islamist insurgency in the north of Arakan. Soon the Karens and Kachins of the highlands turned against the central government. These groups had enjoyed considerable autonomy under the British and feared that their standing would be eroded in a self-proclaimed Buddhist Burma. Both the groups were well-armed, having played a major role in the anti-Japanese resistance during World War II. Two years into these conflicts, the premier, U Nu, was periodically retreating into meditation to cope with the situation. His friend, Jawaharlal Nehru, observed that it seemed as good a way of governing Burma as any.        
	The situation was given a further twist in 1949 when the communists emerged victorious in the Chinese civil war. Sections of the worsted Kuomintang forces fled across the border into eastern Burma. There they created a safe haven, recruiting additional forces, imposing taxes and undercutting local political structures. These forces were subsequently joined by American and Taiwanese military advisors. The Burmese militarys efforts to root out these militias alienated the local population, so paving the way for an insurgency led by the Shans.        
	The presence of these forces resulted in periodic incursions by the Chinese army. By the mid-1960s, Beijing extended support to communist insurgents against the Burmese regime. Meanwhile, Thailand, too, had entered the fray, supporting the Karens and other insurgents operating along its borders with Burma, believing this would weaken its traditional enemy. Over time, many of the rebel groups splintered into factions, resulting in a bewildering array of insurgents with ever longer acronyms.        
	The upshot of this anarchical situation was that the military began to consume much the largest share of the states financial resources and became by far the most powerful actor. This set the stage for the military coups of 1958 and 1962. Since the mid-1950s, the military also became a major stakeholder in the Burmese economy and came to control a number of key sectors. It was only in 1989 that the government began to reach ceasefire accords. These have been concluded with around 16 groups to date. But they remain armed truces and the underlying disputes are yet to be resolved. The army continues to engage in counter-insurgency operations against other important militias, though the strength of these insurgencies has dwindled over the years. But many of these groups are active players in drug trafficking from Thailand and are supported by religious networks overseas.              
	Any attempt to minimize the role of the junta can only succeed as part of a larger process that ends these ethnic disputes and creates a new compact between the State and the peoples of Myanmar. The recent developments could provide the requisite opening for wider effort at national reconciliation. Encouraging the junta and other actors down this road would accord with Indias values as well as its interests.

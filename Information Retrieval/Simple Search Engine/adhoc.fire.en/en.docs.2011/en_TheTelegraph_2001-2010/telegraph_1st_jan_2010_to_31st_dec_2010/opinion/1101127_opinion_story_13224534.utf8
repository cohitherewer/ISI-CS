The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Old patterns revealed in a new light 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OLD PATTERNS REVEALED IN A NEW LIGHT                                   THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	What constitutes new performance (NP)? Since the India Foundation for the Arts and Seagull invite dialogue on their festival by that name, let us comply. To begin with, anyone present would think that NPs main requirement is a video screen  three of five productions sported one, two of them eminently dispensable. Next, NP is not new if it merely imports foreign techniques, again making us copycats rather than creators. Finally, the funding agency must have the know-how to tell if the NP is actually new in its own tradition.        
	As usual, Manipur stunned the small turnout with her delicate grace and lissom movement in M. Mangangsanas interpretation of Phou-oibi (picture), the myth of the rice goddess that sociologically functions as a fertility ritual to ensure harvest and natures rejuvenation. The ring of female singer-dancers conveyed the theme beautifully, every gesture was eloquent, to live music composed by Mangangsana, himself a pena player. Only his concept was not new: Lokendra Arambam directed an exquisite version, Phou-oibi Langon, in 1985. Mangangsana offered todays generation, and those who did not see it here in 1987, a fine substitute.        
	Sunil Shanbags metatheatrical penchant meant that Arpanas S*x, M*rality and Cens*rship (in Hindi) had to have a strong frame to match the ferocity of Tendulkars Sakharam Binder, the prohibition of which in 1972 forms the core of this play. However, the script by Shanta Gokhale and Irawati Karnik meanders, introducing four characters quite transparently to remind us of stage history. So we lost interest in them (except Sakharams director) pretty fast, as did Shanbag, aware of wrapping up the second half quickly, leaving the Tamasha actress (the talented Ketaki Thatte) stranded. Gratuitous movie grabs, ad clips and documentary footage, including a highly simplistic and irrelevant 70s Show, dragged further. The productions force came from Sakharam itself, which always hits like a sledgehammer, wielded powerfully in this show by Nagesh Bhonsle, Gitanjali Kulkarni and Rajashree Sawant Wad.        
	Instead of Arpanas overhead canvas for video, two LCD monitors loomed over Abhinayas Macbeth in Malayalam, doubling their redundancy as they looped surreal audiovisual recordings monotonously. The director, Jyothish M.G., reduced Shakespeare to Duncan, the Macbeths, Banquo and (curiously) the four witches. The Macbeths hollered from start to finish, understandably, to compete with the nonstop soundtrack, which suddenly shifted midway to orchestral Western, and reeked of amateur editing with abrupt audible cuts. The Kalari choreography stood out, but I have seen too many of Jyothishs techniques elsewhere: the Calicut School, from where he graduated, specializes in performers bobbing under huge cloth sheets, itself borrowed from modern dance-theatre. I also had no idea what the intriguing four-winged angels signified.        
	Only in Kat-kathas Anecdotes and Allegories did image projection seem essential to the presentation  because in it, a mini-camera manipulated by the puppeteers fed streaming video on screen. But this technology is not new either; director Anurupa Roy learnt it from the path-breaking Dutch troupe, Hotel Modern, which uses it to magnify toy figurines in carefully-crafted miniature sets and landscapes (a quaint European puppet tradition). Roy just applied it, imaginatively, to Choiti Ghoshs dramatization of Rumer Goddens novel of the Humayun-nama chronicled by Humayuns daughter, Gulbadan. Roy captured Baburs life in this manner, Humayuns through conventional shadow theatre, and Akbars by live-feeding cut-outs of Mughal paintings, with gradually diminishing returns. Suchet Malhotra improvised evocative music, but the American-accented narrator sounded intrusive, and the lives of Humayun and Akbar much condensed relative to Baburs.        
	Jyoti Dogras solo, The Doorway, harked back to Grotowskis poor theatre, which, too, is no longer new in India. One could spot watered-down variations on his star actor, Ryszard Cieslak, in much of this experience-based, non-narrative, performance art. Although placed in a studio setting, and avowedly about open and closed personal physical spaces, at one telling moment Dogra strangely declined contact with a spectator who reached out instinctively when she extended her hand, apparently soliciting help. The inhibition to interact still remains.         
	Certain sequences were laughable (as in her pickle mumblings), while others (those exploring subconscious longings and directly questioning the audience) had an intense impact, for intimate theatre always carries a dangerous edge. Arghya Lahiri designed the lighting with precision for a chiaroscuro effect.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Old mirror on the wall
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OLD MIRROR ON THE WALL                                                                  
	Calcutta is a much-photographed city. Unfortunately, very many of these images, especially those taken by visitors from other countries, adhere to a clichd style and subject. In Calcutta, it is not uncommon to come across wide-eyed foreigners furiously clicking away at hand-drawn rickshaws, rickety trams, bedraggled children or people bathing in a grey river, and then putting these images together in the form of a book or an exhibition to preserve in film the citys resilience, madness or the celebration of spirit in the midst of seeming chaos. CALCUTTA FULL FRAME: PHOTOGRAPHS IN BLACK AND WHITE (Earthcare, Rs 799), featuring the work of Thomas Patrick Kiernan, belongs to a genre of Calcutta photographs that stifles the senses with its unimaginativeness.        
	Capturing Calcuttas quaintness appears to be ridiculously easy. (One wonders whether Kiernan would have found Calcutta as quaint had it been less impoverished.) A stroll along its numerous bleak stretches is expected to throw open a rich template of sights. Kiernan shows no inclination to deviate from this well-trodden path. His chosen locations  Sudder Street, Howrah jetty, Mullick Ghat, Nimtala, Tiretta Bazaar, and so on are as predictable as the images they have yielded a man and his monkey in deep slumber, dilapidated jetties, busy people in a teeming ghat and the grime, poverty and human labour that characterize old markets.        
	This is a pity because Kiernan is a gifted photographer. He prefers simple compositions, and a few of his photographs are marked by depth, detail and the interplay of shadow and light. Also evident is Kiernans fascination with geometrical shapes. There is a spare beauty in the winding balustrade inside a building in Stuart Lane. In another photograph (Ramesh Mitra Road, 1994), the elegance of the straight lines on an old door has been cleverly juxtaposed with the twisted shape of a man sleeping in front of it.        
	Far right shows day-labourers in Outram Ghat lending the goddess a helping hand in her final journey. Top is the all-too-familiar rickshaw-puller  a common sight in such photo projects as he is supposed to embody dignity in the face of unimaginable despair. Bottom is a scene from Lenin Sarani that conveys Calcuttas timelessness and immobility that have charmed Kiernan and others before him.        
	The Foreword notes that Kiernan would like his photographs to serve as a mirror that motivates people to preserve what is so original and moving in this city. The readers, tired of looking into the same old mirror, are likely to remain unmoved by his fervent plea.

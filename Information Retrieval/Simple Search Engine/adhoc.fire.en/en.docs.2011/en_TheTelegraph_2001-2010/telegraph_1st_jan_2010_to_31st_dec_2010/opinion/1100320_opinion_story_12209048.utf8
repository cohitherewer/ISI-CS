The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | As brilliantly played as ever 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AS BRILLIANTLY PLAYED AS EVER                               Fauzia Marikar      Music                                                
	Even though a performer of the stature of Roman Rudnytsky graced the city with a dazzling performance under the auspices of the American consulate at the Lincoln Room on February 17, students of the piano would feel justifiably disappointed because masterclasses had not been organized in advance. Rudnytsky has expressed his willingness to interact with aspiring musicians in the city and to hold masterclasses. Might we anticipate this at a later date?        
	Nor was the recital a first; he had been to Calcutta in 1986, and given a memorable and dynamic performance. It is inevitable that one will seek to compare the two recitals. Despite the nuanced, academic approach, it was evident that the standards of virtuosity have not diminished. Rudnytsky plays Beethoven as Beethoven should be played; with vigour, passion, intensity and grace. His extremely long and powerful fingers possess a rare mastery of the keyboard.        
	Commencing with the Partita by Bach, transcribed for piano by Rachmaninov, he moved on to the Beethoven Sonata  Quasi una fantasia  in E Flat, op. 27 No. 1. Both his renditions were powerful and compelling. Three compositions by Chopin followed: The Barcarolle in F major op. 60, the sublime, posthumous, Nocturne in C minor, and the Grande Valse in E flat, op. 18. Roman Rudnytskys strong and rather quick rendering of the introduction of the Nocturne was pleasantly contrasted with the subtlety of the flowing, liquid runs that rippled to the end. Bringing the first part of the evening to a close was Louis Moreau Gottschalks Union of National Airs, impressive and compellingly American with the recognizable tunes of The Star Spangled Banner, Hail Columbia and Yankee Doodle. The elements in the composition emerged delightfully clothed in a new harmonic attire.        
	The short break was followed by Gershwins piano solo version of the Rhapsody in Blue and Mussorgskys Pictures at an Exhibition. Each of the movements was portrayed with vivid clarity and skill. Next, came the haunting Pavane  pour une infante defunte  by Maurice Ravel, which was followed by Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 14. This was, officially, the last work of the evening. Rudnytskys short, informative introduction to each performance was delivered with erudition. The humorous anecdotes further enhanced the undeniable charisma of his personality.        
	To enthusiastic applause and cries of encore, he promised just one, and gave us Gottschalks Banjo, which was played brilliantly. One surely cannot wait for another 24 long years for the next concert by this master pianist.

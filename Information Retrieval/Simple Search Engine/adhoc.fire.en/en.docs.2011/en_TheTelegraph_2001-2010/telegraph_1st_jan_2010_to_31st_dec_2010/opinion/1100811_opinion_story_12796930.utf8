	Q: A certain sum and interest on it are due to me from a Chennai-based chit fund firm since 1989. In October 2009, the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC), New Delhi, directed the firm to redress my grievance and warned of action against it if the firm failed to do so. In December 2009, the Competition Appellate Tribunal informed me that the MRTPC had been abolished and advised me to approach a suitable forum. I am yet to recover my money. What I should do now?        
	Gurudas Chakravarty, Belghoria, Calcutta                
	A: You could file a money suit within three years from the date of cause of action against the chit fund firm before the civil court with the appropriate jurisdiction. In case your claim is time-barred, you could file an application before the court for condonation of delay. A criminal case can also be instituted against the firm for offences such as breach of trust and cheating under the Indian Penal Code.              
	Q:I want to start a partnership business with five partners. I want to know the process of company incorporation and what papers are required for the partnership deed.        
	Tarun Singh, Calcutta                
	A: A partnership is the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business. To start a partnership firm all the partners would have to sign a partnership deed and thereby apply for registration of the partnership firm before the registrar (empowered by the Indian Partnership Act, 1932) in the prescribed form, accompanied by the prescribed fee under the act.              
	Q:I bought a Hyundai Santro in April 2006 and registered it in Meghalaya as a private car. I paid the requisite one-time tax there. After acquiring a no-objection certificate, I have brought the car to West Bengal. Do I have to re-register the car and pay tax on it again?        
	Nabendu Sekhar, Calcutta                
	A: You have to apply to the motor vehicles registering authority under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for assignment of a new registration number. You also have to present the certificate of registration to the authority along with the no-objection certificate. As far as paying tax is concerned, the registering authority would be able to inform you about this.

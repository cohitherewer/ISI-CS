It examines  from the many contemporary perspectives of international architects, historians, environmentalists and activists  the built and social form of this unique Indian city. What was in Le Corbusiers (and Nehrus) mind when the city was first planned and built in the Fifties, and what has happened to that vision today? Top left is a view of the Assembly from the plaza. Next to it is a detail from a door panel in the Assembly, signed by Le Corbusier and A. Petit. The bottom panel reproduces housing-unit analyses of house-street-open space hierarchy in the city.

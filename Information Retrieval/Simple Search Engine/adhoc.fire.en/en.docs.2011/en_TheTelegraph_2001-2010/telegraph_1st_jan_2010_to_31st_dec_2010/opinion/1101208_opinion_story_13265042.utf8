	Unreal depiction                  
	Sir  Ashutosh Gowarikars Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey, which is inspired by a rousing chapter in the history of Bengals contribution to the freedom struggle, is disappointing. I was one of the special invitees, and I watched the film in a near-empty PVR in Mumbai. Bollywood rarely makes good films when it comes to the Partition or the freedom struggle. Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey was a dampener too; it was like watching a Test match being played on a slow wicket. The film is based on the Chittagong uprising. The director appears to have lost all sense of time and plot, in spite of having in his possession reliable material from a book written by the veteran journalist, Manini Chatterjee. While the story is superb, the film suffers primarily because of the quality of direction. The stilted dialogues, repetitive screenplay and average musical score made the movie a dull affair. The quality of production and design is impressive, but all the costumes looked newly stitched. Making a historical film requires paying close attention to such details, and Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey is a failure in this respect. A film such as this also requires a strong script and actors who can shed their star qualities and merge with their roles. Perhaps this is why Bollywood finds it easier to stage contemporary dramas and musicals.           
	In Hollywood, film makers continue to focus on the Nazis and the righteous war fought by the allied forces during the Second World War. The story has been told many times, but in these films, the characters, music and setting remain authentic. In contrast, the poorly scripted Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey leaves the lead actors and the supporting cast to fend for themselves. Dressed in white dhotis, kurtas and saris, the actors resemble performers on stage. The need of a good script was evident.           
	Perhaps it is pertinent to mention here my memory of history being taught in a remarkable way in an Anglo-Indian boarding school in Kurseong. The English teacher, the late P. Gupta, used to tell us stories of World War II with the book in one hand and by drawing war strategies on the blackboard. His voice modulations made the war come alive to the students. If Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey fails at the box office, I fear that fewer directors from Bollywood will be interested in making films that are set during the freedom struggle.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Right move          
	Sir  Fifa has shown the grit and determination to spread world cup football to uncharted territories, and its decision to leave the beaten track is welcome (Different goals, Dec 4). It is true that Russia has been suffering financial uncertainties for years, but Fifa has taken the right step by asking it to host the world cup. I strongly believe that football is a powerful tool to establish peace.           
	Fifas bold move will rejuvenate smaller nations like Qatar, which will host the worlds biggest event after Russia. Significantly, South Africa had not let the world down when it hosted the world cup this year. For football to develop, the game must be globalized and conservative attitudes in some quarters removed.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  It seems that life on the streets of Old Delhi has returned to what it was before the Commonwealth Games, which saw the capital being presented as a well-managed city to foreign athletes and other visitors.           
	Take, for example, the case of the street, Kucha Lattushah, in Dariba, situated in the heart of Chandni Chowk. A large part of its entrance is now blocked by an encroacher selling artificial jewellery. Residents of the street, especially women and senior citizens, find it difficult to reach their homes because scooters are parked in a haphazard manner. The authorities seem to be indifferent to the need to prevent encroachers and the illegal parking of scooters in a congested street. Moreover, sewer-covers do not fit properly, raising the possibility of pedestrians suffering torn ligaments or fractures.           
	The Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Delhi Police together should launch a massive programme to free the streets of old Delhi from the menace of encroachers and scooters parked illegally at the earliest.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

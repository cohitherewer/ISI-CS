                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PRETTY FACES                                  Neha Sahay                              
	Mao untied their feet, took them out of their homes, put them in pigtails and blue jackets, gave them guns and red bands, and made them shoulder half the sky. Everyone hailed it as liberation. Post-Mao, Chinese girls are flying in another direction  totally free, they can choose what they want to do. Bus driver? Petrol-pump attendant? Immigration officer? Policewoman? They are visible everywhere, and also invisible in factories and offices.        
	A lot of them are migrant workers, living on their own, totally independent of familial control. But over the last few years, the pressure on these smart, efficient girls to look good has been increasing dangerously. Their natural good looks and petite figures just dont seem enough. From the army to private firms, restaurant-owners to shop-owners, all employers set physical standards for female applicants that have nothing to do with the job. A minimum height of 160 cm is almost a given in any ad. In the South, its rare even for men to reach that height.        
	But what happened last month in Chengdu really takes the cake. Eighty CEOs turned up for a recruitment round, which featured only 40 applicants. The CEOs watched 40 young women walk the ramp for them: some were in little black dresses; a few wore formal suits; others wore sober office-wear. A compre, in a flowing shoulderless evening gown, read out the girls names as they came up, exactly as would happen in a beauty contest.        
	The job being applied for? Worker. This interview took place in a posh hotel. These werent bimbos applying; many of them were graduates in business administration, film, TV and psychology. Three of them had Masters degrees.                
	Vital statistics        
	Two could sign job contracts immediately; 15 others were shortlisted. Word spread, and Chengdus residents reacted with disapproval. Are they looking for employees or wives? asked one. The incident was reported online with close-ups of the applicants stockinged legs, as well as pictures of men recording the catwalk on their mobiles. Netizens reactions were mixed. One suggested that the CEOs should have been asked to bring their wives along for this recruitment drive. Some suspected the girls motives; one lamented, I really wonder if future Chinese men can still find virgin women to marry? A few approved, pointing out that everyone liked a pretty face. One gave a psychological analysis: good-looking girls, used to compliments, were more confident and could deal well with the world. Ugly women would be bitter and caustic in their dealings.        
	However, it was the explanation offered by one of the CEOs that revealed the expectations from these girls. He was, in fact, looking for a prospective marriage partner, he said. The chief of a hotel, he said he was looking for talent both in appearance and ability. In the business of customer service, he explained, he needed managers who could create and maintain close relationships.        
	In Shanghai, pretty Chinese girls are building relationships of another kind. In the high-end Pudong area, where most foreign companies have their offices, policewomen have been employed specifically to deal with nuisances such as unauthorized street vendors.         
	Pudong has taken the cue from Kunming and Hangzhou, where female city inspectors have been employed to deal with vendors, pavement encroachers and parking offenders, with encouraging results. Instead of bullying the vendors, which often results in resistance from bands of vendors backed by passers-by, the policewomen use sweet persuasion to talk them into either following the rules or leaving. The qualifications for city inspectors are specific  a college diploma, a sweet voice, familiar looks, polite manners, fluency in Mandarin  and a height of 160 cm!

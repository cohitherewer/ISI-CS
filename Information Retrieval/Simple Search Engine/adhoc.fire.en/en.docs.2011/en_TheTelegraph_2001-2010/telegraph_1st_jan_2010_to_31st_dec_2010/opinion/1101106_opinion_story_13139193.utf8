	Faded charm                  
	Sir  The turn-out at the Calcutta film festival used to be as big as that of cricket matches at the Eden Gardens. People queued up in front of cinemas since midnight for tickets. The craze for watching films shorn of cuts was palpable. The trend continued until cable TV invaded the drawing rooms. Now Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has announced that the government will shell out less money for the festival (Slow fade, Nov 3). He should utilize the money saved to modernize Nandan and to refurbish other cinema halls that are ill-maintained.          
	Yours faithfully,         Debasish Banerjee, Calcutta
        
	Unclean act          
	Sir  It is a pity that the Indian National Congress is short of clean candidates to replace the tainted Ashok Chavan (Chavan fate hangs in balance, Oct 30). It is pathetic to see the party high command dithering on accepting Chavans resignation. After a scam of such magnitude, the ouster of the Maharashtra chief minister should have been automatic. If Chavan is sacked, he should be banished from public life.          
	The Congress should have the courage to start the process of purging politics of corrupt elements. That alone will infuse fresh and clean blood into the party. Moreover, this can also transform politics into an instrument to serve the nation and not the self.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Mookhi Amir Ali, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  An ordinary citizen is put behind bars for petty crimes such as gambling or drinking. Then why shouldnt politicians like Ashok Chavan  who is reported to be involved in a housing scandal  be punished? Merely asking him to resign is to treat him too honourably. Every Indian should raise their voice against such leaders and demand that they be punished.          
	Yours faithfully,      
S.M. Kumbhat, Siliguri 

      
	Sir  If Ashok Chavan was serious about resigning as the chief minister of Maharashtra, he should have submitted his resignation to the governor instead of running to the Congress president in the hope that she will save him. Corruption is so deep-rooted in politics that no politician can be called clean except for a clutch of senior leaders like Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee and A.K. Antony. Given the situation, sacking Chavan might not improve matters as his successor may not have a squeaky clean image either. Most unfortunately, it seems that democracy in India has become demonocracy, or better still scamocracy.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is being reported that three former chief ministers as well as the nephew of Sharad Pawar are involved in the Adarsh housing society fiasco. It is possible that the accused will support the embattled Ashok Chavan, or else the others may find themselves in a soup. Moreover, why did Chavan offer to resign to the Congress president? The chief minister of Maharashtra, along with the other ministers in the government, should tender their resignations to the governor. Had there been a non-Congress dispensation in Maharashtra, the Central government would have raised a hue and cry over the matter.           
	The people of India should opt for governments that are free of corruption. Voters should make sure that they defeat every corrupt politician in the fray during the polls. By electing dishonest leaders to office, the people are also contributing to the corruption. Perhaps it is time for the people to reflect on this matter.                    
	Yours faithfully,

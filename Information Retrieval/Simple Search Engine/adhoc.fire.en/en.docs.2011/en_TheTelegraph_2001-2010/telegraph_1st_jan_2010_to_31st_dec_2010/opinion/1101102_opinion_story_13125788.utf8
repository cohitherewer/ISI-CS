The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | built upon shame
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BUILT UPON SHAME                                  Malvika Singh                              
	India is being forced by those who govern it to bury its head in deep shame  yet again. The secret, ongoing exploitation of India and civil society, from top to bottom, by senior leaders who have been mandated to conserve, develop and protect the citizen at large, is being exposed along with all supporting empirical evidence. How can the Congress tolerate this kind of outrageous corruption at every level of the government?        
	How can the Congress leadership say that it is waiting for all the information to emerge when the public has seen the documentation on television? Why does it take hours to brief the prime minister on the horror? In this age of technology and instant communication even at 30,000 feet above sea level, vague responses to critical questions that concern the probity of the nation and its servants are unacceptable, and clearly sound like a cover-up.        
	The Congress president and the prime minister should not need any time at all to accept the resignation of Ashok Chavan for presiding over a cesspool of wrong-doing and then lying about it in the hope that everything will be shoved under the carpet. This passing-the-buck attitude has perpetuated corruption for decades. Ask anyone across the economic and social strata if the guilty will be punished, and the answer will be consistent  They will get away because they are government and the ruling establishment. If this continues, our corruption-ridden, emerging economic power will fall into anarchy.                
	Everyday reality        
	It is utter nonsense that Chavan has to greet President Barack Obama, and, therefore, cannot be removed till after the visit. This line of argument makes a mockery of the Indian State. People salute those who have the ability to stand by truth and damn lies and corruption. It is time we stood by what is right.         
	How demeaning to have a tainted man welcome the head of state of the United States of America. And his replacement should not be an issue at all. Young Mukul Wasnik can be thrown into the deep end, cutting out all the old war-horses with dubious records from the race. Things cannot get any worse than they are now  so any change will bring improvement.        
	The two former army chiefs, one admiral, other officers of our armed forces, politicians and bureaucrats involved in the housing scam have been shamelessly greedy. They must not only give up the apartments they have falsely grabbed but also be stripped of all decorations and titles with immediate effect if India is to restore dignity to its army, navy and airforce.         
	From having an unmatched reputation, these men have reduced the armed forces to rubble. To think that these are the men who defend India is profoundly disturbing. Their claim that they were unaware of the reality is even more frightening. Riding so close on the heels of such a wholesale loot that took place during the preparation for the Commonwealth Games, this incident has insulted and shamed India  yet again.        
	There was a time when loot and corruption of this scale, and the moral degradation we have to now endure as law-abiding citizens, would have merited the resignation of the government in power. That would be the appropriate thing to do. But rulers have too much at stake. All of us are aware of how deals go through without legal clearances, how the administration is paid off to look the other way, what the scale of the pay-offs are, and more.         
	Sadly, these illegalities have become a part of the DNA of an emerging India. Will the next deal on the table be put on hold till all legal requirements are met? We do not have more than a week or two to wait and see what happens.

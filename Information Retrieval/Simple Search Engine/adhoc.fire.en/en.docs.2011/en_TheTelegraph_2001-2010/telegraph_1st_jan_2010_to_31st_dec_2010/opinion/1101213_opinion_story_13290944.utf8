The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A Pat for a pat
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A PAT FOR A PAT                                                    
	Sensibleness demands that a great deal of fuss is not made about it. Diplomacy demands that matters should be perfectly symmetrical. And security demands that everybody everywhere should go by the rules. For all this to happen together, the rules have to be uniform and everybody properly informed about them. The Indian ambassador to Washington having to go through a security pat down in an American airport possibly because she was wearing a sari rakes up all these issues, and calls for certain clarifications on both sides. It makes perfect sense to argue that security is the great leveller and everybody must act according to, and put up with, the rules. But, in that case, the rules must be clearly laid down, and those who implement them trained out of their cultural ignorance. If ambassadors are to be patted down, for instance, then both the Indian ambassador in American airports and the American ambassador in Indian airports must put up with the same treatment, whatever he or she might be wearing. If ambassadors are not to be searched, then too, the rule must apply uniformly to ambassadors of both nationalities and genders, whatever they are wearing. A female ambassador wearing a sari should not be singled out simply because the security personnel attending to her have never seen a sari-clad female ambassador before, or happen to have a certain prejudice against saris.        
	What is at stake here is neither courtesy nor cultural sensitivity, but clarity or lack of ambiguity in clearly drawn-up, communicated, understood and implemented regulations. There is no room, then, for Indias unthinkingly hierarchical and feudal VIP culture, which creates a palaver over film stars or former presidents having to undergo standard security procedures like ordinary people. There is equally no room for neo-colonial privileges being extended to, and expected by, certain diplomats when they come into India. On either side, nobody gets away with anything  neither the important (and the self-important), nor the ignorant and the unexposed. To turn such matters into a racial, communal or gendered issue is ill-advised, and the reticence of the Indian ambassador in this case, or that of the former president of India in the earlier case, is to be commended as dignified and sensible behaviour.

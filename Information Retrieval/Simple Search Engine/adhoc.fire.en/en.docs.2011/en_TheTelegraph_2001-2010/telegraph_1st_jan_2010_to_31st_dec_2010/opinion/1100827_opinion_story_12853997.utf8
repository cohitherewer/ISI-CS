The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | from reason to roguery
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FROM REASON TO ROGUERY                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Instead of heralding the Age of Reason, we are entering the Age of the Rogue Babu. It is the final flowering of an inept, corrupt and dysfunctional bureaucracy. Once the petals fall off the stem, hopefully, new buds will come out. However, the Indian administrative service could well deny, rather triumphantly, the laws of nature. In all ministries directly interacting with civil society, be it human resource development or culture, or in areas as far apart as food distribution and tax collection, or in the various arms of the municipalities across India, all of which are legally and constitutionally mandated to serve the citizens, there is abject failure and corruption. When exposed, other members of the same clan are positioned on top of the prevailing muck to bring about remedial measures. It is a horrific irony, one that is fast destroying a great civilization, killing pride and celebration, confidence and growth.        
	The crass behaviour of the babu vis--vis Viswanathan Anand is symptomatic of the truth about the rogue among us. Fortunately, in this particular case, we have an honest minister who immediately apologized without any hesitation, something a babu is incapable of doing. Kapil Sibal is bound to look at the archaic and ridiculous procedures for conferring honorary degrees, revamp the process, streamline it and, I am willing to bet, there will be a fresh beginning  as he is sharp and proactive, not looking over his shoulder, nor being suffocated, choked and lied to by the babus around him. He takes risks, is willing to step out of the corroded box, admit errors of judgment or action, work round the clock, and do all that intelligent professionals do.                
	Vanished pride        
	But how many such uninhibited ministers do we have? How many are in command of the details of what their jobs entail? How many hold jobs in isolation from society, cordoned off by fiddling babus? How many retain positions for reasons that are unfathomable  like coalition compulsions  at the cost of the delivery of goods and services, causing enormous losses to the exchequer? How many leaders do not fall prey to half-truths spewed by the babus at the cost of good work, thereby preventing any change or departure from the unpleasant reality of government operations tied up in kilometres of red tape?        
	India is being throttled by the devious manipulations of insecure bureaucrats. Compared to T.T. Krishnamachari  who, in the 1950s, initiated and backed the revival of handlooms and crafts by empowering Pupul Jayakar and Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay to comb the country and rejuvenate dying skills  or to L.P. Singh, A.N. Jha, L.K. Jha, Lovraj Kumar and others, we are now inflicted with people who are scared to embrace new initiatives as that would shake the closed-door ivory tower and insular cocoons provided and protected by their political bosses.        
	Such officers stall the enhancement of quality because a slight iota of quality on the ground, not merely through words and notings on file, will expose their mammoth failures. There is zero accountability. Any attempt to upset the lethargy that insults the Indian people is met with underhand harassment. Thousands suffer at the hands of this fast-growing disease that seems to have no diagnosis and no known cure for it. Like a virus that breeds in a mire, it is infecting good citizens and alienating them from national causes and pride.         
	No one in the establishment seems to be embarrassed or bothered by the mind-boggling corruption, loot, and mismanagement of life around us. There is no premium, whatsoever, on honesty, integrity, commitment to the nation, shram daan and shram seva.

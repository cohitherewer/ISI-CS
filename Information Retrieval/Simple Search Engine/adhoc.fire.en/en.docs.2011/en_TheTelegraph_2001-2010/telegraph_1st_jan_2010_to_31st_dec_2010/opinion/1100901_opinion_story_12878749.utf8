                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ENTRY PASS                                                    
	Out of the chaos of differences in Parliament emerged a verdict in favour of the nuclear liability bill. This will enable India to enter into agreements with various international companies. In this sense, the nuclear liability bill is an important milestone in the history of Indias emergence as a global player. The details of this bill were debated in Parliament and perhaps will remain open to controversy. But the fact that there was eventually an agreement and that the bill was passed by a huge majority is important as it sends out a signal to the world about Indias intentions. The debate and the controversy are equally important since they are evidence of the vibrant character of Indian democracy. Even though the passing of the bill was the work of Parliament, its real author is the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. This was recognized by the kind of attack he was subjected to from the leftist benches and by the fact that he chose to intervene in the debate on the bill. The prime minister had to speak because the main line of criticism was that through the bill, Indias sovereignty was being sacrificed to the United States of America and to the interests of multinational corporations. Mr Singh rebutted these allegations not through rhetoric but by deploying logical arguments.        
	One important aspect of the debate concerning the nuclear liability bill is the change in the position of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Initially, there was a strange congruence between the views and rhetoric of the BJP and those of the leftist parties. This could not have added to the comfort of either of the two groups. When push came to the vote, the BJP decided to stand by the government. One reason for this is that so far nuclear issues are concerned, in substance there is no difference between the present government and the one lead by the BJP. The latters only grouse against the Indo-US nuclear deal and the nuclear liability bill is that it is the United Progressive Alliance, and not the National Democratic Alliance, steering these. But the fact that the BJP successfully stood above narrow party interests and supported the national interest is to be welcomed and seen as an example by other political parties. Mr Singh has prepared the ground for Indias presence in the global high table. History will watch how India behaves at that table.

	Haunted by visions of change      
	Facing my phantoms (Rupa, Rs 295) by Sheeba Shah is a fictional account of one of the most traumatic periods in Nepals history. While scripting the biography of her grandmother, the protagonist, Sanjeevani, stitches together a tale about people whose lives are being changed irreversibly by the socio-political flux that Nepal has been witnessing since the 1930s. The transformation from a feudal set-up to an equitable society is not peaceful. The blood spilled by the Maoist insurgency only adds to the turbulence, even as people grapple with the difficult choices that they would have to make to rescue a nation on the brink of a precipice. Significantly, the protagonists inner conflicts mirror those taking place outside. The book makes a laudable attempt to capture a nation on the cusp of change. Past and present, fact and fiction, merge in Shahs work to reveal wounds on Nepals social fabric that refuse to heal.                             
	Slum Child (Tranquebar, Rs 295) by Bina Shah chronicles the courageous attempts by a young girl born into poverty to make her mark in a difficult world. Nine-year-old Laila lives in Karachis Issa Colony, and isnt exactly unhappy despite her penury. Her days are brightened by her friends, an adoring elder sister, and her mother who works as a maid. But Lailas sister contracts tuberculosis and suffers an agonizing death. Worse, Laila has to escape to a new life after discovering that her step-father is planning to sell her to pay his debts. In her new life  spent as a domestic help in an affluent household  she tastes luxury but suffers yet another set-back, which forces her to flee and resume her search for a shelter. Lailas world has been portrayed realistically, but Shahs writing lacks the depth to keep the reader engaged for long spells.                        
	Human Rights in a globalised world: An Indian diary (Sage, Rs 395) by Mukul Sharma explores the inception of the regional human rights mechanism around the world. Sharma addresses the role of non-state actors in this critical area, and suggests that India, China and Brazil have evolved into global players in the international human rights chapter by building new political and economic ties with nations from Africa, Latin America and Asia. However, despite their influence, the commitment shown by these countries towards human rights remains suspect. This is an important book that adequately represents relevant issues in relation to human rights.

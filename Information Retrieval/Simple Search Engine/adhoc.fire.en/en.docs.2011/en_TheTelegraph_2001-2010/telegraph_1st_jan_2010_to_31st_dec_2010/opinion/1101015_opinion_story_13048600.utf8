	No escape from disaster      
	Escape from Java and Other Tales of Danger (Puffin, Rs 175) by Ruskin Bond asks us to join intrepid heroes and dauntless heroines in their quest for survival against earthquakes, fire, floods and bombs. The stories are delightful, but one shouldnt expect anything less if the writer is Ruskin Bond. In Grandfathers Bath, a deadly earthquake makes Shillong fall apart even as Grandfather Burman splashes about in his tin bathtub. Like Senior Burman, his grandchildren, Rakesh, Mukesh and Dolly, are undaunted by the catastrophe, and instead, make the most of it. After getting over the initial shock of being left penniless and homeless, the children play around the remains of their house, Grandmother opens a tin of sardines for dinner, and Grandfather makes plans for making a hut of small bricks and wood that will survive another earthquake. Unlike his neighbours, Grandfather has no intention of leaving earthquake-prone Shillong, because, Where did one go to escape disaster? One wonders what the extract from Bonds novella, A Flight of Pigeons, is doing in this collection, for the four short stories can stand well on their own without being propped up by it.                        
	For Kids by Kids: The Best of the Scholastic Writing Awards 2010 (Scholastic, Rs 100) has been selected by Siddhartha Sarma, Venita Coelho, Anupa Lal and Arunava Sinha. For the scholastic Writing Awards 2009-2010, students were given the option of writing a short story on a subject of their choice or a letter to their favourite superhero. So we have stories on a magic computer, the little detective, about Akul in Peanut Land, and letters to Superman, Kiran Bedi, Michael Jackson, and predictably, to Mom. As this list indicates, the stories and letters have themes that are very common in childrens writings, and it is a bit difficult to detect the spark of genius in them. A few, such as Oppophobia by Gayathri Sankar or On the Way to Srirangam by Varun Ramanathan, are better than the average, but not exceptional.                        
	Skin Deep: An Inside Out Approach to Looking Good, Naturally! (Collins, Rs 199) by Aparna Santhanam provides answers to such metaphysical questions as How many nuts should you eat in a day?, Why do you need colour in you diet? or What are negative calories? Most of the tips Santhanam offers are the stuff that beauty columns in lifestyle magazines are made of, and hence, are not quite revelations. Sample these: Try a glass of milk or soya milk daily or Apply sunscreen 20 minutes before you leave the house, for genuine protection. More interesting are the recipes in the last chapter, which has the rather ghastly title, Skin Kitchen Recipes.                                  
	Satisdiction: One Mans Journey into all the Words Hell Ever Need (Penguin, 9.99) by Ammon Shea is a compilation of obscure words gleaned from the OED. Shea writes in the Exordium (Introduction) that he is a collector of words and reads dictionaries for fun. While plodding through the OED, he came across some strange and lovely words that have not been in common use for hundreds of years. He brings them together here to let readers savour the taste of these rare words, while sparing them the trouble of handling the tome that is the OED. So we get to know words like felicificability  capacity for happiness, eutrapely  pleasantness in conversation or minimifidian  A person who has the bare minimum of faith (in something). Although some of the words (hamartia, surfeited) may not be unfamiliar to students of literature, this is a book worth a read.

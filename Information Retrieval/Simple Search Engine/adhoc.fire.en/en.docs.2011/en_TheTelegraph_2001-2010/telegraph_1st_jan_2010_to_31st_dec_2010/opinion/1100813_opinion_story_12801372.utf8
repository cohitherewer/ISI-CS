	RENDEZVOUS IN VENICE
  By Philippe Beaussant, 
  Pushkin, pound;10.99  
	This is a gem of a novella that brings together two love stories that are interspersed with reflections on the nature of painting and of memory. The writing creates an aura of fragile beauty and evokes without the slightest exaggeration or indulgence a civilized world where the love of art and books is almost as natural as life itself.  
	The novel opens with the discovery of the secret notebook of Charles Millau, an art historian and scholar, by his nephew and heir, Pierre, who had been Charless sole companion for over two decades. In the notebook, Charles looked back on episodes of his life while he waited for death surrounded by his books and art collection. Pierre is fascinated by what he reads and through his reading he remembers his uncles phenomenal memory about art, his detailed observations not only about the paintings they saw together but also about people they met or even passed by on the street or saw briefly across a caf. The recollections are interrupted when he reads what Charles writes about a woman called Judith.        
	Judith, even though she was many years younger than Charles, had been the love of his life and perhaps even his muse. But he had kept this part of his life a secret even from his nephew. It was only from the notebook that Pierre discovers the depth of the relationship and why they had parted ways in Venice. Judith had wanted Charless child and he had backed off because of the age difference between the two of them.        
	Charles could never forget Judith. In his notebook, Pierre reads, I have to state, yes, state, claim to myself that I have worked for fifty years on painting but have only had the passion for painting for one month. Because of her, by her, through her.        
	Pierre couldnt believe what he read. He couldnt understand why his uncle hadnt told him what was obviously the most important encounter of his life. He lived with his sense of bewilderment, till in a dry and boring seminar on art in Rome, he suddenly realized that the speaker he was listening to was none other than Judith.        
	After the seminar, Judith recognizes Pierre immediately. She says, You are Charles Millaus nephew. I recognized his white scarf around your neck. Do you always wear it? Will you accompany me to the Piazza Navona? I am meeting my daughter there.        
	As they walk and sitting in a caf in the Piazza, Judith and Pierre talk inevitably about Charles and his rare gifts of observation, analysis and imagination. Pierre little knows what awaits him. When Judiths daughter, Sarah, arrives. It is love at first sight for both her and Pierre.        
	When Sarah comes to live with Pierre in the house that Charles lived in and had left for Pierre, there relationship is in no way a re-run of the one that Charles and Judith experienced. Sarah is light-hearted without any of Judiths intense love for art and life. She can occasionally be exasperating. They are in bliss till Sarah one day packs her belongings and leaves. She offers no explanation except that she didnt like quarrelling. Pierre realizes that what he thought were discussion and argument, she saw as a quarrel.        
	The story could have ended with Pierre heartbroken much as his uncle had been when Judith had left. But Philippe Beaussant takes it forward in a few more pages. Suffice to say Pierre and Sarah achieve what Judith and Charles had left incomplete.        
	The two very different love stories are held together not only by evocative writing but also by reflections and analyses of art. Here is a passage from Charless notebook: I shall never return to Venice. The places I liked are becoming hazy in my memory. They lose their outlines, as san Giorgio Maggiore does in October in the evening light. Could it be that the Venice of my memories ceased to be completely real a long time ago? Its palaces and campaniles doubtless already look like those painted by Turner. Like him I invent them, I reconstruct them with a more fluid and vaporous material, I colour them without meaning to, to make them look slightly more like the happiness I felt in contemplating them.        
	In this book life chases art only to completely overtake it.

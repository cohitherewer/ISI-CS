The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | terror on track
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TERROR ON TRACK                                                          
	Politics is sometimes the theme of a tragedy. It is perhaps only in West Bengal that a tragedy becomes the subject of politics. The train accident a few miles beyond Kharagpur in the early morning of Friday can only bring to mind those haunting words of Joseph Conrads Heart of Darkness: The horror! The horror! But such is the darkness which some politicians inhabit that they have tried to make political capital out of a disaster and have started the vicious cycle of a blame game. The fact that the civic elections are scheduled to be held today has only added a certain hysterical edge to the various accusations. What is also remarkable is that despite the recent example of the civil aviation ministers offer of resignation in the aftermath of the Mangalore crash, there has been no such gesture forthcoming from the minister of railways. Scoring points off the state administration has prevailed over the demands of ordinary decency.        
	All immediate and available evidence suggests that the accident was caused by an act of sabotage perpetrated by Maoists. What needs to be condemned unequivocally by all decent and sensible persons is the growing tendency of Maoists to kill innocent people to further their cause. By touching these heights of barbarism, the Maoists are demonstrating that they are no different from terrorists who murder innocent people in the name of some noble ideology. The Maoists claim to represent the tribals, and they want to remove the oppression and exploitation that have been inflicted by the Indian State on the tribals. How this will be achieved by killing ordinary people travelling on a bus or a train is beyond comprehension and outside the realm of the most perverse logic. What is shameful is that there are members of civil society  writers, academics and politicians, people who should know better  who continue to defend the Maoists and allow their killing of innocent people to pass without a word of condemnation or criticism. That areas populated by the tribals are in serious need of development and the introduction of basic amenities is a point accepted by most people, even the prime minister. But this absence cannot be the justification of mindless violence, which, in fact, hinders any kind of development work in the affected areas.        
	While counter-insurgency is not the only way to eradicate the violence, it is the necessary first step. The sabotage of railway tracks only highlights the need for strong measures against agents of violence and hatred, irrespective of the colour of their flags. The otiose distinction between the Centres responsibility and that of the state only points to a level of incompetence that passes description. Terror has made travel dangerous for the common people. The reign of terror must be forced to end.

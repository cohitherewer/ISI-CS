The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | All shall not be well
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ALL SHALL NOT BE WELL                                  MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Erratic weather patterns have begun to besiege us, catching us unawares and disallowing all plannings, ranging from when to sow seeds for a crop to the preparations for a trip away from the predictable comforts of homes, and everything in between those two polar priorities. Are these seasonal shifts being addressed by our scientists, agriculturists and other such professionals, if only to plan better for the future and thereby, to circumvent disasters? Are leaders, their cabinets and administrators, even concerned about these changing realities that will soon overwhelm them and demand correctives and solutions? Are all those men and women who determine the future course of our collective lives, conscious of the need to rethink the paradigms that have dictated our lives thus far?        
	Copenhagen happens. Our Opposition grabs those straws and begins to bash the ruling coalition that represented India at the summit. Its rhetoric is predictable and it jars because it suggests no alternatives, no solutions or correctives. The discourse has reduced itself to abuses hurled at one another within the sacrosanct doors of Parliament. Is our political space utterly bereft of good thoughts and action? For how long are those in politics and the civil services who run the administrative machine going to pollute the domain that belongs to us all? Will the opposition parties fight a good idea merely because it came from somewhere else? Will India ever use the mechanisms of democratic functioning to better the environment and the habitat? Or will the privileged amongst us, the politicians and administrators, continue to divert attention from what they have failed to deliver to the people by introducing irrelevant googlies that trigger fresh controversies, which help disguise their congenital inability to protect the basic tenets of civil society?                
	In pain        
	One such googly at this juncture of our accelerated growth, and our hopelessly faltering delivery of the very basic infrastructure necessary to support the pace of growth happening around us despite the malfunctioning government, is the demand for smaller states. The failed political and administrative class claims that its inability to contain the near-complete collapse of the governing system is due to the unmanageable size of the states. Reduce the states into smaller units and all will be well. This notion reinforces the irresponsibility and lack of accountability that have become the signature of the politico and his non-performing babu.         
	The winners in this breakdown of governance have been the Maoists or the Naxals, call them what you may. Jharkhand is in their control, and if Telangana is christened, it will be another state under their active jurisdiction. Statistics show a different picture. Uttarakhand was comparatively prosperous before it broke away and so were Punjab and Haryana. Bifurcation did not do the trick. If the Indian administrative service worked honestly and by the book, if it stopped pandering to the greedy, illegitimate demands of its political bosses, then every district would have been well governed and the baton would have been passed on to the larger, next in line, entities of the social, economic and political structures.        
	Therefore, rather than be in a hurry to break up states into smaller pieces and build a complicated and hugely volatile jigsaw that might set the stage for balkanization, it makes far better political sense to radically overhaul and correct the system that has become totally unhealthy and diseased. Finding excuses for faulty and corrupt governance does not do justice either to the agenda of the United Progressive Alliance or to the issue of smaller states. It is a shame that India is in pain because the government wants to cure a hairline fracture with an amputation.

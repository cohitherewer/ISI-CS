                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SOMETHING TO TELL YOU                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                                                      
	In my first few moments at Amritah Sens solo exhibition, Do You Still Happen? (Gandhara Art Gallery, till December 16), I found myself reacting to the work with a mixture of voyeurism and self-pity. It felt as though I was walking through a mausoleum of memories, intensely personal, culled out of the artists emotional archive. Despair and disappointment, pleasure and pain have become tangible in inky blues, fiery reds and deadly blacks. Traces of the past lie strewn everywhere: stored away in pain-full paper-bags, trapped like genies inside bottles, tucked away in corners. Yet words and phrases spill out of notebooks, snake down slender rain-pipes, paper-fingers beckon and plastic eyes wink at you or fix you in an icy glare. The eyes mind is subjected to a rigorous spring cleaning. My work is really based on the elimination of fears, the French-born American artist, Louise Bourgeois, had once said. Amritah Sen could claim no less.        
	In spite of the autobiographical nature of the work, its impact is profoundly cathartic, not only for the artist but for the viewer as well. Sen can be cannily manipulative of your reactions. Claiming you expertly as her confidante, she ensures your full involvement in her visual life-writing. You feel waves of sympathy, laced with voyeuristic excitement, for what she shares with you: the highs and lows of her erotic life, a history of getting close to people and letting them go. Understanding turns into empathy as you allow yourself to be gently seduced by the psychosexual allure of her work and confront, in turn, the demons that have been long interred inside your own head. This process is so thoroughly experiential, even visceral, that any attempt to verbalize it risks glibness.        
	Unlike Tracey Emin, with whose style Sen has some affinity, Sen is more interested in subtle self-writing, not self-dramatization. If Emin, with her importunate self-revelations, gives you the equivalent of an emotional earache (in the words of the critic, Jonathan Jones), Sen, in comparison, merely whispers secrets into your ears. Of course, that does not mean that the effect of her confessions is palliative or consolatory. Again, with Emin, you usually get what you see, but with Sen, you are often tempted, and perhaps expected, to see what you dont get. For Emin, a readymade, such as her famous bed that was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1999, is no more than an everyday object, unredeemed and untransformed by aesthetic additions. In contrast, Sens installations inside empty vials of homeopathic medicine and glass jars are more consciously fashioned as exquisite works of art drawing their energy from a powerful symbolic field.        
	In a series of three jars (picture, above), she puts three paper hearts  blue, red and black  and lets the colours interact with the words and phrases that hover on the surface of these vessels. Grotesque and moribund, the work teases the viewer to peep and see and make sense of what lies within. Understanding, or rather a sense of recognition, comes much later, if at all. The overall effect is that of a jigsaw puzzle, which must be made, unmade, and re-made by individual viewers, impelled by their own memories and desires. It is only through association and identification with the work that you are able to imagine the elisions, omissions and obscurities.        
	Confessional work, such as those by Tracey Emin or Jenny Holzer, could turn out to be sources of instant gratification. But not so with Sen, who, with her spidery and inventive scrawl, ensures that you devote quality time and attention to her work. Indeed, the excellence of Sens work comes from the challenge that she throws at the viewer. It is, first of all, an exhausting, although rewarding, activity to simply decipher the densely scribbled messages that she leaves all over like clues. But that is not all. You must then be prepared to exercise your mind in order to decode what you have read and seen before you can get to the truth that lies securely guarded at the mysterious core of her art.        
	The cryptic appeal of Sens work is heightened by the distinction she makes between inside and outside stories, between the life of the mind and that of the body. At one level, to be inside a Sen story is to have access to certain in-jokes, to be able to appreciate her quirky sense of humour, her charming capacity for self-parody, and the mocking, self-deprecating essence of her art.        
	Vroom Vroom (picture, below) takes us back to some of Sens earlier work, such as In Search of Drighangchu, with its twin promise of seeking and being sought. Instead of Sukumar Ray, the presiding genius of Drighangchu, Sens inspiration this time is probably the magical footwear worn by Goopy Gyne and Bagha Byne in Satyajit Rays classic film. But in Sen, even the wildest fantasies are habitually garnished with a pinch of salt. And so we see a pair or ordinary chappals, not any fancy stuff, but with propellers attached to them, alongside a deadpan price-tag declaring invented acc. to my shape amp; size.

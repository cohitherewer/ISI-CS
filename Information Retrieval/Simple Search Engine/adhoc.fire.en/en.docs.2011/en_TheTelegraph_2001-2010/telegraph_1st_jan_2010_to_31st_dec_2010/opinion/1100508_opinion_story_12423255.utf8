	Great Britain, since it lost its empire, has been reduced to a minor power struggling to retain global prominence by clinging on to Washingtons coat-tails. Yet it has a rich political tradition that has lessons and examples to offer many of its former colonies, especially the one that is proud of being the worlds largest democracy. The British prime minister, Gordon Brown, went to the country on May 6. The results of the elections are of no immediate relevance to the people of India and their representatives in Parliament. But the process of electing the representatives of the people in Britain is not without some significance. The elections across Britain were held on the same day. Throughout the campaigning and on the day of the polls, there were no unseemly outbreaks of violence, no reports of coercion and no glaring instances of the violation of the code of conduct. In fact, the electoral commission in Britain had little or no role to play in disciplining political parties and their candidates. The displays of joy and sorrow as the results were announced have also been subdued.        
	All this is in sharp contrast to the manner in which elections are conducted in India. The Election Commission in India stands forth during the campaigning and the day(s) of polling and counting as the head prefect of the political class. The incidence of violence during elections is much reduced, thanks to the excellent work of the EC, but by no means has violence been totally eradicated. In fact, it cannot be said with any degree of certainty that violence has been scaled down because of a change of heart among politicians and a better understanding of the democratic process. On the contrary, there are reasons to fear that the disciplining role of the EC is critical in the reduction of violence and coercion. For some bizarre reason, elections in India are celebrated by many commentators as one huge carnival. There is no reason why this should be the case. A carnival is a carnival, an election is an election. The two are separate and should be so.        
	There can be no denying that there are crucial areas of difference between elections in Britain and India. The size and education levels of the electorate are two factors that come readily to mind. Yet the lower levels of education of large sections of Indian voters have not prevented them from displaying a measure of maturity when they exercise their political choice. Neither maturity nor awareness of rights is at issue here. Democracy in India has struck deep roots and through this process millions of people have become more assertive about their choice. These people need to be made more conscious of the conventions and unwritten norms that govern a democratic society. Their consciousness will force their representatives to follow those conventions. Indian democracy, despite the national adjective, cannot afford to lose all traces that link it to its originary model.

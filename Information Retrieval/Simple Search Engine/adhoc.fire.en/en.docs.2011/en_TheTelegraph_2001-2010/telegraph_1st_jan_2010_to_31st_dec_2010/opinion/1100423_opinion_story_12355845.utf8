	Sprint of the Blackbuck: Writings on Wildlife and Conservation in South India (Penguin, Rs 299) edited by S. Theodore Baskaran is a collection of essays first published in Blackbuck, a quarterly journal on wildlife and conservation that started in 1983. In the introduction, Baskaran stresses the need for making the important distinction between conservation and animal rights that forms the context to these essays. He says, The conservation movement is in danger of being hijacked by animal rights, with disastrous results. It harms the cause of conservation by alienating a vast section of the population. [This] anthology is not just about birds and animals. It is about issues, concepts and history. The short and knowledgeable essays, presenting scientific findings in a readable manner, are entertaining and enlightening. By documenting the sheer variety of flora and fauna present in just south India, they emphasize the urgency of saving the countrys fast-disappearing wildlife.                        
	The Caravan of White Gold: A 1,600 km Odyssey through the Sahara Desert (Jaico, Rs 295) by Michael Benanav would have made for a wonderful adventure novel. Only, the events described here are true. Benanav follows on foot and on camel the trail of the caravans that have been travelling to and fro over the past thousand years between the mines of Taoudenni and the fabled city of Timbuktu (in the West African nation of Mali) to trade in white gold, salt. In the ancient world, salt had been worth its weight in gold. Although the value attached to salt has diminished considerably today, the men of Sahara still continue their arduous journey to the heart of the desert to mine and sell salt. Benanav rediscovers an unknown way of life by living with the camel drivers for weeks. I spent time under the wooden tents of Bedouin families, drinking tea, talking Arabic, and eating fresh goat meat. Charmed by their hospitality, intrigued by their culture, I became hopelessly infected by a fascination with nomadic peoples, he writes.                         
	Vermillion Clouds: A Century of Womens Stories from Bengal (Women Unlimited, Rs 350) translated by Radha Chakravarty is a representative collection of womens writing spanning almost a century. It begins with Dedication (1908) by Susheela Sen and ends with Anita Agnihotris Within the Furnace (2005). Perhaps not surprisingly, the stories indicate that not much changed for women in the last 100 years. If Bibha in Dedication has to follow her Westernized husbands wishes in wearing only silk saris and English perfumes no matter how much she dislikes them, Nandinis mother, the ordinary wife of a famous poet in Within the Furnace, has long lost her own identity in that of her husband. Other writers in this collection include Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, Lila Majumdar, Nabaneeta Dev Sen and others. Notwithstanding Umberto Eco oft-quoted warning that translation is the art of failure, Chakravarty has done a good job of rendering the stories into English.                                  
	Treasure (HarperCollins, Rs 350) by Clive Cussler is, as the cover proudly proclaims, A Dirk Pitt novel. The auditory pun on the name of the swashbuckling, lady-killing hero must have been intentional. What is possibly unintended is the fact that reading the novel is like falling into a dark pit that has nothing but a television set showing only American channels for your entertainment. The hullabaloo over hidden treasures of Alexandria proves to be a smokescreen for the paranoia over Muslim terrorists who, predictably, want to sabotage the pious peace efforts of the American president. The book is recommended only for diehard fans of Uncle Sam and his Dirk Pitt.

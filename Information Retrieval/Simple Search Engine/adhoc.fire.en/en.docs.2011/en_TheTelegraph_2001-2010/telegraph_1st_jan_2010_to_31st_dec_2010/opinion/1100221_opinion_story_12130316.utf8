The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | quite a song and dance
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        QUITE A SONG AND DANCE                                                          
	There is one question that has remained as contentious as it was when it first found expression, possibly in the cave: who gets the biggest share of the pie? And when it is a matter of multiple contributors to one product, as in a film, and multiple uses of that product, wholly or in parts, as in a DVD version of the film and music CDs of the songs from that film, there may be a lack of agreement regarding how the pie is to be shared out. The disagreement can plunge to the almost comic levels reached by the colourful spat between Javed Akhtar and Aamir Khan about who makes a song popular, the actor who appears to sing it or the lyricist who gives it words and the composer who sets it to music. But the broader issues of copyright and royalties are not confined to the peculiar circumstances of the Bollywood film with its playback and star systems. Had it been so, the best arbiter would have been the bathroom singer  he would decide whether he is recalling, say, Asha Bhosle or A.R. Rahman or, perhaps, Shammi Kapoor as he sings. The resultant chaos can barely be imagined.        
	Laws are there to prevent exactly this kind of chaos, but it had long been obvious that the Copyright Act of 1957 was no longer adequate for a distinctly different and technologically advanced world. The copyright amendment bill was approved last year and was meant to clarify current issues, smooth out operational problems and address new areas created by the advances in reprography, in digital technology and the internet. Applied to the Bombay film industry  the scope of the proposed legislation is considerably larger  one of its chief aims is to protect writers, lyricists and composers from exploitation, a phenomenon that has its origin in the dominance of film producers and record companies. That had been established by a Supreme Court ruling in 1977 that treated songs and music as integral to a film. Although this was amended in 1994, not much changed in practice. The proposed amendments are now trying to put things right, but in their present form may muddy waters further.        
	The real difficulty lies in the belief that a single law  with its numerous provisions and amendments  should cover every possibility. Of course, the broad parameters have to be set out  the bathroom singer cannot say a song is his because he sings it  but beyond that each situation requires its own set of contractual rules. In a product such as a film, which demands different kinds of creativity, the ideal would be bilateral contracts on a case-by-case basis. But that may once again give the stronger party  and lawyers  the upper hand. Instead of contortions within a single legislation to ensure justice in every case, the government could work out a number of model contracts that could be employed when deemed fit. That would also give excitable film personalities a chance to act like grown-ups.

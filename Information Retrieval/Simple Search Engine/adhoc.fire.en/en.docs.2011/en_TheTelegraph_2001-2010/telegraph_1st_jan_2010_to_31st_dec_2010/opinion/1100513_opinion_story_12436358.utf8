The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The difficult art of community care
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE DIFFICULT ART OF COMMUNITY CARE                                  A visit to a turtle conservation project in Orissa makes Uddalak Mukherjee wonder about the nature of corporate social responsibility                                  All pictures by Partha Mukherjee                                
	A friend employed with the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation had invited me recently to take a look at their corporate social responsibility initiative near Barkul, Orissa. The CSR project is aimed at protecting the endangered Olive Ridley turtles near the mouth of the Rushikulya river. During my visit to the Gokharkuda beach, a famous nesting site of the turtles, I came across an old fisherman who lived by the sea. His family, he claimed, comprised his wife, two sons, and the buro kachhapa, an aged turtle that returns each year to spend a few days with them.        
	To an outsider like myself, unaware of the mysterious bonds that certain communities share with nature and its species, the idea of a turtle as ones kin was mildly amusing. Reason also prevented me from taking the fishermans claim seriously. How could this unlettered man distinguish his buro kachhapa from the 20,000-odd turtles that swam over 15,000 miles to reach the beach this year? The old man simply said that he knew. His knowledge, based on careful observation and analyses of a complex network of natural signs and ciphers, had been passed on to him down the ages. His conviction stemmed from the strength of this knowledge, a know-how that also helped him predict, unerringly, the storms, tides and currents that rose and fell among the waters which surrounded his life.        
	As we chatted, I asked him about his views on the six-year-old CSR project. He said that he was indebted to the visitors for their assistance. The money that the bank provides is routed through the Wildlife Society of Orissa, which, in turn, helps members of the fishing community find employment as guards to protect the turtles during the hatching season. Those who volunteer as guards can earn upto Rs 3,000 per month during these few months. The mortality rate of the hatchlings has dropped, and there has been a 10-15 per cent increase in the number of adult turtles that come to mate on the shore. The CSR project has many other uses. A sweet-water well was inaugurated while I was there. Books and schoolbags have been distributed to the children of the nearby villages and awareness programmes launched on earlier occasions.        
	But there are some areas that remain outside the purview of even the most clinically executed CSR project. A community initiative is meant to look after the needs and resources of the endangered species as well as the community whose services are utilized to protect the animals.              
	The requirements of such communities can be varied. They can range from tangible needs like demands for drinking water and income-generation to those that are less obvious, but equally critical: the need to protect and nurture local cultures, knowledge and ethics that are as endangered as the turtles.        
	The gentle old man had raised his voice only once during our conversation. That was when he had described how local customs  Kurma Puja (the worship of one of the ten avatars of Vishnu who appears as a tortoise)  and the use of certain languages (his mother tongue, Telugu, for instance) were on the wane. Some of the fishermen were also less inclined to make the arduous journey to the sea and catch fish for a living as the conservation project had provided them with an easier access to money. As a result, traditional skills such as some difficult methods of fishing, the making and casting of nets and boat-manufacturing are being forgotten.        
	Cupping his hands, the man struck a match and lit a bidi. Human interactions, and benevolence, are complicated exchanges, he said. Then, pointing to the endless blue expanse, he said that a gulf as wide as the sea separated me from him.        
	In the evening, children from the three village schools of Gokharkuda, Niladripur and Mayrapuda were brought together by the organizers to attend a function. It was here, amidst the shrieking, delighted children whose voices rose above the crashing waves in the distance, that I realized what the fisherman must have meant.              
	A sit-and-draw competition had been organized for the children, along with a game of musical chairs and cricket. It was a strange, bitterly unequal, ritual; young men and women, their expensive watches and sunglasses gleaming in the light of the setting sun, were herding a group of children dressed in fraying, blue uniforms around some hastily arranged chairs even as a local Oriya song played on a loudspeaker. It was evident that the children were competing to win prizes that included schoolbags and other articles of daily use. I remember vividly this slip of a girl who had exited the game of musical chairs early. Even as her furious father rebuked her in Oriya, undoubtedly blaming her for failing to bring home the precious prize, she looked longingly at another girl who hugged her gift tightly to her chest. I sat and wondered whether a contest  in the guise of innocuous games  was an ideal way to help these needy children. But then, what is a corporate initiative without competition?        
	Meanwhile, another fierce competition was being waged nearby. An excited voice on the microphone announced that a volleyball match was underway between Calcutta and Gokharkuda. But then, this was no ordinary game, for it laid bare the tensions that inform all donor-recipient relationships. The local side, egged on by a vociferous crowd, played with injured pride. Victory was important, for it would make them forget, possibly for a few fleeting moments, their perpetual misery, deprivation and dependent status. The visitors, after a casual start, took to the game seriously. There were shouts of Cmon boys!, frequent substitutions, and off-the-court strategy sessions. It seemed as though the visitors wanted to restore order in the form of a set of unequal relations that forever bind donors to recipients.        
	It is difficult to blame either side. Helping an impoverished people, be it in the form of a CSR initiative or otherwise, can be a complex and onerous responsibility. Along with assistance in the form of money and material, care must be taken to instil in these exchanges a modicum of a sense of equality and respect. It is imperative for the donor to make the recipient understand that a plea for help does not reduce his self-worth in any way, and that the ties that bind the two communities should ideally be premised on equitability. For such points of contact are invariably beneficial to both. There is no doubt that the fishermen in Gokharkuda have benefited from the CSR project. But it is equally important to let them know how such visits and the story of their survival have enriched our lives.              
	Only then would that wise old man, who counts a turtle as family, stop calling us visitors. He would, in his minds eye, then see that a bridge has been built across the waters that now separate us from them.

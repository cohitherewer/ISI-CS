                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EYE ON THE TIMES                                                                
	A photograph captures a moment in life and history more eloquently than words. Yet the entry of photographs into the archives of history was relatively late, as was their entry into historical discourse. One obvious reason for this is that the technology of the camera is a very late arrival as an instrument to document history. It emerged as a complement to the newspaper reporter who recorded bits of history as they were being made. The photographer, who often accompanied (and still does) the reporter, captured the same moment on camera to elaborate what was appearing in print.        
	In India, it is rare to have a full collection of pictures shot by a photographer. Kulwant Roy documented the years before and after Independence and left behind his entire body of work to Aditya Arya, whose family Roy knew very closely. Arya let this collection lie unnoticed till December 2007 ,when he decided to open the boxes. HISTORY IN THE MAKING (Collins, Rs 4,999) offers a selection from that corpus, and is a result of Aryas research.        
	The photographs, as the historian Indivar Kamtekar notes in a lucid and thought-provoking introduction, follow a received version of history that was familiar to most people of Roys generation and background. Most, if not all, the photographs are of leaders and well-known individuals. Before Roy is condemned of being an elitist, it is worth remembering that he was a professional press photographer. When he worked, most newspapers believed that the leaders made news, if not history.        
	Roy had the gift of capturing familiar figures at unusual moments. There is a picture of Nehru and Jinnah walking in Shimla, in 1946, looking in the same direction, and both looking very dapper, relaxed and comradely. We have grown accustomed to pictures of Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten together, sharing a joke or a quiet and intimate moment. Roy shows Vallabhbhai Patel and the vicereine chatting in 1946.        
	The pictures chosen above show (clockwise) Patel with the Maharaja of Kapurthala in 1948; Abul Kalam Azad and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan coming down the steps of the Vicergal Palace in Shimla; Nehru on a merry-go-round with a four-year-old Rajiv Gandhi and Chandralekha (Nehrus niece); Mahatma Gandhi getting off a third-class railway carriage sometime in the 1940s (this photograph is very cleverly placed opposite one of Nehru boarding a second-class compartment in 1937, and he is being seen off by Gandhis devoted disciple, Madeleine Slade, better known as Mirabehn); and finally, an undated photograph of Jinnah surrounded by his admirers and followers. The photographs in this book offer rare glimpses into a vanished world. They form an invaluable archive.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PARTY SPIRIT                                                    
	There are politicians who can rise above politics and those who are forever trapped in the party spirit. When the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, offered to appear before parliaments public accounts committee in the 2G spectrum allocation case, he acted more like a statesman than a conventional politician. If the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party cannot see the extraordinary merit in the prime ministers move, the reason perhaps has everything to do with their political motives. The irony is that the partys bluff has been called by none other than Murli Manohar Joshi, its former president and currently the PAC chairperson. Mr Joshi has argued that the PACs scope is wide enough to enable it to conduct its own probe into the 2G scandal. As the PAC chairperson and a veteran parliamentarian, he should know the rules that guide the PACs work. But it is his own party that is throwing a spanner in his works. The BJPs argument that the PAC cannot summon a minister without the permission of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has little substance. If the prime minister himself offered to appear before the PAC, there is no reason to assume that the Speaker will stop the PAC from hearing other ministers.        
	The schism between Mr Joshis position and that of the BJP shows the party in a poor light. It also takes much of the wind out of its anti-Congress campaign over the spectrum issue. There was never any doubt that the BJP saw the spectrum allocation issue as a potent political weapon. Its opposition to Mr Joshis stand confirms that suspicion. Its demand for a probe by a joint parliamentary committee cannot but be seen as part of that political gameplan. It is unfortunate that the BJP cannot put the spectrum controversy in its larger perspective. There is an urgent need to probe the issue not only because of the large sums of money involved but also because it raises questions about probity and transparency in governance. At stake is the larger issue of corruption and the threat it poses to both business and governance. The prime minister himself feels the need to clear the air and to punish the guilty. He has not taken the average politicians route of denying any wrongdoing. His unprecedented offer seems to be a more honest attempt to uncover the truth than the BJPs loud calls for the JPC probe. At least, Mr Joshi seems to think so.

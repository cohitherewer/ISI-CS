	Caught on camera                  
	Sir  Shahid Afridi was seen on camera biting the ball during the final one-day international against Australia in Perth (Afridis action cost Pak dear: Ponting, Feb 2). He has been banned for two Twenty20 matches. Instead of owning up to his mistake, Afridi tried to justify his actions by saying that he was merely smelling the ball. But television footage have caught him red-handed. Afridi should have been banned from playing national and international matches for at least six months.          
	Yours faithfully,      
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ball tempering is not a new issue. Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram were accused of it in 1992. Afridi has only repeated history, and dishonoured the spirit of the game. It is heartening that such misbehaviour has been dealt with in a strict manner.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Taste for trouble          
	Sir  Rising prices have wreaked havoc in the life of the aam aadmi. But neither the price nor the availability of brinjal has caused much alarm. Recently, an American company tried to patent the production of Bt brinjal for its anti-diabetic properties. Leaving aside the debate over the toxic effects of pesticides used to cultivate Bt brinjal, the fact remains that with the introduction of this crop, Indian farmers will have to depend on the American multinational, Monsanto, for seeds year after year. Are Indians really so desperate for this variety of brinjal?          
	Yours faithfully,      
N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta 

      
	Sir  Currently, less than 20 plant species produce the bulk of worlds food. The fear is that once these crops go the Bt way and fall under the GM umbrella, issues related to intellectual property rights are likely to gain prominence. With patent protection, Indias foodgrains will become the monopoly of a few corporations. About 10 companies will control the vast markets for food across the world.          
	Chemical contamination may not only affect individuals who consume the crops, but also their offspring (New beginning, Feb 11). It is a matter of just a few decades before clinical disorders arising out of eating modified crops manifest themselves among populations. We have no conclusive data on the long-term impacts of GM food. But once such crops enter the food chain, it would be impossible to retrieve the original strand of the crop.          
	Governments have been slow in regulating chemicals that have pernicious effects on our bodies. In the 1960s and 1970s, hundreds of studies showed that tobacco poses health risks such as cancer and heart attacks. Only then did the Indian government finally wake up to regulating tobacco consumption. Just as chemical policies are now monitored at state, national and international levels, it is important to do so with GM food as well.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  GM crops have great potential in food and medicine. They can help alleviate hunger and malnutrition on the one hand, and lessen the pressure on natural resources on the other.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Narayan Das, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  No longer blessed with riverbeds rich in nutrients and unlimited water, modern man faces problems of water scarcity, decreased soil fertility, and so on. Undeterred, human beings have created hybrid varieties of crops that can stand semi-arid climate, and invented pesticides, fertilizers and drip irrigation. The current row over Bt brinjal is, therefore, unfortunate. Researchers take on immense challenges by investing funds and energy to carry out futuristic studies for the benefit of human kind.          
	Apprehension regarding Bt brinjal, stemming from inadequate field tests, are valid. This problem has been addressed with the ministry of forests and environment imposing a moratorium on the cultivation of this crop to give researchers time to conduct tests. Resisting change is natural. But to doubt human ingenuity, which has met several challenges in agriculture, would be self-defeating.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                
	Sir  Jairam Rameshs decision to stall the commercial release of Bt brinjal is prudent. But when researchers endorse the use of this crop, the minister will be left with no option but to allow its cultivation. The present reaction is possibly a stopgap arrangement before anything certain can be said. If the damage done to consumers by Bt brinjal is the main reason for the agitation against it, then it is better to start campaigning against all the food items since most of them are adulterated.          
	Yours faithfully,

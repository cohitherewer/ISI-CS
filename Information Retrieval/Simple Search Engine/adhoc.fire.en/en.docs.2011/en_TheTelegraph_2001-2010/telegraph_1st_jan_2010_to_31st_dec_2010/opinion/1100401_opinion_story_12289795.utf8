The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Death wish
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DEATH WISH                                                                  
	The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, is a curious piece of legislation. According to the law in India, in the event of the death of an individual, his family is empowered to prevent the corpse from being handed over to medical institutions for research even though the deceased had pledged to donate his body for that purpose.        
	This is strange on two counts. First, the law chooses to ignore the voluntary consent of the deceased in the face of opposition from the family. Can this be perceived as an infringement on an individuals rights? Or do such rights cease to matter in the event of death? Second, even if the second possibility is indeed the case, it reveals a glaring inconsistency in the legal rationale, for the law honours certain other kinds of pledges after death. A will, for instance, is legally binding in the sense that in the case of a dispute, a court would expect the claimants to follow the directions given by the deceased regarding the disbursement of property. But a voluntary consent for cadaver donation enjoys no such legal protection. Significantly, in some of the Scandinavian countries, as well as in Israel, after an individual expires, his body is deemed to be State property and donated for medical research even in the absence of written consent.        
	Law often mirrors societal prejudices. The orthodoxy inherent in the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, therefore, can be traced to Indian societys discomfort with the idea of pledging ones body for medical research. It is this collective conservatism that Ganadarpan, a Calcutta-based social organization, has been fighting for over two decades. Founded in 1977 by a group associated with the Peoples Theatre movement, it fought to dispel social taboos. In the mid-1980s, realizing how little has been achieved in the field of cadaver donation, Ganadarpan decided to specialize in this sphere of activity.         
	In a way, Ganadarpans struggle will determine whether a scientific temper would ultimately prevail over the irrational in our society. The battle is proving to be a long and hard one. The imperfections in the law are perhaps as crippling as societal resistance. There is ample evidence to indicate that even a liberal mind might hesitate to defy the notions of purity and the rituals associated with death. (One of Calcuttas most celebrated poets had pledged his body, but his wish was denied by his equally famous, but unwilling, wife.) The numbers bear testimony to this dismal fact. In West Bengal, of an estimated population of 80.18 million (2001 census figure), merely seven lakh people have pledged to donate their bodies. It is important to remember that not every pledge is likely to be fulfilled. Fourteen thousand donations have actually taken place since 1986.         
	The pathetic figure is puzzling, given the simple procedure that one has to follow while pledging ones body for medical research. All that is required is to fill up a three-page form giving ones consent. The form is also available online, and there are no charges involved.        
	Perhaps, more than our love of indolence, it has something to do with the lack of awareness. However, the responsibility of sensitizing people to this noble cause does not rest on social organizations alone. A supposedly atheist government, in power over three decades, has cut a sorry figure in this respect as well. It seems to be content in its belief that the occasional announcements by its leaders that they will donate their bodies will be enough to goad people to emulate them. Unfortunately, citizens can at times prove to be far less disciplined than the cadre. The fact that an inept and conformist bureaucracy often jeopardizes the little good work that is being done has also escaped the governments notice. It is possible that the governments slumber has to do with the fact that some arms of the State  the police, for instance  stand to gain by the lucrative and illegal trade in corpses. A March 30-report in The Telegraph revealed how a desperate fathers search for his dead son in Rajasthan led to the horrific discovery of the state police being involved in this nefarious activity. A young mans dead body reportedly fetches 5-6 lakh rupees in the black market. There is no reason to believe that such cartels do not exist in this state.        
	It is an unequal battle. An inadequate law coupled with an indifferent State and years of accumulated blindness are conspiring against a small clutch of dedicated and progressive thinkers. But the odds have left these pioneers undeterred. For history, they point out, is replete with incidents of equally lopsided encounters that have often yielded unexpected results.                    UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

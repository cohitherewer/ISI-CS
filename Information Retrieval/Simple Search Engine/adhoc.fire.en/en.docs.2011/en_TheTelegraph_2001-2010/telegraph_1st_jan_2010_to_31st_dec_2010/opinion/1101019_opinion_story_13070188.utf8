The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The city and the country
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE CITY AND THE COUNTRY                                  However well-meaning the citys gifts to the countryside, they are not always as beneficial in effect as expected, writes Tapas Majumdar                          Nalanda: start of a journey                                   
	I had recently been thinking of the innumerable intrusions of the city into the country: the age-old question of the divide between the city-mans construction and the inevitable reconstruction by nature that affected the life and livelihood of the people in the surrounding countryside. Thinking about them I realize that these were not contributions of the same kind, though some were remarkably spectacular and some of these indeed have become the wonders of the ancient, medieval and modern world. Thoughts of numerous inroads the city-man had been claiming to make to change the country-life of the world  mostly for the good  came to my mind.         
	I had been trained to see as an economist that most of the intrusions of the city into the life of the villages were all boons gifted by the cutting edges of civilization to village life. Almost all of these advantages were part of what we now call investment in human capital through modernization and which were generally good for all. Some, of course, have stood the test of time. Take the examples of such investments producing universities like Nalanda, which is near Patna, and faraway Taxila in the west, connected by a well-protected and well-shaded path created by the planting of carefully selected, long-living trees. It was by these trunk roads that pandits like Chanakya went from one university town to the other and produced some of the most serious literature of the time.               
	It was not far from this route that the famous site of Sarnath, north of Varanasi, is located, where some of the most astounding works of great artistry are still prominently displayed. It may be recalled that the head of the Ashoka Pillar (the lion) has been proudly adopted as the emblem of modern India. In short, the investment in human capital for the first time since Mohenjodaro is memorable evidence of how successful and far-reaching such investments could be. The vihara (Maurya) architecture of those early years probably gave such a stamp to Pataliputra that gradually the whole surrounding region came to be known as Bihar. This surmise of course, could be wrong.         
	However, the more I thought about it, I could see these changes were not necessarily all good: the cities investments in the countryside were not all benign. Some definitely were of a very different character and not all could be described as good investments in human capital.        
	In spite of the great influence of thinkers such as King Ashoka and others in the early ages and of people like Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi in later periods, the long-run outcome of investments of this kind in human development could be very different. However, men could not be shaken by the idea that the outcome would be invariably disastrous and the outputs were often far different from what the rural man deserved. In other words, it was not always clear whether the constructions in, and the induction of modern technology (of the time) into the countryside would necessarily be as beneficial as expected.         
	The fact of the matter is, so far as the noble thoughts of great men are concerned, that they themselves could not always distinguish between their desires and the likely outcome of their actions. Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, their mistakes stand out and are neglected. Even Gandhi, for example, did not seem to be as pro-rural as one would expect. More about this later.         
	Strangely enough, I find hardly anybody disagreeing with this when it is pointed out on a case-by-case basis. This is beside the fact that, at the same time, all harbour great hopes for humanity, guided by different motivations.         
	I am tempted to refer to my Asiatic Society lecture in 2007 where I had noted that all our leaders, Left to Right, had agreed on the liberal construction of our national goals. All of these were based on the ideas of equality and justice. But this was for the Indian people as a whole. No thought was given to the fate of millions that made up the whole. The saving graces, however, were the binding of the procedures of the Indian Penal Code and the civil laws that worked throughout for everybody, at least in principle. For example, when a person was murdered it was not asked what caste or creed he or she belonged to.         
	Some of these were people definitely of very different character  out of these some could be real promoters of investment in human capital in the best sense. But what the city- men were often diverting to the countryside were their own ambitions and advantages rather than anything in the interests of the villages. Assuming that the city was invariably the benefactor and the countryside the beneficiary and also that the intentions of the city were invariably in favour of the villager might seem to be at least a partially acceptable idea but not always so.         
	For example, there are innumerable cases of holding and hiding new secret arms by making long-term investments of the wrong type  and sometimes against a non-existent enemy. There would also be an implicit assertion of superiority (cultural as well as technological) of one country over another.         
	Apart from all this there have always been other secret urges. Take the famous pyramids of Egypt. They serve as the most magnificent examples of three dimensional Euclidean geometry on earth. The pyramids also happen to be protected places where some of the precious wealth of the mighty Egyptian world was placed safely for all time to come including time hereafter. The earth on which the pyramids were built was deadly and only the pharaohs knew that something was wrong with it. The fear turned out to be genuine. The dangers were known (early deaths of the artisans and so on). The fear effectively discouraged intruders. Much later, it would be discovered that the ground was of unstable radioactive earth.               
	In the real long run there are other considerations too. Some of these can and should be anticipated today  the others have to be left to circumstances beyond the present generations control.         
	To go back to Gandhi, it is our misfortune that he did not consider it essential to protect the civil and social rights and the criminal law administration of the villages against the local goons running large parts of his favourite panchayati raj. Surely, this could not be the best way of reaching his goal.         
	But Gandhis perception of the long run was often correct. For example, his fear of Partition had been very serious long before other politicians had even thought about it. This is why he went to the extent of offering Mohammad Ali Jinnah the governor-generalship of India to avoid a division that he knew could not be undone. Similarly, he might well have thought that it would be easy to bring the problems of his harijans and other deprived classes under the protection of law and order if he and other like-minded people were around. It could well become a game lying silent until other eyes are opened.

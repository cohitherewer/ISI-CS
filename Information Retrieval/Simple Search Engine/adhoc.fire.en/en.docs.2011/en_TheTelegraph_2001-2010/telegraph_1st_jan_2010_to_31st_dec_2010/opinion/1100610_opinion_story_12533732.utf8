	What a waste                  
	Sir  The article, Memories at public expense (June 5), sums up the political reality of India. It is appalling that the government is spending taxpayers money without their consent on the death anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi. As Ramachandra Guha rightly points out, the anniversaries of leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru, B.R. Ambedkar, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and other freedom fighters are never commemorated on this scale. Rajiv Gandhi may have wanted India to become a self-sufficient superpower, and his work may well deserve appreciation, but the government does not have the right to squander such huge sums from the public exchequer on his death anniversary.          
	People will never forget the way Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated and will always pray that such an atrocity is never perpetrated again. Nevertheless, the common man wants the money he pays as taxes to be used for the good of the society.           
	The ministers who are trying to please Sonia Gandhi must understand that they ultimately owe their posts to the Indian people. The ministers are supposed to serve the people, not indulge in their personal whims. Sonia Gandhi should intervene and dissuade the ministers from wasting public funds to honour her deceased husband, if her renunciation of the prime ministers post was indeed in the interest of serving the people of India.          
	There is nothing wrong in paying tribute to a politician on his death anniversary, but it should not be done on this scale using the common mans hard-earned money. All Indian politicians, cutting across party lines, should realize that misusing power would never earn them a good reputation. They must serve the country and its people selflessly in order to make India strong.          
	Yours faithfully,         Praveen Ramachandran, Calcutta            
	Sir  One hopes that the article by Ramachandra Guha would have some effect on Indian politicians and, in future, advertisements to observe the birth or death anniversaries of Rajiv Gandhi will be financed with the personal funds of the Congress. In a similar article last year (The extra picture, July 20, 2009), Ashok Mitra had advocated the filing of public interest litigations against the gross misuse of public funds for advertisements in various newspapers projecting the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance.          
	However, self-aggrandizement at public expense is not the preserve of a particular party or political family. Indian Railways turned this into a fine art under Lalu Prasad. Large adverts with pictures of him at events as minor as the inauguration of a footbridge at some little-known station had become common. The current railways minister seems to be following in Prasads footsteps. Mayavati, on the other hand, has gone a step further and is busy erecting larger-than-life statues of herself. A sustained campaign against such misuse of public funds is needed.          
	Yours faithfully,        A.K. Singh, Ranchi

    
	Small choice          
	Sir  The results of the municipal polls in West Bengal have proved beyond doubt that the people of the state want a change in the political milieu (Colour change, June 3). Time will tell whether the Trinamul Congress would be a better performer as the ruling party or as the Opposition. But it is true that West Bengal has failed to produce politicians with a positive outlook who do not use bandhs, street politics and blame games to prove their prowess. The state lags behind in development owing to continuous political mud-slinging over minor issues. Instead of dousing discontent, leaders try to get political mileage out of disputes.          
	Ever since Jyoti Basu came to power, West Bengal has suffered from lack of industrialization and large-scale unemployment. It has turned into a hotbed of unionism and strikes. Voices of opposition have been ruthlessly but tactfully suppressed. In the midst of this, a hardcore street politician, Mamata Banerjee, built up her base along the same lines as Basu. She has no vision for the welfare of the state but is solely interested in dethroning the Left. I see West Bengal as a patient whose disease has not been treated. It is now dying a slow and painful death. Talented people are leaving the state for better opportunities elsewhere.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Chakrabarti, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The results of the civic polls have confirmed that the Left Front is in its last stretch. For over 30 years, the Left had managed to hold off anti-incumbent votes by winning over rural voters through land reforms. But then it became too arrogant and alienated from the people. Disillusionment with the ruling party was manifest during the general elections last year. The peoples desire for change was conveyed through a groundswell of support for Mamata Banerjee. But the verdicts of these elections must not be taken as a ringing endorsement of Banerjees brand. They actually constitute votes against the Left. Banerjees maverick ways are difficult to digest. The way in which she drove the Tatas out of the state, her approach to the Maoist issue, and her refusal to accept the blame for the Jnaneshwari Express tragedy has shown her in a poor light. In the end, the people may gain little if her party replaces the Left in the assembly polls next year.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Ambar Mallick, Calcutta

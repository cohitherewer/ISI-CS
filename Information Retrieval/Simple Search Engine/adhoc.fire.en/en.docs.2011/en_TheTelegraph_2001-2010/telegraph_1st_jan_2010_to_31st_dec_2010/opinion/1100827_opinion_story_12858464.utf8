	It is a sign of the uncertainties of our times that a five-year foreign trade policy (FTP) is being subjected to quarterly reviews. Announcing the annual supplement for 2010-11 (FY11) to the FTO 2009-14  which extended a number of sops for exporters, put in place in response to the global crisis of 2009  commerce minister Anand Sharma said that he would examine Indias export performance once again in December this year. The various export promotion schemes that have been extended will cost the exchequer Rs 1,050 crore: not very much, though the Federation of Indian Export Organisations welcomed the announcement. However, the measures fall short of actually being a stimulus, and are more along the lines of holding the status quo. Given that the government is ever so slightly withdrawing the various stimulus packages it put together in response to the global crisis, exporters are more relieved than happy. But will Rs 1,050 crore be enough to increase export growth that has, from all accounts, been modest? At first glance, the measures feel inadequate when weighed against the scale of the challenge of bridging the trade deficit, which is expected to reach $120 billion for FY11; but the commerce ministry also expects exports to touch $200 billion in FY11. And this is where there is more uncertainty than optimism.        
	For one thing, it is becoming increasingly clear that the global economy  which appeared to have rebounded from the crisis  is slowing down once again. That implies that demand for Indian goods is likely to slow down as well; the current account deficit could widen further. A large amount of the trade deficit is expected to be met by capital inflows. Some economists have speculated that as risk aversion in the global economy grows, the still-large amounts of liquidity that are available could come into India and China among others. However, there is another scenario that could play out as well: redemption pressures on foreign institutional investment could lead to a larger outflow of foreign capital that could exacerbate the current account deficit further. Growing domestic demand could propel higher imports, adding even greater pressure on the current account deficit that in turn could impact exports. In the short run, a further depreciation in the value of the rupee would be beneficial to exporters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An extraordinary man
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Even if it took eight years to come here, Maulana Azad by Pierrots Troupe (Delhi) remains a remarkable show. At least Calcutta can take pride in hosting its 100th performance, appropriately on the 60th anniversary of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, for Azad was the ICCRs founder-president. M. Sayeed Alam scripted it from Azads Urdu writings, which contain much more of worth than what Humayun Kabir compressed and transcribed into English as India Wins Freedom. Even in the relative brevity of two hours plus, we discovered how much lies outside the covers of that book.        
	That does not merely mean such biographical details as love for his wife, fondness of ghazals and partiality to jasmine tea. It comprises historical commentary beyond his known antipathy for Jinnah, sometimes taking contrary positions at different times of his life, human like all of us. For example, he could understand why Muslims supported the Muslim League, when in two provinces the Congress replaced respected Parsi and Muslim leaders with Hindus: anyone could think that the Congress had become Hinduized. So Azad sarcastically referred to himself as the Congress Muslim showboy.        
	Gandhi, he felt, should have stuck to his anti-Partition stand. Azad looked upon Partition as his own greatest regret, and nominating Nehru to succeed him (as Congress president) as his biggest blunder. Even Patil may have been better, he said. He knew Mountbatten was determined to partition India and, because Nehru listened entranced to the Lady, she easily got him to agree to the Lords wishes. One can see why Gujarat wanted cuts in the play, which Alam laudably refused to comply with.        
	Tom Alter (picture) exhibited exceptional solo powers of stamina, memory and characterization, warming up from initially no eye contact with the audience to an engrossing political last half-hour. When inconsiderate cell-owners took calls in the hall, he ad-libbed to his invisible scribe, Kabir, about ringing sounds annoying him. As director, Alam should excise repetitive lines to include more about this extraordinary gentleman, in all senses of the word.        
	Our own Renu Roy takes on the somewhat less arduous 90-minute fictional part of Nadira Zaheer Babbars Sakubai for Spandan. She never falters as the garrulous maid who director Ashok Singh deftly transposes from Bombay Hindi to a Bihari in Calcutta (but then why keep bai in the title?); her accent stays accurate right through. However, Sarita Joshi gave the definitive rendition of this role, difficult to top. Besides, despite the strong feminist storyline (men exploit, all husbands philander), Babbar packed it with every possible thing that can go wrong with women, so it does stretch credibility.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | a city derailed
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A CITY DERAILED                                                    
	Everyone, except for those who should have, saw it coming. For Calcutta, this is the most dangerous and lamentable aspect of the accident that took place on the Metro on Wednesday. And the Union railways ministers shockingly irresponsible reaction  playing the crisis down while taking political advantage of it  intensifies this sense of a growing public menace that Calcuttans have begun to feel in their city. People dying in accidents on land and in air, compared to which Wednesdays accident seems minor, may be a normal part of Mamata Banerjees everyday life. But to offer such solace to those who have just suffered derailment, suffocation and shock is to add insult to injury  and, as insults go, this one is particularly crass. The callousness and ineptitude of the Metro authorities are of criminal proportions on two fronts. First, their progressive, and now complete, failure to maintain and upgrade ageing equipment. Second, in spite of repeated dress rehearsals, their total unreadiness in dealing with emergencies, mechanical as well as medical.        
	It has been obvious for quite a while that the Metro in Calcutta has been running on a dangerous lack of technical know-how, on non-existent coordination and failing political will. Ms Banerjee, eager to reap electoral benefits from every civic occasion, had been opening new stations and flagging off new rakes, unabashedly clueless about the actual state of the system. Hence, every touted improvement has turned out to be a new menace for commuters, with the authorities being unable to deal with updated technology. But that is a more sophisticated kind of failure than being unable to organize simple first-aid boxes and toilets for normal times, or torches, ladders, doctors and communication devices for emergencies. These failures have been explained and justified by routinely invoking the indifference of the state and Central governments. Besides, Calcuttans are good at overlooking discomfort and danger, as long as disasters are somehow fended off, and even when the disasters eventually happen, they are not remembered for long. This combination of technical ignorance, administrative failure, political indifference and civic inertia is a sad and deadly one for a modern city. Calcuttans should give their harness bells a shake and wake up to the thought that modernity could be enjoyed rather than suffered. It is their entitlement.

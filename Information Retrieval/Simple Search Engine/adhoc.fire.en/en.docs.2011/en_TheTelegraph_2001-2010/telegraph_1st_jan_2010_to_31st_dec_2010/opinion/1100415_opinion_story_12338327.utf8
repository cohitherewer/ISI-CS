The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Sweets, fish curries, and chemist shops
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SWEETS, FISH CURRIES, AND CHEMIST SHOPS                                  Having always loved Calcutta, Alaka M. Basu tries to rediscover it by looking at it from the perspective of someone with no family ties to, or personal knowledge of, the city                          Unshakeable image                                  
	Growing up in crass and commercial Mumbai (Bombay in those days), nothing made me cringe more about the crassness and money-mindedness of my city than meeting a Calcuttan and getting a lecture on the plain living and high thinking culture of that city. By the time I finished college, my nose was well and truly ground in the dust because I had many friends (two actually, but they sounded like many, so incessant was their chatter) from Calcutta and because there was nothing I valued more than plain living and high thinking. I made some attempts to find high culture in Bombay by rediscovering my Marathi roots and searching out Marathi theatre and music and some literature, but by now the local culture had moved to the fringes of the city and it was too much bother to go looking for it. It was much easier to wallow in my regret about not being a Calcuttan.        
	One summer, during college, I made my way to Calcutta for four days with a Malayali friend who wanted to know what I was so hung up on. I think she came back converted. We both loved the fish curry and the sandesh, we bought between us three-fifty-rupee off-white saris with red borders (this was a long time ago, when a sari could be had for fifty rupees), we perfected our accents for saying Ami tomake bhalobashi and Cholbe na, we delighted in being insulted by the staff at the National Library. The finale was an overcrowded train ride to Bolpur, where, quite ignorant of much more about Rabindranath Tagore than vague facts about Santiniketan, a Nobel prize and Gitanjali, all we did was eat some more fish curry and buy another red-bordered sari.        
	Then, when I had moved on in life and forgotten about my youthful angsts, out of the blue I met and married a man from Calcutta, and suddenly I was spending every summer and winter here  the cultural contrast made even sharper because I was living in Delhi by now  even more crass and ruder than Mumbai (actually, Mumbai was never rude, just indifferent).         
	Those summer and winter holidays were willfully reinforcing my love of the city  I learned to copy the artistic script, I could soon tell one Rabindrasangeet from another, I ate so much mishti doi that I developed an allergy to all dairy products, and I was always the first to jump into the car for yet another visit to Belur Math.              
	Not even being constantly referred to as an abangali could dampen my spirits. After all, I spoke Bangla, and so I was a very warmly welcomed abangali, shown off to whoever dared to doubt my credentials. But at last I have become a bit more clear-eyed. Either that, or Calcutta has changed drastically. Whatever the reason (and it is probably both  I have changed and the city has changed), there are inescapable reasons for surprise, some of them disillusioning.        
	In the last few years, I have been trying to be a Martian in the city  to view it with no preconceptions, and to view it from the perspective of someone with no family ties or personal knowledge. This means that all I have are street observations. And I try to define the city by whatever I see most frequently and most visibly.        
	What are these most enduring images of contemporary Calcutta? If I had to pick four, they would be all (except, perhaps, the last) unrelated to the high culture, high emotion and insatiable appetite for conversation that have made up my imagined Calcutta for so many years.        
	The first of these is the obsessive interest in gold. I have not seen so many hoardings for jewellery stores in any other place I have visited. Enormous pictures of known and unknown, usually loose-haired, women shackled in necklaces and bracelets hurt ones eyes from every direction. Is Calcutta discovering a love for gold and diamonds that other parts of the world have now got over, or at least learnt to be less blatant about? Or was it always this way? I need to brush up on the sociological theories of material acquisitiveness. Except that it does not seem to be an unusually strong interest in all things material  loud ornaments seem to hold a special fascination. Gold biscuits would make more sense to me, at least they can be owned discreetly; masses of metallic adornment, on the other hand, physically weigh down their owners, while, at the same time, making a public spectacle of them. Its an intriguing and completely unexpected taste.              
	Jostling with the jewellery shops are the pharmacies. Every few yards, the Martian me observes the red cross signifying a chemist. I thought morbidity had decreased and longevity has increased over time. But Calcuttas streets suggest either an unhealthy obsession with illness or an alarming rise in disease and debility. Perhaps it is the latter, brought on by all that heavy jewellery.         
	It may also be brought on by the third striking image of the city that any outsider must carry back: the crowds outside the sweet shops. Whatever the time of day, it seems to be always the right time to pop another rosogolla down ones throat or to bring tears to ones eyes over another hot singara. Again, I cant tell if this phenomenon has got accentuated by economic growth or if my own tunnel vision kept this ordinary feature of street life out of my sight in the past. So much sugar and so much spice must increase the need for medication, and perhaps that explains the chemists. I certainly know of at least two popular remedies for all matters gastrointestinal that I had never heard of until I came to Calcutta  isabgul and Aqua Ptychotis  to the latter, I too have now become addicted, but isabgul I absolutely refuse to even touch.        
	The last unshakeable image of the city: the flocks of women outside every school, government or private. These young mothers seem to have no occupation or interest other than the education and nutrition of their school-going offspring. In sun and rain, they stand or sit outside the school gates, rushing to feed their charges in the break, rushing again to escort them home when the last bell rings, rushing to escort them right back to a tuition class. I suppose all this maternal rushing around could be seen as proof of the citys intellectual heritage and love of learning, but that is not the association that comes readily to my mind.              
	Luckily for me, I am not really a Martian, and so these four incongruous images of Calcutta life can be camouflaged by retreating once more into the other Calcutta I grew up envying and then loving  the city of poetry and music and anger and endless talk, talk, talk.

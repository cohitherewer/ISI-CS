	Making Sense of Pakistan By Farzana Shaikh, Foundation, Rs 695        
	It is not easy to make sense of what Farzana Shaikh is trying to say about Pakistan. The usual perspectives on Pakistan are based on the opposing binaries of democracy-dictatorship, military rule-civilian rule or peace-anarchy, and blame the countrys feudal set-up, its over-ambitious army, failed politicians, ethnic divisions and an overdose of religion for its dysfunctionality. Most analysts would connect it all to the circumstances of its birth before proceeding to discuss the avarice of the men and women at the helm and the unavoidable socio-economic factors that have brought Pakistan close to an implosion.        
	Shaikh takes a different and a slightly convoluted route. But the journey, if one manages to stick with her, is breathtaking. She charts the mental map of the nation, or the disparate community which poses as a nation, to show how the meeting of minds  and more significantly, the not meeting of minds at crucial times  has taken Pakistan to where it finds itself today. More than six decades after its formation, Pakistan is yet to decide on the questions of national identity and the role it ought to accord to Islam, the founding principle of the nation. The lack of consensus on these issues, Shaikh shows, is responsible for its blighted governance, irresponsible leadership, over-the-top foreign policy, militancy, and so on.        
	Shaikh says Pakistanis, for example, are yet to decide if they are a universal Islamic community without frontiers or a Muslim nation, whose communal, political and economic interests are circumscribed by territorial boundaries. The answer to that question was never easy, and agitated the minds of Indian Muslim leaders no end, prior to the formation of Pakistan. The disparate interests of Muslims from north-west and east India and the divergence in culture were too great to ignore. It was the genius of Mohammad Ali Jinnah that convinced a minority people that they could arrogate to themselves the attributes of a nation with Islam as a common religious identity. The question of identity, however, was not resolved by this singular feat. Within two decades, the secession of East Pakistan on the basis of a distinct linguistic culture and identity had undermined Jinnahs communal project, making it imperative for Pakistan to again try and answer the question stated at the beginning of this paragraph. For if the Muslims were not necessarily one nation and East Pakistan could become autonomous on the basis of its distinct culture, other culturally different people like the Sindhis, Pashtuns and Balochis could demand autonomy as well. Shaikhs account of the reworking of Pakistans identity  a nation or an extra-territorial community?  and its failure to come to a compromise is fascinating.        
	The reason this failure is damaging for the country and responsible for its present status is because of its invariable association with a host of other equally pertinent questions. What then determines Pakistani identity? How does the army shape its role  as guardian of the territorial integrity of the nation or as guardian of the interests of a supra-regional universal Islamic community that would require it to champion jihad worldwide?        
	Crucial to how Pakistan itself has shaped up is the other vexing question  the role of Islam. Is it to be the blueprint of the social and political order in the State as Jinnah had envisaged it (although, Shaikh says, he had been a reluctant convert to that idea) or is the State going to be merely an instrument in the creation of an Islamic society as the ulama dictates it? And what kind of Islam should it embrace? A universalist one, which is an import from the Middle East or a pluralist one that is a typical product of the South Asian society? Or the other permutations that each of Pakistans elected governments and military dictators chose to validate their authority  General Ayubs popular Islam or Zulfikar Ali Bhuttos folk Islam?        
	Shaikhs survey shows how deep the impact of this lack of consensus has been  on the constitutional framework of the country, on the status of minority faiths and cultures, on the socio-economic goals of the government, on the culture of governance, on education, on society, on the life of the nation and its military. Without looking into this hemisphere, it is impossible to understand why and how Islam, the key component of Pakistans national identity, became a divisive rather than a unitary force.        
	Shaikh, by her own admission, posits her thesis against the neo-Marxist and Cambridge school historiography that sees the development of Muslim nationalism, the birth of Pakistan and its subsequent political trajectory after Independence in the light of the interplay of economic and political interests of the salariat and the army. The theory, however, cannot be read in exclusion of the workings of either the political or economic factors that the existing theses highlight. These, time and again, stick out their neck from Shaikhs dense narrative. Thankfully, she is neither unaware of them nor does she try to ignore them. For example, in the cases of both Ayub Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, it is impossible to override the fact that powerful economic factors were behind their political fates. Both their economic reforms had added another dimension to the battles they had to fight over faith and ideology.        
	It is difficult to agree with Shaikh all the time about a consistent lack of consensus on questions that have determined Pakistans journey so far. Its Look Middle East policy, not merely for religious sustenance, or, more obviously, its intense anti-India stance that makes up a crucial if not entire part of its national identity, would have been impossible without some kind of a consensus being reached somewhere. This study helps one understand better Pakistans obsession with Kashmir, intrinsic to its self-image as a Muslim nation, and its unwillingness to let Afghanistan solve its problem its own way. Her prose is lucid and even bitterly critical of Pakistan in parts. But despite her rare insight into the mind of Pakistan, she is unable to overwrite the bottomlines. This is perhaps why her hopes about Pakistan recasting its quest for religious consensus in terms of a cultural heritage rooted in the discourse of Indian Islam sound like a far cry.                          CHIROSREE BASU

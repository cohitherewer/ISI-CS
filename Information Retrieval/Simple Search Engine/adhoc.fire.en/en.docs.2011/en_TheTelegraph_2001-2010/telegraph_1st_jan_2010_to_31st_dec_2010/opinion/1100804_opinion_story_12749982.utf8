	About a year ago, the phrase, green shoots of recovery, attained great popularity after the American Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, used it in a television interview to bolster his claim that the American economy was coming out of the global recession. Since then, economists all over the world have been debating for a considerable time whether spring has actually arrived or whether the green shoots will soon wither away and plunge the world into double-dip recession.        
	The jury is yet to come to any definite decision about the state of the world economy. The economies of several Eurozone countries continue to be plagued by very low rates of growth, high levels of unemployment and large public debts. The economy of the United States of America, too, seems to be struggling to keep its head above the water, while the latest figures coming out of China show that its economy has slowed down  although China is still growing at a rate which all countries would love to achieve. However, in the midst of all this, one shining exception seems to be the Indian economy  all indicators suggest that spring has definitely arrived so far as our economy is concerned.              
	According to earlier Central government estimates, the gross domestic product growth was estimated to be 8.5 per cent during the current fiscal year. This is a very healthy rate of growth under most circumstances and is particularly noteworthy against the backdrop of the recent gloomy world outlook. But it turns out that even this is an underestimate. The International Monetary Fund, not known to exaggerate growth rates, has recently estimated that the growth rate of the Indian economy will exceed nine per cent. And now the Central government too has stated that it is revising its estimates upwards on the back of a nine per cent growth of GDP during the first quarter of the fiscal year. While all sectors have contributed to the improved performance, the capital goods industries have led the pack with an amazing growth of 34 per cent. The consumer durables sector is not far away at 24 per cent. If this years monsoon turns out to be close to normal, then we can look forward to a bumper harvest. In that case, the IMF forecast may well prove to be conservative.        
	Clearly, at least a part of this improvement in the growth rate must be attributed to the set of stimulus measures adopted by the Central government and the Reserve Bank of India during the course of the last year. These included tax concessions, increased public spending as well as a liberal credit policy. The size of the package, in its entirety, was considerably smaller than that of the corresponding measures taken in China, the US and the larger European countries. Despite the significant difference in the relative sizes of these programmes, the measures have met with considerably greater success in India. Of course, this reflects the fact that the crisis was somewhat less severe in India. In fact, unlike in Western Europe and North America, which witnessed actual recession in the sense of an absolute fall in the level of GDP, the Indian economy slowed down but continued to record a positive rate of growth.        
	Paradoxically, success may breed failure. That is, the fact that the economy seems to have attained a high growth trajectory may prompt the government to withdraw the entire stimulus package. However, any precipitous rollback of these measures may have quite undesirable consequences. In the near future, the main growth impetus has to come from within the country since there is some uncertainty about the external demand for Indian products. So, any sharp reduction in the support provided by the government may have a significant negative effect on domestic demand. This may result in an appreciable slowdown of the economy.        
	Having said that, it is almost inevitable that the stimulus package will be withdrawn over time. In fact, a small step in this direction was taken by the finance minister in this years budget when he increased the excise tax slightly  this was a reversal of the earlier, much larger, reduction in taxes as part of the stimulus package. The level of inflation, particularly the rise in food prices, will put increasing pressure on the government to take some action. The only likely set of actions must involve some effort to cool down the economy. These will take the form of some restrictions on the availability of credit. So, for instance, the RBI may revise the interest-rate structure upwards very soon. The government may also opt to reduce the size of the fiscal deficit by cutting down expenditure. An important consideration for the government and the RBI is the need to act in moderation.              
	Will these restrictive measures help to bring down or, at least, stabilize food prices? Are there other actions which the government can undertake? Unfortunately, food prices react only very slowly  if at all  to small cuts in overall public expenditure or small increases in the interest-rate structure. A more important determinant of the level of food prices will be the monsoon. If this turns out to be normal, then the prospect of a bumper harvest will surely spur private traders to release their stocks sooner than later.        
	This is not to suggest that the only effective course of action available to the government is to pray to the rain gods. I recently came across a newspaper report stating that the Food Corporation of India feels that we have accumulated a larger stock of foodgrains relative to the availability of warehouses. Surely, this is an absurd situation. How can very high food prices across the board coexist with huge stocks of foodgrain held by the government? The only explanation is extremely myopic food distribution policies pursued by successive governments. Instead of complete reliance on the public distribution system, the government must find alternative ways of releasing grain into the economy. This will not help in bringing down prices of pulses or edible oils  these are commodities with limited supplies. But the government can surely find ways of bringing down foodgrain prices.              
	Clearly, there are areas and problems which need urgent attention. But, the bottom line is that the Indian economy is poised to follow close to a double- digit growth path. Manmohan Singh and his economics team can take considerable pride in how ably they have steered the economy through some very troubled times.

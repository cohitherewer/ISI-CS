Datta-Ray                        Lonely battle				                                             
	Having rescued Orissas 10,000 or so Dongria Kondh tribals from the Vedanta Alumina companys rapacity, Rahul Gandhi must now also help them to manage change. Otherwise, his operation might turn out to be a hollow victory, to borrow General Smutss famous comment when great-grand-aunt Vijayalakshmi Pandit sought his blessings (as Mahatma Gandhi had instructed her to do) before launching Indias United Nations campaign against South African racism. You will win, my daughter, Smuts replied, but it will be a hollow victory.        
	Taking a long-term view of history, India must seek ways of reconciling the traditions and practices of people like the Dongria Kondh who worship the Niyamgiri hill, where their god, Niyamraja, lives, with the needs of modernization. Unless this gulf between New Delhi and Jangalmahal is slowly narrowed, land grabbers and metal seekers abetted by ruling parties will continue to drive coach and horses through well-meaning laws like the Forests Right Act, Forest Conservation Act, Environment Protection Act and Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act. Bureaucrats and policemen at the beck and call of politicians, who are hand in glove with businessmen, will denounce, arrest, beat up and sometimes eliminate local leaders who dare to stand up for community rights. They used to be hunted down as Naxalites in Bihar. In Orissa, Niyamgiri Suraksha Parishad leaders like Lada Sikaka Majhi, Kumti Majhi and the probable victim of extra-judicial execution, Adasi Majhi, are branded Maoists.        
	But their protest and Rahul Gandhis intervention suggest that India can still hope to avoid the destructive violence of Australias encounter with its indigenes. I recall a journey in Northern Territory in search of an aborigine called Yorkie Bill when a uranium company official, white of course, burst out, No sooner do we find uranium somewhere but that damned Yorkie Bill declares it a dreaming site! (Dreaming in aboriginal lore is the sacred era when ancestral totemic spirits formed the Creation). White Australians awakened conscience was beginning then to make some amends to the victims of centuries of ruthless exploitation, even to recognizing aboriginal land rights and place names like Uluru for Ayres Rock.        
	India can spare herself the anguish of that confrontation by co-opting her tribes  some nine per cent of the population  in the great adventure of modernization. The vision, skill and sensitivity the task calls for is beyond the grasp of flash-in-the-pan operators like Mayavati or Mamata Banerjee whose populist antics at Singur and Nandigram have set back by decades the recovery of a state that the Marxists condemned to stagnation. What West Bengal should also remember is that she forced Manmohan Singhs first government to abandon the land acquisition (amendment) and resettlement and rehabilitation bills after tabling them in the Lok Sabha in January 2009. Though the two bills are about to be revived, Pranab Mukherjee despairs of West Bengals plight if a woman whose obstinate but calculating ignorance will not allow land to be acquired even to build roads ever becomes chief minister.        
	The bigger overall challenge is how to guarantee his birthright to Indias version of Rousseaus Noble Savage without depriving his sons and grandsons of the opportunities they seek in an evolving urban industrialized society. Experience shows that artificial protection only exposes innocence to predators prowling on the edges of protected homelands, waiting to pounce. The challenge is not new. Neither is failure. The inner line regulation of 1873 and Verrier Elwins A Philosophy for NEFA, which Jawaharlal Nehru endorsed, have failed to insulate the Northeast against exploitation. Traders and contractors from faraway Punjab and Haryana flourish behind the shield of a token Naga, Mizo or Metei partner. Equally ingenious hordes of illegal Bangladeshis threaten the Indian States integrity in Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura.        
	Though large areas of Bihar, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh were similarly protected, Ranchis Tribal Research Institute has produced many depressing accounts of the degradation of tribal life, alienation of tribal land and devastation caused by alcohol and moneylenders. The contractor who pays the most to the ruling politicians of the day gains unlimited right to plunder supposedly protected forest wealth and turn free hunters and gatherers into pitiable wage slaves. Nothing could be farther removed from the public purpose for which the law sanctions land acquisition; yet public purpose is a valid aim that justly calls for adjustment and accommodation. Wise statesmanship lies in ensuring that this reconciliation of interests inflicts the least pain on the weaker partner.        
	The Chipko movement, which achieved laudable success in saving forests in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere, also exposed a sharp contradiction that Rahul Gandhi might care to study. Sunderlal Bahuguna, the idealistic septuagenarian environmentalist, was isolated as he fought a lonely battle in the courts and outside against the 2,400-megawatt Tehri Dam in Uttarakhand. Even the locals whose homes were doomed to submersion deserted him because they wanted abundant irrigation water, relief from regular flash floods, a steady flow of electricity as the key to modernization, and the jobs that industry alone generates. Their complaints against the government were overcompensation, alternative accommodation and jobs. The moral is that in the short term, companies like Vedanta must be prevented from despoiling the countryside and destroying established lifestyles. In the long term, which is Rahuls remit, India must find ways of satisfying the tribes own aspiration for a better standard of living and the comforts and amenities of modernization. That means houses, schools, hospitals, roads and opportunities for agreeable employment. There is no other antidote to adivasis flocking to rebel standards.        
	South Africas transformation into a rainbow democracy demonstrated that Smutss hollow victory limited only the immediate future. Mahatma Gandhis campaign, Vijayalakshmi Pandits UN initiative and Nelson Mandelas sacrifices not only succeeded in bringing about change but  what is more important  ensured the transition was harmonious. Some of the friction in India may be necessary to stop further plunder, but irresponsible vote-seekers do not help the poor by blocking road construction, withholding land earmarked for factories, or halting multi-purpose projects.        
	Of course, there is no general rule. Each case must be judged on its merits. But the expert committee of educationists who recommended a review of the 2,000-megawatt Lower Subansiri Hydro Power project in Assam could set a precedent for continuous appraisal. Though it, too, has been criticized, the so-called Sterlite model for rehabilitation might provide a partial answer to the neglected needs of the dispossessed and displaced. Projects like Shanghais Pudong or the Three Gorges Dam, between them displacing at least a couple of million Chinese, would be unthinkable here. Yet, with 60 per cent of the population said to survive on Rs 20 a day, India cannot afford to ignore the compulsions of productivity. Modernization with a human face is not an impossibility for a young man not in a hurry.              
	Its a sad truth that there is no reverse movement in time. Visiting an American Navaho reservation once, I asked the leader about his tribes future. You see Western movies? he retorted. Its always the cowboys that win! But casinos have since brought new prosperity to some reservations, and the hope is that Native Americans might learn to use this wealth to preserve the best in their tribal ethos while also assimilating with general American life. With its tribal areas so rich in forest, wildlife and mineral wealth, that is also the best India can work for. Whenever you need me, I will be there for you, Rahul Gandhi promised Kalahandi tribals.        
	Now is the time, before romanticism cripples growth or greed destroys lifestyles. As their sipahi in Delhi, the best service he can render them and the nation is to set about managing change so that those whom time has passed by, who are geographically isolated or live outside the cultural mainstream are also involved in building a new India that respects the heritage of all its communities.

	How important are international institutions? Judging by the euphoria generated by President Barack Obamas endorsement of Indias bid to be a permanent member of the United Nations security council, the answer, at least as far as Indians are concerned, would seem to be obvious. Everything else seemed to pale into insignificance as far as Indian interests were concerned.        
	It is but natural that international agencies and institutions will acquire far more importance in todays globalized world. However, the actual performance of several international organizations leaves much to be desired. An obvious example is the UN itself. It has been powerless to prevent flagrant breaches of international laws in innumerable cases. Neither has it been able to bring warring countries to the negotiation table. The UN has been a dismal failure both as a global policeman and as an international arbiter. It has deservedly been labelled a glorified debating society.        
	The recent track record of international economic institutions has been more mixed. The G-20 group of countries (which together controls 80 per cent of the worlds output), the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank were required to play a very proactive role during the recent global meltdown. These institutions successfully persuaded governments of individual countries of the need to find a collective solution instead of pursuing myopic policies such as raising protective barriers that would have surely spelt doom for all countries. They were definitely instrumental in ensuring that there was no prolonged meltdown  most countries have come out of the slump far earlier than would have been the case if these institutions did not exist.               
	More recently, the ECB and the IMF have saved the Greek economy from collapsing. And as I write this, ECB officials are trying to construct a bailout package for the Irish economy. The ECB has also promised to come to the rescue of other vulnerable European economies. There is little doubt that these economies would have collapsed but for the initiatives taken by the ECB-IMF combination. Moreover, their collapse may well have had a domino effect on other countries.        
	Perhaps of even greater significance are the fledgling attempts to formulate an effective international financial regulatory mechanism. It is now more or less universally recognized that the root cause of the last global meltdown was the proclivity of the global banking industry to advance very risky loans. The only way to curb this dangerous practice was for all the major countries to act together. If only a few countries had attempted to rein in the banks, then capital would have flown out of these countries to the banking systems of countries which did not place such restrictions on the banking sector. Fortunately, better sense has prevailed. Successive meetings of the G-20 countries have helped to establish norms which will ensure that banks are more prudent in their lending decisions.         
	The next regulatory step is likely to be directed against very large financial enterprises. If these enterprises believe that the national government will ultimately bail them out because they are too big to fall, then they too will take unduly large risks in the belief that the national government is always there to help them out. There are signs that there will soon be in place a set of regulations (to be adopted by all major countries) that will incorporate a package of protective measures directed against these large enterprises.        
	Unfortunately, these successes need to be balanced against some failures, all of them of very far-ranging significance. These range from the virtual failure of the international agencies to formulate an agreement on steps to prevent global warming, the collapse of the Doha talks to bring about some order to the system of international trade, to correcting the global imbalances in international trade which threaten to culminate in currency wars and a fresh round of protectionism.        
	The latter must have been the most important item in the agenda of the G-20 country leaders when they met in Seoul in November. For several years now, a major engine of growth for the Chinese economy has been its export sector  Chinese exports have flooded Western markets. In contrast, Chinese imports have been relatively small in volume. This has resulted in huge current account surpluses. Of course, the flip side of the coin is that other countries  most notably the United States of America  have run up equally large trade deficits.         
	Since several Western economies continue to be in the doldrums, they too want to be able to increase their exports so as to generate additional employment in their countries. But they contend that one of the biggest international markets  the Chinese one  has been effectively closed to them because the Chinese government has pegged the value of the renminbi to an artificially low level. While this means that Chinese goods are relatively cheap in world markets, it also results in foreign goods being priced too high in the Chinese domestic market. Frequent pleas to the Chinese government to set the value of the renminbi at more reasonable levels have been ignored. Instead, the Chinese and German governments (who too run a large surplus in their current account) have in turn accused the US government of effectively trying to devalue the US dollar by implementing the large fiscal stimulus plan.              
	This situation is not sustainable for very much longer and so all neutral observers had hoped that the G-20 summit meeting would produce a feasible solution. Unfortunately, none of the countries involved in the dispute were willing to make reasonable concessions and so the Seoul meeting must be labelled a complete failure.        
	So, the lessons seem fairly straightforward. When we are in the midst of a crisis  if a fire is raging  all countries realize the importance of firefighters. This enables international agencies to adopt appropriate corrective measures because all countries can either be persuaded or coerced into cooperation. Protective measures to prevent future crises are also relatively easy to adopt when we have just come out of a crisis. However, the prevention of future fires seems far more difficult when a small number of countries need to effect large changes (as in the case of Chinas trade surplus) or when the fire is unlikely to break out in the immediate future. The latter seems to explain the failure to find a cooperative solution to the problem of global warming. Unfortunately, these tendencies will ensure that international institutions become toothless tigers or mere debating societies.

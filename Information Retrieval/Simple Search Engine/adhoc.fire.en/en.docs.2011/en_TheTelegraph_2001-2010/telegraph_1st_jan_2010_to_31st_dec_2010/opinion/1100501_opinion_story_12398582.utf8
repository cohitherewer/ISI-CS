The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the promise of peace
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE PROMISE OF PEACE                                                          
	It was a fairy-tale setting. Not because the location was Thimphu, the picturesque capital of Bhutan, but because it marked the meeting of two prime ministers  one eager to walk the extra mile for peace and another for whom peace is fast becoming an imperative. Location and priorities made it perfect. The meeting on Thursday between Manmohan Singh and Yousaf Raza Gilani, the prime minister of Pakistan, could well turn out to be a landmark date for the history of the region. It would be no exaggeration to suggest that never in the fraught history of India and Pakistan have the prime ministers of the two countries met with greater goodwill towards each other and a greater desire to establish peace. The most apparent expression of the new bonhomie and trust is the unqualified decision to go ahead with talks irrespective of other noises and past grievances. To talk, both the leaders felt, was better than to sulk.        
	The Indian prime ministers intentions so far as Pakistan is concerned have been clear since he spoke in Sharm el-Sheikh. What he said there had not made him very popular with either the foreign office establishment or self-styled pundits of Indias foreign policy. In Thimphu, Mr Singh demonstrated that he has not moved an inch from his declared position. He wants to establish peace and normalcy with Pakistan. This desire is informed by a vision; it is also influenced by the demands of practical politics. Mr Singh wants India, as the largest and most powerful country in South Asia and the only country from the region that has been invited to sit at the global high table, to take the lead to establish peace. He sees this as Indias historic destiny, which India should not deny because of petty considerations. This is his vision of India and its role in world affairs. Mr Singh is the only Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to think on this scale and at this philosophical level. This vision is, however, grounded in reality. Indias progress and prosperity are tied to peace in the region. Mr Singh knows that even the short-term goals of a higher level of economic growth and incremental social and administrative reforms are unattainable if his and his governments attention is every so often diverted by the threat of violence originating in Pakistan.        
	Pakistan is a country torn asunder by violence. There is no absence of goodwill towards India within Pakistan society. Mr Gilanis gestures can only be interpreted as attempts to bring the Pakistan State in line with the priorities of its society. The State in Pakistan cannot be driven or held at ransom by some rogue elements within and without it. Mr Gilani has his own internal battles. He can be helped in those battles if he can improve Pakistans relationship with India. Through different and circuitous routes the aims of the two prime ministers converge. The beginning is fairy-tale like and in the beginning may lie the end.

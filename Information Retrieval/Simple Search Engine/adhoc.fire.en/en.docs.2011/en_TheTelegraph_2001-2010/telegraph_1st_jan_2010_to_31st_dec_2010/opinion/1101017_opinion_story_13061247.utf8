                              Cold reception        
	 Way back in 1963, while performing Blowin in the wind, Bob Dylan crooned the following lines: How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man? Forty-seven years later, some Bharatiya Janata Party leaders can be heard humming these lines  albeit with a twist  while reflecting on Uma Bhartis fate. After the recent Ayodhya verdict, a beaming Bharti had hoped that she would soon be allowed to return to the party. But it seems that BJP leaders, who are busy celebrating the verdict, have forgotten about Bharti. But Bharti herself has not forgotten the fact that all it took Jaswant Singh to stage a comeback in the saffron ranks was a plane ride with Advani. Since her expulsion, Bharti has flown with Advani thrice  to Joshimath, Raipur and to Somnath  only to find that the partys doors continue to remain firmly shut. The word in the BJP camp is that though a number of leaders want Bharti back, some netas in Madhya Pradesh, especially the chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, continue to foil her reinstatement. The delay, apparently, has made BJPwallahs hum, How many times must Uma travel with Advani before she returns to the BJP? Does Bharti find the remixed version a little out of tune?                              
	 The successful completion of the Commonwealth Games has pleased the prime minister as well as the Congress president. Two others who cannot hide their smiles are Sheila Dikshit and Suresh Kalmadi. With Dikshits performance drawing praise from all quarters, her followers are clamouring for a suitable reward for their boss  a stint in the home, defence or external affairs ministry. Kalmadis supporters have set their sights even higher: no less than a Padma Vibhushan award will do for them. All talk of punishment and accountability for the mess before the Games seems to have been given a decent burial, at least for now.                            
	 The Doon School, regarded as the cradle of governance in India, is celebrating its platinum jubilee. Twenty-five years back, Rajiv Gandhi, the then PM, was the chief guest, and many of Doons former students are hoping that Manmohan Singh will light the lamp in Dehradun, even though he is not a member of the alumni. The word is that in case the PM cannot make it, Kapil Sibal, the Union human resource development minister, will do the honours in Singhs place. There is no dearth of ministers in United Progressive Alliance government who hail from this august institution. Little wonder then that Kamal Nath had once boasted, the DNA of Doon is Congress. The shared roots also mean that on some occasions, the Doon connection is prioritized over party preferences. For instance, when Jairam Ramesh was a junior minister in the commerce industry, Naveen Patnaik, the CM of Orissa, often sidelined him, preferring to deal with his old school chum, Roly, who is better known as Kamal Nath. School friends are not always enemies in politics.                        
	 Ever since Maneka Gandhi announced that her son will be tying the knot, the news of Varuns impending nuptials has created a lot of interest in political circles. The BJP has already made plans to use the event to score political points against its opponents. Meanwhile, Varun, whose name was struck off from the campaigners list for the polls in Bihar, is working tirelessly to brighten the partys prospects in Assam. Varun, who has been put in charge of the northeastern state that will go to polls next year, is hoping that his hard work will reap political dividends for his party. In almost every public rally, BJP leaders have been heard seeking the blessings of Assams Bengali voters by saying that Varun is marrying a Bengali girl. It remains to be seen whether the people respond to this fervent plea.                            
	Things are far from hunky-dory between the Congress and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. When M Karunanidhi met the visiting Congress president recently, he tried his best to draw her attention to some family issues, but failed. The meeting was over in minutes, and Sonia Gandhi rushed to another venue where Karunanidhis daughter, Kanimozhi, was in attendance. Sonia, reportedly, isnt keen to meddle in the internal squabbles of the K clan. Karunanidhi must be hoping that the next meeting lasts longer.

	 The mud-slinging between Congress and TMC leaders continues in West Bengal, but it has done nothing to diminish Mamata Banerjees concern for Pranab Mukherjee. In fact, Didi has made it a habit to drop in late at Pranabdas house whenever she is in Delhi. Last week wasnt an exception either. Mukherjee was attending to some urgent work before leaving for Washington when Didi marched in, advised him to call it a day for the sake of his health, gifted him a CD of Rabindrasangeet, and then started to sing in Bengali in the hope that it will have a therapeutic effect on Mukherjees blood pressure. This continued for almost two hours, during which Mukherjee apparently sat holding his head in his hands. After Didis departure, Mukherjee stayed up all night, finished his work and then caught his flight.

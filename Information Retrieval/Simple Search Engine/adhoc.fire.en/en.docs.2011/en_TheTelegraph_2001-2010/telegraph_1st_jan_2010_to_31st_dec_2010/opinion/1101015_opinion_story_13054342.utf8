	In the essay, Temple Terracottas of Bengal, published in the Illustrated Weekly of India (November 25, 1951), the artist, Mukul Dey (18951989), writes, Thousands of Siva, Vaishnava and Kali temples are scattered all over Birbhum. They are built of brick, sand and lime plaster.... Most of these temples lie in ruins. But in many of them still remain beautiful specimens of baked clay terracottas depicting figure compositions in decorative panels.        
	A student of Santiniketan during Rabindranaths days, Dey was one of the earliest documenters of Birbhums temple architecture, much of which is still unknown. Dey took photographs of the temples he visited. Since many of the temples no longer stand, these pictures are the sole reminders of an architecture that was becoming derelict even in Deys time. It is good to know that the Santiniketan Chapter of the Indian National Trust For Art and Cultural Heritage has taken up the task of documenting the archeological sites of Birbhum. MONUMENTS AROUND SANTINIKETAN (Shubhi, Rs 995), edited by Pialee Mukherjee, gives a cursory glimpse of some of the sites documented between 2001 and 2004. The short write-ups accompanying the colour and black-and-white plates give readers a fair idea of the legends associated with the sites, as well as of their historical importance.         
	Part one of the book, entitled Santiniketan: Abode of the Poet, is about the buildings in Santiniketan that carry the imprimatur of Rabindranaths vision. Top right is Shyamali, that stands beside the Konarka at the far end of the Uttarayana complex. This house, on which Rabindranath had composed a poem, was one of his favourites. It is unique in its mud walls, its faade reminiscent of Buddhist chaityas, and the reliefs, three of which were made by Ramkinkar Baij.        
	Top left is the Gauranga Mahaprabhu temple in Hattala, Illambazar. The 24 columns and the octagonal roof give the temple an unusual appearance. The outer wall of the temple is decorated with terracotta plaques depicting scenes from the Ramayan and Krishna lila. The panel on bottom left, featuring long-robed Arabian Muslims and European Christians wearing high hats, is from the Hatakali temple in Itanda.         
	Bottom middle is the famous black stone Durga of Deuli. In 1560, Kalapahar, the Hindu general of Sultan Suleman Karnani, had broken the nose of the figure and demolished the temple, which was later reconstructed. On bottom right are two of the four Char temples of Panchra that have white and black Shiva lingas.         
	While Intach should be lauded for its efforts to document, and so, in a way, preserve the sites, it could have paid better attention to the design of this book. Most of the pictures are of poor quality, and have been cropped badly. Notwithstanding space constraints, photographs placed side-by-side that eat into each others space cannot quite add to a books aesthetic appeal.

	Mumbai fables																														 By Gyan Prakash, 
  HarperCollins, Rs 599  
	In 1947, Saadat Manto left his beloved Bombay. Unable to cope with the communal tension in a fragmented nation, he relocated to Pakistan where he died in penury as a lonely alcoholic. Yearning for the city that gave him critical recognition, he wrote, I am walking, talking Bombay... I loved that city then and I love it today. Other progressive writers like Ismat Chughtai and Khwaja Ahmad Abbas refused to choose between religion and homeland, and remained in Bombay. They disentangled themselves from national politics, and contributed instead to Bombays journey into creative cosmopolitanism. Then why did the magical and mythic city, which offered a niche to people from different class and religious backgrounds, become torn apart by riots, bomb blasts and the rise of radical politics? Gyan Prakashs Mumbai Fables grapples with such questions by mapping a number of cultural transformations in the city  not through an epochal reading of urban history, but through narratives of love, loss and longing from below.   
	Prakash, a professor of history in Princeton University, was fascinated with Bombay since his childhood days in Patna. The boys from his neighbourhood sported glossy Dev Anand haircuts and cracked raucous Ajit jokes (Robert, usko Hamlet-wala poison de do, to be se not to be ho jayga). In his imagination, Bombay was a city of film, music, beauty, labour and vivid fantasies of success. Prakashs extra- academic curiosities (he wrote a script for Anurag Kashyaps much-awaited film, Bombay Velvet) eventually steered him towards modern Mumbai. While spending time in the city, Prakash wondered about the tenability of Mumbais mischievously avant-garde spirit. He grew interested in the murky secrets that lurked in the shadows of commercial progress in a contemporary metropolis: With these thoughts in my head, I hit the streets of Mumbai. The intimate life that Prakash encountered in urban legends, in yellowed archival records, in musty official documents, in reels of faded film and in poetic and political commentaries on the city remains captured in the nine chapters of Mumbai Fables.         
	The author starts out by shedding light on the citys past. He initiates the reader to the history of Portuguese conquests in the 16th century. The fleets that violently annexed seven beautiful islands (which later formed the city of Bombay) called their newly acquired possession a ilha da boa vida or the island of good life. The well-charted European maritime route to the western shores of India also attracted East India Company traders who swiftly set up shop in Surat. In the 17th century, Bombay was acquired by the English as a wedding dowry, and the Crown leased it to the Company as a city port. The author argues that the centuries of European domination were a period of forced conversion and coerced labour. But it was also a time of opportunity for the citys small merchants, and the wealth amassed by them consequently enabled Bombay to emerge as a shining, swinging city. For example, opium dealings with China thrived under Company rule and Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, who started out as an orphaned apprentice in his uncles shop in Bombay, established himself as the king of the opium trade. Yet, few people in contemporary Bombay know that the famous J.J. College of Arts and the J.J. Hospital, seats of artistic and medical acclaim, have been built on the foundation of drug-trafficking during the colonial era.         
	In the following chapters, Prakash exposes further how Bombay (renamed Mumbai), a place of endless opportunity and aspiration, had layers of ugly, urban experiences irreparably etched on its landscape. For example, in Mumbais elegant architecture, Prakash finds a design vocabulary juxtaposed with mindless capitalism. The Art-Deco-style buildings on Marine Drive exuded the aura of wealth and sophistication, yet they stood on the foundations of illegal reclamation, evictions and corruption. He recounts the Nanavati murder trial, and how sensational reporting in the tabloid, Blitz, whipped up public passions, to the extent that a swanky, high-ranking naval commander went free after shooting his wifes lover. Prakash also traces the transformation of a red city, marked by trade-union activism, into a saffron city, hounded by fanatical Shiv Sena goons. The most captivating chapter in the book, however, is about the growing popularity of Doga, a crime-fighting, comic-book hero, whose disillusionment with apathetic policemen and political leaders inspired him to become a saviour on the streets of Mumbai. Each chapter addresses timid or tumultuous turning points in Bombays cultural history which are viewed through the prism of texts, ideas and voices. In the authors words, The fables of the city can be unravelled to reveal how they came to be.        
	Prakashs monographs, especially Bonded Histories: Genealogies of Labour Servitude in Colonial India (1990), not only established him as a subaltern scholar, but also advocated a fragmentary, non-linear approach to history. Mumbai Fables remains true to this methodology. It follows a multiplicity of narratives  cinematic, literary, architectural, artistic, apocryphal. And this filters through to the reader as myriad imaginings of inclusivity and otherness in the city. It would have been valuable, however, if the author informed the reader why he chose some representations of the city over others. The main scope of the book lies in its eloquent movement between a narrative of hope and belonging and a counter-narrative of destruction and displacement. Prakashs style of writing is almost novelistic which makes the book lucid and absorbing to read.         
	Each tale, however, is peppered with the authors assertion that he will tell us how a city can be expressed as society: Mumbais experience of the modern city as society lay bare the history of the city as society wedded to his imagination of the city as society living imagination of the city as modern society... etc. This repeated emphasis on as lulls the reader into a hope that the storyteller will end with an explanation, perhaps a non-theoretical one, about the city as society, which he seems to evade. Having said that, Prakash wraps up his commentary on a charming note. The tapestry of contradictory and capacious desires in Bombay made the city of his childhood dreams more compelling than ever before.                    ATREYEE SEN

	The alternate nation of Abanindranath Tagore
  By Debashish Banerji,   Sage, Rs 995
    
	The luminous clarity of Abanindranath Tagores writing leaves one unprepared for the almost impenetrable theoretical complexification in a discussion of his place in art history. Certainly, Debashish Banerjis task is not simple. He goes against the traditional perception of the artist Abanindranath as committed to the deliberate creation of a nationalist art, proposing in its stead the figure of an artist mining past paintings and literature for techniques and subjects to create an art that would reflect his nuanced consciousness of the colonial encounter.   
	Abanindranath himself makes the job tricky. With his natural modesty, limpid tales, whimsical mischief, he resists the excavation of the depth and range of his erudition as well as glimpses into the degree of his self-consciousness as an artist. His intellectual richness is elusive; he discusses Bengals bratas with the same pristine elegance with which he writes on art and aesthetics. The gentle humour of his reminiscences would persuade anyone that everything in his life was accidental, just a result of happy circumstances, the stimulus offered by a bustling, creative family, and the encouragement and affection of unusual persons, the chief of these being his uncle, Rabindranath. To detach him from his self-projection and the hypnotic luminosity of his writing in order to bring to light [the] otherwise concealed dimension of an alternate cultural nationalism as Banerji attempts to do is no doubt a weighty project.        
	But the complete lack of felicity in Banerjis writing, heralded by the books title, The Alternate Nation of Abanindranath Tagore, merely adds to the weight. Banerji is anxious to place Abanindranath within the complicated dynamics of the colonial cross-cultural encounter that breeds both resistance and mutual transformation. His project is to correct the pigeon-holing of Abanindranaths art as part of the elitist creation of a modern cultural identity by uncovering and explaining the artists choice of popular forms that, Partha Mitter says in the Foreword, amounted to no less than a communitarian critique of modernity.         
	Banerjis point of theoretical departure is subaltern studies, and his villain the modernity that subaltern history sees as having suppressed the social revolution, which should have followed the political one. In his anxiety, Banerji litters his text with names and strange expressions; while art historians are occasionally referenced (word Banerjis), especially R. Siva Kumar, whose presence is felt even on the jacket, Partha Chatterjee, Dipesh Chakrabarty, Homi Bhabha, Sudipta Kaviraj, Pierre Bourdieu, Habermas, Foucault, Bakhtin, Gadamer, Derrida, all jostle for space among the dense foliage of Victor Turners communitas and liminality, dizzying uses of the word, communitarian, verbal tics such as habitus, multivocality, intersubjectivity, dialogic, and sentences such as the following: Addressing the subject of modernity, Abanindranath now sought to give expression to an ontological transcendence of this sense of passing through the use of cultural resources available to the national habitus as also homologously present to other cultural space-times arriving as new histories of belonging into the nation, region and home (p. 42). The last is about the development of the artists technique of wash.         
	Banerjis information is diverse, tying together familial, regional, national, Asian and Western strands of culture, politics, philosophy and history in the effort to place Abanindranath in a shifting, intersubjective context. He discusses each direction and each personality he considers relevant to the artists career, whether it is Vaishnavism, Jorasanko flanerie, Pre-Raphaelitism, Orientalism and so on as well as E.B. Havell, Rabindranath, Okakura and Gyanadanandini. Most relevant is his study of Abanindranaths interest in forms such as the kirtan, jatra, brata, and their role in his art, as well as his analysis of the costumes and postures in the paintings, demonstrating the variety of faiths, crafts and livelihoods in the artists imagined worlds. These represent, according to Banerji, part of the communitarian undercutting of the elite nationalist project.         
	Is it unfair to expect art history not to let us forget the art  or our sense of the artist? For an artist as exploratory and inward as Abanindranath, the touch of theory must be feather-light. Some of Banerjis insights do make sense of both art and artist, but his anxiety to make his point is stifling, as when he discusses the artists use of the Persian/Urdu nastaliq calligraphy to write Sanskrit or Bengali verses in the Bengali script in his Krishna Lila paintings.         
	Again, in his analysis of the medal-winning Last days of Shah Jahan in the context of the Delhi Durbar exhibition in 1903, one misses the artists own comment that he had poured into it his grief for his recently dead child. Maybe he had supplied the bhav or feeling that he had missed in the exquisitely painted crane he had once studied through Havells magnifying glass.         
	Banerji, an art historian who teaches in the US, is the artists great-grandson. Is that why he freely changes kutum katam, the artists own name for his tiny works of art, into katum kutum, and calls it relatives-in-wood?                          BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

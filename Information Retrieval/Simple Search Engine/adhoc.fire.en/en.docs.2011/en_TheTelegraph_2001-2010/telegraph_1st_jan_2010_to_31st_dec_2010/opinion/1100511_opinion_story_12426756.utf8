The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A war for peace and progress
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A WAR FOR PEACE AND PROGRESS                              As none can go on playing politics with the lives of the poor, Maoists need to re-evaluate their philosophy and strategy, writes Shyamal Datta                                                
	As the spokesperson of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), a person called Azad responded to a set of questions that the organization had received from the media. The questions focused on the Maoists seriousness of intent regarding talking to the government of India. The clarity of Azads answers gives an insight into the thinking of the radical outfit.        
	Azad asserted that the offer of talks given by Kishanji to the Union home minister should be viewed positively. However, he was quick to mention that there was no formal discussion on the subject in the central committee of the party. He took the opportunity to reiterate that the ban on the Maoists and their front organizations should be lifted to create a congenial environment for the talks, making them more transparent and meaningful. Earlier, the Maoist leader, Ganapati, pressed for the release of leaders illegally detained so that they could take part in the dialogue. For the talks to materialize, there has to be simultaneous cessation of hostilities from both sides, the spokesman added.        
	Azad clarified that the offer of talks had no underlying design of buying time to reorganize the party. Neither was it a ploy to undertake a re-evaluation of the strategy to go overground and take part in the electoral process and multi-party contest as in Nepal. The talks are actually meant to assert the rights of the people guaranteed under the Constitution. They would bring pressure on the government to implement the limited and nominal affirmative and inclusive provisions. This would, in turn, expose the governments hypocrisy and duplicity, raise the peoples level of consciousness and enhance their resolve to continue the struggle, while the Red Guards would get some respite from the repression and oppression of the State.              
	Azad made it clear that the talks would in no way dilute the revolutionary objective of the party. There was no question of any compromise on the partys political programme of New Democratic Revolution and the strategy of protracted peoples war. The party would involve only the leaders released from illegal detention in the dialogue process.        
	The press statement issued after the merger of the Peoples War Group and the Maoist Communist Centre into the CPI(Maoist) in September, 2004 had stated that the revolution will be carried out and implemented through an armed agrarian revolutionary war, i.e, protracted peoples war for the seizure of power as its principal and central task....directed against imperialism, feudalism, dangerous Hindu fascist forces and comprador bureaucratic capitalism. The party will also support the struggle for the right to self-determination, including the right to secession. The last smacks of the ulterior design to secede from the body politic once the peoples war paves the way for a new democratic revolutionary government.        
	The over-ambitious Maoist plan of action shows a lack of understanding of the complex Indian reality in a changed international situation which saw the end of the Cold War without shedding any blood. Symbolically, the fall of the Berlin Wall marks an eclipse of communism. The success of the West, its economic prosperity, freedom and military might raised questions about the desirability of communism as it failed to match the progress of the West. Communism survived for more than 70 years in the Soviet Union, but left the people seriously disillusioned.        
	What exists in Russia and China after the Cold War is party autocracy and authoritarian regimes. Both countries are trying to be economically successful capitalist powers under a totalitarian system. Today, the two countries, by integrating with market economy and globalization, have become more liberal and democratic than they have ever been.        
	The communists in India learnt nothing from their comrades. They remained cocooned in dogma.While China provided factory employment on a massive scale to lessen poverty, the Marxist-led government in West Bengal stopped teaching English at the primary level for over a decade, making at least one generation ill-equipped to share in globalization. The militancy in the labour sector also continued to drive away capital and industries from the state.        
	The Leninist and Maoist movement that started in West Bengal for the first time in India as the peasants uprising of Naxalbari in the late 1960s died prematurely as it failed to cope with the pressure of political and security offensives under Congress rule. The movement indirectly helped the Left Front come to po-wer. It is an irony that the peoples government spearheaded by the Marxists failed to address the problems of the poorest of the poor in the tribal belt of the state during its unprecedentedly long tenure. It yielded space to the Maoists to revive the armed revolutionary movement in the districts of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia.        
	It is never too late in the life of a party or state to assess its shortcomings to take corrective measures. Such conduct shows political acumen and maturity. In keeping with this, the CPI (Maoist) will do well to be more circumspect, and stop continuing under the impression that the government of India has the watch while it has time on its side to remain engaged in the struggle. The party has to appreciate that in reality, none has the time to continue playing politics with the lives of the poor.        
	It is most unfortunate that Dantewada has put the clock back. The gruesome killings of so many jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force and the state police have hardened positions on both sides. The Union home minister has said that any mention of talks at this juncture would amount to a mockery. According to the hardliners, negotiation without crushing the Maoists will mean abject surrender and an act of appeasement. It would also seriously undermine the counter-insurgency operations and demoralize the security forces. Under the circumstances, what looms large is the dire prospect of armed confrontations in the coming months.        
	Under authoritarian rule, it is the hard power that does the talking when faced with dissent. It is more so when such a political process emerges out of communism and the totalitarian mindset. It is exemplified by the ruthless manner in which social strife, civil unrest and militancy were dealt with by China and Russia in Xinjiang and Georgia respectively, and so on. Had insurgency of the kind at Dantewada taken place in either of the two countries, it would have been put down with the brute force. The problems would have been settled on terms that suited the government.              
	Democracy is different. It provides an ideal framework for debate and dialogue. In todays complex situation, our democracy should guide both the CPI(Maoist) leadership and the government to mull over the revelations made through the questionnaire and make a beginning in a process of reconciliation.         
	In a mission like this, the nation will rally behind both the CPI(Maoist) and the government and help the two create a history of sorts. The Maoists need to agree to join the democratic forces to find a lasting solution to the vexed problem. They will find the government more than willing to reciprocate and go several extra miles. Trust has to grow between the two for the guns to fall silent. Talks and war cannot continue concurrently. With this might ensue a real war for peace and progress in place of the protracted peoples war that entails a huge loss of human lives, the destruction of social assets and devastation in the lives of the poor and downtrodden. Our salvation lies in greater wisdom and the political sagacity to stop the mayhem once and for all, and in following the flicker of hope that might be visible at the end of the tunnel opened up by the medias questionnaire.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In search of the signature style
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN SEARCH OF THE SIGNATURE STYLE                              Visual Arts      Bhaswati Chakravorty                                                      
	Why is an art exhibition held? There may be many reasons, but it would have seemed that the Chitrakoot Art Gallery had a laudable one in mind (Jamini Roy: A Painters Journey, till April 11). The invitation card said, An Exhibition [sic] highlighting the stylistic changes that Jamini Roy passed through before reaching his signature style. Passed through, at least in this case, suggested a well-documented journey moving towards a signature style. The phrase did not prepare one for the sight of a little over thirty paintings hung up in any old order along the walls of one main room and of its entrance chamber, the latter space cluttered with what appeared to be a counter crowded with sculptured objects, casts and solid shapes of various kinds.         
	There is no catalogue, and no titles or dates attached to the paintings, no indication of their provenance, nothing at all except little printed number tags, indicating the order in which they were hung up. That too is mysterious. Numbers 33 and 34, for example, are the furthest apart possible in that space. Given the complete lack of any indicators  not even a background note  the gallery seems to be making an unreasonable demand on the trust of the viewers. Especially since some of the paintings do not have a discernible signature. Alternatively, the gallery is not concerned about the viewer; it is enough that the paintings have been put up. It is apparently not the exhibitors job to make the exhibition meaningful, or illuminating, or even enjoyable, as though the value of art resides in other things, things that the common or garden art-lover has no idea of.        
	What is startling about the paintings is the beauty of the oils showing the influence of Impressionist and post-Impressionist painters that contrasts with the almost amateurish insecurity of some of the water-colours where the presumably young artist attempted Oriental subjects. The oil of a man ploughing the field with his bullocks is arresting in its colours and firm, stubby strokes, as is the painting of a straight road bordered with posts. The last contains its bright, almost contrasting, hues within black outlines, as if looking forward to the very different style that the artist will adopt. Czanne, sometimes a playful Seurat, Sargent and Rembrandt in the shadows of the portraits, van Gogh in the painting of a house tucked away below serried mountain ranges  the Western masters haunt Roys early paintings, if they are all early and if all of them are his. The large oil portraits hide the signature, and look very conventional, exactly like those that used to hang in our grandparents houses.         
	The large painting of a standing Eastern figure, suggestive of weak Bengal School, is somehow unsure of itself, as are the figures of posed women, one with a drop of water on a lotus leaf, one balancing a ceremonial plate. The faithful academic studies, such as that of a patterned vessel, or the large unsigned realistic sketch of mute geese, are competent and decorative. Only painting number 33, tucked away behind the door to the main room, shows the emergence of a strikingly different hand as it draws the outlines of a woman and her crawling child while she milks a cow looking back and down at her. The outlines overtake the patches of colour. It is the most intriguing painting, as if an artist is in the process of discovering his own characteristic touch. Perhaps. That is as far as this exhibition will allow us.

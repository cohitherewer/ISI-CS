	Afghanistan remains a picture of contradictions. Yet, a pattern seems to be emerging that is easily discernible. It all points to the growing confidence of Hamid Karzais government in manoeuvring the political game to its advantage. Mr Karzais renewed efforts to engage the Taliban in talks, this time with Nato backing, and his ready confession to receiving money from Iran to run his office, are both indicators of this. The Nato forces, led by the United States of America, have so far shied away from openly supporting Mr Karzais reconciliation drive with the Taliban. The admission of assistance in the talks process constitutes, therefore, a turnaround of sorts. The US is still maintaining its distance by insisting that it has recently made substantial military victories over the insurgents, and that it is serving merely as an escort party to partners at the table. But there cannot be doubts about a softening of stand, courtesy what is being perceived as General David Petraeuss military statesmanship. But Mr Karzais recent summoning of the peace council, which confirmed indigenous support for his reconciliation policy, coupled with the no objection from the international forces, undeniably projects him as a man who is more in control of the situation than he was earlier.         
	There are no clear answers to what prompted this change of scene in Afghanistan. The USs tepid support for Mr Karzais policy could be the result of a combination of factors  the evident futility of the military exercise; the USs last-ditch attempt to limit the involvement of the Talibans Haqqani faction, and thereby Pakistan, in the peace process; Mr Karzais success in building up a regional entente to counter the Wests monopoly over dictating Afghanistans political future. But what is certain is that the situation has worked to the unqualified advantage of the Afghan president, who now has no qualms in admitting to receiving money from foreign nations (Iran, a known US-detractor, in this case) in exchange for services. Mr Karzai no longer thinks twice about bracketing Iran and the US together, both of whom have come to him with money bags. He also minces no words in pointing out that since the time of George W. Bush, before whom he allegedly admitted to receiving Iranian money, the US has not moved any closer to or further away from Afghanistans power centre.

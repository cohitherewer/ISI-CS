                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Time to help                  
	Sir  It is distressing to read about the devastation caused by the earthquake in western China (Hundreds killed in China quake, April 15). The survivors will have to live with the pain of losing their loved ones and suffer the lack of hygiene, water and food. The remote location of the earthquake-hit Qinghai and the freezing temperature would make things more difficult for the victims. Although China seems equipped to handle the situation, the international community should lend a hand to help the victims.          
	Yours faithfully,         Mohammed Sadullah Khan, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 
        
	Strange obsessions          
	Sir  The editorial, Special focus, and K.P. Nayars piece, Spinning out of control, both published on the same day (April 14), deserve appreciation. Something is indeed wrong with Indias national psyche. We fail to see the world beyond Pakistan and have developed severe Pak-phobia, even though Pakistan is a much smaller country than ours. The main reason for this is Pakistans successful application of State-sponsored terrorism against a hapless India. Indias response to these assaults has been largely passive, owing to its ministers concerns over their vote banks. Its meekness has boosted Pakistans morale, and has demoralized the Indian people. As Nayar points out correctly, meetings on the sidelines between Indian and Pakistani leaders at every international conference have become the bane of Indo-Pak relations. This farcical practice must stop.          
	Indias habit of running to Washington to complain about Pakistan at the drop of a hat is ridiculous, and is a show of immaturity on Indias part. This attitude needs to be replaced by responsible behaviour that befits a growing world power  the image that India has tried to project for itself in recent times. What India needs are young and dynamic political leaders instead of the existing lot that is incapable of thinking out of the box.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Jayanta Dutt, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Indo-US ties appear to be caught in a pincer. After a difficult battle with the healthcare bill and with persistent unemployment plaguing America, it is obvious that Barack Obama is hard-pressed for a headway in his AfPak strategy. The United States of America considers India to be a soft nation that can be manipulated to suit its purpose. But the US can never be as sure about Pakistan, which is unpredictable and controlled by the all-pervasive army. Even Asif Ali Zardari is losing his pivotal role in active politics. Obamas job of balancing relations with India and Pakistan is hardly enviable. Most US presidents have faced the same dilemma. But, so far, the end result has rarely been favourable for India.          
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                          
	Parting shot          
	Sir  It has become a common practice with ministers to rename places after famous people. The railway minister started naming Metro stations in Calcutta after well-known personalities. Now, the shipping minister is reportedly keen to change Nimtala Ghat to Rabindra Ghat. This practice not only humiliates the eminent people whose names are being used, but also causes hazards for visitors and citizens. Calcuttans should protest against this drive.          
	Yours faithfully,         A. Khan, Calcutta

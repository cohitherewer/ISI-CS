	Q: I am aware that a registered company can make its employees work for eight hours per day. But there are many companies that make their employees work for 12 hours or more without overtime payments. Can they do this legally? What steps can I take to stop this exploitation at my workplace? Is there any authority to look into this?        
	Amrita Basu, Calcutta        
	A: Under existing labour enactments, weekly working hours should not exceed 48 hours and each shift is generally of eight hours duration. Hence, workers being made to work beyond that without being paid overtime is illegal. Usually, trade unions of workers take steps regarding disputes between them and the employers. You can put your complaint before the trade union of your company, and through it, file a complaint in the labour court.        
	Q: We are a registered resident welfare association (RWA). In 2009, it was decided to give a vacant space on rent to a member for use as a car park. The minutes of the meeting to the effect are posted on our website. Can an RWA legally rent out such a common space to members?        
	Himadri Sen, Calcutta        
	A: Common space or areas cannot be claimed for exclusive use by any person or association unless ownership of the area is established. Thus, to let out the space, the person or body claiming to be the exclusive licensor or landlord should have the title to it. However, if none of the flat owners or members of your association objects to the space being rented out, then there is no problem.        
	Q: I have given on rent a reserved car parking space in front of our building which has 16 flats. The tenant keeps his two-wheeler there. The flat owners association is objecting to this and wants the two-wheeler to be parked in a common area behind the building. Is the objection on the ground that it is not a car valid? If not, what should I do?        
	M.Y. Kutty, via email        
	A: A parking space allotted to you and being transferred to you by registered deed of conveyance means that you are its legal owner and entitled to use it to park your own vehicle or to let it out. It is implied that any light motor vehicle, which may not necessarily be a car, can be parked there. Hence, you could file a suit in the civil court for temporary and permanent injunction and get a restraining order against the flat owners association.

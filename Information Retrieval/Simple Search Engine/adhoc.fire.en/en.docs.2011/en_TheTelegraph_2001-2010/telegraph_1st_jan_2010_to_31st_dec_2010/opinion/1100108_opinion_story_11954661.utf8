	A nations search for identity may not begin and end in a written constitution. But a countrys constitution is meant to capture the collective wish of its people. The legal battle in Bangladesh to restore the word, secularism, in the constitution is only superficially a political issue; at stake is the bigger question of what kind of a nation-state it hopes to evolve into. At its birth as a new nation, Bangladesh aspired to be a secular, democratic republic. When the fifth amendment to the constitution dropped the word secularism, it reflected more the politics of the government of the day than the wishes of the people. Opponents of the new move to restore the word in the constitution now make the same complaint. The two main political parties in Bangladesh  the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party  agree on almost nothing. Worse, almost everything is given a partisan twist. But the countrys liberation war left no room for doubt that secular nationalism was its prime mover. The move to restore secularism in the constitution should thus be seen as an attempt to return to the spirit of both the original constitution and Bangladeshi nationalism.        
	More troublesome for the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, could be the move to ban religion-based parties. Her opponents would try to exploit the issue in order to recover lost ground. But Ms Wajeds massive victory in the last elections reflected a popular anger against parties and leaders who sought to ruin Bangladeshs secular polity. In a country where Muslims form nearly 90 per cent of the population, the majority religion cannot be in any real danger. To argue that a ban on religion-based parties poses a threat to Islam in Bangladesh is no more than familiar political rhetoric. Bangladeshis cannot be unaware that the making of a modern nation has much to do with the separation of State from religion. In fact, many of the countrys problems in recent years resulted from the way some political parties abused the peoples religious sentiments for narrow partisan gains. Some of these parties even sought to use religion to try and obliterate the nationalism that gave birth to the nation. The rise of religious fundamentalism and the resultant violence were also a direct outcome of religion-based politics. The return to secularism will not solve all of Bangladeshs problems, but it can better safeguard its fledgling democratic polity.

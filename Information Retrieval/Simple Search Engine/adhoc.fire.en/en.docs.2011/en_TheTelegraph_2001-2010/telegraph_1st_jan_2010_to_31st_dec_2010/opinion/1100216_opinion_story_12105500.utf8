                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THINK OF THE FUTURE                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The furore over the decision to stall the release of Bt brinjal has generated a sharp divide between Bharat and India. Newspaper headlines in English scream with anger, frustration, and sometimes desperation about having lost the first round to Bharat. Soon there will be condescending headlines about how the farmers are illiterate and uninformed about scientific progress. Multinational companies that deal in such products as Bt brinjal tend to lobby and influence those in power with all kinds of bits and bobs to win their undying allegiance. And, when the decision goes the other way, there is wild and uncontrollable anger reflected in some sections of the media, which are otherwise known to have clear positions on such interventions.        
	While the world is serious about going back to organic living, we are being bombarded with loud demands from a small group for an unnatural injection into our land that could well affect our children and grandchildren. Of course, there will be supporters of this group but just because they have the voice and power to hit the headlines does not necessarily mean that their contention is right. Why this overwhelming surprise and deep anger because Jairam Ramesh has decided to carry the research further before accepting the premise? Was someone promised something? Was it taken for granted that, as usual, the voice of the majority will go unheard in a democracy? Democracy is about the majority, for the majority, by the majority. It is time that both open debate and dissension are encouraged to ensure the death of arbitrary political and economic motivations.                
	Real message        
	Modelling India on the United States of America seems like a strange, short-term and untenable exercise. Europe, with its entrenched cultural roots and rich historical past, settled and comfortable in its many different skins, plural, diverse and federal, is far more suitable as a model for a changing India. Yet our leadership continues to treat Europe as second fiddle to the US, which is, in fact, a declining power. Why is the Indian leadership so behind the times? Why does India not learn the real message of American success  whatever you do must only be in the interest of the US and its people?        
	If the Indian government pledges to do only what is good for the Indian people in all their diversity, then it would not be unthinking to order a uniform code on anything except currency, defence and security, and foreign policy. Plurality is the formidable strength of this subcontinent. To destroy it, robotize it, kill its many personas, make it sterile and plastic, like the little boxes made of ticky-tacky that spell rootless culture, would be a criminal act. The real test and challenge is to create contemporary processes and mechanisms that will enhance those very strengths and fundamentals. This will ensure good governance which is rooted, and not an alien set of parameters superimposed on this energetic civilization that has been dumbed down by strange, unidentifiable, and facile operations.        
	Indians know, through their ancient, tried-and-tested oral tradition, who is doing what and why. Empirical evidence on such truths can never be forthright and transparent. Therefore, the word of mouth wins hands up. The horror of what is happening behind the closed doors of government decision-making and operations is very much present in the public domain, and will influence the democratic mandate when the time comes. Opponents call the better decisions appeasement because they know well that those will get the majoritys support, and so are scared of the possibilities. Hopefully, the recent churnings will blur the divide between Bharat and India.

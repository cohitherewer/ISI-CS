	Politicians in new democracies take their time to learn the rules of the game. The current crisis in Nepal is, however, a result of its politicians refusal to learn anything from the brief history of the countrys parliamentary democracy. Last month, the country came close to a constitutional vacuum until the government and the Maoist opposition agreed to extend the tenure of the constituent assembly by another year. The two sides are on a collision course again over the Maoists threat to not approve the annual budget unless the prime minister, Madhav Kumar Nepal, resigns. This is not the first time that the former rebels have indulged in such brinkmanship. Mr Nepals government has not exactly covered itself in glory during its brief tenure. The unstable coalition he heads has spent its time and energy more on surviving than on governing. Many even in Mr Nepals own party, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), and in his biggest ally, the Nepali Congress, would like him to quit if his exit helps forge a national consensus. Given the current impasse, Mr Nepals departure may be a necessary condition for saving the country from yet another spell of constitutional void.        
	But the Maoists too have to keep their side of the bargain. They cannot hope to be a party of the government and a militia at the same time. There is enough evidence to suggest that the Maoists continue to use their armed wings in their attempts to control Nepalese politics. Their refusal to come clean on the issue of integration of the former Peoples Liberation Army combatants in the Nepal Army suggests that they have a hidden, undemocratic agenda. Given the current state of political instability, the idea of a national unity government replacing the present one led by Mr Nepal has its merits. But such unity can only be built on mutual trust. As they form the largest group in the constituent assembly, the Maoists need to be taken into confidence in building a consensus. It may even be necessary to allow them to lead a consensus government. But before that is even attempted, the Maoists have to dismantle their armed wings and accept democratic norms unequivocally. After all, the most important question for the people of Nepal is not who runs the interim government but how the peace process can be saved. In or out of power, the Maoists pose the biggest challenge to peace in Nepal.

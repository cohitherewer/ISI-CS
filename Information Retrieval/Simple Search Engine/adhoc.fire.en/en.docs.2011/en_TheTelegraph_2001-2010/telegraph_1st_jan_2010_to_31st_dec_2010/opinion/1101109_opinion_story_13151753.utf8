                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HELL GATE                                                    
	The bureaucratic savagery that awaited Rafiqul Islam, a Bangladeshi national, at Calcutta airport over the weekend gives the city yet another reason to top the civic disorder and inhumanity index. Some of the basic human gestures of respect that civilized societies make towards the dying, the dead and the bereaved were denied, repeatedly and systematically, to Mr Islam as he tried, first, to organize a wheelchair to put his uncle on a plane, and then, after his uncles sudden death on the plane, to find a resting place for the body in the airport. Airport staff and other passengers turned a blind eye as the body lay for nine hours on a wheelchair with Mr Islam trying to get a trolley to move his uncle to a more private space within the premises. At every stage  from trying to get a doctor to certify the death and his ticket refunded in time by Air India Express to not being able to find a place for his dead uncles coffin until they could board a plane the next day  the apathy, inefficiency and brazenness that Mr Islam had to face from various officials make his experience of Calcuttas civic systems no better than hellish.        
	It is a mix of bad planning, worse maintenance, lawlessness and party-political hooliganism that makes Calcutta airport what it is today  a nightmare for travellers and an embarrassment for all Calcuttans. Every other city has managed to work out solutions to the problems of burgeoning traffic and the challenge of international benchmarks. Extending infrastructure, tightening existing bureaucracy and innovating ways of involving the private sector have been tried out, with impressive results, in all other Indian cities. But Calcutta limps along towards a bleakness of prospects that does profound damage to its civic, economic and political profile  in the eyes of its own people and of the world. But the inhumanity shown towards Mr Islam goes beyond mere questions of inefficiency, corruption and politicking. It speaks of a deeper failure of civilization that years of decline bring to a city, and of a resulting enervation in its inhabitants that makes them put up with such failures without being terribly disconcerted by them. From breathing lethally polluted air to having their safety on the roads compromised by legalized hawking on the pavements, the ordinary Calcuttans seem to be the worst victims of their own levels of tolerance.

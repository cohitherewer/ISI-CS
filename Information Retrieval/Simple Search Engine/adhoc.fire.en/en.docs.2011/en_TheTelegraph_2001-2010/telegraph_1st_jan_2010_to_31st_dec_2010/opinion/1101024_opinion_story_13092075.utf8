                              The chosen one        
	 Despite being stuck in the depths of controversy, Suresh Kalmadi may yet survive, but there is very little chance Sheila Dikshit will. The problem is not with her buoyancy or corruptibility though. It is just that Dikshit is already into her third term as chief minister of Delhi and since nobody expects her to win a fourth time, she suddenly appears to be perfectly dispensable. There is already talk of finding a replacement in Congress circles. But the actual task may prove as Herculean as hosting the Commonwealth Games. Dikshit, clearly, was the choice of Sonia Gandhi, who follows her own logic in such matters. So party MLAs have less chance of exercising their choice. Anyway, many have suggested Kapil Sibal as Dikshits replacement as he fits into Sonias preference for non-professional politicians to head party governments. However, the only thing certain about Dikshits likely successor, if and when there is one, is that he will not be of the mould of either Jagdish Tytler or Sajjan Kumar. The problem is there are too many like them.                        
	 But first things first. Sonia Gandhi is yet to make up her mind over the appointment of state Congress chiefs. Given her reluctance to drastically alter the balance of power, she doesnt seem to have made much headway. There are indications that in spite of their lacklustre performance, most of the incumbent chiefs would be allowed another terms run. That will create problems, especially in Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh, where there is a deafening clamour for change. Madam has to also take a call on the venue for the All India Congress Committee plenary meeting scheduled for December. Is the pressure telling already?                            
	 The J amp;K assembly speaker, Mohammad Akbar Lone, sent shock waves across the valley when he passed a condolence resolution on the death of the Gujarat speaker, Ashok Bhatt. What raised the storm was his calling Bhatt a champion of secularism. A probe later revealed that it had been the blunder of a junior bureaucrat, who had fished out some old condolence message and just overwritten the name of the departed. Lone had simply read it out.                            
	 If youve noticed that the JD(U) and the BJP had been campaigning separately in Bihar despite being in the electoral fight together, then you also must have gathered that the blame lies with Nitish Kumar. The Bihar CM had made clear his discomfort with the BJP months before the polls. Moreover, except for Arun Jaitley, Kumar does not seem to have a rapport with any other BJP leader. But then, Kumar does not appear to be comfortable with leaders in his own party either. There are allegations that several top-notch leaders like Rajiv Ranjan Singh had drifted away because of Kumars high-handedness. The same attitude prevented senior leaders from sharing the campaign trail with the CM. But nothing succeeds like success. If Kumar manages a win, his snootiness would be declared an asset, not a liability for the party.                            
	 If you are the badshah of Bollywood, it is important that you do things in style. This year is Shahrukh Khans 20th wedding anniversary, but the actor has been away in Berlin, shooting for Don 2. To compensate for his absence, SRK will be taking his family to Rome to celebrate his birthday on November 2. Wife Gauri, son Aryan and daughter Suhana are, naturally, not complaining. All eyes are now on Karan Johar. Will he join the family holiday?                            
	 The suspended Congress spokesperson, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, is keen to get his job back. A section of the party leadership still feels strongly about his appearance in the Kerala High Court for the controversial lottery kings in spite of being warned by a senior leader. What may go in his favour, however, is the dismal performance of Manish Tiwari. Instead of converting people to the partys cause, Tiwari tends to alienate people with his demeanour. Singhvi, on the other hand, was always suave, even while defending a bad case.

	 Congressmen collectively missed a heartbeat on Dussehra, when the prime minister looked as if he would fail to shoot an arrow at the Ravan in the capitals Ramlila Maidan. Sensing Manmohan Singhs acute discomfort, Rahul Gandhi came to his rescue, and the rest went off well. As expected, people have read the signs their own way. Rahuls hit was seen as a good omen. During the Commonwealth Games both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi made time to watch some of the matches. Mother and son sat with the public at the Dhyan Chand Stadium to watch India-Pakistan hockey tournament. In most of the tournaments they attended, India won. Unfortunately, India lost to Australia in the hockey match the prime minister watched with Sonia Gandhi.

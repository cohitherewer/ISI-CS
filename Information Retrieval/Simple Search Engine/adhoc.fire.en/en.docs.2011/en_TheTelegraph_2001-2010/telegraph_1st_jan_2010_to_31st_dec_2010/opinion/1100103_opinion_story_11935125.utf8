	One of the most alarming aspects of the Left Fronts tenure in West Bengal has been the way it has expanded the role and authority of State power. It has got the State machinery and the bureaucracy to interfere in affairs where it has no business to be present  from, say, the appointment of teachers to, more recently, whether cricket matches should be held in Eden Gardens or not. If the police commissioner is acting at his own behest, it has not struck him that he has better things to do than decide on the fate of cricket matches in the city; and if, as many suspect, he is acting under the orders of his political master, then he is making a show of himself as a very pliable police officer. There may exist a law that makes police permission necessary for any assembly of people. This does not mean that such a law should be invoked. In fact, such an antiquated law should be allowed to lapse through disuse. The police commissioner is doing exactly the opposite: he is using the law to exhibit his power and authority. There is no denying that the lights did go off in Eden Gardens during the one-day international played there on Christmas Eve. It is also undeniable that no major unlawful incident occurred under cover of darkness. So where does the police commissioner, the guardian of the citys law and order, come in? The question is rhetorical since the simple answer is he doesnt and he shouldnt. There should be an internal enquiry into the incident carried out jointly by the Cricket Association of Bengal and the CESC. But such a thing cannot happen in West Bengal under Left rule. The police commissioner has jumped  or has been made to jump  into the fray and has cut a rather sorry figure.        
	It would be a trifle unfair to hold an individual responsible for such a state of affairs. This is how power has been (ab)used under Left rule. The principle that important officers of the state and the authority of the State should be invisible has been honoured only in its breach in West Bengal. Readers will recall how very recently the chief minister got himself associated quite openly in an election of the CAB. This was another case of getting an important officer  again a police commissioner  in an unseemly squabble over the control of a non-governmental body. The police commissioner of Calcutta is a public servant, he should not be a public figure.        
	The interface between the CAB (and other bodies like it) and the police should be minimal. If they have need of police help, they should approach Lal Bazar and, on the merits of the case, help should be provided and a fee charged. The police department should not provide charity service to private and prosperous organizations. If the CAB needs security during a cricket match they should arrange it through the payment of adequate remuneration. Such an arrangement may not find favour with the administration because it wants to use any public occasion to exhibit its authority and to keep a window open for interference. An expansive State does not secure democracy. It threatens it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Where trends parade as culture
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WHERE TRENDS PARADE AS CULTURE                                                            
	BECOMING INDIAN:   The Unfinished Revolution of Culture and Identity   By Pavan K. Varma,     Allen Lane, Rs 499              
	Today globalization is an accepted phenomenon and the whole world has indeed been reduced to a global village. As expected, Western influence has transformed the lives of less developed nations in more ways than they are willing to acknowledge. Try as much as we might, it has become almost impossible to stop the influence of Western culture, which has swamped our own. Information technology, cable television network and now the internet have brought the Western way of life into every household. American lifestyle has almost become a part of the culture of the young. Whether the trend is worthy or not is for sociologists and the future generation to decide. But it is certain that our indigenous culture is slowly dying out. If some radical step is not taken, it would soon be pushed to the point of oblivion.  
	Becoming Indian: The Unfinished Revolution of Culture and Identity is basically about this loss of culture and identity. Indias long years of colonial rule had its effect on the mind. The English failed to get themselves assimilated into the ancient culture of India. They looked down upon the locals and enforced their own way of life. The Turks and Afghans, on the other hand, settled permanently and managed to add to local beliefs and traditions.         
	Thus, even today, Westerners try to prove the supremacy of their culture in subtle ways. Unconsciously, the young not only follow everything that is Western, but they also accept the superiority of the West. The book serves as a reminder to fellow countrymen that imitating the West is like dressing oneself in borrowed feathers.        
	More than 60 years have passed since India freed itself from the shackles of colonial rule. Political control may be over, but the cultural domination of the colonial rulers still continues in our lives. Be it in terms of language, dress, food habits or even ways of thinking, Indians have failed to come out of the influence of their colonial past. Pavan K. Varma begins the book by talking about the effects of colonial rule and ends with a discourse on the clash of civilizations and globalization.         
	From the time of colonial rule to the present days of globalization, the unfinished cultural revolution continues its onslaught on our culture. For more than half a dozen chapters, Varma presents his views on the ill-effects of colonial rule and shows how it cripples the minds of the ruled. Even after the departure of the rulers, the cultural domination continues with such subtlety that people are not even conscious of it. He goes back in time to explain his point of view, beginning from the days of the arrival of the English on Indian soil.        
	Cultural domination today exists in the form of the English language, and its effects are seen in the decay of our traditions of music, arts, architecture and even our creative thoughts. It is not that Varma propounds a new idea in the book. The generation under colonial rule was conscious of its effects but the people were helpless. The next generation wavered between doubt and faith. The youth of our age are blissfully ignorant. Yet it would be unfair to blame them. Varma has succeeded in giving a form to pent-up feelings that had afflicted a whole generation. Given his experience of staying in different countries because of job assignments, he understands these emotions better than most, and has expressed them in a straightforward language.         
	But he does this with such zeal that he himself falls prey to the mindset he disapproves of in the book. He censures the colonial powers capacity to rule our lives even today. But the book is replete with Varmas descriptions of his stay in England, his visit to the Queens palace, to Westminster Abbey, of his London tour in a bus, and so on. He reproaches the Indians habit of using English when it can never be a substitute for his own mother tongue. Yet Varmas own ideas reach us not through Hindi or any other Indian language but through the colonial rulers tongue.         
	We cannot blame him too much for this, since the contradiction has somehow entered our psyche. The photograph on the books cover probably conveys this contradiction more meaningfully than words can. It is a half-hidden picture of a man dressed in kurta and dhoti but sporting shining black shoes and socks. This incongruity has become a part of our lives. However conscious we may be about our culture, it is impossible to escape the influence of the West.         
	In his enthusiasm, or probably anger and sadness, Varma does not exclude anyone  Mirza Ghalib, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Raja Rammohan Roy, Jawaharlal Nehru, Nirad C. Chaudhuri or Amartya Sen  from his criticism. Probably only Mahatma Gandhi escapes his scathing remarks. But it is difficult to disagree with him. He not only speaks with conviction, but there is also a halo of truth to what he says. Becoming Indian makes us ponder. It forces us to rethink the meaning of our culture, tradition, and the future of our youngsters. Written in a straightforward style, Becoming Indian is marked by its authors honesty and deep conviction. It is a book that every young man and woman of the country should read in order to understand their position in todays world, and also so as not to get lost in the confusing cross-currents of trends parading as culture.

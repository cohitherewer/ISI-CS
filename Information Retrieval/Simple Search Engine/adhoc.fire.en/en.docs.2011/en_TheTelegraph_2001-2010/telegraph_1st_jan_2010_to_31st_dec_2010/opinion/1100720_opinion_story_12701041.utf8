	Just as there are horses for courses, there are special words for special audiences. The occasion and location of a statement are often the best clues to comprehend the contents of a statement. It was hardly to be expected that the foreign minister of Pakistan, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, would praise India when he spoke to Pakistani reporters at the Foreign Service Academy in Islamabad. In that gathering, Mr Qureshi was speaking to his home constituency and trying to gain a few brownie points by criticizing India for narrowing down the talks. In the convoluted and deceptive world of diplomacy, especially Indo-Pak diplomacy, such a statement by a foreign minister of Pakistan speaking to a Pakistani audience in the nursery for Pakistani diplomats should actually be taken as par for the course. The Indian foreign policy establishment seems to have taken the statement in its stride instead of reading in it a grand plot to subvert the talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries. It should also be noted that, on the Indian side, there was the utterly ill-timed announcement by the home secretary blaming the Inter-Services Intelligence for the attack on Mumbai in November 2008. Even assuming what the home secretary said is correct, he could have surely said it at a more opportune moment.        
	It has been quite clear from the statement in Sharm-el-Sheikh that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, is very eager to normalize relations between India and Pakistan. To achieve this aim, he has put forward his best foot and has persuaded the ministry of external affairs to follow him. No one, not even the prime minister, believes that this is going to be an easy task. On both sides there is far too much baggage and the relationship between the two countries has been scarred, maybe permanently, by too much violence and suspicion. There is, as Mr Singh memorably remarked, a deficit of trust on both sides. Notwithstanding this, forging a new relationship is an imperative for both countries if both want to grow and if the region is to have any kind of future. India is concerned about terrorism that originates in Pakistan. But this is not the only item that India brings to the negotiating table. Indias approach is more broad-based and, in fact, the opposite of what Mr Qureshi alleged when he was speaking to a domestic audience. The gains of the talks might well lie in what transpired away from the public gaze.

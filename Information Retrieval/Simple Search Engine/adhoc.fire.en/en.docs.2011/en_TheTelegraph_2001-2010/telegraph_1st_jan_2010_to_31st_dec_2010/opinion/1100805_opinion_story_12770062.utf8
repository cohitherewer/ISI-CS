                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE DIVIDED NATION                          - What hinders the equitable welfare of all Indian citizens?					 					      Sukanta Chaudhuri                                                      
	The Central Bureau of Investigation is making a new submission about Bhopal. This breaks a month-long silence on all fronts. Yet only two months ago, the nation had professed outrage at a judgment that, disturbingly tenable in law, sent out a worldwide message that India allows 25,000 people to be killed with impunity, and untold generations to be maimed in mind and body, provided they are sufficiently poor and disempowered.         
	Six weeks ago, a group of ministers submitted their damage control report. The damage in question was clearly not to the Bhopal victims but to the rulers who betrayed them. That problem taken care of, we have heard no more about implementing the report at the human or environmental level. We learn of these things through the media, and the media, too, have shifted sights. Once the drama and scandal had been milked, and file pictures of old horrors recycled to optimal point, infotainment had no further stake in the business.         
	Bhopal was a disaster. The Right to Education Act, launched four months ago, should be an unmixed blessing. Here is a historic measure that could revolutionize our society and economy. At the same time, the nation is singularly ill-prepared to implement it. Had we taken the act seriously, the country should have been caught in a tide of activity. Yet Kapil Sibal is uncharacteristically silent. As for the states  who play the lead role in the next stage of planning  they seem preoccupied with attacking the act and diluting its implementation.         
	Now for the uncomfortable part. Few of us live in Bhopal. As a TV programme demonstrated, even the affluent young who do care little about the slums surrounding the Union Carbide factory. As for the right to education, it is already secure for anyone even remotely empowered by money or class. Extending it to the rest might actually threaten the former  as symbolized by the unconcealed resistance of elite schools to admitting less privileged children, as enjoined in the act.               
	This is the factor linking Bhopal to the RTE Act. Both situations illustrate an indifference if not opposition  of the State, and the empowered classes upholding the State  to the full and equitable welfare of all Indian citizens. The State gets away with it because, deep down, we want it to.         
	So whats new? Not only the ruling but the conniving and attendant classes have always customized our democratic polity to their own ends. If the rest of the nation benefited, that was a happy side-effect. Despite a heroic agenda of hypocrisy and subversion, the democratic welfare State could not quite be reduced to a rhetorical sham.        
	Whats new is that the rhetoric has changed. It is less hypocritical, but not therefore more honest. There are worse sins than hypocrisy, which at least professes the ideal it subverts. We cannot ensure equal justice for all, but it would clearly be wrong to expunge the principle from the Constitution. Today, we are becoming an alarmingly candid nation. Our lies are intended more and more to be seen through.        
	Hence the rhetoric of democracy has been recast to ensure power and gratification in newly brazen and divisive style. Autonomy equals pay-your-own-way; empowerment, fight-and-get-it; the pursuit of excellence, grotesquely selective nurturing of the favoured. Janata-level benefits become a compensatory ritual for those who, by systemic fiat, do not qualify for the real thing.        
	However chimerically, the old political rhetoric talked of prosperity for all. The new reality show frankly admits exclusion, discrimination and unequal competition. The new order may or may not be impoverishing more people; this may or may not be econometrically possible; but we are accepting it as a morally admissible scenario. The nation is splitting in two, the beneficiaries and the rest, by its declared process of uplift. There is a huge blurred tract in between (which is why the model can be touted at all), but once the process is complete, the division may get sharper. The crucial divide will be something as simple as the price rise: on one side, those who can afford more and more of everything; on the other, their fellow-citizens  however productive, provident and indispensable  whose vision, and still more damningly their childrens, cannot look beyond a sketchy meal and a hovel, at most the ritual social support that actually entrenches inequality: the village primary school, the rural health centre, the jobs at such venues at wages in three figures.        
	I once discussed equal educational opportunity with that bizarre new functionary, a commission agent recruiting students for private and foreign universities. Oh, you mean the social obligation quota, he said. You can factor it in by charging the others ten per cent more. This could actually be good socialist strategy if it wasnt bad arithmetic: ten per cent must suffice for seventy per cent of the people. Primped up with such ideological fibre, the RTE Act might self- destruct before it takes off.        
	So might the nation, through what we have allowed to become (as two years ago it was not) the biggest perceived threat to the nations security: the Maoist challenge. Most of us would abhor violence and consider the Maoist strategy misguided and doomed. But it is further argued that any reference to the root causes, endemic deprivation and misgovernance, is unpatriotic or even anti-national. Yet these causes are admitted, in different keys, not only by Medha Patkar and Arundhati Roy but also by the army and air force chiefs; E.N. Rammohan, the forthright BSF ex-chief appointed by the Union on a fact-finding commission; Swami Agnivesh, the home ministrys appointed emissary; indeed, by their repeated statements, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. But the so-called two-pronged strategy, development alongside deterrent action, has failed on the first count or, more accurately, never taken off. How much will be achieved by the sops now held out by a beleaguered State proposing too little too late?        
	When home minister, P. Chidambaram, visited West Midnapore by helicopter, an adivasi woman asked him an awkward question. Herself with little or no education, she had supported her daughters studies up to Class XII; in that virtual war zone, she had insisted that the girl sit her finals; but on exam day, there was no transport to take her there. Far from being a Maoist, this woman was clearly staking on the establishment. The establishment failed her, because she and her daughter were not its accredited members. How much schooling can a tribal girl-child want?        
	This educationally deprived region has suffered immeasurably  not, one hopes, irremediably: by police occupation of schools, the dearth of teaching materials, the collapse of communications. Older children are missing out on their slender chance of higher studies; younger ones are scarcely learning their letters. Rice supplies for school meals have stopped. Yet provisions for police camps are transported under special escort. That may be right and necessary; but the contrast confirms the stereotype of governance.        
	A smug-cat school of thought would argue: if poverty bred Maoism, why havent all poor people turned Maoist? No thanks to their rulers, for sure. Combine this argument with another, that development is impossible till the violence is curbed. Fair enough, but it leaves some questions unanswered. What was being done till the violence broke out? If enough had been done, would violence have broken out? Most crucially, what is being done where there is no violence?              
	A classic instance would be the Aila-hit Sunderbans. There are no Maoists in those parts. Here was the States great chance to demonstrate its commitment to the welfare of a shattered community. But 16 months later, most victims have not received their relief money; not a kilometre of permanent embankment has been built; and thousands of people are braving out their second monsoon without shelter.        
	Delhi and Calcutta will bicker endlessly on fixing the blame. So will the states chief opposition party, which runs the concerned zilla parishad. All parties concur in the us-and-them divide between the people who must profit from the system and residuary beneficiaries who may possibly do so by default. The old order of feckless inaction connives with the slick new productive model, the babu in cahoots with the MBA. They are both on our side of the divide.        
	So are all readers (and columnists) of The Telegraph. Even the meanest of us are secure in a milieu that should haunt us with entirely selfish fears: retaliation by the deprived, or attacks by enemies of society masquerading as or manipulating the deprived; more basically, the unviability of a humming economy, a shining example to the sahibs, that would write off three-quarters of its human resources.        
	For the moment, we are doing quite well on tax breaks and trendy gadgets, with guards for our condominiums and corporate billets or green cards for our offspring. In our puny way, we are mimicking the life-cycle of the obscenely rich and terrifyingly powerful. We can share in the fiction that India belongs to us. The only problem is, it doesnt not really and entirely.

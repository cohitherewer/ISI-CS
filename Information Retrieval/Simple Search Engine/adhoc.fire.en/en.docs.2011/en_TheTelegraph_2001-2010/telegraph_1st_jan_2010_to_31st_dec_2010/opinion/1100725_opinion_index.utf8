Its an institution, but I hate it with a passion that is usually reserved for the lowest of low humans. My bank screws me up, turns me into a scrunched up paper ball of anger and makes me throw myself into the dustbin and, as I land ... |                               Letters to the Editor                                  Sir  I hail from the village of Ghat Rangamati in Purulia.

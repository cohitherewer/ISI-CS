                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TOO ALIKE                                                    
	What does change look like? It is a word that has been ringing out like a resounding promise of happier days from politicians in opposition, political workers and the meekest and most peace-loving of non-political people. That the last group is also gasping for change shows the depth of the feelings of disgust, fear and desperation in which West Bengal has become gradually immersed because of the excesses of the Left Front. If, as seems more than likely, the leader of the Opposition in West Bengal, the Union minister for railways, Mamata Banerjee, comes to rule the state after the elections in 2011, then her voters will be looking to her for the promised change. She has built up to this moment, bit by hard-won bit. She and her followers, especially her brood of articulate, glamorous, cultured intellectuals, have been flying the banner of change like a beacon of hope in a rescue fantasy. But not all her followers are famous: the others are just the doers, the foot soldiers. And in their hands, change is beginning to look frighteningly like everything that has gone before.        
	In spite of the opposition parties virtuously professed abhorrence of bandhs and disruptions, recent incidents show that bullying, intimidation, coercion and violence are their chosen methods of conducting business. In Khejuri and Kanchrapara, in West Midnapore and Bankura, on the road, in government offices, in schools and colleges, the champions of change confront their opponents aggressively in an effort to silence competition, dissidence and difference. Everyone has the right to protest in a democracy, but that protest cannot take the form of annihilating different positions and points of view. This is precisely what the party in power at present does. The forces of opposition seem to be taking over those habits even before they have achieved full victory over the Left Front. The Trinamul Congress is doing itself no favours by reminding the electorate of its earlier disruptiveness and violence, when it had no power at all. This is not promising; it is frightening. It is high time that Ms Banerjee reined in her followers and asked them to adhere to her declared rejection of violence. She has created the promise of change. To fulfil that potential, she must ensure that her party moves away from the route of vengefulness and violent oppression. West Bengal may not want more of the same.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Time to chart a new course
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO CHART A NEW COURSE                                  MALA FIDE                          Fresh ideas                                  
	The more one thinks about how carelessly the spin doctors running Manmohan Singhs engagement with the people have operated in recent times, the more one wonders what is happening under the surface between the party and the government that needed this rather hasty and tardy get-together with a select bunch of editors. The perception in the market is that the government of India regrets having had to deny Vedanta its place in Niyamgiri, but was compelled to deny permission since Rahul Gandhi had chosen to be the sipahi in Delhi of the tribal people who have been defending their land from being illegally occupied by corporate India. How did the green signal to the small dams project on the Ganges get reversed suddenly, despite the government having emphatically stated that it would not write-off the 600 crore already spent? These two situations demand that transparency kicks in so that the people get to know what prompts such wild see-sawing. Clearly, the media are not interested in delving deeper into facts, as they are bored with the need to do solid homework.        
	The Delhi grapevine is overloaded these days. Questions abound and all kinds of possible answers float about depending on who one is speaking with. Will Jairam Ramesh be sacrificed because of the inordinate pressure mounted by big businesses? Who will replace him and play the balancing act even though 95 per cent of irrigation, power and mining projects have been cleared this year? Will Pranab Mukherjee be anointed deputy prime minister since he has served as the governments principal troubleshooter and as a bridge for the party vis--vis its coalition partners? Will Kamal Nath make a bid to stand for chief ministership of Madhya Pradesh? What will be the design of the impending game of musical chairs to reduce the average age of the cabinet and council of ministers?        
	A majority of the men and women the government deems young are already in their late fifties or sixties. They are slowing down intellectually, and are bereft of energy to take on new challenges and to unravel the faulty mechanisms that are needed to renew systems of governance. Sadly, in India, young and government seem to be incompatible. The old describe the aggravation of the Kashmir problem as a consequence of the inexperience of the Omar Abdullah government. I would like to ask a counter question  what have the experienced oldies achieved for so long? The answer is there for all to see. They bungled and destroyed a paradise on earth because they were disconnected and dictatorial. They neither heard the voices of the people, nor noticed the shifting ground realities. The overriding arrogance and know-all attitude of the old and seasoned politician are responsible for the legacy that Omar inherited, as well as for the many mutinies that India and Bharat are reeling under.        
	An independent-minded and comparatively young Rahul Gandhi is making an impact across India with the majority. That majority, the bulk of the citizenry and voter, is tired of moribund practices, exclusive and suffocating governance, archaic methodologies and the corrupt bureaucracy. The people want to inhale and rejuvenate their everyday lives. They do not need advice or instructions on how to do this from those at the helm because the leaders have failed to deliver a vibrant civil society. The people want fresh ideas and lively initiatives, something that members of their own generation can comprehend and give to them.                          MALVIKA SINGH

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Controversy continues                  
	Sir  I fully agree with the views expressed in the editorial, Not a jewel (March 4), about the conferment of the Bharat Ratna on Sachin Tendulkar, after his double century in the one-day international against South Africa. Despite being an avowed admirer of the little masters exploits, I cannot subscribe to the proposition that he should be crowned with the Ratna. He has already been awarded the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna, the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan for his feats. Those, by any yardstick, should be considered enough for a cricket star. Tendulkar is reported to have said that his longing for such coveted awards is nowhere near the pleasure he derives from doing justice to his game (Focus is on game, not Bharat Ratna: Sachin, March 3).          
	Cricket, as the editorial states, is not yet open to international competition, as only select countries participate in this game. Top athletes opt for other sports, which demand much more physical strength. The lowering of the difficulty level of cricket is a result of the incredibly huge inflow of money and corporate sponsorships that cricketers attract, together with the attempt to cater to popular demands. In other words, crass commercialization of cricket has killed the professionalism so integral to any sport.          
	There may be differences of opinion on the question of who is the best batsman ever. But it is too far-fetched to compare Tendulkar with the legendary Donald Bradman, whose record is unparalleled. Another cricket legend, Garfield Sobers, had said that Sunil Gavaskars achievements deserve to be ranked above Tendulkars. But these debates do not, in any way, detract from what Tendulkar has achieved and contributed to Indian cricket.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I am amused that there are demands to confer the Bharat Ratna on Sachin Tendulkar. It is amazing how Indians go overboard when it comes to cricket. The heroes of other sports are routinely ignored, denied financial support, and are often put up in hostels with bad toilets and water facilities. Yet, they manage to bring laurels to the nation. How can one get the Bharat Ratna for hitting a few runs in a game? I am sure there are several other eminent and meritorious persons whose contributions have silently revolutionized sports, and who, therefore, are more deserving of this honour.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The tone of the editorial, Not a jewel (March 4), seems to suggest a vendetta of some sort against Sachin Tendulkar. One of the first things discussed is whether any sporting feat can be a valid criterion for a Bharat Ratna. In a time of political turmoil, financial crisis and war, sports in general and cricket in particular have been a binding force and a source of happiness to millions of people in India. And there has been no greater icon of cricket in India than Tendulkar.          
	Next, the editorial mentions that cricket is not a physically demanding sport when compared to athletics, for instance. One cannot underestimate the physical stress of a cricket match, which lasts longer than any other game. This comment also does not give due credit to the sporting legend who, for the most part of his life, has worked hard to stay fit and represent his country.          
	The third issue up for discussion is that since only a handful of countries play cricket, this game is not a sport of international standing. However, we must remember that Bharat Ratna is a national award. The aim of this prize is to honour an Indian civilian who has contributed to a particular field in his own country and, by doing so, has made the nation proud.          
	Tendulkar possesses a rare power to bridge differences  when he is playing, there is no Hindu, Muslim or Christian, no politician or civilian, no rich or poor, but only fans eager to watch their champion hit a century. If there is any person who deserves a Bharat Ratna, it is Sachin Tendulkar.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It may not be correct to compare Sachin Tendulkar with the great Donald Bradman. Nor is it proper to raise a hue and cry over rewarding Tendulkar with the Bharat Ratna. This campaign seems more like an attempt to gain political mileage, with politicians vying with one another to extending their support in favour of an award for Tendulkar.          
	One must also not exaggerate Tendulkars capabilities. It can be argued that he has reached this level of success only because he was allowed to play for 20 years, while Saurav Ganguly was shown the door despite being in his best form. Moreover, Ganguly was a successful captain who brought his team together. Tendulkar, on the other hand, refused to take up this responsibility when he was asked to. There are several players who get dropped frequently for a single failure. But Tendulkar had the backing of the administrators.          
	It is too early to bestow the highest civilian honour on him. Even Dhyan Chands achievements in the field of hockey were overlooked. Let us wait for some time before thinking of a Bharat Ratna for Tendulkar.          
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

                
	Sir  In how many games do Indian teams stand among the best at the international level? If cricket were included in the Olympics, the Indian basket would no longer be devoid of a gold medal. Why not recognize cricket as a major feather in Indias cap? There can be no better way to do this than to reward Sachin Tendulkar. It is true that these days pitches are prepared in such a way as to advantage batsmen. But the records the players achieve now are also of a standard which was considered impossible at one time.          
	Yours faithfully,

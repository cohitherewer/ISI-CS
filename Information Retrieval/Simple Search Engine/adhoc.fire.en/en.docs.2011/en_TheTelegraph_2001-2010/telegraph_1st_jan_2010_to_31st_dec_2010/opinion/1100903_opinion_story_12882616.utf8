	KEEPING THE FAITH:   MEMOIRS OF A PARLIAMENTARIAN  By Somnath Chatterjee,  HarperCollins, Rs 499
          
	Somnath Chatterjees book hit news headlines the way political memoirs often do  by stirring a controversy. Incidentally, it comes between two memoirs that have done the same thing in the last couple of months. Peter Mandelsons The Third Man gave an insiders story of the trouble within the Labour Party before its fall in the last British polls. And now, Tony Blairs A Journey, published earlier this week, has the former prime minister hitting back at Gordon Brown, once his Number Two and then successor, who blackmailed Blair so ruthlessly that Blair took to alcohol to support himself emotionally.        
	Chatterjees political life is not comparable to Blairs or even Mandelsons. But he felt just as miserable, he writes, when Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), allegedly manipulated the politburo in order to expel him from the party he had served for 40-odd years. July 23, 2008, the day of his expulsion, was undoubtedly the saddest day in my life since the passing away of my parents. Like Blair using his memoir to settle scores with Brown, Chatterjee takes his revenge on Karat in this book. That his arrogance and intolerance had reached a peak was clearly demonstrated by the fact that he decided to expel me summarily, without even a show-cause notice. That anyone in the party could defy his diktat was inconceivable to him!        
	Strong words, indeed, compared to Jyoti Basus condemnation of the CPI(M)s decision not to join the United Front government in 1996. Basu, whom Chatterjee calls his undisputed leader and to whom this book is partially dedicated, knew that Karat and his group were the prime movers of that party decision but did not name anyone. He only called it a historic blunder.        
	But the former Speaker of the Lok Sabha could do what Blair could not. As the British prime minister, Blair felt powerless to remove Brown from his cabinet. But Chatterjee defied Karats  and the partys  diktat to resign from his post on the eve of the crucial vote of confidence over the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	Thanks to the pre-publication news headlines, which are always part of the plan to promote sales, this aspect of Chatterjees story is now known. But, covering as it does nearly 40 years of his life as a member of the Lok Sabha, the book offers interesting insights into more significant aspects of Indian parliamentary democracy at work. It is one politicians chronicle of events as he saw them. Obviously, politicians with other views would see many of these events differently. In fact, many members from the Opposition parties and a section of the media saw little to be pleased with the way Chatterjee conducted the proceedings of the Lok Sabha during his term as the Speaker.        
	It was not that Chatterjee was always at fault. His critics would often try to heckle him or disrupt the proceedings of the House in order to score partisan points. This is not unique in these days of frequent free-for-alls, fisticuffs and even worse in legislatures across India. Many of Chatterjees laments for the ugly behaviour of some members of the House were not only valid, but they also reflected a genuine concern for a growing danger to parliamentary democracy from the peoples representatives themselves. Chatterjees rebukes and laments also say much about the man. The book has a selection of these that make curious reading. Are you not ashamed of yourselves? I can only say that you are behaving in the most despicable manner. I hope all of you are defeated in the election.        
	It is difficult to remember any other Lok Sabha Speaker using such language in an attempt to discipline unruly members. The irony was that, instead of restoring order in the House, such language usually ended up unleashing more chaos and showing the Speaker up as an easily irritable man who was unable to control either himself or the troublemakers. A more charitable view would be that Chatterjee, a little too self-conscious and ever mindful of his upper-class background and education, was out of his depths in the new world of small-town and less-educated politicians. That is the general image of the man that emerges from the book.        
	Many of the issues and events that Chatterjee dwelt on in his long tenure as a parliamentarian have lost much of their relevance today. So the sections that contain his speeches on some crucial issues of the day, including Indira Gandhis declaration of Emergency and the destruction of Babri Masjid, are not exactly the most exciting parts of the book. For all his success as a lawyer, Chatterjee was not an orator in the mould of someone like Hiren Mukherjee, whom he rates as the greatest Indian parliamentarian he had met.        
	But on two issues, Chatterjees stance may be of much political and constitutional significance. Drawing on his own experience, he argues that Speakers of the Lok Sabha and of the state legislatures should cease to be members of any political party during their terms in office. Given the increasingly bitter rivalry among political parties and its reflection in the legislatures, this seems to be a sensible and practical suggestion. The other issue is of even greater significance, and Chatterjees position on it could prove to be crucial for similar situations in the future. In 2005, the Supreme Court took the extraordinary step of ordering how the proceedings of the Jharkhand assembly were to be conducted during a vote of confidence. Chatterjee not only criticized the courts move but also called a meeting of the Speakers of state assemblies to get a resolution passed, upholding the legislatures constitutional protection against an overreaching judiciary.        
	He took a similar stand, the same year, against unwarranted judicial activism when he refused to accept or respond to notices by the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court over the expulsion of 10 Lok Sabha members in the cash-for-questions scandal. Different kinds of conflict among the three wings of the government have been increasing in recent years. Chatterjee could well be remembered more for his role in this issue than for other things he did, or did not, do in Parliament.

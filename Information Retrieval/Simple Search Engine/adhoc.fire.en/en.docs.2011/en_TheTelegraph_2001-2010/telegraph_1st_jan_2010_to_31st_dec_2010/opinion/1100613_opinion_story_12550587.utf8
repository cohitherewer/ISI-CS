                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Open the door                  
	Sir  Shrines such as the Jagannath temple in Puri should have their gates open for everyone (Temple chaos over Briton, June 9). Restricting entry to people from other faiths violates the basic principle of sanatan dharma. It reveals a medieval mindset and rigid adherence to an orthodox culture. The temple authorities must change their attitude. As for the priests or the pandas, given that money matters to them more than spirituality, they should realize that they would gain more if the number of visitors increase.          
	Yours faithfully,        Bhaskar Majumdar, Kuwait 
      
	Sorry state          
	Sir  The day, June 2, will be remembered as a crucial day in West Bengals political history. On this day, the Tata Motors Nano plant at Sanand, Gujarat, was formally inaugurated (At Sanand, Nano makes a village of crorepatis, June 2). On the same day, West Bengal celebrated the victory of Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress in the civic polls.          
	Gujarats youth are rejoicing about the abundant employment opportunities that came with the Nano plant. But in West Bengal, the unemployed lost lucrative jobs with the departure of the project. With the Tatas being driven out of West Bengal, the state will find it more difficult to attract fresh investments. Even existing projects may be quietly shifted elsewhere.          
	Yours faithfully,       
P. Das Mukherji, Delhi 

                
	Sir  The news of the Nano plant being launched in Sanand makes an inhabitant of West Bengal sad. Had Mamata Banerjee taken a more rational approach to the Nano issue, villagers in Singur could have become crorepatis by now. Both Banerjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee are responsible for making West Bengal lose the project. The chief ministers inept handling of the matter gave Banerjee a pretext to set off a vehement campaign against it. One hopes that at least railway projects would get started in Singur, as Banerjee has promised.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

          
	Unwanted          
	Sir  The incident that took place in a Vadodara hospital is shocking (Mother love, June 7). Such cases are to be found all over India and in many parts of the world. Pre-natal sex determination carried out secretly has given fillip to female foeticide. We fight to reserve seats for women in Parliament, but have a primitive outlook. Education and employment for women and their greater inclusion in society are needed.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
P. Jana, Calcutta

          
	Clarification          
	Sir  I have come to know through a news report published in The Telegraph that I am being included as a member of the advisory board for the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. I have also seen another report in which some of the members have informed that they were not consulted before the announcement was made (Did Trinamul ask? 41 say No, June 8). I am out of the country and could not give my opinion. My clarification is needed, as I am the head of a government institution. I was not consulted before my name was announced as a member of the advisory board. However, I shall be happy to help the CMC if my suggestions can improve the functioning of the organization. I should also like to mention that I have no direct or indirect connection with any political party whatsoever.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Sugata Marjit, Director and RBI Professor, Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | six feet under
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SIX FEET UNDER                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	Good news. The Telegraph has at least one American reader. (OK, dear circulation manager, dont rush to tell me it has thousands in ethnic-Calcuttan enclaves across the US; sure, sure, but lets concentrate on this one.) And, pretty rudely but entirely reasonably, our American friend asks me what the deuce  I amend his actual word  the dislike of his countrys arrogance that I so vigorously and lengthily displayed two weeks ago has to do with language.        
	The honest answer has to be: not much. Like any columnist, I try to reflect some current event. My mind was on the noisy patriotism of British media celebrating the Battle of Britain 70 years ago. But my emotions were more aroused by the antics of some American senators apparently eager to run Britain and its justice system from Capitol Hill. (Not only Britain, indeed: one of them, the aptly named Chuck Schumer, of New York, recently declared it made sense for Israel to strangle Gaza economically until it came to heel, an idea that not even Israels premier would avow out loud.) And heart overcame head.        
	On which still lengthier peg let me hang some thoughts about vocabulary. As a journalists verb, that peg has nothing to do with pegging a tent or pegging down or indeed tent-pegging. Its the way we hang a story that interests us on some aspect thereof, or even some vaguely-related news item, so as to interest you. To get rid of an unwanted story, we spike it; as the copy-editor did in the days when journalists typed on paper, and on his desk stood a tall metal spike for him to thrust the offending story on to.        
	My trade used to have many such private terms, born in the days when journalists copy was typeset in lead by compositors using linotype machines. The result produced galley proofs (or plain galleys), long strips of paper with the story printed down them, to be proof-read (or simply proofed) by the readers  not newspaper-buyers but men (they all were men) employed for that job. We knew reproduced pictures as half-tones  originally, the tones of a photograph between the darkest and the lightest. Our printers had even more terms of their own.                
	New terms        
	Most of these terms Ive forgotten. How many have todays journos even met? Theyll die, just as the author who used to fear his books would be burned now hopes that his texts will be Kindled. But they may leave a residue behind. Todays upper-case and lower-case reflect the way printers stored individual letters in two wide, shallow, open boxes in front of them, capitals in the upper box, small letters in the lower. The press itself  hard-copy media, if you like  recalls a centuries-old technology that now struggles to exist.        
	Language rests on countless such strata from the past. Do big ships still steam? Let alone sail? When did anyone last fill a barrel of oil? Yet those wordings are still in use. Many more live on as metaphors. Something may fly straight as an arrow. You may be given the whip hand, or drive coach and horses through some theory you dislike. You can still flag your intentions, as if you were Admiral Nelson.        
	Ancient measures, notably, also survive, at least in British English: when the penny drops, anyone with an ounce of common sense will run a mile. Theyre vanishing, though, even in Britain. I dont expect often again to hear that a London taxi can turn on a sixpence, still less of someone spoiling the ship for a haporth (halfpennyworth) of tar, let alone give him an inch, hell take an ell  a long-dead measure (of some 45 inches, it seems, if that enlightens you). But so be it. I dont give a tuppeny damn. Language must move on, and by the time these phrases finally pop their clogs  pawn their wooden shoes, that is, ie die  I shall be six feet under.

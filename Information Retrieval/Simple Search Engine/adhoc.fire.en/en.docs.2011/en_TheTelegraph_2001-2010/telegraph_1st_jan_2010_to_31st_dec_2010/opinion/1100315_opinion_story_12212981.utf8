	There are notable differences between Woodrow Wilson, the 28th president of the United States of America, and Umaru YarAdua, the current president of Nigeria. For one thing, YarAdua did not found the League of Nations or win the Nobel Peace Prize, whereas Wilson did. For another, Wilson was the president of Princeton University before he entered politics, whereas YarAduas highest academic post was lecturer in chemistry at the College of Arts, Science and Technology in Zaria, Kaduna state. But there is one striking similarity between the two men.        
	In 1919, about halfway through his second term as president, Wilson suffered a stroke that left him paralysed on his left side and blind in his left eye. He never recovered sufficiently to resume carrying out the duties of the president  but almost nobody knew it at the time. Wilsons wife, Edith, safeguarded his position by allowing almost nobody else access to him for the last 17 months of his term. Even the vice-president and the cabinet almost never got to see him. In effect, it was she who acted as the countrys chief executive.        
	Last November, YarAdua unexpectedly left Nigeria for medical treatment in Saudi Arabia  and didnt return. He had made no arrangements for the vice-president to take over his duties while he was gone, but he remained abroad for three months, and virtually incommunicado, while the business of government was paralysed in his country. Finally, last month, the Nigerian senate declared that the vice-president, Goodluck Jonathan, should become the acting president until such time as YarAdua might recover. Soon afterwards, YarAdua was flown back into Nigeria and driven to the presidential villa in the middle of the night.        
	Statements by his aides pointedly refer to Vice-President Jonathan, implying that YarAdua is back in charge. However, he spent his first week home in the back of an ambulance, while an intensive care facility was built inside the presidential villa. His wife, Turai, has taken control of his agenda, and is allowing almost nobody in to see him.                 
	High stakes        
	What is really going on here is the latest round in the perpetual power struggle among Nigerias ultra-rich elites. Political power matters greatly to them, since their wealth mainly derives from stealing the resources of the State, and in practice the competition is between the northern elite, who are Muslim, and the southern elite, who are Christian. YarAdua is a Muslim; Jonathan is a Christian.        
	It is a competition that has sometimes come close to tearing the country apart, and the animosities it generates play out at street level in the form of occasional massacres that seem to be religious in motivation. Last weeks mass-murders of Christian villagers in Plateau state, for example, were probably in retaliation to a similar mass killing of Muslims in January. But neither at the national or the village level is this struggle really about religious differences. The desperate attempt to keep YarAdua in power is happening because replacing him in mid-term with Goodluck Jonathan violates a gentlemans agreement in the ruling party that Muslim and Christian leaders should alternate in power. Similarly, the massacres in Plateau state are actually due to a conflict over land between the local farmers (whose Berom ethnic group happens to be Christian) and Fulani-speaking pastoralists who happen to be Muslim.        
	The northern elite plays the Muslim card repeatedly to preserve its monopoly of power in the northern states, but it will never stop collaborating with the southern elite to maintain the status quo, because all the oil is in the south. The two groups compete fiercely over the division of the spoils, but if the north ever really seceded from Nigeria, the northern elite would lose its access to the oil revenues that keep it rich.

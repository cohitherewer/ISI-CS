                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        COURT AND AWAY                                                    
	The fond hope, entertained in some circles, that the Allahabad High Courts judgment on the Ayodhya issue would be indefinitely deferred has disappeared. The Supreme Court has made it clear that the Allahabad High Court is free to deliver its verdict, and this will be announced on Thursday afternoon. This development can only be viewed with mixed feelings. The Ayodhya dispute  even though the dispute was mischievously created  is one of those problems in life that have no immediate solution. It certainly has no solution within a court room. To decide on the title deed, the court will go into matters that are outside the domain of law. Judges will have to take a view on matters that demand expertise and specialization in archaeology, history, architecture and so on. Indeed, it can be argued that the court should not have accepted some of the petitions that make up the present case. This issue underlines the importance of courts taking up matters that deal strictly with law. Whatever be the courts verdict on Thursday, it will never be beyond criticism and free from allegations of bias and prejudice. There is something worth learning from the injunction that there are some matters best left untouched by the courts. As things stand, the Allahabad High Court cannot avoid the unenviable responsibility that it has taken upon itself.        
	What is to be welcomed is the attitude of the present political dispensations at the national and the provincial levels. They have made no attempt to influence or interfere with the legal process to defer the judgment lest the verdict incites communal tension and violence. They have allowed the due process of law to take its own course. The fallout of a court judgment is the governments concern; it cannot be and should not be the concern of the judiciary. This separation of responsibility has been very visible in this case, and it is evidence of a degree of maturity in the Indian polity. It remains to be seen if society displays a similar maturity after the court pronounces its verdict on Thursday. There are enough elements in Indian society to play with the raw emotions of the people and to propel them to violence. The existing legal framework permits any aggrieved party to challenge a courts verdict by appealing against it in a higher court. A courts verdict should not be challenged on the streets.

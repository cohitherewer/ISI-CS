	Objection overruled                  
	Sir  It is difficult to agree with Somnath Chatterjees observations that the Supreme Courts order to the Centre to distribute free foodgrain to the poor has exceeded all limits of jurisdiction and that the directive interfered with the governments functioning (SC grain order exceeds jurisdiction limits: Somnath, Sept 3). His view that the apex courts role perception as a constitutional authority is flawed cannot be accepted. One feels that the former Speaker of the Lok Sabha has overstepped his limits by making such comments.          
	From the point of view of a common man, the government has made a grave mistake by allowing foodgrain to rot for the lack of proper storage facilities while the poor went hungry. It was the failure of the government to carry out its constitutional obligations that forced an activist to file a public interest litigation against the malpractices crippling the food distribution system. Following this PIL, the Supreme Court came out with the foodgrain order. There have been instances in the past of PILs being dismissed by higher courts as the litigations were found to lack merit. The Supreme Courts judgement on the foodgrain issue confirms the fact that the court had found the matter worthy of careful consideration. If the Supreme Courts order proves to be difficult to implement, as Chatterjee has argued, nothing stops the government from reporting this problem to the apex court and asking for a solution. Chatterjee should let the government handle the matter. He can worry about ways to help the deprived.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  What Somnath Chatterjee has said about the Supreme Courts directive to distribute free foodgrain to the poor represents a limited point of view. The court seems to have issued the order on the basis of a wider consideration of human welfare. If the court directive is not followed, foodgrain rotting in the Food Corporation of Indias storehouses will be wasted, and the problem of hunger will persist. The apex court should be thanked for pointing out a measure that will help utilize the governments stock of food in the right way. But this will be possible only if the State is proactive in supervising and implementing the plan properly. It is unfortunate that the judiciary had to remind the government of its task of ensuring proper food distribution.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Somnath Chatterjees comments about the Supreme Courts order to distribute free foodgrain among the poor are quite interesting. Chatterjee had earlier made similar observations on two occasions: once when the apex court had ruled on the proceedings of the Jharkhand assembly, and when the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court had ordered the expulsion of ten Lok Sabha members over the cash-for-question scandal. In both cases, Chatterjee had questioned the judicial activism of the courts of law.          
	But it might be worthwhile to ponder why the courts are compelled to resort to such activism. On many occasions, the courts had to interfere in the workings of the government to protect the interests of the common people as and when the peoples representatives failed to do so. The apex courts order on foodgrain that Chatterjee has criticized is in itself a glaring example of the failure of the elected representatives to carry out their essential duties  which includes proper preservation and distribution of food in a country where countless die of starvation and malnutrition. It is time our politicians learnt to care about their electorates instead of thinking only about personal gains.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  It is unfortunate that owing to the ham-handed management of the agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, tons of foodgrain are rotting in the FCIs godowns while the poor are either committing suicide or starving. It is equally appalling that Somnath Chatterjee has criticized the Supreme Courts directive instead of praising the courts good intentions. Chatterjee may be legally correct but his stand is morally unacceptable. As to his view that the courts order would be difficult to implement, it is for the agriculture ministry to take the necessary steps to make the plan practicable.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

      
	Sir  The Supreme Court has ordered the government to distribute foodgrain stored in the FCIs warehouses to the needy. But that foodgrain has been rotting in storage for long and may not even be fit for consumption now. Neither the court nor the government seems to be bothered about the necessity to properly test and certify the foodgrain before distributing it. This shows how insensitive we have become as a society. The court and the government seem to be taking the poor for granted. Otherwise they would have spared a thought about the quality of the food to be distributed among the underprivileged.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The finance ministers decision to remove sops for women taxpayers from the simplified direct tax code bill recently introduced in Parliament is proof of his good sense (Letdown for ladies in tax equality, Aug 31). This is an important step towards gender equality. Sops exclusively for women violate the basic condition of equal rights. The earlier tax exemption for women was preposterous, given that women today earn no less than men. In our society, questions of gender inequality are complex and cannot be answered simply by offering women sops.                    
	Yours faithfully,

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN SEARCH OF THE SOUL                                                                
	IN SACRED SPACES: A JOURNEY WITH THE SUFIS OF THE INDUS (Mapin, Rs 3,500), Samina Quraeshi interprets the idea of the sacrosanct as a place where one feels connected to something larger than oneself. For Quraeshi, the major centres of Sufism in Pakistan and northern India symbolize all that is truly pure and sacred. Her journeys to prominent Sufi shrines throw light on the richness as well as the complexities that inform this mystical tenet within Islam.        
	Quraeshis work, however, is not a mere travelogue. What is intriguing here is the methodology that has been employed to dissect the diverse aspects of Sufism. The core of Sufism  enunciated through metaphorical messages concerning notions of love, freedom and tolerance  has been examined through a narrative that combines personal memory, story-telling and imagery. The descriptions of life at the shrines in Bhit Shah, Multan, Lahore, Kasur, Delhi and Ajmer are revealing because of two reasons. First, they show how people and cultures have been successfully assimilated within the Sufi fold. Second, they also prove that having incorporated diverse strands from Islamic and non-Islamic philosophies, Sufism has managed to challenge Islams claim of a monolithic and uniform faith. Quraeshis anecdotal, but contemplative, tone seldom appears dour or pedantic.        
	Quraeshi is ably complemented by the other contributors. Ali S. Asani delves into the influence Sufism has had on popular culture, and traces its emergence as a medium to challenge the established orthodoxy of the mullahs. While exploring the contemporary ties that bind Sufism and Islam, Carl W. Ernst provides disturbing evidence of the way Sufi philosophy is now coming under increasing scrutiny from Islamic movements that prioritize doctrinal purity. Kamil Khan Mumtazs essay, which examines the inherent richness of Sufi architecture, is equally illuminating.        
	The book has been elegantly produced, and contains some impressive photographs. Yet, it is not completely free of minor irritants. For instance, most of the images come without captions or photo-credits, making the process of identification difficult. A comparison between Sufism and reform movements in other religions  such as the Bhakti cult in Hinduism  could have been looked at more extensively to lend depth to the text. Left is an amusing depiction of two dervishes on a folio by an unknown artist. Top features a woman devotee in the middle of a rapturous dance. Middle and Right include images that indicate the aesthetics and creativity that are integral to the glorious tradition of Sufi architecture. Bottom is a beautiful photograph of Lahore  the spiritual abode of several Sufi saints  bathed in the early light of dawn.                          UDDALAK MUKHERJEE

	The invention of the photograph in the mid-19th century and the emergence of the studio brought about interesting changes in middle-class life. Purveyors of a quickly-valued skill, the growing band of comprador photographers, soon brought the visual into the world of the market and of the urban middle-class home. At the most obvious level, to be photographed provided an exciting option of visuality for many who had not been able to afford a portrait painter. What is of interest, of course, is the intense activity, some of it backstage, that preceded a photo op of those days. As little has been written about the photographic encounter, so to speak, it requires some reading between the lines as well as generous doses of imagination and conjecture to describe these momentous events in family life.        
	When the idea of the studio was evolving, those with some enterprise used makeshift spaces in horse-drawn vans, railroad cars and shacks on the beach; these co-existed with the well-appointed interiors of ones that provided the choice of multiple identities and a kaleidoscope of backdrops: the new visual specialist was a slightly intriguing  if not awesome  icon of the industrial century whose instructions were diligently followed by his clientele. The early studio was a performative space, the sitters often catapulted into the role of unwitting actors as the photographic establishment provided options of accoutrements ranging from important-looking vellum-bound tomes, a variety of exotic potted plants, a selection of objet dart and ottomans, divans and a variety of chairs. To be photographed was indeed gratifying, but before the final product adorned the family album or mantelpiece, a long, if not stressful, period of discipline and patience was required. Specialized personnel, proscenium-style studio sets, and an elaborate lighting system helped in creating an ambience where the client had often to play-act so as to appear real. In India and other colonies, studio codes were adopted from the West within a very short time and often replicated effectively. The reception rooms of the first London studios were temples of ornamental plasterwork, velvet and gilt, with changing rooms, maids in attendance and cosmeticians at the ready. When necessary, appropriate clothes were also provided to match backdrops and props, wrote Robert Pols (Family Photographs). Well-to-do Indian studios were not very different and soon internationally-reputed photographers were available by the 1850s.        
	In books on early photography in India, one comes across the names of leading photographers  Samuel Bourne, Linnaeus Tripe and Lala Deen Dayal  with amazing regularity. It is rarely mentioned that these men were minor entrepreneurs, heading outfits with several employees, most of whom remained anonymous. The person who finally operated the cumbersome early camera was, in fact, called the operator. The composition of the final image  presentation, posture and juxtaposition of various persons in case of a group photograph  was determined by the likes of Bourne and Deen Dayal. These men were the directors of a fairly complex production that involved  apart from technical expertise and ideas of composition  tact and the art of persuasion. For the time span of the photographic session that could run into half a day, the photographer was in charge and even gave directions on items of clothing and accoutrements. If he was of the stature of Lala Deen Dayal, then who would have the courage to demur? His studios in Bombay, Indore and Secunderabad encouraged defectors from the well-established Bourne amp; Shepherd and Johnston amp; Hoffman establishments. In no time, he had European operators named Wartenburg and Schultz who undoubtedly added to the mystique of the photographic experience.        
	In case potential clients had any illusions of a visit to the studio being a cake walk, Lala Deen Dayal took care to disabuse such notions. Carefully tucked away in a catalogue on his works was a section on what to expect of a photography session. Sensitive to the fact that a long studio sitting may exacerbate the moodiness of some initial enthusiasts, Deen Dayal quickly advised sitters to place themselves in the experienced hands of the operator  under, of course, the overall supervision of the photographer. If clients prefer to pose themselves, and to take full direction of the sitting, the staff would help to ensure a good result  and in some cases, a good result will be obtained, the catalogue added somewhat guardedly. Prior appointments were recommended, and it was imperative to come with plenty of time in hand. The long exposure of early photographs necessitated the use of immobilizing equipment such as the headrest, and many staccato instructions on keeping still, holding the smile and so on. Aware that some may flinch at the thought of being incarcerated by equipment such as the headrest, clamp and knee brace, the catalogue assured sitters that the headrest is often of great assistance. Many years later, the social theorist, Roland Barthes, articulated what many 19th-century visitors to photographic studios might have secretly felt: a mounting apprehension as the supports that maintained the body in its immobility were trundled towards them. Few had the imagination to think of these as Barthes did, the pedestal of the statue I would become, the corset of my imaginary essence.        
	Clearly, a photographic session was an event of no mean proportions, involving time, energy and a positive frame of mind. Who knows for how long young Kristo Mohan Mullick (picture) would have to sit on the inhospitable seat of the tricycle? His expression indicates that it had not been easy, and perhaps many instructions and counter-instructions had preceded the final framing. And, of course, there had possibly been many discussions on the backdrop, in this case, a temperate forest flanking an elaborate staircase into a garden. The photographic establishment had not only to invest in backdrops, accessories, expensive equipment, and personnel with a variety of skills, but also modify the physical space for specific requirements, the most important being that of light. In the early days of the daguerreotype photograph, the need for light inside the studio led to interesting innovations: Richard Beard, who started the worlds first ever photographic studio in Londons Regent Street, devised a blue glass rotating skylight that could control the amount of natural light available for the photographer and his assistants. Deen Dayals studios were arranged so that the strongest light is thrown upon the sitter and that without causing any heavy shadow. As the makeshift gave way to the more established, a discourse around the photograph and the photographic establishment grew.        
	Till well into the 20th century, photography and the photograph were the preserve of photo studios, the growing breed of photographers and their support staff. Indian establishments  some of which lasted only a few years  made a handsome living out of portraying the trappings of the raj, and later, its well-to-do subjects, aware of the growing fashion of recording themselves visually for posterity or otherwise. Where control over access to physical space was a marker of racial and colour difference, the studio acquired a curiously powerful status, being one where cultural and social differences melded, even though briefly. The Indian photographer of an European establishment would make a portrait of the tight-lipped British bureaucrat in his three-piece suit  and within hours recommend the same backdrop of moonlight and roses to the blushing child bride, wife of a first-generation English-educated Bengali lawyer.              
	As individuals and their families were committed to a flattering reproduction of the physical mien, they tended to follow the photographers diktat minutely. While men were the first sitters for the photographer, with changes in family dynamics, it became imperative for women, and also children, to visit the studio as well. Public viewing through the photograph, so to speak, of mothers, wives, daughters and sisters was integral to the affirmation of the emerging identity of the nuclear family. The photographic studio provided images to be framed or placed carefully in family albums; these were precious objects, important markers in a cultural milieu still in the process of defining itself. And if the studio and its owners became wealthy men overnight, they did so only after contributing significantly to the fashioning of an emerging middle class. The creation of a new self-image is never easy  and the middle class of late 19th-century India gratefully accepted the role of photo studios in this, at times challenging, process.

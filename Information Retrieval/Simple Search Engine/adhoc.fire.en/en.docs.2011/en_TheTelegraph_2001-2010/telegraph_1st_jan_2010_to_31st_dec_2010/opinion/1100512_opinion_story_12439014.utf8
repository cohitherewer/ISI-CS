	Q:One of my neighbours has turned the ground floor of his residence into a godown where inflammable materials are being stored. Our house, being adjacent to his, runs the risk of getting damaged in case of a fire there. I dont think my neighbour has any arrangement to tackle such an emergency or the legal licence to run such an establishment. Should I inform the local fire brigade or the police? Or should I go for a civil law suit?        
	Rama Chakraborty, Calcutta                 
	A: Section 420 of The Kolkata Municipal Corporation Act, 1980, provides that no person shall use any premises as a godown or warehouse without the written permission of the municipal commissioner, and that the commissioner may refuse such permission if the use of the premises as a godown constitutes a fire hazard. Hence you could lodge a complaint with your local police station as well as with the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, apprising them of the situation and requesting them to take appropriate action.              
	Q:I own a two-storeyed house in a co-operative housing society. I have two daughters. Recently, I came to know that there is no provision for joint membership and that married daughters cannot be nominated as per the housing co-operative rules. When I approached the office of the deputy registrar for housing co-operatives, I was offered the rather facile solution of selling off the house and dividing the money between my daughters. I would like to know if there is any legal provision that would facilitate the smooth transfer of my house to either of my daughters in the future.        
	A.K.Basu, Calcutta                
	A: There seems to be some confusion in your understanding of the co-operative laws. According to the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Act, 1983, joint membership shall include either husband and wife; father and son or unmarried daughter; or mother and son or unmarried daughter. However, in the case of a member appointing a nominee, there is no such bar or exception. Hence you can easily nominate any one of your married daughters, thereby facilitating the smooth transfer in her favour.

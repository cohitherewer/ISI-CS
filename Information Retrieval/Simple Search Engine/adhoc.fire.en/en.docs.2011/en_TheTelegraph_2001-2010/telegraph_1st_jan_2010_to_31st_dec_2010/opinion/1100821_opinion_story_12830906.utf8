	Improper medicine                  
	Sir  As a result of the swine flu scare in Orissa, a large number of people are making a beeline for homeopathic medicine shops. Homeopaths claim that their medicines are effective in controlling the flu. The sale of homeopathic medicines has increased these days because of the unavailability of proper allopathic drugs for swine flu. Swine flu vaccines and masks are in short supply in the market. Cashing in on the anxiety of the people, some pharmacists are selling these at a high price. It is time the government acted to allay the fears of the public.

	On the rise          
	Sir  Dipankar Dasguptas incisive analysis of the nature of inflation in India provides a lot of food for thought (Living with the enemy, Aug 19). Inflation is here to stay, whatever be the level of output. The main reason behind this is the fact that our country has been experiencing an overall growth rate of seven to eight per cent in recent years. For sustainable growth, a certain degree of inflation is necessary.           
	However, in an inflationary situation, a countrys poor are always affected. This is particularly true of agricultural labourers, whose income does not increase rapidly. To protect the lower income groups, it is the duty of the government to arrange for a public distribution system through which poor people can get essentials, be it food or fuel, at a subsidized rate.           
	At the same time, it is true that a large section of the Indian population has learnt to live with inflation. People were purchasing commodities even when the country was experiencing a double-digit rate of inflation. This implies that the high rate of inflation has fed the growth process in a way. The wage hike brought about by the sixth pay commission, and new initiatives introduced in the liberalization era generated a lot of income for the people that created a high rate of demand.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  In his article, Dipankar Dasgupta expresses concern for the poorest sectors of the economy that have been hit badly by inflation. But Dasgupta does not consider the fact that the earnings of the poor have also increased in recent years. An unskilled labourer who got Rs 2-3 per day in the early 1950s, now gets about Rs 200 per day. Similarly, a full-time domestic help who would probably be getting about Rs 20 a month 60 years ago, now gets Rs 1,500-2,000 each month. This amounts to a 75-100 per cent hike. Have the prices of essential commodities gone up proportionately? Rice sold at Rs 2-3 per seer in the early 1950s can now be bought at Rs 15-20 per kilogram  a mere seven to eight per cent increase.          
	While talking about inflation, economists generally evade the fact of this parallel rise in the income of the poor. Dasgupta has also lamented the poor rate of agricultural growth. While a year-by-year analysis of the performance of the agricultural sector might present a dismal picture, an overall survey of agricultural growth might not seem that bleak. In a developing economy, price rise is inevitable. The cost of production increases mainly because of wage hike, resulting in inflation. If income also rises at the same rate, there should not be much cause for worry.

	Erratum          
	 The editorial, Not cricket (Aug 20), contains an error. India could not have lost the match as the scores were tied. The error is regretted.           
	 The Editor

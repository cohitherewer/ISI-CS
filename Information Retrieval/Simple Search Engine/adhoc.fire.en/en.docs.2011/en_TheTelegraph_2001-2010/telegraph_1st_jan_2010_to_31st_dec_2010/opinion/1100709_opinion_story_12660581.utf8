	The street-fights in Kashmir, one is given to believe, are seasonal blights that may or may not be complicated by political opportunism and doctoring from beyond the borders. Had they been treated less as something perfectly normal, perhaps the recent spate of bloodletting in the valley would not have invited something as extraordinary as the summoning of the army after almost two decades. The army  as the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, has announced  is there to stage flag marches and provide assistance to the Jammu and Kashmir state administration only when called to. But on the ground, and in the whirl of khaki, the difference between full deployment of the army and its being merely put on guard will be difficult to make out. For the people, for instance, the addition of forces to the existing battalions of the bungling Central Reserve Police Force, which has been directly or indirectly responsible for many of the deaths in the past weeks, will appear to be nothing less than a complete negation of the promise of the states chief minister, Omar Abdullah, to phase out the military. The immediate fear of boots may quell rebellion for a while, as it has always done, but it will add to the emotions deep down. Next year, in a normal replay of the valleys tragedy, these emotions may once again find expression on the streets.        
	Whether or not the army stays put in the valley, the administration, both at the Centre and in the state, will find itself hard put to counter the sense of betrayal among the people. There is no running away from the fact that the Jammu and Kashmir police and the CRPF have been absolutely ham-handed in dealing with the street scene. The absence of any official condemnation of the use of extreme force, the shameless passing of the buck, and the repeated efforts to suppress the genuine public anger felt at the deaths of the young and innocent by blaming external agencies for stoking the fire, have backfired. These are, of course, normal responses from the government. But perhaps it is time to think out of the box. There is a serious trust deficit that has to be bridged by the administration. A greater demonstration of force is unlikely to do that. It is imperative to revive the political process in Kashmir and to provide people effective, responsive and responsible governance. This is the least that they deserve.

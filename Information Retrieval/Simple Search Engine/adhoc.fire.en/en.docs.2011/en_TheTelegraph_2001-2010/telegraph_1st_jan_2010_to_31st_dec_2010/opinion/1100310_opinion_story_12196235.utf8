	Iraq voted as Afghanistan did last August  in the shadow of violence. But unlike in Afghanistan, where the Western coalition forces could not dispel the suspicion that they were favouring a particular candidate, in Iraq, they have managed to put a healthy distance between themselves and the vote-seekers. It is perhaps this apparent detachment and impartiality of the occupying powers that have encouraged Iraqis  62 per cent of the 19 million registered voters  to defy death threats and violence and turn the elections into one of the most successfully conducted democratic processes in the post-Saddam Hussein era. What has contributed to the success of the polls is the overwhelming participation of Sunni Arabs from the extremist stronghold of Anbar, as also from Sunni-dominated areas that had boycotted the elections in 2005. It goes without saying that this image of fairness will be crucial to the credibility of the government, which will eventually be formed, although that may seem a long way off. The results are unlikely to be known soon, and government-formation may take a longer time given that none of the parties, not even the Rule of Law coalition of the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has sufficient support to claim a majority. All this will mean a prolonged phase of uncertainty as parties try to strike a deal with like-minded groups and even fortune-seekers. The Kurdish parties will have a major role in coalition-building, and their support will be determined by the amount of flexibility negotiators display on Kirkuk, the disputed oil-rich area the Kurds claim as their own. There is also likely to be a period of constitutional vacuum during the time the president decides which coalition should be called upon to form the government.        
	There are two factors that make this period of waiting doubly uncertain. The first is the time-frame set by the United States of America for a pull-out. The second is the designs Iran may have on Iraq. It is common knowledge that Iran has had a part to play in the ferment of communal violence in Iraq, and may continue to play this part to maintain its influence there. Both the US and Iran have to realize that Iraqs stability is crucial to peace in the Middle East. Hurry and selfishness on the part of either country are bound to undo the gains made painstakingly in Iraq.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A matter of Shame
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A MATTER OF SHAME                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The brouhaha over the Padma award for Sant Singh Chatwal has neither been loud enough nor emphatic about the fact that he does not deserve the third highest honour India bestows upon some of the best and the brightest. Whether he has been acquitted of charges of fraud or not is irrelevant because he just is not the kind of icon who should be awarded an honour by the president of India. As a citizen of India, I could not care less about the facts that he happens to be a fund-raiser and therefore a friend of the Clintons, or that he worked hard, at some obscure, non-intellectual level, to give India its due respect in the eyes of the American establishment, (which, in itself, speaks volumes about that establishment), or that he happens to be the Indian face of the Democratic Party.        
	Lobbyists of the United States of the America, who have been patted on the back by the government of India for operating surreptitiously and extra constitutionally, have no business at all to be awarded the Padma Bhushan. The same holds true for doctors who have attended to the ill and the infirm within the top ranks of the bureaucracy. This is an insult to India. Why are we demeaning these honours consciously by making them handouts for the inner coterie of friends, helpers and extended family who will use these accolades to pull ranks in the public domain? The names of the doctors and lobbyists, recommended by the group mandated to prepare a final list, were cleared by the prime minister, by T.K. Nair and by others in the Prime Ministers Office, before being forwarded to the president. The judgment and responsibility rest with them.                
	Save face        
	Padma awards are meant to celebrate excellence of thought, action and skill, not political lobbying. The list this year has been polluted by at least a dozen non-entities with dubious backgrounds. If Chatwal had played a critical role in seeing the nuclear deal through the corridors of power of the Bush administration by being a good pal of Bill and Hillary Clinton, and if he was indispensable to the entire negotiation, then why not appoint him the foreign minister holding the card for persons of Indian origin? Why dilute the Padma Bhushan? As a citizen, I would like to know whether the likes of the doctor whose name is in the Padma list have adhered to all norms and regulations while building their hospitals and institutions. Whose physicians are they? Who recommended their names? Why are there no real people in the list who work against endless, unmitigated odds, to deliver health, education, justice and dignity to Indians who have no voice or lobbies? Since Chatwal is so powerful, he should be mandated by the government to spend five years in India, using his finely-tuned skills to lobby furiously with the babu to ensure that municipalities work sans corruption.        
	The retaliation of the home ministry to the public outcry against the Padma list was predictable. What was interesting though was the response of the Congress, which immediately distanced itself from the furore, and quite correctly too. It was a government of India decision, taken by a committee endorsed by the PMO and by the prime minister. What makes the situation far worse is that one never expected Manmohan Singhs office to deliver such a substandard blow.         
	The moment seems right to discontinue such awards since they are increasingly being determined by the ridiculous reasonings of rather strange bureaucrats who have a different agenda that has nothing to do with excellence. This stranglehold, manipulated by the imperious senior babus, has managed to alienate Indians from the idea of India. It is a great shame. Will the PMO ask Chatwal to return the Padma Bhushan and thereby save face?

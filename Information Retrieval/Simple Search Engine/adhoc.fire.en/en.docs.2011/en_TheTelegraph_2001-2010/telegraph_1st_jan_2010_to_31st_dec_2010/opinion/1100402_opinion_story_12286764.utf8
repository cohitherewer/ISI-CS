The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | time to get tough
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO GET TOUGH                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The National Advisory Council is back in play, and so it should be. To have this collective of carefully selected advisors, led by Congress President Sonia Gandhi, debate issues that are of primary concern to the citizen, is salutary. There are many critical, tough-to-negotiate issues that tend to get sidelined by the ruling government, egged on by clumsy and self-serving bureaucracy that has rewritten the priorities.         
	Prioritized listing is, more often than not, skewed. Corroded and corrupt delivery systems are not scrapped and reinvented. Mechanisms that could trigger inclusive growth are non-existent. Over 63 years of Independence, successive governments have perpetuated the leftover colonial norms instead of working out transparent, democratic delivery systems that spell good governance. There is no excuse for the condition of our habitats  rural, semi-urban, urban and metropolitan. Properly managed scarcity conditions could keep the dignity of life and living alive if the political class and the civil administration were committed to their mandates and adhered to the rules and laws. Unfortunately, the abysmal national standards that prevail are set by the government and its babus. That is what needs to be radically overhauled first.        
	The NAC could start pushing the agenda for administrative and police reforms, carefully culled from the large body of work presented to the government by the Veerappa Moily committee. With the chairman himself as the incumbent minister of law, the transition would be far smoother than if another uninitiated person was in the gaddi. This move could shake the government out of its complacence and also make the politician-babu nexus accountable. That lot of privileged Indians have had their day and must be made to stand on their heads. Enough of taking the citizen for granted. Enough of misusing corroded mechanisms to protect personal turfs and fiefdoms.                 
	New way forward        
	The point-counterpoint, government and NAC, could be a balanced and sensible way of ensuring that social issues concerning those without a voice in Delhi enter the realm of national policy and decision-making. We have a large number of liberalizers, advocates of the free market, trumpeters of genetically-modified seeds, proponents of US interventions in foreign policy and civil society issues, well represented in the present dispensation. We now need to have the top heavy, alienated-from-reality administrator and political entity astutely balanced with men and women who comprehend well and have experience of the life and times of the grassroots, where the majority just about survive in this fast-ascending rate-of-growth nation.        
	It is frightening to see the callous disregard for our true priorities. It is distressing to find that the Vedantas and Adanis of the world see it as their right to break the laws of the land in order to further their projects and are constantly lobbying to have their way. Usually, such determination, backed with financial clout, tends to have its way. The argument put forward is always  man or forest. This is a mindless comment because if the mandarins in North and South blocks cannot find alternatives, they are huge failures in their jobs and need to be replaced. Taking the easy option is unacceptable.        
	Let us hope that the NAC will set new agendas, lobby with the incumbent government for the proposals it believes must be introduced and implemented correctly, according to the laws of the land, and ensure the restructuring of the government to make the administration of India transparent and inclusive. All Indians deserve this minimum dignity for their inexhaustible patience in having lived through the stranglehold of misrule.

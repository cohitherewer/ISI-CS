	All writers have different sources of income now, including advances, royalties, commissions, sales of copyright to different regions of the world, translations, television and film rights. These are becoming increasingly lucrative with the expansion of the usual media. But with the exception of royalties, the amount payable to authors from the various sources is never clearly spelt out in the contract; it is negotiated on a book-by-book basis by the author or literary agent.        
	Of the several sources, the most vexed is the question of advances. Should advances be treated as income to be deducted as the first charge against royalties or should they be taken by authors as expenses incurred in the preparation of the work? How much should the author charge for the time and money spent on the preparation of the electronic copy, which is the format that publishers now expect from their authors? Since advances strap authors to the publishers schedules and editorial policies, should they accept advances if they can do without them?        
	All publishers will try to squeeze authors dry unless their books are well known enough to be easy to sell. Of course, no book sells on the strength of the authors reputation alone, but the initial take-off depends on the celebrity status of the author. In the long run, the books merit and relevance matter, but the long run is now defined as a couple of months to a year. Publishers want their returns immediately.        
	Given the vagaries of the market and other financial constraints, all publishers want their advances back fast. If this is not possible, they take the next obvious step and include the advance in the cost of production. But this increases the price, which results in lower sales and profits. Either way, it is a tough call for both author and publisher and it is usually the publisher who gets his way, unless the author has the clout.         
	Deciding on the amount of the advance is tricky because there can never be an agreement on how much to charge for the time spent on writing the book or, for that matter, on how much the authors reputation is worth. All that can be said is that a great proportion of the huge advances paid to celebrity authors is set off against their future royalties. If any concession is made it is that the advances are recovered over two or three editions and not in one go.        
	Authors should ask for an advance because the preparation of the electronic copy is best done by professional typesetters. And publishers are willing to share this cost because it saves them the expenses and the hassles of typesetting. But there have to be reasonable limits to the advances that authors ask for; they could charge for the costs of setting the electronic copy plus a little extra for overhead costs but not much more. If they do, publishers know how to recover the extras from their royalties. The whole game of advances is one of give and take; neither party can take the other for a ride if it wants to survive.

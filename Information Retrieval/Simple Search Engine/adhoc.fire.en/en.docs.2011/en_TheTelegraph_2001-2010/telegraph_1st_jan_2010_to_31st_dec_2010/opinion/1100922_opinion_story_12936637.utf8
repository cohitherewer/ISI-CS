The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | old wine in an old bottle
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OLD WINE IN AN OLD BOTTLE                                  SUMANTA SEN                              
	It is not even as though old wine has been served in a new bottle in Jharkhand  rather, it is the same old wine gone flat in the same old and leaking bottle. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha have shared power in the state and fallen out. Now they have come together once again under the leadership of Arjun Munda, and are enjoying the blessings of Shibu Soren, who, clearly, has nothing new to offer.         
	Yes, Presidents Rule has ended, but for how long? In Jharkhand, the ritual of going through the motions of democratic procedure has become tiresome by now, with all the principal players routinely failing the state. Those who may still retain hopes of Jharkhand going places under the latest regime would do well to note that it has had a halting start with senior BJP leaders  like Lal Krishna Advani, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj  having reservations about the party tying up with Soren, who has proved himself to be an unreliable customer.        
	Munda may feel that as long as the BJP president, Nitin Gadkari, and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh are by his side, he need not worry. But Gadkari is based in New Delhi and the RSS bosses in Pune. Nearer home in Ranchi and Hazaribagh, there are the state BJP president, Raghubir Das, and the former Central minister, Yashwant Sinha, to constantly breath down Mundas neck and create obstacles. Sinha, who was considered a possible chief ministerial candidate while the idea of a tie-up with the JMM was being discussed, is likely to prove particularly difficult. Gadkari, however, would have none of that. He wanted his own man in. Now, a sulking Sinha may well turn out to be a thorn in Mundas flesh, especially as he has the support of a fair section of the saffron brigade. After all, the BJP is no longer a monolithic structure, as it was once perceived. It has also been infected with the disease of factionalism.                
	Shaky arrangement        
	Then again, the government has two deputy chief ministers, one from the JMM and the other from the All Jharkhand Students Union. Such an arrangement is often a recipe for disaster, as the deputies soon begin to harbour ambitions. This may not have happened in neighbouring Bihar. But the same may not be said of the situation in Ranchi. In Ranchi, there is an alliance without a programme, unlike the National Democratic Alliance in Patna.        
	The fate of the government is, however, its own problem. Even the people of the state cannot be bothered about it, let alone the nation as a whole. What is of concern to the nation is how Jharkhand goes about meeting the challenge posed by the Maoists. In the past, Jharkhand has not been tackling the Maoists in the way other concerned states, particularly West Bengal and Orissa, would have liked it to. There has always existed a suspicion that cutting across party lines there is sympathy for the Maoists, and Calcutta has complained that Ranchi is not that interested in joint operations in the jungles along the common border. If Munda insists on remaining inactive, then the Central home ministry may have a thing or two to say about this. The Maoists in Bengal are showing signs of being on the run and it is essential that Jharkhand rises to the task. Nobody would be helped if Soren remains in the backseat.         
	On the whole, the question arises as to why the Centre decided to lift Presidents Rule, well aware as it is of the situation in Jharkhand? The only answer seems to be that, with cynical disregard for the people, the Congress played politics to make both the BJP and the JMM stew in their own juices  which may fetch the Congress dividends in the next elections. However, for Jharkhand, a shaky arrangement in Ranchi would be of no help.

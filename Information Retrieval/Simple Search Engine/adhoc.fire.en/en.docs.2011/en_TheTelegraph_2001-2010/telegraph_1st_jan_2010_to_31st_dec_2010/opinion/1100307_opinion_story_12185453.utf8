                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ALL IN A FINE DAYS WORK                                                          
	The former Shiv Sena legislator, Sitaram Dalvi, must have been confident that the Mumbai collector was talking through his hat when the legislator was levied a hefty fine for damaging hotel property during an agitation last year. Accountability is an exotic creature in the Indian ethos. Rather, it is the destructiveness of a mob that is an almost indispensable part of Indian political and psychological life. The victim of this kind of violence is always the non-participating citizen, the passer-by, the tax-payer. No one is accountable. Such public disorder  breaking up or damaging property, burning buses, digging up greens and scorching the grass, obstructing people, traffic and trains  in the name of political demonstrations and rallies is one of the issues that has been engaging the higher judiciary in recent times. In Mr Dalvis case, the high court has upheld the collectors penalty, with the generous allowance of one day within which the politician is welcome to find out whether Bal Thackeray or any other leader, or the party itself, will share his burden.        
	Last year, the Supreme Court desired an amendment to the Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act, 1984 to include within its purview the destruction wrought by rampaging political parties, and also decided to lay out guidelines regarding the penalizing of political leaders for damage to public property during political agitations. Mr Dalvis penalty is thus exemplary, communicating that the casual vandalism all political parties consider their birthright is a crime, inculcating the notion of accountability, and also conjuring up the possibility of succour for the helpless citizen. So far it seems that although primary responsibility will attach to those leaders who organize and lead the particular demonstration  as Mr Dalvi had claimed in writing to have done  the money for the fine can come from the party too. The role of the camera would be crucial once this becomes the law, for fixing responsibility for vandalism in the confusion would be impossible without video records.        
	The notion of the fine is both practical and just, if implemented with rigour. In the case of public safety, while offenders can be incarcerated up to six months, they have, so far, no civil liability such as compensating the victims through a fine imposed by the court. A really massive fine could be an excellent deterrent to the destructiveness of political parties. But the best notions are useless without proper administration. Mr Dalvi is in the hot seat because the state administration is unyielding. It may be pertinent to remember that the Shiv Sena is rather far from the seat of power at the moment. How quick off the mark will state administrations be when the offending political party is also part of the state government? Imagine the chief minister of West Bengal being fined for allowing his partymen to destroy what little is left of the Maidan while listening to his speech from the podium.

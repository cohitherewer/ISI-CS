	Knowing what is right does not always mean doing it. The Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, seemed to have struck a chord across the board at the diamond jubilee of the Election Commission when she said that political parties must evolve a consensus on barring candidates with criminal records from contesting elections. Her sentiments were echoed by leaders of her own party as by those of others, emphasizing the prime ministers point that there was unanimity on this issue. Ironically, there is unanimity in action as well. Reportedly, there are 150 members of parliament with criminal backgrounds in the 15th Lok Sabha, with the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party boasting the two highest numbers, the BJP running a close second to the Congress. The theme of money and muscle power corrupting politics is a well-worn one. Numerous discussions and pious intentions of successive governments have not made a jot of difference; a non-governmental organizations account shows a gradual increase in the number of elected candidates with criminal backgrounds.        
	There is a convenient vagueness about the phrases criminal background and criminal record. Do these mean someone who has been convicted in the past and been freed after he has paid his debt to society, someone against whom criminal charges are pending, someone who is defending such a charge, or all of these? If it is a question of charges alone, anyone can be charged with anything under the sun. Should charges be established as cause for a bar, it would become a marvellous weapon against rivals for all politicians. On the other hand, given the dilatoriness of Indias courts, if the charge itself is not a bar, conviction can be put off time and again and a potential convict can happily contest the polls. And is it fair to bar someone who has already paid the penalty? Yet the solution could be simple enough. If political parties were only to shed their hypocrisy, they could also unanimously declare that they know, as does the public, which among the aspiring candidates are directly associated with criminal activity. The parties are responsible for the choice of candidates; if their judgment were to be geared towards ethics rather than money and muscle support, it would not be difficult to clean up politics. Neither would there be any need to announce good intentions at every anniversary.

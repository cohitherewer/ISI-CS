                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Risky engagement                  
	Sir  The National Commission for Women has taken a timely initiative in asking the information and broadcasting ministry to ban marriages on reality shows such as Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Rahul Mahajan, a 34-year-old divorcee, who was involved in a case related to drug abuse, could attract a decent girl like Dimpy Ganguly because of the media hype surrounding the show (Honeymoon gift to Mahajan, March 10). Such uneven matches never do any good to the brides, and should not be encouraged.          
	Yours faithfully,        Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi
        
	Tools with a heart          
	Sir  It is true that modern technology can harass and puzzle users if it is not operated properly (Too much to remember, March 8). But when used correctly  such as providing the information sought by a machine to process a request  technology can meet the demand for which it has been created. In fact, machines are more courteous than human beings, who are appointed and paid for the services rendered. But to reap the benefits of a machine, one needs to remember basic information like passwords and identification numbers. Failing to recall these numbers can cause embarrassment. But if one has a fair understanding of machines, these problems can be overcome in no time.          
	Information technology saves people from standing in long queues to avail a service from a minor official. Government officials often express their disgust and irritation openly, especially when someone fails to bring along the necessary documents. Demanding and accepting bribes are also regular occurrences. Remembering passwords may tax our memories, but the arrogance and indecent behaviour of government personnel are as inconvenient. The occasional harassment caused by a machine can be forgiven. At least a machine, unlike public servants, begs to be pardoned if it fails to provide a particular service.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subrata Pal, Karimpur, Nadia                         
	Unruly house          
	Sir  The unruly behaviour of some members of parliament is truly disturbing (Disruption by a dozen, March 9). It is also sad that the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has to watch the violent scenes helplessly and repeatedly adjourn the House. The Speaker should assert herself and insist on decorum. Otherwise, she should be blamed for failing to protect the spirit of democracy. One also wonders why the chairman of the Rajya Sabha did not evict the rowdy MPs immediately after they grabbed the papers from his table. The delay in expelling them has given the impression that indiscipline will be tolerated.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
N.S. Venkataraman, Chennai

      
	Parting shot    
	Sir  Celebrities maintain their exclusivity by retaining a veneer of mystery (Outsource ghost lurks behind celebrity tweets, March 6). That is what separates them from hoi polloi. The greater the mystery, the bigger the audiences interest in celebrities. But social networking sites such as Twitter have made famous people more accessible. Moreover, Twitter also brings about changes in their behaviour.           
	As for politicians, one wonders why they waste time tweeting. Perhaps they do so to appear accessible, and to be in touch with voters. But their followers, mostly scribes or rivals, are only interested in controversial remarks.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
A. Mohan, Dubai

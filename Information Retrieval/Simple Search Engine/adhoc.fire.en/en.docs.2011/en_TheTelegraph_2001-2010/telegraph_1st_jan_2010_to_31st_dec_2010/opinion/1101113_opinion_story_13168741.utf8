	Despite the physical contrast of race and religion, they might have been father and son. What earlier looked like a patronizing pat on the back turned out to be an affectionate hug. This visual proof of the fondness between Manmohan Singh and Barack Obama and its outcome prompts the question: would India have been refused American support for United Nations security council membership if the prime minister and president had hated each others guts like Indira Gandhi and Richard Nixon?        
	The personal factor in political relations has always eluded measurement. Queen Victorias prolific correspondence with a host of European royals was long supposed to strengthen diplomacy with what is nowadays called back-channel support. Later evidence suggests her ministers found her interference a nuisance that was sometimes obstructive. Similarly, a flurry of telegrams among the closely-related sovereigns of Britain, Russia and Germany did not avert World War I. But that failure can also be cited as evidence of the role of personal equations since at least two of the trio, George V and the Kaiser, heartily disliked each other.        
	By keeping up appearances until the end, they pre-empted by some 70 years Henry Kissingers dictum that rulers rarely make disagreements explicit; they do not want to solidify a deadlock that they have no means of breaking. The master of realpolitik thought that would indicate a lack of negotiating skill. What Kissinger meant was that public disagreement forecloses options. By that token, rulers must also be chary of demonstrating friendship lest this inhibits saying no when the occasion demands. That clearly doesnt trouble Singh. But while his nuclear liability legislation navigated the danger skilfully, a less dexterous Saladin rejected Richard the Lionhearts invitation to a tte--tte in a television series on the Crusades precisely because of those twin fears. Great kings, intoned the Saracen chief, should meet only after agreement had been reached. Ironically, the screening of that instalment in India coincided with the fiasco of Atal Bihari Vajpayees Agra summit with Pervez Musharraf.         
	Dwight Eisenhower thought Jawaharlal Nehru was swayed as much by personality as by logical argument but in at least one instance Nehrus cold-bloodedness would have earned Kissingers approval: he ended a relationship with the clever and beautiful Madame Chiang Kai-shek when it became clear the Kuomintang was losing. Whether or not they were in love with one another as Winston Churchill believed, they kept up an affectionate correspondence, with Nehru signing himself Vagabond and Madame Chiang, more than her husband, trying to persuade Franklin Roosevelt to support Indian independence. During her wartime American tour she also publicly criticized Britains imprisonment of a man with Nehrus world vision.         
	Nehrus decision to place politics above person (perhaps he had tired of her!) seemed to belie Eisenhowers assessment. He may not have been equally calculating with another inamorata though history alone can judge if Lady Mountbatten in any way influenced Indian decisions on the Commonwealth, Jammu and Kashmir, the Cross of St George (White Ensign) on the Indian navys flag and on other matters.        
	On the whole, however, Eisenhower was not far out. One of Nehrus subjective actions was to recognize Israel almost on the rebound after meeting Egypts King Farouk who was one of the most repellent individuals he had met. All that I could do was not to be rude to him, Nehru wrote. Farouk then headed the Arab League, and Nehru, who had no great sympathy with militant Zionism, was committed to the Palestinian cause.        
	His encounters with American presidents were also high in personal content which was reflected in bilateral relations. The first was with Harry Truman, whom he obviously found shallow. Truman, on his part, recalled later how Nehru sat coldly opposite him, rebuffing overtures. I tried to make friends with him. I tried very hard. He suffers from racialism in reverse. But there was no coldness when Nehru visited Eisenhower or when Ike returned the visit in 1959. But, then, Ikes Atoms for Peace programme led eventually to the Tarapur reactor.        
	Ironically, the most enigmatic of Nehrus relationships was with John F. Kennedy. An American president young enough to be his son, who knew enough history to argue that Oliver Cromwell had ruled Ireland more harshly than Robert Clive in India, and who eulogized Nehrus soaring idealism in his Inauguration speech evoked no reciprocal cordiality. Apparently, Kennedy was excited like a schoolboy about Nehrus visit, and he and Jacqueline personally attended to small details like menus, the people to be invited and the people not to be invited lest their guest take offence. Nehru had asked Washington to eschew the medieval splendour that Ayub Khan, who gave Jacqueline a spirited stallion, had lapped up a few months earlier.        
	But the visit was a disaster Kennedy lamented, the worst head-of-state visit he had hosted. John K. Galbraith, the US ambassador, thought Nehru appeared tired and uninterested. Kennedy did most of the talking. Nehru simply did not respond. When American reporters asked him how he had got on with the starry-eyed young prince of their new Camelot, Nehru snapped with asperity, I can get on with anybody in the world.         
	Sudhir Ghosh tackled him about it afterwards, asking why Nehru did not show some kindness and warmth to his young admirer. Surely you did not expect me to embrace him, did you? Nehru retorted glumly. What would he have said of the spectacle of Singh and Obama in a tight embrace? True, men were less demonstrative then but the coolness may not have been only a question of style. The Kennedy fire did not ignite a matching spark.         
	In reverse, Nixon, who waxed lyrical about Indians and had read a life of Mahatma Gandhi  a present from his Quaker grandmother when he was 17  over and over again, just couldnt stand Nehru. The prime ministers softly modulated British English grated on him and he found Nehru the least friendly of the leaders he met during a 20-country tour in December, 1953. Nixon accused Nehru of a personal thirst for influence, if not control, over South Asia, the Middle East and Africa and condemned Indira for being in every way her fathers daughter. So, the hostility was there long before she behaved towards him like a professor praising a slightly backward student while preparing to dismember Pakistan in which he had invested heavily.         
	Kissingers view that Mrs Gandhi outsmarted him may also have rankled. Unlike her father, who called Nixon an unprincipled cad, she could trim like and dislike to necessity. Many observers missed her personal liking for Lee Kuan Yew because of her disapproval of his politics, unlike later prime ministers who suppressed their personal unease with the Singaporean patriarch because his politics could help India. Mrs Gandhi also showed at Cancun that instinct could be managed to serve her purpose. Since Ronald Reagan had refused to attend the meeting if Fidel Castro did, she persuaded Cubas leader to stay away in the interests of the non-aligned movement he chaired. Then she set out to charm Reagan, chatting about family and films. He observed afterwards he had been warned to expect a formidable person. Instead, he found her very nice indeed. Thats when liberalization began. If Cleopatras nose had been shorter, the whole history of the world would have been different, citing Pascal.               
	India is also fortunate in the rare and happy synchronization of public need and personal preference in the lanky young African-American and his Mr Guru. But the combination demands that Indians who loved George W. Bush so deeply (as Singh assured the former president) must now transfer their affection to the charismatic leader who is his personal friend and has made a deep imprint on world affairs. Its a relief that another switch may not be necessary until 2012.

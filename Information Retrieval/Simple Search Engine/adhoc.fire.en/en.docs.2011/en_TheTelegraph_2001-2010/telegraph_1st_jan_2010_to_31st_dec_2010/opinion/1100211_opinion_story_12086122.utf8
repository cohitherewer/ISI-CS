	The management of relationships with neighbours takes priority in any countrys foreign policy. An unfriendly neighbourhood means tensions, the threat of conflict, a diversion of material resources to meet security needs, opportunities for external powers to interfere and distort bilateral relationships, loss of trade benefits and an erosion of diplomatic credibility at the international level of a country seen as unable to solve problems at its own doorstep.        
	Conversely, a stable, friendly and peaceful neighbourhood lightens the political, economic and military burden on a country, even as it enhances its capacity to act on a broader international canvas.        
	How can the theoretically desirable objective of a friendly neighbourhood be achieved in practice? How can that balance of interests be created that would bind neighbours in amity? Is reciprocity the basis or does it require unilateral concessions from the bigger and stronger country? How can fears, prejudices, the weight of history, traditional animosities and such factors be overcome?        
	What about the role of third countries? Countries seek partnerships beyond their own region for protecting their own political, economic or security interests. Smaller countries fearful of bigger neighbours often reach out to external countervailing powers who, in turn, may have an interest in containing regionally influential powers for larger strategic reasons.        
	Many in the country hold India responsible for the poor state of its relations with neighbours. India as the biggest country is expected to bear the main responsibility for regional stability, with a display of generosity and with unilateral concessions, especially on the economic side, as tools, now that Indias economy is growing apace and neighbouring countries can be integrated with it to long term advantage.              
	Such criticism exaggerates Indias capacity to manage its neighbourhood. On many issues of national interest, internal opinion is divided. Indias legal, political and administrative system impedes hard decisions in its own interest, such as on the proper management of its porous borders. Electoral considerations or the preoccupation with its own problems of subcontinental dimensions prevent the requisite degree of attention to neighbours.        
	Indias record in moulding conditions in its neighbourhood in its favour is poor. After withdrawing militarily from Sri Lanka in difficult conditions in the Eighties, it ceded its central role in shaping developments there, including those leading to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelams military defeat. Its ability to now determine the pace and content of the final resolution of the ethnic issue is doubtful. Indias intervention in the Maldives was more successful, but that hardly constitutes a model for a future Indian role in ensuring regional stability. In Bangladeshs case, in a telling diplomatic setback, India has had to cope with the power-grab there by anti-Indian forces which have pursued unfriendly policies over decades. In Nepal, India supported the rise to power of forces traditionally hostile to it in the interest of a stable Nepalese polity. India finds it difficult to handle Nepals internal affairs even though developments there seriously impinge on Indias security.        
	India is victimized by terrorism directed against it from within its neighbourhood. Pakistan has used terrorism against India as an instrument of State policy, without India being able to find an answer, either on its own or with the support of the international community. India is now living under the shadow of another Mumbai-like attack, which, if it were to happen, could have grave unwanted consequences.        
	Apart from the Hamid Karzai government castigating Pakistans sponsorship of terror, other countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation remain reticent. All, barring Bhutan, have interest in maintaining good ties with Pakistan for motives that include leveraging its hostility towards India to their own advantage, countering Indian domination, and needing to politically manage their own Muslim communities. Saarc conventions on combating terrorism remain ineffective given Pakistans complicity with terrorist groups.        
	The debate about unilateral concessions versus reciprocity is misplaced. A big country has no less responsibility than a small one to protect its interests. A sustained policy of making unilateral concessions is politically untenable. Those who advocate such concessions overlook the conduct of other major powers and, most relevantly for us, that of China. Is China ready to make any such concessions to us on bilateral differences for reasons of good neighbourliness? India tried a policy of unilateral concessions towards neighbours in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, but with no lasting result.        
	Indias physical domination of its neighbourhood creates problems in itself. Most of its neighbours are very small in comparison, geographically, demographically and economically. The strong civilizational, cultural, linguistic and ethnic ties that India and its neighbouring countries share makes them in reality feel insecure in their separate identities. Projecting India as a threat, a hegemon and a bully is integral to the assertion of their distinctive identities.        
	India cannot prevent the neighbouring countries from seeking to balance its weight by reaching out to external powers in order to acquire a greater margin of manoeuvre vis  vis India, squeezing concessions from it and obtaining economic and military assistance from powers wanting to constrain Indias rise or imposing costs on it for pursuing independent policies. Pakistan, in its obsessive pursuit of parity with India, has been most responsible for bringing outside powers into the subcontinent. The Pakistan-China nexus has sought to permanently neutralize India strategically by transfers of nuclear weapon and missile technologies to Pakistan. Significantly, the United States of America has been complaisant, as it too has favoured a strategic balance between India and Pakistan for ensuring regional peace and stability. Today, China is Pakistans biggest defence supplier. The US too has begun supplying advanced arms to Pakistan to reward it for its cooperation in combating the insurgency in Afghanistan. Pakistan is now the recipient of arms assistance from the worlds foremost democracy and its foremost authoritarian State.              
	In the foreseeable future, India will not be able to shape its immediate environment to optimally subserve its interests. Unless Pakistan ends its politics of confrontation with India, the Saarc region will remain under stress. If the extremist religious forces ultimately win in Afghanistan, the strategic space for them will expand enormously in the region. A triumphant radical Islamic ideology can be destabilizing for the religiously composite societies of South Asia. A Talibanized Pakistan will add to the pressures on India.        
	The prospects of a border settlement with China remain distant. China has, in fact, increased tensions by reviving aggressively its claims on Arunachal Pradesh. The tactical alliance between India and China at the Copenhagen climate summit should not obscure the deeper sources of India-China problems.        
	With the Sheikh Hasina government in power in Bangladesh, Indias relations with that country seem set to improve. Bangladesh is showing an unprecedented willingness to deny safe havens to anti-India insurgents and progress on transit issues. The recent visit of the Bangladesh prime minister promises to launch a new phase in the ties between the two countries. A solution to the problem of illegal Bangladeshi migration into India, however, will remain difficult.        
	The success story of Indias relations with Bhutan shows that good relations between India and its neighbours depend on reciprocal goodwill and wise, unprejudiced policies on all sides, without allowing external countries to impede the building of positive equations locally to mutual advantage. There is a core lesson there for all.

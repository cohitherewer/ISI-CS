The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A deal too far
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A DEAL TOO FAR                                                    
	Mamata Banerjee is one of the stars of our political system  a dramatic, expressive opportunist. Representatives of the people must be like the people  nay, they should be exaggerated versions of the people in their emotionalism, impulsiveness and capacity for obduracy. Judged according to this criterion, Ms Banerjee has attained a standard of excellence that the Thackeray clan would not reach in their lifetimes. And this too at the unripe young age of 55, when a typical Congressman would be an infant waiting in the wings to become a deputy minister of state. By the standards of her class, she is a genius. Seeing what she is, it must be questioned whether even she had to go as far as she did last week. To recall briefly, Pranab Mukherjee, the Union finance minister, extended the service tax to railway freight in his budget of February 26. Ms Banerjee is the current minister of railways; she may be there today and may be out tomorrow. But she regards the railways as her fiefdom. So she took the imposition hard, and protested against it while replying to a Parliament question. Then her ministry shot off a letter to the finance ministry. Then she did some personal politicking.        
	Curiously, the same drama was enacted last year, and the finance ministry withdrew the tax. Its reasoning, that the withdrawal was anti-inflationary, was weak to the point of mindlessness. For one thing, every tax imposition is inflationary, but only in so far as its victim raises his prices to recoup the tax. This applies as much to direct as to indirect taxes; a Shah Rukh Khan would assuredly pass on to his producers any tax imposed on his income, and his services. For another, all tax revenue also works against inflation in so far as it reduces the spending capacity of its victims; this is as true of tax on railway freight as on anything else. When the tax revenue is spent, it correspondingly adds to expenditure and hence has an inflationary impact. It is the balance between government expenditure and revenue that is relevant to inflation, not any particular tax or its removal.        
	Equally faulty is the railway ministers reason for seeking a waiver of the service tax, that it would hurt the railways in their competition against road transport. Road transport was taxed in the budget of 1997, but the government caved in after truck operators blocked roads. Then Mr Mukherjee restored the tax in 2005, and this time it stuck. The tax on road transport is discriminatory; it favours rail transport. The proposed service tax on railway tax redresses this. Taxes should not be so designed as to favour one competitor over another. If the tax on railway freight is to be removed, the finance minister should also remove the tax on road transport.

	Q: I purchased a flat in a standalone building with eight flats in the front portion and three covered garages. All the 11 meter boxes were installed on my garage wall by the promoter who is now untraceable. I have requested the others to shift their meter boxes, but to no avail. Moroever, one flat owner has taken to parking his car in the common space within the boundary wall. When I objected to this, he claimed to have bought the space as an open car park and showed the sale deed made by the promoter, although no open car park is shown in the sanctioned plan. How I can have the meter boxes shifted? Can common space be sold as an open car park?        
	Swapan Kumar Dasgupta, Calcutta                
	A: Since all the 11 meter boxes were installed on your garage wall from the time you took possession of it and you did not protest at that time, it may be inferred that there was consent on your part. Shifting the meter boxes without the consent of the other flat owners would be an offence. You could send a legal notice to them and thereafter file a civil suit against them for removal of the meter boxes to a common area. Common areas (provided they are common) should not be sold for exclusive use. The promoter seems to have created confusion and got away.              
	Q:Recently, my tenant threatened me with violence. I want to evict him. There is no lease agreement between us. He doesnt have any rent receipts either. How should I proceed?        
	John DSouza, via e-mail                
	A: You should seek the help of the police. At the same time you could institute a case under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code before the executive magistrate for the prevention of breach of peace. Since he has no document to prove his tenancy you should not admit him as your tenant but treat him as a trespasser. You could also file a suit of eviction against your tenant on the grounds of his being in your premises as a trespasser.         
	Q:My nephew has forcibly taken over my shop. The property was my fathers but before his death he had registered it in my name and that of my elder brother. I have all the documents but I cannot take action against my nephew due to an injunction. What should I do to reclaim the property?        
	Khalid Jamil, Park Circus, Calcutta                
	A: You should contest the suit of injunction instituted by your nephew and put up a petition before the concerned court to get the injunction vacated. You could also file a suit for the recovery of possession before the civil court with the appropriate jurisdiction.

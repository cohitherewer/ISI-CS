	Not written in the stars                  
	Sir  Before the World Cup final, the Dutch were denied Pauls blessings. The British-born octopus became a sensation after it correctly predicted the outcome of every match that Germany played during the tournament (Psychic Paul? Scientists see 8-on-8 illusion, July 13). It has been reported that Paul will now retire and do what he likes best  play with his handlers and delight children who come visit to him. India would do well to import Paul. With his impeccable record, Paul could surely put some of our celebrated soothsayers out of business.

	Cruel times          
	Sir  A school in Durgapur detained a four-year-old student, Tanmoy Das, for an hour after his father failed to pick him up on time (Dad late, child punished, July 11). This is clearly a case of unlawful confinement on the part of the institution. The school authorities ignored the possibility of the child being traumatized as a result of the punishment. This incident is likely to damage the child psychologically.           
	The rule to detain students for at least one hour if their guardians are late by more than five minutes after school hours is barbaric. After a gruelling day in the classroom, all that a child wants is to meet his parents. Preventing him from doing so is both inhuman and criminal.This arbitrary rule is apparently in place as the school has only one gatekeeper, who finds it impossible to open the gates again and again. This clearly establishes the ineptitude of the concerned authorities. It is also strange that the school has appointed only one gatekeeper.          
	According to the secretary of the schools managing committee, guardians are informed of this rule at the time of admission. But is the school entitled to torture a child if this rule is broken by his parents? It is shocking to learn that the Aurobindo Vidyamandir, run by the Jadavpur University Alumni Association, acted in an unlawful and cruel manner.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Cases of educational institutions punishing children harshly for minor offences has become a common occurrence. But the government seems to be indifferent to the plight of these children. A school in Durgapur recently punished a nursery student because his father was late in arriving. Instead of punishing the child, the staff should have taken care of him till his father reached the premises. The presence of insensitive people in powerful positions in educational institutions can jeopardize the future of students. Why arent the authorities doing the needful to ensure that such incidents do not ever happen again?           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Instead of being ashamed for being late, Tanmoy Dass father, Goutam, actually ended up blaming the school authorities for their decision to punish his son. Goutam reportedly told the principal that it was not his sons fault that he had been delayed. But neither is it the schools fault because Goutam got late while refuelling his scooter.          
	As someone who had taken her son to school on public transport for over 10 years, I can safely say that parents are often found wanting when it comes to picking up their kids after school. And if schools are expected to entertain alibis like the one presented by Goutam, they will find it difficult to maintain standards of discipline. I fully support the rule to detain students to enforce the timely arrival of parents.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar

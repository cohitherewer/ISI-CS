	Q: A member of a co-operative housing society had nominated her grandson to the flat. Her sons had no objection to it. The member has passed away. Can her share or interest in the society be transferred to her grandson and can he be approved as a member of the society?        
	Bhabesh Dutta, Calcutta                
	A: Being the nominee, he has to apply for membership to the society, along with all relevant documents in accordance with the West Bengal Co-operative laws. If all the conditions of the laws are met, the society will induct him as a member.              
	Q:My father died intestate in 1955, leaving behind my brother and me. My mother is no more. I was married in May 1956. My brother died in 1999, He has three sons. Do I have any right to the property he has left behind? If yes, how do I proceed?        
	Jayanti Bhattacharjee, Calcutta                
	A: By virtue of Section 14(1) of The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, you do have a share in the property. You can file a suit for partition against your nephews before the civil court. But before that, please send them a legal notice for partition of the property.               
	Q:My father gifted my elder brother a house through a registered gift deed. Both my brother and his wife passed away intestate. They were childless. I have a sister too. Please guide us on how we may legally sell the property.        
	Manish Mukherjee, Hooghly, West Bengal                
	A: Since you are the heirs of your younger brother, you fall in the category of heirs of Class II under The Hindu Succession Act, 1956. So you have to apply to the district court for the grant of letters of administration. Once you get the necessary documents, you can establish your ownership and will be able to sell the property.        
	Q:My elder brother is the nominee in all the fixed deposits that my father holds. Shall I get a share of the investments if my father expires before they mature? If not, is there any legal remedy to ensure that I get a share?        
	Ashim Kumar Chatterjee, Sodepur, North 24 Parganas                
	A: If your father dies intestate (without making a will) your fathers legal heirs, including you, will inherit his assets. As his nominee, your brother will be entitled to receive the amount but will have to distribute the same to the legal heirs.

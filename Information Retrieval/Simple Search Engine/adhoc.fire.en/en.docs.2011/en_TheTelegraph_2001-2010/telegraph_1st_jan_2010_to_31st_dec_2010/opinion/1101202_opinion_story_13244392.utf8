	It is embarrassing to have to own up to a culture of violent fleshly crudeness. By itself, inclusion in a United Nations agencys programme aimed at making cities safe for women may even seem positive. But Delhi is one among only five cities selected from all over the world  the others being Cairo, Kigali, Port Moresby and Quito  for safety audits and identification of unsafe locations and situations in a bid to work out means to ensure womens safety in urban spaces. To be bracketed with the capitals of Papua New Guinea and Ecuador, for example, with Port Moresby being rated the worst city in the world by some agencies, is frankly shameful. With 402 rapes this year alone, excluding sexual harassment, molestation and other forms of public victimization of women, Delhi seems to be the capital of a country where sexual violence is routine. Although rape cases in Mumbai have gone up, last year it recorded 178 such cases to Delhis 452. A statewise count  that would exclude Delhi  for 2009, records 1,508 rape cases in Maharashtra, exceeded only by Madhya Pradesh with 2,900, West Bengal with 2,400 and Uttar Pradesh with 1,900. The single most obvious factor in this spiralling rise in crimes against women is the growing confidence among rapists that they will get away with it. Convictions are pitifully few, cases are too prolonged to be effective and, perhaps most important, the attitude of law enforcers is too casual, even dismissive of crimes against women.        
	The police will change only if the general ambience changes. It is not merely the spread of education, as in book learning, that will transform sexual attitudes and behaviour, although without education there would be no hope at all. Unless social practices and belief structures that reduce women to objects of exploitation are rooted out, there will be little difference. To have the police reiterate, in Goa for example, that foreigners should not go about in bikinis, is an embarrassment hard to face. Added to the old attitudes that excuse violent sexual behaviour in men is the spectacle of glittering violence offered by easily accessible forms of entertainment that fall strangely athwart inadequately exposed mindsets and an angry sense of inequalities. The problem needs full and urgent attention, whether in Delhi or in the rest of the country: touting its growth rate will not make India a leader.

	A History of Bangladesh By Willem van Schendel, Cambridge, Rs 495        
	Last month, the airport in Dhaka was renamed after Hazrat Shah Jalal, the 14th-century conqueror-turned-Sufi-saint who is credited with introducing Islam to what was then eastern Bengal. Around the same time, The Economist published a survey in which Dhaka was rated as the worlds second-worst city to live in  after Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe.        
	Renaming streets, other public utilities and monuments has been part of Bangladeshs politics almost since its birth. But invoking Shah Jalals name is different  it captures the new nations struggle to invent a cultural history that dates from a distant past. The Economist survey, by contrast, reflects the countrys present history with its focus on social, economic and environmental life in Bangladeshs capital city.        
	Most accounts of the country dwell largely on two aspects of Bangladesh  its abject poverty and its political-cultural search for an Islamic identity. Myths are invented through emphasis and omission, and competing versions of community imagined.        
	Willem van Schendels book is a refreshing change. Here is a narrative that looks at the past without attempting to create myths, and at the present without being judgmental. This is no easy task considering that Bangladeshs blood-soaked birth and the recent activities of its Islamic radicals make it difficult to write on the country dispassionately.        
	Van Schendel strikes a different note right at the beginning of his history. Conventional wisdom treats Bangladesh as a geographical absurdity. To van Schendel, Bangladeshs geography is crucial to the process of community-building that happened there over centuries.        
	Three forms of water  river, rain and sea  not only make up Bangladeshs natural environment but have also shaped its economic and cultural identities since ancient times. Floods and tidal storms may routinely destroy life and property in the country, but they also make its soil one of the richest on the earth. Living dangerously on waters edge, as the book shows, also made the people there perennially prone to migration, and exposed them to influences from other shores.        
	The book offers an interesting explanation as to why Islam emerged as the majority religion in this region, so far from the Arab world and surrounded on all sides by areas where Islam never had such an impact. Van Schendels thesis is that the geography and the agrarian frontier helped the Islamic Bengali identity remain strongly rooted in the deltas milieu. He also argues that the Mughal State did not have a policy of promoting Islam in Bengal. All this made it possible for a new blend of Islamic and Bengali worldviews to emerge in the land.        
	There are historians, though, who offer other explanations for the spread of Islam in the region. Richard M. Eaton, for instance, has argued that in the eastern delta  inhabited by communities lightly touched, if touched at all, by Hindu civilization  Islam came to be associated with State-recognized control of reclaimed land, the expansion of wet-rice cultivation, and literacy. Van Schendel, however, makes a distinction between the deltaic region and other parts of the land such as the Chittagong Hill Tracts, where the people were neither Muslim nor Bengali.        
	This search for an Islamic Bengali identity that dates back to the first writings of Muslim religious reformers in the 19th century shapes nation-building in Bangladesh even today. The book traces the history of this search through the colonial period, the Partition and then the birth of Bangladesh.         
	For a long time, at the heart of this quest for identity was the debate over language. Many educated Muslims and religious leaders refused to accept Bengali as an Islamic language. The lowly peasants steeped in Bengali culture, they argued, could not be accepted as true Muslims.        
	The pro-Bengali reformers sought to counter this by introducing what is known as Mussalmani Bengali. It was their attempt to Islamize Bengali by introducing Arabic and Persian terms.        
	But Bengali, after all, was the language of the masses and, after Partition, increasingly became a tool for stirring a new political nationalism, as opposed to the religious nationalism that triumphed in the creation of Pakistan.        
	One of the great strengths of van Schendels narrative is his recreation of the new nationalism that found a dramatic expression in the language movement of 1952. He captures not only the high points of the movement but also the process that was slowly nurturing it in so many different ways. There were political and economic reasons behind the popular resentment against Pakistani rule. But there were cultural currents that channelled and fed the anti-Pakistan sentiment. The roles that cultural organizations like Chhayanat and literary magazines like Bichitra played in sustaining the new linguistic nationalism come alive in the books sensitive but dispassionate portrayal of the period.        
	The same tone of a neutral but sympathetic analysis marks van Schendels account of the birth of the nation. Those familiar with the stories of the 1971 genocide by the Pakistani army might feel that the book does not quite capture the scale of the tragedy that saw millions killed and millions more forced to leave their homes and begin life as refugees in India.        
	More important, the massive waves of Hindus fleeing from Bangladesh left their mark on the nations subsequent struggles over its political and cultural identity. That struggle shows not only in the political rivalry between the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party but also in the recent attempts by other outfits, such as the Jamaat-e-Islami, and religious extremists to radicalize politics and culture in Bangladesh.        
	But there are completely new twists and turns today to the Bangladeshis search for identity and to their daily lives. With 150 million people, the country is bursting at the seams. But some 80 lakh Bangladeshis now live abroad and the migration stories have changed dramatically over the past four decades. Their encounters with the world keep changing the multiple frontiers of this old land. But, as van Schendel tells us, so much of the old still lives on in the floodplains where life continues to be about rice, fish and boats.

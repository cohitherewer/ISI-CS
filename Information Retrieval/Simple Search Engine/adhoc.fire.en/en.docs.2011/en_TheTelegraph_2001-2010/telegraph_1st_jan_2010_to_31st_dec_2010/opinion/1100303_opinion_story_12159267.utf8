	2moro n 2moro n 2moro, 2 B or not 2 B? Do U think that is the ? about todays English spelling? Professor David Crystal does, and he is a renowned expert on the language. But I suspect he is mistaken.        
	His argument is plausible. Thanks to the Internet, he says, for the first time in centuries anyones writings, and thus spelling, can reach the world unseen by proofreaders or editors. So new spellings could become widely accepted.        
	So back to the random spelling of 500 years ago? Possibly, Id say: many blogs are misspelt, yet wholly intelligible. But all Mr Crystal foresees is the slang of the Net (or of text-messaging, Id add) becoming the norm, and one set of conventions will replace another. Maybe, but IMHO  yes, even I know what that means  the professor, however expert in the dynamics of language, is less so in those of society.        
	He is wholly right to see our spelling as chaotic. But not in talking of a huge movement over hundreds of years to simplify it. Movement yes, huge no. Not, at least, since spelling was standardized in 18th-century Britain, a bit later in America: challenges to the results have been feeble.         
	And yet.... Countless new words have come in since then, new meanings for existing ones, new grammar, old nouns made into new verbs. New catchphrases are ten a penny, or a dime a dozen, as two old ones put it. All thanks to usage. Pedants may preach in horror, but what users want, users tend to get. And in time even purists accept most novelties. So wont spelling develop likewise?        
	Society has so far ignored would-be reformers, such as Bernard Shaw. But the process Mr Crystal foresees would be far easier than the enlarged alphabet of Shaws dreams, which implied new keyboards too; and less brutal than the wide changes sought by todays dreamers. Why shouldnt it happen?                
	Not now        
	Because society just wont bother. Sure, initials save space and time: why write megawatts when it could be MW? Breath too, if theyre spoken as written: mph or GPS, eg  or indeed eg. And more still if spoken as words in themselves, like Nato or Aids. But how many phrases turned into initials on the Net or mobile phone are common elsewhere? Lots of love, maybe  one sense of LOL that is, in fact, long pre-Net  but hardly in my humble opinion.        
	As for shorter spellings, I can see the charm of writing U for you, and the briefness of 24/7. But why 2moro? To save just three key-strokes? Shortening is not new: I was using wd and cd in personal letters 50 years ago. And journalists my age can recall things like t for the and tt for that; indeed, in priced-by-the-word cables much odder ones, such as llgo for will go. Yet Id never use wd or cd in any formal writing, and those old hacks usages have mostly died.        
	And the forces against change are huge. Even awful spellers accept that there are right spellings and wrong. However daft, the right ones  with a few transatlantic variations  are standard worldwide. If they werent, reading would be slower, hard-copy dictionaries almost unusable, whatever may be possible on the Net. Above all, though, we just like uniformity, useful or not. And plenty of writing still has to satisfy editors, proofreaders and other superiors.        
	Will society alter its habits just to suit bloggers and text-messagers? Not 2moro, I guess, nor even l8r. A recent email from a son of mine ended ROFL. I had to ask him what it meant. Text-savvy young readers may be ROFL at my ignorance. Yet how often do even they really need to write rolling on the floor laughing?

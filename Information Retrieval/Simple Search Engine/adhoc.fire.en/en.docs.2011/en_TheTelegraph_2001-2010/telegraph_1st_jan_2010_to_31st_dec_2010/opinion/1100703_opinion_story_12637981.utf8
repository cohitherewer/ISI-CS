The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | odes to tennis 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ODES TO TENNIS                                                           
	Apart from a fixation with love, tennis and poetry cannot be said to have much in common. But tennis at its classiest is being chronicled by a poet. There is an official poet-in-residence at Wimbledon this year, and Why not? asks Martina Navratilova, quite sensibly. If Pindar, in ancient Greece, could celebrate with an ode the victory of a certain Psaumis of Camarina in a chariot-race with mules, then there is nothing out of the way in Matt Harvey attempting to immortalize the Grandest of Slams thus: Its the whizz its the biz/ The temple where physics expresses its fizz/ Theres one word for tennis and that one word is/ Wimbledon. This does not sound particularly deathless, but its not meant to be Eng Lit  and its catching on. Mr Harvey is posting a poem every day on the Wimbledon website, and the readers comments, from all over the anglophone world (including Ethiopia), are very encouraging.         
	People are loving to read and listen to these poems on the radio on the way to work or school, and in response to Mr Harveys call for Wimbledon haikus from readers, almost 200 have poured in so far. Every aspect of the game, including the strawberries and cream, are being versified by Mr Harvey in a virtuosic range of metres and forms; the appeal of his poetry remains doggedly popular. It was Britain that invented the dreary figure of the Poet Laureate. But it was also Britain that lent to the taking of the Metro a different kind of fun by putting up bits of poetry in the trains.         
	So, those who lament the passing of poetry from modern life are perhaps looking in the wrong places. The Faber amp; Faber readership is not the only index of poetrys vitality. In the everyday lives of people, all over the world and across society, in work and play, buying and selling, mating and ruling, poetry  or heightened and rhythmically ordered language  continues to flow through a wide range of perfectly ordinary human activities and preoccupations. Think of football chants and hawkers cries, political slogans and graffiti, advertising jingles and lullabies. The writing of poems was part of weddings and births in many Bengali families not so long ago. And if one opens ones eyes and ears to the jostle for every kind of attention in Indian villages, towns and cities, then the performance poet  as Mr Harvey calls himself  could be said to have found a veritable haven in the subcontinent. In local trains out of Howrah, the selling of everything, from safety-pins to laxatives, inspires ear-splitting performances of improvised verse, which often have to compete with the heart-rending lyrics of visually challenged karaoke singers.        
	Almost in his 150th year, Tagore is up for grabs with renewed zeal in Bengal, which fought for bits of his beard and nails as he was being carried dead through Calcutta. In a state wilting under the burden of its poetry, there can be no better image for poetrys death-in-life or life-in-death.

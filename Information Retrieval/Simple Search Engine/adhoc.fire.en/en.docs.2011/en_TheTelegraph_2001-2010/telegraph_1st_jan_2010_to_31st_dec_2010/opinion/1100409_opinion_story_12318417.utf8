                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EASIER WAY                                                    
	It is astonishing what can go down in the name of political correctness. Get women to fill up a respectable number of seats in Parliament by hook or by crook, or it looks bad. Reserving seats for women in Parliament is exactly that, either hook or crook, because such a notion assails the very root of democratic politics. It also insults women by reducing them to a homogeneous mass of gender representatives, erasing parties, constituencies, disparate political struggles and ideologies, and different dreams. Besides, reserving seats narrows the field of competition, pitting women against women only, and presumably  because women are unlikely to be allowed to wander out of their reserved precincts  men against men. The last is the way they like it, but that is beside the point. The bill for one-third reservation of seats for women in Parliament creates these problems, while being unable to address those raised by its conscientious objectors.        
	There is obviously a need to rethink the bill, if necessary to redo it, for its intention is positive: to get more women to participate in politics and rise to decision-making positions. Evidently all options have not been explored. An alternative has been lying around since 2000, presented then as a private members bill, that proposes a sensible, unfussy alternative. For the sake of gender parity, the quota should be imposed on the different political parties. No party should have less than 40 per cent of either male or female candidates. This would automatically bring about a rise in the number of women contesting seats, and the competition would be open. The actual numbers of men and women respectively would vary in Parliament after each election, but that would reflect the peoples choice, not an imposed gender code. To institute this, the Representation of the People Act would need an amendment; that would be easier than a constitutional amendment. The conscientious objectors to the present bill would then have the freedom to teach by example and show the world how social justice actually works. The idea of imposing quotas within parties is not an entirely new one, although the private members bill in question works it out methodically. Parties have always evaded this option, which might suggest to the cynical that the game is to stall the change forever. No wonder the private members bill has been lying in storage since 2000.

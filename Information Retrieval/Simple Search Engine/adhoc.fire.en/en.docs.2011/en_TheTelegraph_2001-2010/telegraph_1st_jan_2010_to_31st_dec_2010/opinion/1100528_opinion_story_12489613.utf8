	Beatrice and Virgil: A Novel By Yann Martel, Hamish Hamilton, Rs 450        
	Is it possible to write a novel on representation? No, says Yann Martel at the beginning of his book, and then goes on to do just that. Henry, an author, writes a book on the representation of the Holocaust. Part fiction and part essay, it is to be presented in the form of a flip-book. The book is decimated by editors and experts before it can even be published. Devastated, Henry decides to give up writing. It is clearly an attempt to enlist the readers sympathy. It also anticipates much of the criticism one might have against the book.         
	One day, Henry receives a letter from a taxidermist, who sends him pages of an original play featuring a monkey called Virgil and a donkey called Beatrice. The play uses the extermination of animal species, called The Horrors, as a metaphor for the Holocaust. As the two animals meet their fate, Henry finds out the taxidermists terrible secret.         
	Beatrice echoes the novels central question, How are we going to talk about what happened to us one day when its over? Through fiction, Martel seems to argue, and the distance afforded by fiction. The reader must regard the book itself as an artefact instead of being subsumed in its created world. Henrys ill-fated flip-book is described in detail. The flow of the novels prose is interrupted by the dialogue of a play, by typewritten notes and pictorial representations of gestures.         
	Fiction lies folded within fiction and the figure of the author is replicated more than once. Henry is a Canadian author well known for his novel about real animals and figurative animals which instantly recalls Life of Pi. Animals, Henry explains, make for a useful allegorical device. That is how they will be used in this book as well. For a writer to create an author figure whose life closely resembles his own seems self-indulgent. To refer unabashedly to the success of an earlier book can only be called self-congratulatory. The darker parallel lies between Henry and the taxidermist, as both struggle to depict the Holocaust. Finally, there are Beatrice and Virgil, characters in a play who must decide how they will talk about their experiences. This set of parallels evokes conflicting ideas about fiction. For Beatrice and Virgil, it may be cathartic, a way of dealing with traumatic experiences. There is also the more troubling notion of writing as taxidermy, or the art of making the dead look good. Henry would craft the past into make-believe, just as the taxidermist preserves dead animals as works of art. Fiction, reduced to artifice, offers no solace and no salvation. Yet Martels novel is haunted by the idea of salvation.        
	In The Divine Comedy, Virgil guides Dante through inferno and purgatory and Beatrice guides him to paradise. But Dantes quest for salvation is a deeper one for love and knowledge, not just the mathematical negation of sin. Martel also cites large chunks of Gustave Flauberts story on St Julian the Hospitator. In this ironic fable, Julian, a bloodthirsty hunter, later reforms and is offered salvation. Although contrite about killing his parents, Julian remains unfazed by the butchering of animals. It is this lack of remorse that concerns Martel, he explains kindly.        
	Indeed, Martel kindly explains most things. All the dots are joined for the reader. The charm of reading a story and the subtlety of allegory are lost. What is elegant and self-reflexive turns pedantic and self-conscious. The taxidermists play is afflicted by inaction, as is much of this novel. Beatrice and Virgils dramatic conclusion appears to be wrought by an accidental fact, introduced last minute. In the end, the novel affirms the failure of representation in the face of profoundly disturbing experience. This may be the most poignant thing it says.

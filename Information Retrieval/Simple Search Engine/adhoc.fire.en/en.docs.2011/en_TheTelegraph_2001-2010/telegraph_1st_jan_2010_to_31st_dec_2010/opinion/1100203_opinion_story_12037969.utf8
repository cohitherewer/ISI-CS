	Accidently, Ive just mis-spelt that word, so Id better apologize publically  thereby committing in a single sentence two of the commonest spelling errors in written English.        
	I sympathize with those who commit them unwittingly. Both spellings are indeed wrong, yet there are plenty of adverbs that look just like them. And, if English spelling had any logic whatever, public would be among the countless adjectives ending in -ic that form their adverb not by adding the usual -ly but -ally.        
	Many of these adjectives have a good excuse: there is a parallel adjective, with the same root but ending -ical rather than -ic, so the -ically adverb is perfectly natural. Thus we have comic/comical, economic/economical, magic/magical, mystic/mystical, politic/political.        
	The resultant adverbs are a fine demonstration of the mongrel nature of English. Very often the root word is a noun from ancient Greek, and -ikos was a standard Greek way of turning nouns into adjectives. For that purpose, Latin typically used -alis. Hence our -ic and -al, often cheerfully combined into -ical. In contrast, our adverbial -ly is of Germanic origin. So we can end with all three sources in one word: typically is a typical example.        
	Sometimes these combinations cause no problem, because at least in todays English the -ic adjective does not exist: we dont say farcic, grammatic, identic, practic, or tyrannic. Sometimes an -ic version exists, but only as a noun  a cleric, a critic, a cynic, a heretic, using logic on their way to the clinic  not an adjective. So no adverb such as clericly is called for. In some cases, the -ic word can be both noun and adjective: classic, comic, magic, and mystic, for instance.                
	More trouble        
	There remains a very long list of words that end in -ic and have no -ical form: basic, caustic, despotic, dramatic, frantic, manic and specific were just the first few of the 25 or so that came to my mind in less than five minutes. There must be hundreds more. Why must we add -ally to turn these into adverbs, as if such words as basical, caustical or despotical existed?        
	Yet we do, and when both forms exist, we meet trouble if they have acquired divergent meanings. To take a politic decision does not mean you are deciding politically. To put it economically, monetarism is bunk: am I deriding that theory as a branch of economics, or just noting that Ive taken only three words to dismiss it in? Plainly, English should have -icly forms as well as -ically, which we seldom even pronounce in full.        
	Yet publicly is the only -icly adverb that I know (except franticly, which in theory is permissible, but is far, far rarer than frantically). The man who writes publically is mistaken, but he could quote umpteen similar words as an excuse for not realizing it.        
	Accidently is a much simpler affair. Granted, there are many adverbs such as recently or independently to mislead the unwary into that mis-spelling, but they do all come from adjectives ending in -ent. In contrast, the bad speller here is looking for the adverb of accidental, not accident, which doesnt even exist as an adjective (whereas both continent and continental, incident and incidental do).        
	So what is the mis-spellers excuse this time? There isnt much. But one reason, I suspect, is the very same sloppy pronunciation that allows us not unreasonably  to pronounce -ically as if it were -icly, in the many words Ive cited earlier. If cynically comes off the most learned tongues as cynicly, dont be too hard on the less learned writer who pronounces accidentally as accidently, and spells it accordingly.

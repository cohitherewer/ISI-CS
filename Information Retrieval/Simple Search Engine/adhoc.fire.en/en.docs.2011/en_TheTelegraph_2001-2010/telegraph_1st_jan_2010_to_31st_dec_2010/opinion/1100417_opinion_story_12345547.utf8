The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A different vision
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A DIFFERENT VISION                          - Although friendly towards India, Obamas priorities lie elsewhere					 					      Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                                                      
	It makes me cringe to see televised images of American presidents patronizingly patting visiting dignitaries double their age on the upper arm or back after shaking hands. Its just as nauseating when Indian officials boast breathlessly that the prime minister was granted a longer audience, with a few extra minutes bonus thrown in, and a warmer handshake (also a more resounding pat?) than any other leader in the whole wide world.        
	There was plenty of occasion for cringing and nausea all through a week that suggested that India might have to reconsider Afghanistans relevance to its security and choose the most fruitful theatre of partnership with the United States of America. That was the particular message for us from the biggest diplomatic gathering since the San Francisco conference that gave birth to the United Nations. Barack Obamas triumph was a foregone conclusion because no president or prime minister could stand up and say he or she opposed stopping terrorists from getting hold of nuclear material for a dirty bomb.        
	But the razzle-dazzle of invitation-only summitry was necessary for Obamas real purpose. He sought to isolate Iran and North Korea, deny them a voice and mobilize global support to force them to give up perceived nuclear ambitions. The backing of the three nuclear weapons countries that refuse to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty  India, Pakistan and Israel (though Benjamin Netanyahu sulked off-stage)  mattered in this context. The conference jubilantly pre-empted next months NPT meeting under UN auspices where Iran is bound to explode verbal bombs. It also gave Obama an asset that will stand him and his party in good stead in the November congressional elections and in his re-election campaign for 2012.              
	Obamas Afghan policy concerns India more. The media gloated, presumably on the basis of confidential briefings, that he scolded Yousaf Raza Gilani after listening to Manmohan Singh. But a lingering doubt remains that whether to attain his objectives he did not lead India up the garden path in respect of its expectations of an active civilian role in Afghanistan. That country may already have been franchised to a Pakistan that Hamid Karzai, with a weather-eye always open for how the wind blows, now calls his conjoined twin.        
	If Iran was Americas unwritten priority item on the agenda, Pakistan was Indias. By that token, India must have been Pakistans. To that extent the conference was a replay of all those Baghdad Pact and Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meetings where Asian members swore fervent loyalty not because they had the slightest intention of tilting at international communism but because they wanted American arms to further their own regional ambitions. International terrorism has replaced international communism as the unifying bogey.        
	Echoes of even more dusty history rumbled along the sidelines as India and Pakistan, squabbling claimants to the mantle of the winning side in the Great Game, continued to enact that drama all over again. But the moves this time round were under the watchful eye of the lone superpower whose own interest in Afghanistan will largely determine the interaction between the two subcontinental neighbours. American and Pakistani stakes in Afghanistan are easily explicable; but it is for India to decide whether that distant landlocked country is so crucial to the national interest as to make itself hostage to US-Pakistani diplomacy for it.        
	It has become a mantra for benign American officials to insist that US subcontinental policy is no longer hyphenated. It may not be in Washingtons thinking but it is never anything else in the minds of those at the receiving end. Continued F-16 sales to Pakistan, the billions of dollars allocated to secure nuclear arms and materials, and the presence of Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates (defence secretary) and the national security adviser, General James Jones (Shiv Shankar Menons strategic dialogue partner) at the dinner Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of joint chiefs of staff, hosted for Pakistans army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, are resented here. Obamas announcement to West Point cadets that the US would start to evacuate Afghanistan in July 2011 was also seen as a betrayal of the assurance earlier that day that Indias concerns would be borne in mind. There is nothing, but nothing, that the US can do in, with or for Pakistan that will not be judged in terms of the impact on India and faulted. Pakistan is no better but has less cause for complaint.        
	This is more than the petty obsession that vitiates media coverage to which K.P. Nayar drew attention in these columns on Wednesday. Obsession it certainly is and can descend to pettiness such as grumbling about the compliments lavished on Kayani or Obama telling Gilani that he was very fond of Pakistan, having visited the country during college. The underlying truth is we have always known that despite public outbursts of anti-Americanism, militaristic Pakistan makes itself useful to the US in ways that pluralistic democratic India can never bring itself to do.         
	A State department memorandum acknowledged in the Forties that from the military point of view, the countries of South Asia excepting Pakistan have, under present and prospective conditions, little value to the US. While India was of negligible positive strategic importance, Pakistan occupied one of the most strategic areas in the world for securing West Asias oil and allowing ideological and intelligence penetration of, as well as air operations against, the Soviet Union. Olaf Caroe also stressed these advantages to justify the Baghdad Pact; US diplomats reiterated them at another conference in 1951. The target has changed, not the concept or method.        
	Meanwhile, Rising India has other claims to attention which the US has acknowledged handsomely. George W. Bush admitted with a pragmatic candour that old-fashioned South Block mandarins apparently find embarrassing that Indias expanding market for every import from pizzas to nuclear reactors is an irresistible attraction. So is Indias strategic potential in the Indian and Pacific oceans where Americans remain wary of Chinas ambitions. The India-US reprocessing arrangement, albeit belated, confirms that Obama has not abandoned his predecessors friendliness even if his immediate priorities are elsewhere and he has a different vision of the partnership with India.        
	If official Indian claims are to be believed, the US has so far condoned (or even welcomed) Indias civilian presence, fortified by a $1.3 billion budget, in Afghanistan. Obama probably believes he can persuade Pakistan to share the franchise and cooperate with India. That is where American optimism falls short of Asian reality. When it comes to the crunch, the president will have no option but to back Pakistan and its perhaps by then reconstructed Taliban allies. An India that does not agree to resume the dialogue with Pakistan can have no role in that reconstituted Afghanistan.              
	The general belief here that Afghanistan enables Pakistan to send jihadis into Jammu and Kashmir and otherwise harass India recalls a conversation with Lee Kuan Yew when he vigorously denied Chinas responsibility for hostile Pakistani actions. Pakistanis didnt need China for that, he argued. Enmity was inherent in their Muslim fundamentalism; it was something visceral in them. Similarly, Pakistans conduct in Jammu and Kashmir was much the same even before US policy allowed it to become entrenched in Afghanistan.        
	At a recent meeting in Londons Chatham House, a senior British diplomatist wondered why India needed 26  his figure  consulates in Afghanistan. It was not for me to suggest that whatever the number, their raison dtre probably lies at least partly in the successor States historic memory of a time when India controlled the Durand Line and seated and unseated Afghan amirs.The time may have come to forget the past and take a hard look at contemporary geopolitical reality. India might conclude then that it stands to gain more by cutting its losses in Afghanistan and consolidating the economic and strategic relationship with the US.       sunandadr@yahoo.co.in

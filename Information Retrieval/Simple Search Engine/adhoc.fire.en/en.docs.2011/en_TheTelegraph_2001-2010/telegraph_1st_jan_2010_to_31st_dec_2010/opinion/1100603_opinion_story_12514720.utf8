                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CHAMPION OF CHAMPIONS                                  Raju Mukherji                              
	With Viswanathan Anand winning the World Chess Championship for the fourth time (twice in a row), there is a growing tendency among some sport-lovers to regard him as the best-ever Indian sportsman. There are valid reasons to rate Anand as the finest sportsman that India has ever produced. But let us not forget those other magnificent people who have done wonders for India in the world of sports.         
	The first man from India to win a world championship crown was the great wrestler, Gama Pehalwan, way back in 1910. Although there was no official wrestling championship among professional wrestlers at the turn of the 20th century, it is a fact that Gama Pehalwan did defeat the best among the heavy-weight wrestlers from Europe and America.        
	The first Indian sportsman who earned universal plaudits was the hockey legend, Dhyan Chand. The Olympic Games are considered to be the acme of sports. Despite the stiff competition, between 1928 and 1936, Dhyan Chand and his band of men brought India three gold medals in succession at Amsterdam, Los Angeles and Berlin. By 1948, at the London Olympics, Dhyan Chand had retired. But he left behind a legacy that continued to bring India the Olympic gold till 1956.        
	Another man who kindled tremendous interest in India was the magnificent mountaineer, Tenzing Norgay. When the British Everest expedition under John Hunt began the climb, Tenzing was merely a sherpa labourer who was expected to carry the heavy luggage. During the final stretches, the courageous Kiwi climber, Edmund Hillary, realized that he needed the one and only Tenzing to succeed. Thanks to Tenzings superlative approach, bravery and immaculate technique, the pair made it to the top. Tenzing was the man who literally put India on the top of the world.                
	Sagely conduct        
	Our billiards and snooker heroes have made us proud over the years. Wilson Jones started the trend of conquering the world, and was followed by Michael Ferreira, Manoj Kothari and Geet Sethi. The fairly recent achievement of Abhinav Bindra, who won the Olympic gold medal in rifle-shooting, is another outstanding milestone in Indias sporting history.        
	Viswanathan Anands achievement surely ranks among the best-ever Indian performance in the world of sports. He is in a class of his own: a matchless wonder and a man of high principles. It is because of men like him that we Indians can walk tall. Chess is a sport that has received very little assistance from sponsors. Initially, it was known as chaturanga. It went over to Persia and returned home as shatranj. Today, chess is almost a forgotten sport in the land of its birth. Hopefully, Anands success will spur Indians to produce champions in the future.        
	However, the person who has the right to claim to be the best-ever Indian sports personality is not a man but a woman. She hails from a state that is not famous. Therein lies the misfortune. Most of us do not even know that there exists a young lady by the name of Mary Kom from Manipur in Northeast India. She has won the womens World Boxing title for four  yes four  years in succession.        
	No other Indian sports personality can claim to have won a world title four times in a row. She is up there with the very best. Kom has no sponsors, not even a highly-placed job. Moreover, she has hardly received any media coverage or official assistance from any quarters. It is a shame that we have not given the lady the honour and the recognition she deserves. The greatest thing about her is that she is not even concerned about awards and pecuniary benefits. She is not only a champion, she is also a sage.

	How to go about killing mankind                 
	On killing: The psychological cost of learning to kill in war and society (Back Bay, Rs 595) by Dave Grossman is a revised and updated version of the original work that seeks to explore scientifically the basis of slaughter in human society, and the methods that the military employs to goad soldiers to overcome their hesitancy to commit the act. Killing is taboo, even for soldiers in the theatre of war, and the military institutions have devised and perfected methods of psychological conditioning to enable men kill during combat. These strategies include incorporating elements such as physical distance, authority, group absolution and so on to ease the associated stress. For instance, during the horrific air raids on Hamburg and Dresden in the closing stages of World War II, the avenging pilots, gunners, navigators and bombardiers were able to mitigate their guilt by the virtue of their physical distance from the site of destruction. But such acts have a collateral consequence, which, Grossman writes, is mirrored by the escalating violence in modern societies that are being plagued by suicide bombings and school shootings. Although Grossmans repeated emphasis on the link between sex and aggression appears incongruous at times, this book does answer a few questions about the darkness that resides in us all.                                  
	Where girls dare (Penguin, Rs 150) by Bhavna Chauhan chronicles the ups and downs in the lives of 52 Lady Cadets, who are being trained along with 400 Gentleman Cadets to become army officers. The men and women endure numerous hardships  push-ups, front rolls, figures-of-eight and night marches  but their spirits remain high. Chauhan also shows how women candidates in the army have to fight sneering men who believe that the former are not good enough. But, unfortunately, this intriguing line of enquiry remains underdeveloped. Consequently, Where Girls Dare is mildly entertaining but intellectually vacuous.                        
	Understanding dementia: Disease, treatment amp; care (Connectiva, Rs 275) has been edited by Shyamal K. Das and is an authentic collection of articles on fundamental issues related to dementia. The contributors delve on the definition, causes, symptoms and diagnoses as well as on the role of care-givers and research on this dreaded condition. Given the debilitating effects of dementia, this is a book of considerable import.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | waiting for a verdict
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WAITING FOR A VERDICT                                                          
	It is said that one of the dictums of the former prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, was that not finding a solution is also a solution. If this sounds too cynical and characteristic of a prime minister who disliked taking decisions unless he was forced to, it is important to remember that there are problems in life which are insoluble or not susceptible to any resolution. The case over the title deed of the land on which Babri Masjid stood appears to be one such. The Allahabad High Court was to have ruled on the matter yesterday and was perhaps saved by the bell with a stay order emanating from the Supreme Court. The matter is now in limbo and there is no guarantee that it will be dealt with on September 28, the time frame set by the apex court. There are grounds to believe, as many do, that it would have been better if the verdict had been given instead of having been postponed for an indefinite period.        
	There are two issues thrown up by the case that deserve some comment. The court has been asked to deliberate and comment on whether the plot was Rams birthplace and also on whether Muslims prayed in the structure which was seen as a mosque. Neither of these issues pertain to law; they are matters of history. Judges are trained in law and jurisprudence and therefore have the expertise to pass judgment on legal matters. Judges are not trained historians, archaeologists or specialists in architecture. Yet the court will have to pronounce on such matters and its opinion will have the seal of authority and be treated as fact. The other issue concerns the shivers of fear experienced by the government at the prospect of a court verdict on the Ayodhya issue. This fear points to the perceived absence of respect for the rule of law in India. It is apprehended that interested parties, affected by the verdict one way or the other, would incite violence. In other words, there are people in India who have little or no respect for the courts of law and the verdicts they give. Such people think that they can undermine a court judgment through sectarian violence. There exists enough evidence in contemporary India to argue that such fears are not baseless. This only shows how fragile and shallow the roots of democracy are in India.        
	That the judgment on Ayodhya preoccupies the official and the public minds is also a comment on the priorities that prevail in India. There are so many problems in the country but the one that excites the strongest emotions relates to a plot of land over which a dispute has been created by divisive and vested interests. The importance ascribed to the Ayodhya judgment is an indicator that the Indian mind is obsessed with communal issues. Very little has been done to eradicate that obsession. On the contrary, political parties like to perpetuate it since it enables them to play with religion for electoral purposes. This will not go away, whatever be the courts verdict and whenever it is delivered.

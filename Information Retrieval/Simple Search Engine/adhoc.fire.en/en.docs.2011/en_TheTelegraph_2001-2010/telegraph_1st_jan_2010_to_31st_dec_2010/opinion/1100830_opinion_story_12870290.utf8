	The news is as bad for children as it is for women. Crimes against women and children have increased quite sharply since last year. National Crime Records Bureau estimates show that crimes against children, including murder, rape and abduction have risen by 7.6 per cent. Kidnapping alone has grown by 30 per cent. The Centre has asked all states to set up a special desk in each police station that will deal exclusively with crimes against women and children. This is a logical enough response. There is no dearth of laws for the protection of women, although that does not seem to deter violence against them. But it seems sensible to try and ensure that womens complaints are recorded and investigated properly.         
	But child-specific laws are inadequate and often vague. For example, while there are penalties for custodial rape, minor marriage and child labour, there is no law against child abuse, sexual or otherwise. Perhaps to compensate for the nations indifference to the rights and happiness of its children, the women and child development ministry has asked that the police be sensitized with regard to crimes against children, register first information reports quickly, investigate and ready chargesheets within three months, while counselling the child and reassuring the family. It is good to aim for an ideal world. But special desks or cells to help women are not unknown, and the police have been sensitized many times. Women are still insulted and turned away, even when they have a complaint of rape. Maybe the police do not have the resources to follow up these crimes  there are either too many of them or they are unimportant. Will children be considered more valuable? Will Nithari never happen again?

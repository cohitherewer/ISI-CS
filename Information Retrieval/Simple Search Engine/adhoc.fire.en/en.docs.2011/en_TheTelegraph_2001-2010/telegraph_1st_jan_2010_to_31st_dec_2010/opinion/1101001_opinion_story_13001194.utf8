	Wait for me!: Memoirs of the Youngest Mitford Sister By Deborah Devonshire, John Murray, 20              
	The six Mitford sisters were daughters of Lord Redesdale. They had one brother  Tom  who died in the Second World War. The girls  all for very different reasons  have become part of the history of the British aristocracy. Nancy, the eldest, became a well known novelist and writer. Unity became close to Hitler and tried to shoot herself when Britain and Germany went to war. She never recovered completely from her self-inflicted injury. Diana first married into the Guinness family and then fell in love with Oswald Mosley, the fascist. They married, and she had to spend the Second World War in prison. Jessica turned to communism and lived in California. Pam, the second sister, had an otherwise undistinguished life but like all her other sisters was a part of the London social scene. The youngest Deborah, as the duchess of Devonshire, has had the most stable life of the six.        
	Privilege, wealth and living in the country created their own cocooned world. The girls all had special names by which they called one another. At the beginning of this book, Deborah Devonshire (she was known as Debo among her friends but was always Stubby to her parents, Hen to Jessica, Swiny to Unity and Nine and Miss and lost more to Nancy) has to provide a special note to explain the family names to the readers. Their mother was Muv and their father, Farve. The prevalence and the preponderance of these nicknames, which lasted all through their adult lives, are a clue to the enchanted place that was their childhood and youth.        
	It is no surprise that the best parts of these memoirs are those that concern Deborahs childhood and growing up.        
	Deborah was born on March 31, 1920. Her mothers engagement book reveals a blank on that day. The arrival of a sixth daughter was not worth recording. Nancy, then 16 years old, wrote to her mother: How disgusting of the poor darling to go and be a girl. Deborah grew up in Asthall, a typical Cotswold manor with a garden that descended to the river, Windrush. The children loved the house where they lived for seven years, and according to the author those were the happiest years of their lives, both for the parents and the children.        
	It was in Asthall and its surrounding countryside that Deborah imbibed her lifelong love for the country and for outdoor life. This book evokes the almost idyllic rural world between the two great wars. This evocation is not redolent like Evelyn Waughs Brideshead Revisited, but it is done simply with a few choice, but irreplaceable, words. Deborah has this rare gift as a writer  to be evocative without being over the top. This gives to her account a dash of realism so vital to any remembrance of things past.        
	From Asthall Manor, the family moved to Swinbrook House, originally a farmhouse that Lord Redesdale had converted into a house. The depression of 1929 brought about a sharp decline in Lord Redesdales fortunes, and the family had to move to a smaller house till in 1931, with an improvement in the familys fortunes, it was possible to move back to Swinbrook House.        
	These years are unforgettably described. The love and the friendship between the sisters and their mother is evident. Lord Redesdale was a gruff man who probably had a heart of gold. The only book he had read in his life was White Fang, and he described any man who read books as a literary cove. Deborah was his favourite.        
	The book takes a different turn as Deborah enters the London social scene just before World War II. It becomes a whirl of dinner parties, balls and visits to nightclubs. It was during this time that Deborah met Alexander Cavendish, the second son of the 10th duke of Devonshire. For Deborah, it was love at first sight.        
	The Second World War marks the great divide in Deborahs life. She got married to Alexander, but much more important was the break-up between Farve and Muv. The cause of the separation was none other than Adolf Hitler. Muv had met Hitler through Unity and didnt think he was all that bad. There was also Unitys attempted suicide and Dianas imprisonment. But the war also saw the death of many of Deborahs close friends and relatives who died in combat, many heroically. They included Alexanders elder brother, and thus Alexander and Deborah came to inherit the Devonshire title and fortunes. The most terrible news came, however, many years after the war and after Nancys death in 1973. It was revealed from the official documentation that during the war Nancy had actually denounced Diana to the secret service.        
	Deborah recreates the war years when every young man in Britain feared he was going to die soon. Every night a couple went out, they thought it was their last time together. Her account captures the alarm, the desperation and the fierce patriotism.        
	In her recollection of the post-war years, especially the account of doing up Chatsworth, the Devonshire pile. Deborah becomes more self-conscious of her own position.         
	The chapter describing the last years of her five sisters is poignant without even a hint of sentimentality. The bonds of love and sharing ring true.        
	The mood of the book is elegiac. Deborah is aware of her privileged life and is almost always conscious of the good fortune of her birth, her marriage and her circumstances. The book is so full of humour and joie de vivre that it is impossible to believe that she is 90.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OPEN SECRET                                                    
	It is no secret that war is a messy affair. What is less obvious, however, is how tantalizingly messy it could get. Close to 400,000 classified documents placed in the public domain by the whistleblower website, WikiLeaks, reveal the secret workings of two of the most devastating wars of this century  waged on Iraq and Afghanistan by the United States of America. For instance, the records detailing the circumstances leading to casualties are often baffling. Apart from enemies killing one another, a striking number of deaths occurred under friendly fire. In one incident, trigger-happy US marines gunned down Iraqi policemen who merely wished to help them defuse a bomb, while an Iraqi torture squad, known as the Wolf Brigade, systematically terrorized other Iraqis. Beyond the sheer variety of the violence inflicted, the mutual paranoia is truly shocking.        
	But shock has long lost its edge in a world that is in the grip of an unending war on terror. Post-Abu Ghraib, the unimaginable is now very firmly within the realm of the imagination  not merely of the warmongers but also of lesser mortals. So the long march of figures  declaring the number of dead, injured or missing  in these documents only confirms an open secret. It was long feared by human-rights activists all over the world that the US was abetting the use of torture in its wars on terror. Even after President Barack Obama shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison camp and the clandestine detention centres (black sites) run by the Central Investigation Agency, there was suspicion that US troops were turning a blind eye to torture carried out by Iraqi police officers on Iraqi citizens. The situation was exacerbated by the US policy of keeping clear of Iraqi operations unless explicitly asked to intervene. So incidents of abuse were wilfully suppressed, or ignored, by US soldiers. Taliban leaders were apparently captured and killed without trial by a black unit of special forces. Even the acquisition of deadly surface-to-air missiles by the Taliban was quietly covered up. The irony is now deepened by the fact that Mr Obamas exit plan from Iraq hinges crucially on the training of Iraqi policemen and security forces by the US army. By failing to act decisively on the crimes perpetrated by Iraqi forces on their countrymen, the US marines have set a poor example before the very people they were supposed to liberate from the dark ages by teaching them the virtues of justice, compassion and expertise.

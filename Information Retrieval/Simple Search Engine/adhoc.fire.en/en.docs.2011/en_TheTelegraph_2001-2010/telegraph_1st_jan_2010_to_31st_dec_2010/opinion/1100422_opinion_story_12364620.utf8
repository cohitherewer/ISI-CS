	Mukul Sangma could not have asked for a better birthday gift. He was sworn in as Meghalayas chief minister on his birthday. But the circumstances which led to the fall of his predecessor, D.D. Lapang, do not make it a happy beginning for Mr Sangma. Dissidence within the ruling party or coalition is common in the Northeast. Unstable coalitions make the tenures of chief ministers far more uncertain than elsewhere in the country. But Meghalaya seems to have become the worst example of political instability. When Mr Sangma took over from Mr Lapang, whose term lasted less than a year, he became the 22nd chief minister of the state. As in the latest case, the changes of guard rarely had anything to do with policy or issues of governance. It is routine for elected representatives to change their loyalty from one leader to another or from one party to another. The result is that leaders are more concerned with keeping their flock intact than with governing the state.        
	All this has taken its toll on the development agenda for the state. Unlike several other states in the region, Meghalaya is free from any major ethnic insurgency and the violence that goes with it. There have been smaller insurgent groups, but their impact has been limited. Yet the states leaders have failed to capitalize on peace and use it to pursue development goals. Mr Sangma now has an opportunity to do this, especially in areas such as tourism and hydel power generation. The states high literacy level also makes it eminently suitable for investments in new technologies. Mr Sangmas promise of involving the youth in development raises hopes of a new approach. But there have been others before him who sought to use the youth, not for development, but to build a support base for themselves. What Mr Sangma can do depends, though, on how long his present supporters in the party keep him in his job.

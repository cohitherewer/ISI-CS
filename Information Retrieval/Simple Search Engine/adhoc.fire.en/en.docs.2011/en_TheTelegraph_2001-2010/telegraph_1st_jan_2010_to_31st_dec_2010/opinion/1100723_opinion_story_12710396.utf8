                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN THE DARK AGES                                  Bona Fide - Malvika Singh                              
	India seems to be slipping out of the structure of a democratic nation state. The citizens, following the example of those who rule, have begun to disregard and disrespect all the norms of a civil society built on the tenets of fraternity, equality, secularism and liberty of thinking. We have descended into a dark age of our own making. The slightest murmur of protest against the corrupt around us is met with murder, death or some such horror. Dissent and debate are dying, opposition is stalled using ruthless means, and every wrong is celebrated. There is only one saving grace  the people, ordinary citizens across all strata and communities of the country.        
	A man protests against illegal mining and is shot dead by assailants on a motorcycle using country-made guns. The public knows who the obvious culprits are but the law-enforcement agencies are either protecting the criminals and their mentors or just happen to be incompetent. At the same moment, in the exalted corridors of power and decision-making, regulations for mining contracts, making dams and the like are waived and illegalities permitted in the name of a required rate of economic growth.         
	Both acts have similarities that are frightening, and it is this fact that adds strength to those who use the guns and grenades to get what they want. I asked a taxi driver why he was demanding more than what the meter was recording and proceeded to give him a short lecture on honesty. He stopped me with this  Why dont you lecture our leaders first, madam? We need to survive and what I am asking for as extra is a pittance. It is not in any way comparable to the crores that are harap karo-ed by those who ask for our votes once in every five years. They extract what belongs to us every day. I was silenced.                
	Come together        
	Protest, opposition, debates for and against specific issues  are disregarded by those at the helm, aided and abetted by the administrators of their governments. We who raise the many issues on different platforms in the public domain, which is falling into various traps as a result of conscious decisions that are thoughtlessly implemented for short-term gain alone, are condescendingly categorized as the jhola brigade, which is against growth.         
	This is nonsense and needs to be rejected outright because the disconnected India Brigade has been far more detrimental for this country than those who understand, listen, care and are willing to dump one set of failed premises to look for inclusive alternatives within the restructuring processes of this economy.        
	Most of the lieutenants in our economist brigade, lateral entrants into the political system, have been too disconnected from the turmoil, trials and tribulations of India and Bharat to even begin to comprehend the complexities of a plural, diverse and complicated polity that is transiting into a new age of growth, development and globalization.         
	Changing aspirations, real imperatives, urgent demands, more immediate, honest attention, and a redressal system that is led by a profound commitment to deliver through mechanisms that are dependent on integrity and good sense are a few things that are urgently needed. Text book formulae that may have worked elsewhere in the world are likely to be ineffective in our layered and complicated landscape that is crying out for innovative and area-specific solutions.         
	Creativity seems dead in the arena of our politics and administration. The intellectual, cultural and spiritual energies of those outside the operating system are ignored. Till the two sides come together with no pre-conceived agendas, truthfully and with sincere commitment, India will continue to slide.

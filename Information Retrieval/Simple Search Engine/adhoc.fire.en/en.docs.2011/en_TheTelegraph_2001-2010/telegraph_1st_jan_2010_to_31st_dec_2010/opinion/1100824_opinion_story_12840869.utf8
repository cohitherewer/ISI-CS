The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A thing of beauty, enjoyed for a while
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A THING OF BEAUTY, ENJOYED FOR A WHILE                                  Since classical traditions are beginning to show signs of decline in India, it is time to reinvent the teaching of music so as to make it part of a holistic system of education                                            
	One of the most perceptive remarks about Hindustani classical music can be found in Sheila Dhars essay, The Raga: An Inward Journey, in her book, Ragan Josh: Stories from a Musical Life. After acknowledging the rigorous and arduous process of taalim that every student of music must undergo, Dhar comes up with a stinging proviso in her typical manner. To the connoisseur, she observes pithily, a voice is only as beautiful as what it conveys.        
	The wisdom of her comment is likely to escape much of the present generation of learners, performers and teachers of Hindustani music. In this age of the virtuoso, the stress invariably falls on skill to the exclusion of all else. In the endlessly proliferating talent-hunt shows on television, participants are expected show off their stock acrobatic skills in the few minutes allotted to them. So voice-training becomes sacrosanct, as though that is all there is to excellence in singing.        
	Ironically, many of the contestants claim to have a firmly classical base. They are well versed in the physical realities of music-making, especially in the ways of using their voice to the best of their advantage. However, that leaves the challenge of conveying the essence of a raga  to invoke a lazy, although useful, word  unresolved. What can a voice, quickened by diligent practice but not sharpened by thought, convey?        
	This leads to the tricky, if controversial, question as to whether Hindustani classical music can at all be taught within an institutional framework. Until Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande wrote his musicological treatises in the early years of the 20th century, the teaching and learning of Hindustani music were largely a matter of interpersonal relations between the guru and the shishya. In the absence of fixed rules or notations, each gharana went on to create, and zealously protect, its own version of the canon. In his pioneering works, Bhatkhande standardized existing anomalies in ragas and talas, introduced a system of notation, and helped preserve a body of knowledge that could, till his time, only be transmitted orally or aurally.        
	However, in his quest for consensus and harmony, Bhatkhande did not disavow the primacy of gurumukhi shikshya  the mode of learning that is premised, at one level quite literally, on the idea of receiving face-to-face instruction from the guru. At another level, this pedagogic tradition puts an absolute emphasis on the need to imitate the teacher scrupulously. As Indian classical music is chiefly concerned with spiritual communion, it demands a form of inner sophistication that cannot be supplied by textbooks or notation sheets. The latter may effectively open out the self-enclosed, and often severely elitist, world of gharanedar taalim to the masses, but talent can never ensure affective membership to a milieu in which a sweet or a supple voice must be enlivened by a fine sensibility for it to produce any meaning.        
	In its purest form, gurumukhi teaching imparts many skills that are ancillary, but imperative, to the actual act of music-making  it enhances the power of attention, tests the limits of patience, and inculcates humility while discouraging abject reverence. In spite of his respect for the guru, the shishya is, after a certain stage, expected to come into his own, to find his voice, literally and figuratively. So, unlike Western classical music, which is governed by fixed notations and is less conducive to experimentation, Hindustani classical music is premised on improvisation and a lively exercise of the imagination. Sadly, equal opportunity for all to avail themselves of the privilege of learning a difficult art must be accompanied, inevitably, by a spiritual dumbing down leading to a levelling, and even decline, of standards.        
	Some form of familiarity with theory and rote-learning can produce competent singers good enough for TV shows. But the sentimental education and the development of personality that are crucial to the making of an artist, or even a connoisseur, can only take place in the privacy of the music room  where the guru, and not the textbook, is the law.                    SOMAK GHOSHAL

	Forgotten route                  
	 Sir  I hail from the village of Ghat Rangamati in Purulia. I wish The Telegraph had reported on the deplorable condition of the bus route from Chatna, in Bankura, to Ghat Rangamati via Jhantipahari. I havent seen a worse road in my life, and its condition has not changed in the last four years. Even the authorities dont know when things will improve. Just before the last general elections, we were promised better roads but nothing seems to have changed. So much for development in Maoist-infested belts.          
	Yours faithfully,        Partha Pratim Goswami, Kharagpur
        
	Expected result          
	Sir  In his article, Unexpected outcome (July 19), Ashok Mitra has analysed the results of the 2010 Fifa World Cup and offered a new perspective.The success of European nations in football lies in their balanced approach and strategy. European nations are also richer in experience. This makes teams like Spain and the Netherlands more methodical in their approach. Contrastingly, Latin American countries are guided by passion and exuberance. Hence, they often fail to rise to the occasion.          
	There is another factor that has resulted in Latin American and European nations performing differently in this World Cup. Most of the talented Latin American players play for clubs in Western Europe throughout the year. Hence, the players become tired and dispirited while playing for their own country. As a result, despite various game plans and strategies, they failed miserably. As for the Europeans, they played with passion and only to win the trophy. This helped them outperform their rivals from South America who depended solely on flamboyance.                    
	Yours faithfully,
  Saroj Upadhyay, Calcutta 
          
	Sir  Ashok Mitra offered an insightful assessment of this years football World Cup. But a closer look would show that the Latin American countries were never the real contenders for the trophy on this occasion. The ultimate champion, Spain, is the reigning European champion. The Spanish club, Barcelona, is also the best club side in the world currently. Six players of that club turned out for Spain in this World Cup. As against this, the Latin American teams possessed one or two brilliant players but lacked teamwork. Better cohesion among players in teams like Spain and the Netherlands led to their success. Latin American countries had failed to perform well in the 2006 World Cup as well. Both the finalists were from Europe, and Italy emerged as the world champion. The outcome of the 2010 World Cup may have left many football enthusiasts with broken hearts, but it was not altogether unexpected.                    
	Yours faithfully,         Sanjit Ghatak, Calcutta              
	Sir  Ashok Mitra seems to be unhappy with South Africa for staging the soccer World Cup. Mitra wonders what the host country would do with its gorgeous, now-empty, stadia on which it has invested heavily. He further adds, The stadia are no answer to the worklessness of thousands....          
	When a poorer country like communist China  South Africa ranks higher in per capita gross domestic product compared to China, according to the International Monetary Fund index  built stadiums at a huge cost during the Olympics, why didnt Mitra raise the issue of worklessness? China has high unemployment among its rural, migrant workers. Yet, the Beijing Olympics was flaunted as a symbol of Chinas progress.          
	Yours faithfully, 
  Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

	Governments in India have for long regulated many economic and other activities within the framework of the Constitution and the laws passed by the Central or state legislatures. Since no law can be so detailed that it covers all the complexities of implementation, rules and regulations are framed to enable governments to give flesh to the skeletons of overall policies. During the four decades or so when India was committed to a socialistic pattern of society, ministers and their bureaucrats developed regulations that controlled almost every aspect of economic activity. There was much abuse of these powers; favours were given to some, bribes smoothed the way for many, nepotism was common, financial and other support to political mentors was the price for some. This continues despite liberalization and the withdrawal of government from many areas of control. This is because decisions that could enable large profits were taken in an opaque manner. There was considerable discretion given to ministers and bureaucrats, easily subject to misuse.         
	Independent regulators were created to get over this difficulty. The first regulator who took over many of the governments powers was the Reserve Bank of India, though it remained ultimately subservient to the finance minister and his office. The RBI determined monetary policy. Though there is no legislation that gives it the mandate, it uses monetary policy (money supply, interest rates) to keep inflation within limits. It also manages the external value of the rupee by buying and selling foreign currencies and increasing and decreasing the flow of rupees. It also regulates the different financial institutions. There were other regulatory bodies like the Tariff Commission that set import duties, the Forward Markets Commission that dealt with commodity futures trading, the railway rates tribunal, the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission. Some of these no longer exist and their tasks are carried out by departments of government behind closed doors. Others, such as the MRTPC have been subsumed under the Competition Commission and the various consumer tribunals.         
	However, liberalization, the freer rein given to private enterprise and the opening up of the economy to foreign investment and foreign competition resulted in large investments by private parties in sectors, many of which were natural monopolies. Natural monopolies gave much scope for exploitation through high prices, low quality, poor service and so on. Though these were common when government enterprises dominated a sector, the entry of private investment led to independent regulators being appointed to decide on many issues that could otherwise lead to misuse or abuse of power. Public sector exploitation was acceptable; private sector exploitation had to be controlled.        
	It is a toss-up as to whether the most successful new industry in recent years is telecommunications or information technology. A recent article in The Economic and Political Weekly by Paranjoy Guha Thakurta and Akshat Kaushal says: The Indian telecom market is currently the second largest in the world (after China).... Call rates in India today are among the lowest in the world if not the lowest. The Indian information technology industry is a major contributor to employment, exports, and to Indias image as a country whose people are very bright, easily trained and who acquire advanced skills without difficulty.        
	The government had little role in the growth of the IT industry. It is said to have grown as it did because it escaped the attention of the Indian bureaucracy that was technologically illiterate and, not knowing the potential, was not able to stifle its growth by detailed regulation. In telecom the article mentioned earlier says: There were at least three scandals that preceded the current one (2010) in which allegations of corruption, nepotism and crony capitalism were levelled. These flip-flops in decisions may in fact have helped the spectacular growth of the sector. The Raja-Radia revelations are of a different order. A few businesses were immensely profited (witnessed by resale prices of licences), and a powerful minister profited from his decisions.         
	This might lead to the erroneous conclusion that no regulation is better than detailed regulation, and the view that flip-flops in decisionmaking are only adjustments made to facilitate faster growth. Transparency, objectivity, predictability, reasoned decisions are vital if the institution of government is not to be discredited. It has been so discredited by the recent revelations in the Radia tapes.         
	In recent years, electricity tariffs have been determined by state electricity regulatory commissions which are expected to examine the costs as submitted by the distribution companies (mainly fuel and power purchase as well as operating costs). Some state-level regulators, particularly in Delhi and Maharashtra, presumably to gain appreciation from the political powers, have denied legitimate costs or postponed their recovery by calling them regulatory assets. This has caused financial strain to the utilities. It postpones tariff rises to future consumers and in a period of rising fuel and power costs, those are unlikely to ever be recovered. The Delhi electricity regulatory commission, advising the Delhi state government on these issues that were unilaterally postponed by a former DERC chairman, who insisted on tariff being reduced when costs indicated raising them, has given a report. Among other things it says: Analysis of the Audited Accounts of the distribution licensees would indicate that the net shortfall in respect of the year 2008-09 was about Rs 450 crores, for the year 2009-10 about Rs 1720 crores and for the six months from April to September, 2010 about Rs 2300 crores. Thus, it would be quite obvious that in the absence of tariff revision, there is a growing revenue gap which is to be funded out of borrowings which are increasing from year to year.        
	Electricity regulators who deny recovery through tariffs of costs already incurred, are putting avoidable financial burdens on the utility and on future consumers who will have to pay for past costs. Regulators in their enthusiasm have also taken steps to introduce retail competition without ensuring adequate supplies. Failure to be objective and take all facts into account leads to bad decisions.        
	Similarly, regulators avoid decisions. This is seen with the microfinance industry where the lack of regulation led to some microfinance institutions charging extortionate rates of interest, giving multiple loans to the same financially weak borrower with little capacity to repay  and that when banks have made loans to the institutions without adequate diligence. The RBI should have set out regulations that could have prevented such a disastrous outcome, as in Andhra Pradesh where microfinance has virtually collapsed.         
	Another instance of regulatory failure is the decision of Sebi that virtually knocked distributors of mutual funds out of the business, with customers having to do their own homework on the relative merits of different funds. The result has been the sharp fall in the amount of money flowing into funds.              
	The lessons are clear. Ministerial and bureaucratic discretion in matters that can give large financial benefits to third parties should be taken in public, transparently and objectively. Political and populist considerations must not affect regulatory decisions. For this, it is essential that regulators, who will not be easily influenced by government officials and politicians, are selected. There must be an overseeing body that scrutinizes allegations against regulators and a strong system of penalties for those found guilty.

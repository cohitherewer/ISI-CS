	BRIDESHEAD ABBREVIATED: THE DIGESTED READ OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY  By John Crace, Random House, Rs 599  
	This is one of the funniest books of the year. Very few write parodies with the aplomb that John Crace commands. He has no icons and worships at no altar. He shows his respect through what ancient Hindus called virodha bhakti.  
	Craces gifts lie in the manner in which he touches the right register and tone of the novel he is trying to send-off. He does this successfully most of the time and in a few hundred words. His repertoire varies from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and 98 other novels that fall in between.        
	To illustrate the point take this beginning of Craces rendering of Heart of Darkness: The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm and the only thing for it was to wait for the turn of tide. The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mysteries of an unknown earth!The dreams of me, the germs of empires. Or with this which readers of Evelyn Waugh will not take a moment to recognize: I had been there; first with Sebastian more than twenty years before on a cloudless day in June, when the ditches were creamy with meadowsweet and the sentences heavy with nostalgia.        
	There is not only clever imitation of style but also perhaps the hint of criticism as the words, the sentences heavy with nostalgia, would tend to suggest. In an odd choice  John le Carrs early novel, Call for the Dead  Crace brings into play events extraneous to the book to indicate lines of criticism: Some of the plotting had rather stretched credulity and the characterisation had been thinner than hed hoped. But it was more than a decent start and his career as Alec Guinness was under way. Crace suggests here how the success of Guinnesss depiction of George Smiley on television helped the revival of le Carrs first two novels (in both of which Smiley is the main character) which had been forgotten.        
	Sometimes, the parody doesnt work at all. The best example of this is one of The Hound of the Baskervilles. No reader of the Holmes canon, even those who do not quite like the sleuth of Baker Street, will be able to accept his use of the f-word directed at Watson. Holmes didnt speak or think in those terms.        
	The occasional lapses dont take away from the joy the book provides. Rather, they point to the difficult task that Crace has undertaken. The book covers the 20th century and is divided into 10 decades. Crace believes that there will be very little quarrel regarding 80 of the 100 he has chosen. Many readers will disagree with him when he asserts that in any other decade save the 1950s The Leopard would have made the list. The 1950s were too crowded. Disagreements are part of the enjoyment of this book which is a readers delight.

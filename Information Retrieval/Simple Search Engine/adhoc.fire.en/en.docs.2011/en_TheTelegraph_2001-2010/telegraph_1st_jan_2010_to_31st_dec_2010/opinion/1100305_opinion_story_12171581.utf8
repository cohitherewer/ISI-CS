                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LEADER WITH A VISION                                  BONA FIDE - Malvika Singh                              
	The protests in the public domain over genetically modified food has managed to bring the debate to the forefront, and compelled some strategic thinking before the final decision. The truly draconian draft, prepared by the ministry of science and technology in 2008, of the regulatory bill for such products has also come under severe scrutiny. It has clauses that belong to past eras of dictatorial regimes and tinpot potentates. Whoever drafted the bill did not comprehend the basic tenets of a federal democracy, and made a mockery of all that India stands for. For those in power to say that it is merely a draft or the law ministry will look at every clause with a magnifying glass is not enough. We know that many such clauses are deliberately introduced somewhere in the depths of endless paragraphs, hoping they will go unnoticed when the bill is placed in the House. More often than not, India resorts to a very strange and untenable form of voting by voice-vote instead of pressing the button. This is most undemocratic, deeply flawed and, therefore, unacceptable in 2010.        
	We are fortunate that there are leaders who win and lose elections and are not nominated, who are accessible to public opinion and to open, inclusive dialogue. When governments are desperate to push through acts and ordinances, one is forced to be suspicious of their intent and to wonder whether they favour a few rather than the millions. Poverty has, unfortunately, allowed disconnected technocrats to have a free-run and, in some instances, the policies have been hugely detrimental for the larger good. There is much condescension among those who rule with the assumption that the electorate is illiterate and unlettered. They forget that it is profoundly philosophical, highly experienced in the realities on the ground, and is able to surmount the worst forms of exploitation, neglect as well as unacceptable shortages. The people have been skilled by tradition handed down through generations. They know far more than the decision-makers who sit behind closed doors, guarded by kowtowing babus.                
	Perfect balance        
	Our economic advisors have spent the better part of their learning lives in the sterile climes of overseas institutions. With their expertise on alien processes and methodologies, they are now trying to superimpose such systems on an unsuspecting mass of people without similar privileges. Many of them are completely disconnected from the real and tangible India. This is why it was essential for the government to have a counterpoint in the garb of the National Advisory Committee that was chaired by Sonia Gandhi. It is ironic that the Indian amongst the ruling elite, committed to addressing the fundamentals and to alleviating the abject distress of a majority of Indians, is a person who came here as a young bride, put down her roots and rose to political heights.        
	Sonia Gandhi cannot be faulted on her astute instincts about what is right and wrong, and what needs deliberation. She is firm and cautious at the same time. She does not waver from her basic values. She does not aspire for hollow, Western sensibilities knowing fully well that India is resilient, but needs an efficient infrastructure to take the entrepreneurial spirit to levels that could determine the trend for the world to follow. The rich, advanced nations are looking for alternatives to their wasteful societies and deteriorating environments. If we do not follow those failed trajectories, we may be able to salvage the bits and pieces that will ensure sustainable growth within our own cultural realities. Sonia Gandhi comprehends that truth, commands the stature and remains the unmatched conscience of the Congress and what lies beyond.

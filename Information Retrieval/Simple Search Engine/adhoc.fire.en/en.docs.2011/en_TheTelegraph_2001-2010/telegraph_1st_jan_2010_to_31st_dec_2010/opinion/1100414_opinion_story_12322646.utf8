	Uneasy relations                  
	Sir  Ashok Gangulys article, Neighbourly caution (April 7), was both consistent in its arguments and appealing. The sentiments that gave rise to the creation of Pakistan in 1947 may not have subsided yet. The formation of Bangladesh, which resulted in the disintegration of Pakistan, is a historic reality. Over the last one-and-a-half decades, the AfPak soil has been used as a nursery for planning historys worst ever terror strikes. The Lashkar-e-Toiba, Hizb-ul Mujahideen and their ilk have taken to mindless genocide. The Afghanistan crisis has become complex, not only because of the vested interests of individuals and groups within the country, but also because of the shortsighted and selfish nature of the global leadership.          
	Moreover, some disgruntled elements have continued to receive patronage from the Pakistani establishment. A State with as many disorganized power centres as Pakistan has is bound to fail. America and China have a big role to play in taming the evil forces. Ultimately, the demand for democracy among the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan will be responsible for unravelling this tangle. India, on its part, should also make a determined effort to reach out to the saner elements in the subcontinent as well as overseas.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Gangulys analysis of the situation in our neighbourhood is absolutely right. But India must remember that its neighbour is not just Pakistan but also China, which was openly supportive of Pakistan during the Bangladesh war of 1971. Even after all these years, Indias relationship with China is fraught with suspicion. Within Pakistan, the anti-India rhetoric is the glue that unites all political parties.           
	Abdul Qadeer Khan, the pioneer of Pakistans nuclear programme, remains a revered figure among many sections of Pakistanis even though he confessed that he had sold the countrys valuable nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea. Clearly, the world would have been safer had Khan been stopped before he turned into a nuclear proliferator. Several other nations, which had been backing Pakistans nuclear plan in its initial phase, are now worried that a bomb made in that country may reach terrorists hands.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Merit list          
	Sir  Sarmila Boses suggestions on the womens reservation bill are worth taking note of (A far better option, April 7). The arguments put forward in the article are not only logical but can also be implemented very easily. However, I have one objection to what the author suggests. She says that gender quotas should be extended to the Rajya Sabha and the legislative councils. This, I think, would not be in the best interest of the country. Quotas at the entry level are necessary and welcome. But higher posts should occupied only by those who are suitably qualified for, and deserving of, such positions. Imagine the outcome if quotas were enforced in the Indian cricket team, or in the teams sent to the Olympics.          
	The Parliament is the place where Indias future is shaped; it should be in the hands of learned experts, and not be flooded with people who would not have been there but for the quota system. For similar reasons, all forms of reservation in institutes of higher learning should be discontinued. Finally, why not amend the Representation of the People Act to make it mandatory for candidates to have at least a a graduate degree from a recognized institution in order to be eligible to contest any election?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The report on the Chinese hackers on the front page of The Telegraph was quite exhaustive (Chinese hack India secrets, April 7). Hackers are smart and intelligent people. Being an ethical hacker myself, I believe that the Indian government should change its policy regarding information technology. It should hire ethical hackers and work closely with them to protect sensitive data, as the American and Chinese governments have done. Only a hacker can fix the loopholes, if any, in important networks. India has suffered attacks on its servers even in the past  sensitive information from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre had been compromised by Pakistani hackers. But it seems that the Indian government has not learnt a lesson.          
	Yours faithfully,

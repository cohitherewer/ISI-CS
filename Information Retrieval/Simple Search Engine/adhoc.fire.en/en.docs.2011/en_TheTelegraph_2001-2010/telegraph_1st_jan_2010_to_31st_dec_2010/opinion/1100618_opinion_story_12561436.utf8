                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Power play                  
	Sir  The role of Sharad Pawar was suspect from the day he backed Lalit Modi in the scandal surrounding the Indian Premier League. It has now been revealed that the Union minister and his family, including daughter Supriya Sule, a member of Parliament, own a 16 per cent stake in the Pune-based City Corporation Limited (Builder lands Pawar in IPL fix, June 5). The company allegedly bid for the Pune IPL team.           
	Pawar is a controversial political figure in India, but he has remained unscathed so far. The Congress, which needs Pawars support to run the coalition government in the Centre, is scared to move against him, although it has already distanced itself from the present controversy. Pawar would do better to hand in his resignation, the way Shashi Tharoor did. As minister for agriculture, Pawar is a liability to the United Progressive Alliance government. Such politicians do not fulfil their responsibilities but hold on to power. For the sake of clean governance, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh should ask him to resign from his post.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,

	Sir  It is unfortunate that Shashi Tharoor had to give up his post as minister of state for supporting a particular bidder for an IPL team. Meanwhile, the Union minister, A. Raja, who is allegedly involved in questionable dealings over the issuing of spectrum licences, continues to enjoy the protection of his party. Thanks to the coalition politics at the Centre, his position as minister has remained intact.          
	Sharad Pawars offences are far more serious than those committed by Tharoor. However, he is likely to escape unharmed. In an ideal world, all men should be judged equally and face the consequences of their actions. Unfortunately, in the world of politics, all are equal but some are more equal than others.           
	Yours faithfully,      
K. Venkataraman, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  Taking advantage of the recent allegations against Sharad Pawar, the Bharatiya Janata Party has attacked him for suppressing facts and has demanded his immediate resignation.          
	In their response, Pawar and his daughter have come up with the excuse that they had no role in the bidding (Only stakeholder, not bidder,June 7). According to reports, it was done by Aniruddha Deshpande, the managing director of the Pune-based company, in his personal capacity. Deshpande had been permitted to do so by the companys board of directors. This decision is suspect, since the documents submitted for the bid are in the companys name and not in Deshpandes. In the event of any tussle between the bidders and the franchise, the company, and not the individual, would be deemed answerable.           
	It will be extremely difficult for Pawar to wriggle out of this tangle. He has already lost a lot of credibility and seriously embarrassed the Congress. Revelations of this nature may open up many more cases of the cricketing top brass being involved in the IPL scam. The Congress will have its hands full dealing with the peccadilloes of its coalition partners.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Rita Bose, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sules claims that they were not involved in the IPL bids are unconvincing. It is high time Pawar resigns on moral grounds. During his tenure as the agriculture minister, gross mismanagement has led to soaring food prices. The prime minister must ask him to resign immediately and institute an inquiry into the matter under the Central Bureau of Investigation. A joint parliamentary committee should also be formed to examine the case. Perhaps it would be a good idea to scrap the IPL altogether.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Two steps back          
	Sir  As the editorial, The lotus eaters (June 6), observed, West Bengal lives in the past. This is reflected in its work culture, the general attitude of its inhabitants and in the narrow-mindedness of its politicians. Although born and brought up in Calcutta, I have spent all my working life in Kerala. Even when there was a communist government in power in Kerala, the work culture was driven by independent thinking.           
	The media in West Bengal are also partly to blame. Things looked brighter in 2004 but a sustained campaign by political parties, the media and non-government organizations succeeded in keeping industry away from West Bengal.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Dhruba Basu, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Death and the network
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DEATH AND THE NETWORK                          - The Facebook hauntings        Mrinal Pande                                                  
	On July 18, Kara Swisher of All Things Digital announced that Facebook, the worlds biggest social networking site (34.8 per cent of all Net users, 630 billion page views per week), will be launching a series called Facebook Stories. These would be special articles contributed by members on topics ranging from finding love, to coping with grief. This, she said, was a special marketing plan to celebrate the number of the sites users touching the 500 million mark. A day later, a truly weird story surfaced. It seems that because of a glitch in software programming, messages from and about some dead members are still doing the rounds and startling the recipients as they land in their mailboxes.         
	Social networking sites have been routinely shuffling information about birthdays and anniversaries of its members and passing them on in an effort to nudge friends to send good wishes to each other like, well, good friends. So far so good. But recently, a young, Texas-based, female member of Facebook got a message that asked her to get in touch with another member, a family friend dead since April. The request is said to have spooked the young lady totally. It was like he was coming back from the dead, she said.              
	In the real world full of all age groups, death has been around for long. To the aged and the ageing, it is a word signifying the end of all meaning, a void filled with nothingness. It denotes the ultimate absurdity of human life being beyond defiance, definition or approach. Ancient civilizations have, therefore, learnt to clothe it in elaborate rituals developed through the centuries for consoling the living. They throw gigantic death feasts, maintain long vigils with a constant flow of food and wine , even arrange for surreal and stylized mourning by hired mourners or rudalis.         
	Writers from Donne to Kafka, Kabir to Premchand have resorted to black humour when writing about the D word, and Martin Amis, while reminiscing about the death of his father, Kingsley Amis, suddenly veers into black comedy as he tells us how in birth, two people enter the hospital room and three come out, while in death a person goes in and none comes out. Ha ha ha.        
	Facebook has not yet learnt to laugh at death in order to get over its atavistic fear of the phenomenon. Death is the new kid on the block here. Come to think of it, the block itself is also brand new. Facebook was launched only in February 2004, and so has reacted to the report of the unwelcome haunting with the grim earnestness of the techno-savvy young. Its spokesperson has explained that Facebook has been grappling with the problem of segregating dead members from the living ones, but is strapped by a phenomenal rise in the numbers and has not yet found a good solution.        
	The spokeswoman adds solemnly that death is a very sensitive topic and with people passing away each day, we are never going to be perfect at catching it. However, a method for separating and preserving the pages featuring the dead will be found soon, and a sort of cyber-shrine will come up where people can pay tribute to their dead friends.        
	The virtual world, by and large, finds it hard to grapple with topics like death. It is non-meaningful, non-graphic , cannot be reconnected to by clicking on a key, and does not move in predictable algorithmic patterns. So far, acknowledging death in networking sites, so full of pranksters and perverts, has meant erasing the profile of the deceased member, of course after properly ascertaining that the poor sod was dead. But that still leaves untouched the problem of sudden, unforeseen hauntings. Facebook is now reportedly considering scanning repeated postings of good old phrases like Rest in peace or How we/I miss you and introducing them in the software about the deceased persons preserved images in the virtual world, and then also despatching, to quote the spokesperson, a human to investigate that account.              
	Actual dying, as all who have lost parents and loved ones know, is non-negotiable. By remaining an awesomely lonely, unplanned activity like real mourning, it teaches all who are witness to a death to create a respectful space around the one that actually faces it. The sorry spectacle of Jade Goodys death on our TV screens proved that it is gross to try and make a reality show out of, or foist a grand meaning on, the slow snuffing out of a human life.         
	As she lay dying, my mother, ever the irreverent writer, fought for her human dignity with a rare cunning and grace. When the doctor she was inordinately fond of asked her gently if she had considered donating her eyes, she winked at us, smiled broadly, and said, With my husbands first wife already up there with him, do you think I would be foolish enough to leave my corneas behind? But we knew, and she knew, what was coming , and we let her carry on the banter.         
	The hospital was full of her fans and as she was wheeled in and out of the ICU, she would regale us and her nurses with stories and witty asides about fellow patients and their relatives who sought her autograph in the ICU. She knew that laughter, like those green screens they put around her as they drained the fluids from her stomach, might make it easier for us to distance ourselves from the slow closing of the final chapters of her life. They would also prevent those well-meaning but misguided efforts families make at organizing a loved ones last days around a fake comfort zone full of flowers and morphine. She was gracious about our needs, I now realize, so that even though it didnt matter to her any more, she let us arrange flowers in her room, play her favourite music and drape cheerful shawls around her.               
	Actual death, my dear Facebookers, like memorializing a truly dear person, is something no one will be able to turn into a socially enjoyable event. Leave it be.

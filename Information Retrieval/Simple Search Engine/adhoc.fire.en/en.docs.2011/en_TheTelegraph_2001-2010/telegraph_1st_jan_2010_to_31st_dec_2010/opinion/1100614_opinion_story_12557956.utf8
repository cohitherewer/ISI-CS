	The television screens are full of images of grown-up men running about in shorts and running after a ball like hyperactive kids. And if there is a country that has gone crazy about them, it is South Africa. Its children are running after anyone in shorts in the hope that he is a football star; many of the shorts-covered whites turn out to be just Argentinian fans bent on seeing their familiar team in a strange land. The children are blowing on big plastic cones making rude noises that might just pass for sporty music. It is a huge, chaotic street show; but before it ends, South Africa would have made a few billions out of it. It is the latest export industry  an industry that requires nothing more than a few stadia.        
	India has plenty of them  even in otherwise unknown places like Mohali. It has a game with an international following  cricket. It has a genius of an organizer in Lalit Modi. He organized a tournament whose turnover could rival that of football tournaments. And what happened to him? He was kicked out and accused of criminal acts. He was replaced by an industrialist whose normal occupation is running a chemical factory. A Central minister was accused of having invested in a cricket team; for some strange reason, he and his daughter have vehemently denied any connection with the team. Meanwhile, Indian cricketers have gone round the world and lost every game they could be expected to win. They have certainly won the race to the bottom.        
	Why is it that South Africa, a country that is perhaps run even less well than India, can do a decent job out of a game which it does not play all that well while India makes such a fine mess out of a game it claims to be good at? A facetious answer would be that every country gets what it wants. India is the worlds biggest market for scandal, and will turn the most solemn event into a sensation. Bowlers dancing their way to the wicket and fielders diving for a catch are only props; the real action is in the toilets, where punters place bets on who will make the first boundary without hitting the ball and tip the toilet attendant to keep quiet about it. A more serious answer would be that Indians are more concerned with what others are doing wrong than what they themselves are doing right. Their abiding trust in their compatriots corruptibility makes them superb individualists; but acting together is something they still have to master. Mr Modi may be a superb entrepreneur, Sharad Pawar a consummate politician and Chirayu Amin a good manager. But together, they fall. The World Cup will give Indians good training in watching. What they need now is for someone to come and train them in listening.

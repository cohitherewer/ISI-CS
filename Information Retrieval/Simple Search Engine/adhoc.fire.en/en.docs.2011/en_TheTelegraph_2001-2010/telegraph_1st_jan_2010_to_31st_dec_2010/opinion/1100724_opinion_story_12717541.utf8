	Barack Obama, the man who has the most important job in the world, rules over a nation of more than 300 million people. But one of his countrymen, a 26-year-old billionaire called Mark Zuckerberg, has an even more exalted empire to run: one with 500 million subjects (and still counting) from every nation across the whole wide world. If Facebook were a country, then, with more than half a billion inhabitants, it would have been the third largest in the world. But that says next to nothing of its fabled powers. Facebook has already captivated 35 per cent of the worlds internet users (thats 8 per cent of the global population) with the promise of much more than 15 minutes of fame: it confers nothing short of immortality on those who devote hour after precious hour of their lives to it  recently, users got messages urging them to reconnect with long dead friends whose profiles had not been deleted from the social networking site. On a less sinister note, Facebook is the cyber mirror on the wall before which one must preen, resplendent in the daily trivia of ones all-important life, fishing for compliments, sympathy, or even a smiley (that would do just as well). So the prospect of a morning at the dentists, woefully announced on Facebook, may elicit a great many hugs and kisses. But such unexciting news can also assume epic significance for, say, ones vilest enemies, or less dramatically, for burglars waiting for a chance to break in. As a thief-turned-Methodist-minister recently explained, having 900 friends on Facebook means that many nosey people keeping a tab on every petty detail of ones life.        
	Yet, in its earliest avatar, Facebook was designed by Mr Zuckerberg and his friends as a dating site only for the students of Harvard University. After its huge popularity among the young, it was opened to the public in 2006, and that, in a way, diminished its value for many overnight. Since then, privacy and safety concerns have increasingly plagued Facebook. So by shedding its elitist membership policy to become inclusive, Facebook actually risked virulent opposition from its own patrons. That, perhaps, is one of the first lessons of democracy  in order to make half a billion friends, one has to make as many, or even more, enemies.         
	Apart from contributing a new vocabulary to the English language  the Oxford University Press recognized unfriend as The Word of the Year in 2009  Facebook has transformed society and politics. (Mr Obama launched a spirited campaign on it while running for the presidency). Yet, it also has deadening potentials. Addiction to Facebook can lead to doom, sometimes with a comic twist. A burglar (once again) in West Virginia could not resist checking his account from a house he had broken into. The poor chap was traced back by the police from the information he had left behind. He was caught in the trap laid by the temptation to be always on. That may, perhaps, be a good reason to unfriend Facebook forever.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | New Garia and beyond
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NEW GARIA AND BEYOND                                                                  
	I was waiting for the Metro at the peak of the rush hour, that time of day Bengalis dourly refer to as office time, when a train, ten minutes late, sighed wearily into the platform. As I pushed my way in, I noticed a family  parents with two boys  rushing down the stairs, dashing through the sea of bags, umbrellas and lunch boxes, and squeezing themselves into the compartment in the nick of time.        
	The boys, snot dribbling out of their noses, were in giggles after this heady adventure; even their mother, wrapped in a heavily sequinned sari and resplendent in the glitter of faux gold, joined them shyly. But the father, panting heavily, his paunch all a-tremble, looked stricken. Turning to the man next to him, he asked hoarsely, Eta Garia jabe, dada? (Is this going to Garia?) The man, who had witnessed the turbulent entry with amused disdain, raised his voice dramatically and replied, Sudhu Garia keno, Bongaon, Lakshmikantapur, Budge Budge, shob jaygay jabe. (Why Garia alone, it will also go to Bongaon, Lakshmikantapur, Budge Budge, everywhere.) There was a ripple of laughter, followed by an appreciative murmur for this comic relief. People forgot the pushing and grumbling, if only for a while.        
	The extended Metro route has exposed, among the myriad technical failures, some telling features of the urban psyche. The underground is a region of morbid fascination. Suicides prefer it in overwhelming numbers. In spite of trains being derailed, the threat of suffocation, and the odd chance of being sliced by doors going berserk, people cannot resist its pull. The Metro ignites the Death Instinct among urbanites. It also brings out a peculiar streak of hostility in city-dwellers, a resentment, bordering on xenophobia, of people from the fringes invading the precious order of civilized life.        
	The incident above captures the condescension that Big City usually reserves for Small Town. Every disruption, disorder and disharmony is put down to the encroachers  who pollute the spirit of modernity that is an intrinsic part of a citys perception of itself. The assumption is that city people are incapable of transgressing the norms of decent behaviour, just as the suburbans are predisposed to flouting every rule of decorum.        
	As one of the vital links between the town and the city, the Metro has, in a way, defiled urban space by bringing several improprieties into the lives of people who regard themselves as the proper citizens of the metropolis and, therefore, as exclusively entitled to enjoying the privileges of metropolitan life. The civilian urban population is easily, and terribly, offended by the intrusion of the uncivil suburban lot. The average city-dweller may not be as outspoken as the gentleman above, but he does manage to convey his disapproval in subtle ways. While the chivalrous Bengali office-goer taking the Metro will usually concede his seat to an elderly middle-class man or woman, the same courtesy is routinely denied, or grudgingly extended, to a dehati man or woman, who may be no less old or infirm.        
	But the Metro is also a leveller of sorts. Running from the outskirts right across the heart of the city, it forges a symbolic meeting ground for the MNC employee and her domestic help. Yet, it is far from being the proverbial melting pot; at least, not yet. As a mode of transport that throws together people from disparate walks of life, the Metro bristles with a barely suppressed tension. In the underground, battle lines are constantly being drawn  between the sexes, between the classes, between the entitled and the intruders. Yet, the city itself is pushing against its limits and merging with the town, as housing crisis and real-estate prices force the respectable into the suburbs. Modernity, that many-faced monster, seems to be having the last laugh.                    SOMAK GHOSHAL

	Cinema, Emergence, and the Films of Satyajit Ray By Keya Ganguly, University of California Press, $24.95        
	Satyajit Ray, for all his worldwide fame, has never attracted the scholarly attention lavished on his Western peers. Keya Gangulys stimulating, rigorously argued and potentially controversial study of Rays cinema, therefore, deserves a warm welcome. Ganguly teaches cultural studies and comparative literature at the University of Minnesota, and her view of Ray is sharply opposed to powerful trends in Indian film studies. She not only declares Ray to be the most accomplished Indian filmmaker to date  there are places where one would be lynched for saying that!  but claims that Ray was an avant-garde artist, whose work cannot be studied in isolation from the international flowering of art cinema in the middle decades of the 20th century. And a properly transnational approach to Rays cinema, she adds, should draw upon the theoretical writings of European artists and intellectuals, from Sergei Eisenstein to Siegfried Kracauer and Theodor Adorno.         
	Whether or not one agrees entirely with these contentions, they make a refreshing change from current academic dogma, which tends to dismiss Ray as a reformist liberal whose patrician and timidly realist films acquired their fame largely because their maker was championed, for other than aesthetic reasons, by the Indian State and a motley crowd of Western admirers. Gangulys book powerfully challenges such ideas with comprehensive critical discussions of Apur Sansar, Jalsaghar, Devi, Mahanagar, Charulata and Ghare Baire, arguing that these films incorporate subtle but profound critiques of capitalist modernity. Ultimately, for all their differences in location, background and interests, Ray, Ganguly asserts, was responding to the same actual material pressures that European theorists such as Adorno were confronting in their own contexts, and this is evident from Rays formal and narratological strategies. Her Ray is not just a filmmaker, but also a social thinker of a high order.        
	The discussion proceeds in reverse chronological order, beginning with Ghare Baire and ending with Apur Sansar. Not having the space to outline her views on each film, I shall focus on a very personal selection. Let me start with Gangulys analysis of Ghare Baire, a film that tends to perplex even Rays staunchest admirers. Rays characterization of Bimala seems to be flat, she argues, because the director was intent on depicting her as a virtual commodity, enmeshed in a complicated world ruled by commodity fetishism. Bimala, Ganguly claims, serves as a cipher of the social, and her presence on the screen exists in tension less with other people than with other objects, exhibiting the luminosity of the still life rather than the roundedness of real historical personalities. She is, in short, a thing among things rather than the tragic but fully personified symbol of the new woman that most viewers expect her to be. This is an interesting argument and gains from a perceptive contrast with the figure of Bouthan, although one wonders how the male characters, on whom Ganguly says relatively little, would fit into the scheme.        
	Also, Gangulys suggestion that Ray implies a utopian dimension to Bimalas catastrophic fate remains an assertion inspired by Walter Benjamin, rather than an argument supported by evidence from the film. There are similar strengths and problems with the chapter on Devi. Ganguly argues that the film rejects extreme idolatry as well as secular cosmopolitanism, implicitly supporting an enlightened attitude to the divine as it embodies principles of nature, force and consciousness. That is a plausible interpretation, but the evidence cited  the care with which the rituals of the puja are depicted in the film and the inclusion of shyama-sangeet  is surely inadequate. (Incidentally, the song, Ebar torey chinechhi ma, which Ganguly attributes to Ramprasad Sen, was actually written by Ray himself.)        
	Although Ganguly does not usually refer to European cinema to support her theses on Ray, she makes some excellent points when she does. I was struck, for instance, by her remarks on the interesting parallels between Rays Mahanagar and Fritz Langs Metropolis. Both films, Ganguly argues, are concerned with the fate of ordinary people in a corporate world and, consequently, the future of humanity, although Rays film, despite its controversial happy ending, is far more pessimistic about the possibility of vanquishing the machine or the corporation. Rays cinema, she claims, was not animated by an exclusively intellectual engagement with the visual image but sought to expose the historical and social contradictions that govern the production of art.        
	That argument is broadly persuasive and I applaud the rigour with which Ganguly tries to substantiate it in her book. I doubt, however, whether an exclusively Marxist approach can sufficiently illuminate Rays work. Many of Rays ideas about the vexations and possibilities of modernity were profoundly liberal, and unfashionable as liberalism might be amongst radical American academics, it may be a more useful ideological perspective from which to approach Rays work. Ganguly would also do well to reconsider her total lack of interest in Rays biographical, historical and psychological contexts: decoding history purely from texts, again, may be fashionable among theorists, but does it truly produce more robust interpretations than what Ganguly contemptuously dismisses as largely conventional text-in-context interpretations?         
	Despite such issues, however, Cinema, Emergence, and the Films of Satyajit Ray is a rewarding study. It complicates and enriches our understanding of Rays art and, less directly, of cinema itself. It is only fair to add, though, that those who do not share Gangulys familiarity with critical theory may find this a difficult, even exhausting, book. It is full of insights and perceptive observations, but they are almost always buried under mountains of scholarly jargon and convoluted prose. This is not an argument against using theory, it is simply a plea for clarity. Surely its not unreasonable to expect a book about Ray to emulate some of the grace and lucidity with which its subject expressed complicated ideas?

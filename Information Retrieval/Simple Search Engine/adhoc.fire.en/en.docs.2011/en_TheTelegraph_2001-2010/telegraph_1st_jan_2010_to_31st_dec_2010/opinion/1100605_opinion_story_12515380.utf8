	Rabindranath Tagores Raktakarabi is always a challenge for directors and choreographers. Madhuboni Chatterjee, a sensitive Bharatnatyam dancer, interpreted this unique play imaginatively at the G.D. Birla Sabhagar on May 28. She brought out Raja, the antagonist in the story, from behind the iron curtain and tried to show that each character in the play was an individual shade of the king himself. The idea of using Kathakali costume for Raja, played by Manoj Murali Nayar, was effective. The story, narrating the oppression of humanity by greed and power, was told through mime, mask, music, dialogue and dance. Chatterjee as Nandini looked graceful in a golden costume. Aniruddha Chakladars make-up deserves a special mention. Sanchayan Ghoshs stage design allowed the choreographer to treat the entire production as an installation.        
	Jahar Das as Adhyapak was brilliant. His theatrical background made his character faithful and restrained. He also assisted in directing this production. Monoj Murali Nayar composed the music. Kathakali choreography was by Kalamandalam Muralidharan Nayar. However, a more skilled group of dancers was needed to do justice to it. Joy Sens light designing often failed to capture the expression of the performers.

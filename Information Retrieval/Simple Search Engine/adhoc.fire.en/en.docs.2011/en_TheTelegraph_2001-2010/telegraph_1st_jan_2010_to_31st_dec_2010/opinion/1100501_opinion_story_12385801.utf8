	Young but brave                  
	Sir  Mithu Das, a victim of trafficking, deserves praise for doing something that the other victims have been unable to accomplish (Just memory, April 26). With Dass assistance, the police have put members of a prostitution ring behind bars. However, Dass fight is far from over. She has lost her childhood and is now HIV-positive. She should be provided with all kinds of support so that she emerges victorious from lifes battles. The government should also enact stringent laws to stop trafficking.                     
	Yours faithfully,         Lalita Agarwal, Calcutta
                  
	Challenging task          
	Sir  I agree that it is difficult for Nitish Kumar to allocate Rs 27,000 crore from his meagre state budget to provide free education to children in the age group of 6-14 years in Bihar (Demand for education act funds, April 6). Many other chief ministers are also facing a similar problem.          
	But the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act is a necessity. India cannot survive in a globalized world without universal education. One hopes that the states show the will to arrange for funds. It has already been reported that the funds allocated for education have remained unspent. Is there a way to find out how much money is lying unspent under other heads so that it can be redirected into education? Can the education cess be enhanced in the interest of the nation?           
	The government of India spends an enormous amount of money on providing assistance to those who wish to perform haj or undertake the Mansarovar yatra. Shouldnt this sum be spent on educating children instead? Perhaps religious leaders should ensure that a part of the donations to shrines is used to build educational institutions. Chief ministers too must appeal to citizens to contribute to the fund, which will be used to support free and compulsory education for all children in India.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Indra Roy Sharma, Noida 

                
	Sir  Bihar is a changed state now. Roads have been repaired and construction work is in full swing in many parts of the state. The government has come up with an effective plan for the collection and dumping of garbage to help the state maintain standards in hygiene. Thanks to Nitish Kumar, the education sector has received a boost as well: school uniforms, books and other requirements are being provided free of cost to children. However, it will take some time to ensure that the benefits reach all sections of society.           
	When it comes to development, it is expected that the Centre will work in tandem with the states. Sadly, that has not happened in Bihar. The Centre has failed to provide enough electricity, and has also withheld funds meant for development projects. This has impaired the pace of Bihars growth. The Centre must shun politics and help Bihar prosper.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Shailesh Kumar, Patna

      
	Deep stain  
	Sir  The advice put forward by the editorial, Crisis as opportunity (April 24), will fall on deaf ears. Indians have forgotten the Madhu Koda imbroglio. We will soon forget the dirt that the IPL has raked up as well. But the underprivileged sections are unlikely to be amused by this collective amnesia. Those living below the poverty line are seething with anger at the greedy people. If India does not act against corruption, it has no moral authority to ask the poor to stay away from tainted individuals.          
	Yours faithfully,         Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AMUSING AND INTENSE BY TURNS                                  VISUAL ARTS: Rita Datta                          Phantasmagoria 1                                        
	Though sculpture is clearly the royal of Indias art tradition  whether mainstream or folk/tribal  it does not seem to inspire students, a majority of whom opt for 2D media in art school. And the uncertain market, along with the planning it demands, such as workshop facilities, does not make it any easier for aspiring sculptors. Hence sculpture is often reduced to a kind of obligatory afterthought at group shows. Which means that a solo like Projection of Disjointed Times, being hosted by Aakriti Art Gallery till December 11, gets your vote right away.        
	It features Akhil Chandra Das who, clearly, is a sculptor of both skill and imagination. This becomes apparent as you enter the gallery to face a 69.5 tall bronze that has a man serenely balancing on his head a huge iron cauldron to which are attached small brass nudes poised as though before a dainty descent. Or when you encounter the lithe figure of Phantasmagoria 6, caught in its mid-air leap, as it were, clutching a trident that spears a triumvirate of heads, with the middle anchoring the fluid tableau to its shallow wooden base.        
	It is thus strange that the artist seems rather anxious to prove his virtuoso, because you can see that the works are often a little too overloaded, a little too eager to show off technique, particularly the clever balancing of weight. Not trusting simplicity, he goes for elaborate constructions. And not content with classic bronze, he weds it to wood in many of the pieces, while brass and iron are occasionally added.        
	This body of figurative work is called, somewhat self-consciously, Phantasmagoria, perhaps asking viewers to be prepared for the artists Gothic fantasy. But the images are not so fantastical as to outrage or startle or bemuse. In fact, stylistically, the figures do not stray too far from accepted norms of depiction. Indeed, gargoyles and late-Medieval/early-Renaissance statuary have stimulated part of Dass imagination. On the other hand, his lean, rugged men go back to Giacometti, whose lengthy shadow is hard to escape when it comes to striding figures in bronze; an impressive scorpion, its sting at the ready and its body suspended on its quite sinister tentacles, cannot but recall Louise Bourgeois; and a large orb dotted on the top with inviting peep-holes is likely to bring Arnaldo Pomodoros spheres too much to mind. Besides, texturing the surface of wood or carving inscrutable masks, as Das does, is again standard practice.        
	What does not always work is the pairing of wood and bronze which turns out to be a misalliance of material. Perhaps the name, Phantasmagoria, also refers to this kind of combination. In several works, the wood  which seems garishly varnished  wraps or encloses the torsos of human and animal figures but lends no dimension in meaning or appeal to the sculptures. Which is to say, the material does not appear to be intrinsic to the imagery in most cases, but is rather thrust upon it as a cosmetic effect, a somewhat mannered device.        
	It could, of course, be that the mismatch is deliberate: the artists search for a correlative to approximate these disjointed times, the disunities mentioned in the catalogue essay, could have led him to mixing media as a jolt to the accustomed eye. But that would seem too literal a rendering of a complex conceit.        
	Yet, Das can be both amusing and intense by turns, and even create brief fables that awaken queries and address concerns. The wooden masks that sheath a bearded man are like advertisement placards while the old, weathered man of No. 5, a grotesque beast hefted on his shoulder, summons references to the unpretty burden that technological civilization foists on the world. But then, in evoking the violence of conflict, No. 7, with its seated stoic holding an undulating sheet of wood that cradles armed snipers, ends up becoming somewhat verbose.        
	You find the artist at his best, therefore, when he settles for persuasive simplicity. A small sculpture of a wizened, coldly observant boar, for example, or a big goat with a body of blackened, hollowed wood, boasts an unpretentious appeal.         
	But the remarkable image of the show is a dying or dead bird, possibly a pelican. Placed on the floor rather than on a pedestal, it seems abandoned, forlorn. Its stiffened legs pointing out, its eye frozen in a sightless stare, its beak gaping, its limp body constricted by a foreign cancerous agency  wood  the image turns symbolic: an indictment of pollution, a testament to these disjointed times....

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PASS THE BUCK                                  Malvika Singh                              
	If you have earned honestly and declared your income correctly, you will be summoned by an income tax officer for what chartered accountants refer to as routine questioning, which usually ends up with you paying a baksheesh for having been honest, if you want your case to be closed. However, if you have illegally made anything above one thousand crores, ingeniously using the loopholes our system provides for the innovative offender, you will either be honoured by the State, or be given a high office in government. Those who generate wealth are kicked about, and those who ruthlessly exploit the country are celebrated. That is the irony of India in 2010, and there is no one addressing this horrendous truth.         
	We are poised for a bloody revolution. The troubled areas of India are volatile and determined to get their rights, even at gun-point, since no one paid any heed when they asked for their due in a peaceful and dignified manner. Sadly, governments turn the other way, realizing that they are incompetent and ill-equipped to rectify the situation. The ineffective, insular attitude to finding viable solutions has managed to destroy a great young nation state, and has left it mutilated and scarred. This has led to greater corrosion and corruption. Committees abound and sub-committees delay. This mechanism of passing the buck has disrupted the democratic processes of India, as the country waits for outcomes from these isolated, disconnected committees. If the leaders got out of their fortresses and bulletproof cars, they may just connect, find alternatives and deliver the goods.                
	Miles ahead        
	Prices have risen to heights that are unimaginable to simple professionals and the neglected poor of this land. The rich are fine and kicking. The last thing India needs is an unabashed rich-poor divide. We need sensible policies that will reach out to all levels and classes, that will deliver the diverse         
	needs and requirements for growth in all strata of society. We do not need retired men sitting in committees  who faltered when they were in power  to determine the changes that are imperative at this moment. Sinecures have worsened an already disabled reality. New ideas come from new generations and not from old, failed moaners. We have been inflicted with more than our fair share of that variety of experts.        
	Our national institutions are in the mire. Many are headless, even though we have some of the best and the brightest practitioners in almost all disciplines there. Simple remedies for creating the parameters of productive public-private partnerships have eluded such government operated institutions. The involvement of the citizens and private professionals in the building and administration of public institutions has been non-existent. The babu is much too comfortable to allow any disruption. Change, therefore, can only come with a strong political will.         
	Our foreign policy stances are unorganized, and appear ad hoc, depending on who is committed to doing what, and when. We are busy alienating Iran because that complements the American foreign policy. We want to bend over backwards to keep that peace even if we dilute our own position in the region. We accept every ridiculous explanation the US presents to us for all the unspeakable acts Pakistan indulges in against India. Pakistan may be Americas holy cow, but it most certainly does not serve the need of India.        
	And as a parting comment  friends visiting the Shanghai trade fair returned with the most appalling stories about how tacky the Indian pavilion was in comparison to all the others. We have to hide our faces in shame when confronted with substandard representations of our legacies, and skills. China, for sure, is miles ahead in effective growth.

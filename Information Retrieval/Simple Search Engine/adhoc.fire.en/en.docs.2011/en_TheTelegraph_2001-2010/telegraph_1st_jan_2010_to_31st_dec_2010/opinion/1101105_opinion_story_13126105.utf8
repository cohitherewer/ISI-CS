	The increasingly-hotting-up spat between the United States of America and China over exchange-rate adjustments is not exactly a currency war  at least, not yet. Currency war, in the classical sense, involves competitive devaluation by two countries in the external values of their respective currencies in order to capture the other ones market. The situation now obtaining is quite different, most of the worry is only on one side. The monthly deficit that the US is experiencing in its trade with China has been running close to 30 billion dollars in the recent period.        
	This trade gap has been a fact of life for more than two decades, and Chinas pile of dollar holdings  which represents the USs indebtedness to the Asian giant  has scaled to trillions of dollars. Were the Chinese authorities in a naughty mood and suddenly demanded redemption of this debt at one go, a version of the sovereign debt crisis that has afflicted a number of European countries this summer, including Greece and Spain, could well visit the US itself, still by a long way the worlds richest country. What is far worse, since the dollar is the reserve currency in which many countries around the world hold their external savings, the catastrophe would suck in all of them.        
	Behind-the-scene diplomatic manoeuvres are therefore on. The Chinese are being urged to be reasonable. Apart from the grim prospect of a global financial turmoil in case the dollar went down, a US in economic disarray, the Chinese are being asked to appreciate, would prove utterly harmful to their own economy too. The huge success that China has experienced with the strategy of export-led growth is largely accounted for by the volume and value of goods and services the US imports from China. Why kill the hen that lays the golden egg? The instinct for self-preservation should persuade the Chinese leadership to adopt measures that might reduce the trade GDP. The obvious first step is to raise the value of renminbi vis--vis the dollar. That would lead to an increase in the prices of Chinese goods for American citizens, who would willy-nilly be forced to buy less from China; the American trade deficit would come down.        
	The Chinese authorities have long ceased to be babes in the wood, if they ever were. They would well be ready with a sharp repartee: since it is essentially an American problem, it should be taken care of by the US itself. The American nation has piled up, over the decades, large trade deficits not just with China, but with the other East Asian countries, Europe and Latin America as well. It preaches economic discipline, such as the need for balanced budgets and deficit-less balance of payments to others, but it itself remains most profligate in both respects. To remedy the malady that is afflicting it and is posing a problem for other countries too, the US must discipline itself. For a start, the US administration might go for a round of administrative, fiscal and monetary measures to restore the health of the countrys economy.        
	This Physician, heal thyself barb touches a raw nerve, involving as it does issues both of productivity and freedom of consumer choice in the US. With the extent of capital intensity American industry embodies, output per unit of labour deployed could normally be expected to outstrip labour productivity in China in most spheres of production. There is a problem though. The most affluent country in the world nurtures a workforce who have to be paid wages that are about the highest in the world.        
	The disparity between the standard wage rates in China and in the US is so great that even if labour productivity in the US is ahead of that in China in particular lines of activity, the wide disparity in wage scales more than neutralizes this advantage. China produces goods of the same quality at cheaper rates, American citizens exercise the sovereignty of their choice and buy these rather than American products. The trade deficit emerges as the continuing reality.        
	To find a way out of the problem is the major challenge facing the American nation. Any drastic cut in wages across the board has to be ruled out in any case. The bargaining power of organized labour in the US is a basic, incontrovertible datum that is philosophically accepted these days by even the most rabid of capitalists: wages are not flexible downwards, period. Entrepreneurs, played into a difficult corner by the frighteningly slack demand on account of recessionary conditions, have sometimes fallen back on the modality of curtailing working days per week. Outsourcing, wherever possible, has been another device they have latched on to. But neither reduction in work-days nor substitution of high-wage domestic labour by shipping out jobs or hiring low-wage workers from poorer countries is of any help for licking the problem of trade deficit. Outsourcing, while depressing the level of domestic employment, actually aggravates the difficulties on the balance-of-payments front.        
	American policymakers thus face an excruciatingly painful dilemma. The country is hailed as the land of unbridled free enterprise. Unhindered competition is a dictum that is now an integral part of national consciousness. In international fora, such as the World Trade Organization, the US has virulently opposed the concept of restrictive trade practices of all genres, including tariff barriers. The two Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, are both accustomed to echoing the economic philosophy of the US. They have donned all along the role of stern taskmasters and tried to impress on their member-countries the imperative to accept without reservation the tenets of economic liberalization. The opening decade of the 21st century has coincided with the emphatic triumph  at least, for the present  of the concept of globalization. Country after country has joined the bandwagon of free or near-free economic systems, Nobel-prize-winning economists have written tracts for proclaiming that freedom and development are synonymous and reversible entities.        
	Ironically, it is precisely globalization that threatens to herald doomsday for the American economy. A panicky note is discernible in Barack Obamas recent perorations: children in the US must be imparted the best education to enable them to compete successfully with the younger generation emerging from China and India. That is the only way, it is implied, American industry and technology could cope with the challenge of the Asian countries. The problem, however, is not merely one of keeping pace with the level of skill attained by the average Chinese worker or technician in different spheres or matching the adaptability demonstrated by Indians specifically in the information-technology sector.        
	Far more crucial is the standard of living of the average American citizen, which is much, much higher than in China or India and gets inflected in American wages, which are 10, 15 or 20 times higher than for comparable jobs in the Asian countries. While globalization has weakened the trade union movement in the developing countries, the downward rigidity of the American wage structure, jealously enforced by trade union conglomerates like the American Federation of Labour, will be a hindrance for the country in the global competitive market.              
	The world therefore is witnessing the unravelling of an extraordinary circumstance: the US is suffering from the consequences of the global acceptance of a doctrine  that of free enterprise  its political establishment has been religiously believing in and preaching to all and sundry. At the same time, because the US is so rich and its workers fetch such high earnings, American industry falls behind in competition with the products of such countries as China and India. Free competition is working to the disadvantage of the US. And while economic liberalization has rendered the wage structure more flexible in large parts of the world, American labour cannot be persuaded to sacrifice what they have gained from free-market bargaining.        
	A tentative conclusion is worth drawing. It is not as if only a revolution devours its own children; free enterprise, too, trips up its principal sponsor.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DRESSED UP                                                    
	Some forms of oppression are so routine that they become visible only through their removal. The full absurdity of the dress code for female teachers may have struck some people only when the Calcutta High Court ruled that teachers have the right to choose what they wear to class. The issue has been simmering for a while, with clashes over the proper apparel for female teachers erupting from time to time between individual or groups of teachers on the one side and school authorities, sometimes even guardians and students, on the other. That these conflicts began to become public only this century shows a growth in confidence among a particular segment of educated women, for oppressive dress codes had always been in place while the protests and defiance were new. The courts ruling puts an end to the bickering, but is also useful in underlining how blatant discrimination against women has been internalized by society as normal. Society is used to seeing women teachers dress in a certain way, but whether women dress in a particular way because they want to, or because a usually silent but implacable authority compels them to is a matter of indifference.        
	The court has added that women teachers can dress as they wish as long as the dress is decent. But it has left the judgment of decency to the women, who are educated and responsible enough to know what is becoming wear for a teacher. The courts good sense and display of balance might set an example for authorities nurturing medieval notions of women, although the fact that an extremely busy high court has to deal with such matters is a kind of triumph of stupidity. No matter what lessons are taught by textbooks, the values of educational institutions that force a dress code only upon their women teachers are nothing short of dangerous. Violence against women is bred in unlikely nurseries, side by side with the conspiracy of silence. From here come the women who cower and comply, who refuse to speak up when they experience violence or see another experiencing it, the policemen who refuse to take complaints from women, the husbands who beat their wives for disobedience and threaten their daughters when the latter fall in love. Oppression is an everyday matter yet barely visible. By objecting to an unreasonable dress code, teachers have demonstrated its ubiquitousness.

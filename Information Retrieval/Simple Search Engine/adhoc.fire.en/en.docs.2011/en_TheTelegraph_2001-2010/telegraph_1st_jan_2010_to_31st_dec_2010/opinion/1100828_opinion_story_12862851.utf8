The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Exciting possibilities
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        EXCITING POSSIBILITIES                                  DANCE: Kathakali Jana                                                  
	When three stylish women in sleek evening dresses and high heels took the stage, looking the audience in the eye with an inscrutable seductiveness, one knew that the spectators were in for some serious adventure. But I would be lying if I said I knew whether they were trying to invite or repulse us through their performance titled Anarchys Dream at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, ICCR, that night. The performance, created by the Taiwanese choreographer, Chieh-Hua Hsieh, was part of an initiative of the Calcutta chapter of the World Dance Alliance, Disha, an International Conference on Dance and Empowerment.        
	One could never have guessed the next stage in the performance from the girls come-hither looks, candid pimping and uninhibited shaking of butts in what could only be described as an incredibly vulgar manner. Who would have thought that in a few moments they would be lunging at one another with unexpected violence? As they became ferocious animals knocking one another out, even throwing one another off the stage, their bodies became metaphors for a disintegrating society out to establish individual supremacies.         
	Intensely disturbing and fascinatingly choreographed, the performance was intriguing. While the concept note spoke of utopia, there was nothing in the three girls demeanour to express a longing for any such lofty ideal. If anything, they began as creatures sold to the pleasures of the senses and ended up in wholly destructive, warped and wild combats with one another. Where does utopia figure in all this? And why are women used to project disruption in society? Is it a way of saying that women are more given to such behaviour than men are?        
	Dishas presentation that evening also featured several pieces by the Post Natyam Collective, a multinational community of dancers engaging with south Asian dance forms. A playful take on how cultures interact and collide with hilarious consequences, Cynthia Ling Lees choreography, Ruddha (rude, huh?), was fun. It was interesting to note how much was lost (or gained) in translation as syllables of traditional Kathak compositions got converted to nonsensical English gossip. Classical Kathak also gave way to zany postmodern movement patterns to create a work of exciting possibilities.        
	Lees facility with contemporary dance-theatre was evident in Fish Hook Tongue, where she used diasporic womens poetry and the tenets of abhinaya to address the issue of linguistic colonization. The piece emerged as a telling exploration of an immigrants longing for her mother tongue.Kathak came together with contact improvisation in Not Two Not One that blended rhythms, sensual, seamless movement patterns, and humour. Earlier in the evening, Anjika had put up a commendable performance marrying Manipuri with Thang-Ta.

	Times have changed                  
	Sir  It would appear that Ramachandra Guha is not aware of the phenomenon of tribalism that has afflicted present-day India (A serpent in paradise, Feb 13). Most Indians from other regions are strangers to the Northeast, but one would think that what is happening in Jharkhand or Chhattisgarh would have prepared Guha for the situation in Arunachal. The world of Verrier Elwin or David Scott no longer exists in this part of the world. The Northeast of today presents a much more complex reality, largely due to economic reasons. Born and brought up in Shillong, I joined the forest service in Tripura in 1963 and retired in 2000. When I was due to retire, I contemplated building a house in Shillong. However, I was told this was not possible as I was not a tribal.          
	When I first moved to Tripura, I found most tribals living in the interiors to be so poor that their belongings were seldom worth more than Rs 50. By the time I left Tripura in the year 2000, things had improved a bit: the value of their belongings was about five times more. Meanwhile, the urban elite took advantage of their tribal status to amass great wealth while those living in the villages remained as poor as they have always been.           
	The fact is that there is none among us whose ancestors did not belong to a tribe. Changing lifestyles led to the jettisoning of their tribal identity. Now, there is a renewed attempt by a handful of elites to flaunt their tribal associations. But the real tribals remain in penury.           
	Guha has come to know of what has happened to Sucheta Sen Chaudhuri, but he might not be aware of what has been happening to many non-tribal students in northeastern universities for years. Guha expects the University Grants Commission and the Human Resources Development to do something about the victims of such discrimination. He may rest assured that nothing will be done.

	Talking trouble          
	Sir  As usual, India has walked the extra mile in trying to mend relations with Pakistan. The editorial, Bold and right step (Feb 6), is correct in asserting that the dark shadow of Pakistan falls on Indian foreign policy. No Indian prime minister can afford to ignore the situation in Pakistan and its impact on Indo-Pak relations, especially since it also has an adverse effect on Indias domestic affairs. Peace and functional ties with Pakistan must be established in the interests of effective governance in India. The Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has made an earnest attempt to engage Islamabad. Indias offer to Pakistan to initiate talks between the foreign secretaries of the two countries should be welcomed by all. The earlier refusal to talk had restricted New Delhis room for diplomatic manoeuvring severely. Islamabad had also taken a more aggressive stance by elbowing India out of the discussion on Afghanistan.           
	Escalating violence has brought Pakistan close to being called a failed nation state. The country is also poised to be taken over by Islamic fundamentalists. At present, India will have to take on board the fact that at least pro forma legal action has been initiated against some Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives allegedly involved in the Mumbai attacks. Not doing so would have made Indias position diplomatically untenable.           
	The editorial rightly concludes that it is to Indias advantage to establish peace and that Manmohan Singh has adopted a policy of enlightened self-interest. This may be a modest beginning but it can help shape future dialogue between the two countries. Islamabad and New Delhi should show maturity, not let the talks get derailed by the Pune blast, and seize the moment so that people may gain economically from trade, transit and infrastructure.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

                
	Sir  One wonders why the United Progressive Alliance government offered to hold talks with Pakistan. This clearly is another of those gaffes that our foreign policy has been prone to in recent times. With Pakistan not cooperating after 26/11, India had put a lid on bilateral ties. There was no need to open negotiations again, especially since Pakistan has found itself to be in a volatile situation over the last year. Extremist elements in Pakistan have taken control of large swathes of the country. With the spate of bombings in Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi and other cities, it seems but a matter of time before anarchy strikes roots in Pakistan.           
	The United States of America, with its strengthened presence in Afghanistan, now has a clearer understanding of the situation. The US is also aware of the risk of Pakistani nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of terrorists. The complicity of the Inter-Services Intelligence with the al Qaida and the Taliban is also evident. Under the circumstances, it seems rather odd that India should offer to talk with Pakistan. Nothing good can come of this initiative unless there is a change in Pakistans polity, but that looks unlikely.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Timely move                  
	Sir  The defence minister, A.K. Antony, must be congratulated for overruling the army chiefs decision in the land scam involving the senior officer, Avadhesh Prakash (Antony overrules chief in land case, Jan 28). It was imperative for Antony to intervene in the matter so as to restore the dignity of an institution like the army. V.K. Singh, the army chief-designate, is an upright officer who performed his duty by investigating the case honestly. He had no intention of slighting his present boss in a bid to succeed him as the army chief.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir The defence ministers decision to ask for disciplinary proceedings against the military secretary, Avadhesh Prakash, was an absolutely correct and timely step. Apart from ordering a court martial against Prakash, action should also be taken against the other top-ranking officers involved in the episode to boost the morale of the defence forces. Further, the Central Bureau of Investigation should be instructed to probe the activities of the Siliguri-based realtor, Dilip Agarwal. If he is guilty, he should be meted out exemplary punishment as well.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The Sukna land case has been investigated by a legal body called court of inquiry. As per its recommendation, the army chief, Deepak Kapoor, is legally bound to take action against an errant officer. This he did, issuing a show-cause notice to Avadhesh Prakash. Kapoor knows his officers well, and can understand them better than the defence minister. An army chief can seldom tolerate a senior officer being treated in a shabby manner. Favouring a businessman may perhaps be a serious offence but then half of our ministers ought to go to trial on similar charges. It is evident that A.K. Antony has been misguided, and one hopes that he will correct himself shortly. It must be remembered that Vishnu Bhagwat, who was sacked by the government led by the National Democratic Alliance, managed to win back his privileges on the Supreme Courts orders.This matter too may reach the apex court. It is therefore advisable that Antony ignores the media propaganda and concentrates on matters that are more important than a case involving land transfer.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Benu Kumar Bose, Calcutta

                
	Sir  By ordering disciplinary action against an errant army officer, the defence minister, A.K. Antony, has demonstrated appreciable honesty and considerable political astuteness. His decision is a step in the right direction. It will not only serve as a warning to greedy officers, but also help in stemming the corruption gnawing at the roots of the nation. Antony has shown that no one is above the law. Significantly very few defence ministers have shown the nerve to overrule an army chief.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Struck hard          
	Sir  In Another empty promise (Jan 25), Gwynne Dyer writes, What has devastated Haiti is the politics, much of it imposed from outside by foreign governments: the French in the 19th century, the United States of America in the 20th and 21st. Haiti was governed by the US from 1915 to 1934. So to blame the US, along with France, for Haitis underdevelopment is unacceptable. In fact, Haiti prospered under French rule when the colonialists set up their sugar and coffee plantations.          
	If Haiti has not been able to develop itself since its independence in 1804, then there must be something wrong with the country itself. Dyer should note that India, too, was under British rule for a long time but that has not deterred the country from making considerable progress in the last 60 years. If Haiti has failed to progress as a nation, the fault lies in its peoples inability. Digging the past and blaming foreign powers are lame excuses.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that a large number of people perished in a disastrous earthquake in Haiti recently (Aftershock rattles Haiti, Jan 21). There have been a number of such disasters, including the tsunami and other earthquakes, but the developed countries are yet to invent mechanisms that can assist in the prediction of such natural calamities. In fact, at the recently-concluded climate conference in Copenhagen, very few of the participating nations took note of this critical lacuna. India has experienced several debilitating natural phenomena. The earthquake in Gujarat that took place more than eight years ago is only one example. Taking a cue from what happened in the Caribbean island, India should take preventive action with the help of technological expertise. It is also expected that the US president, Barack Obama, constitute a high-level committee to devise mechanisms for the early detection of disasters.          
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  The death and devastation wrought by the earthquake in Haiti are shocking. What is equally sad is the fact that those who survived the killer earthquake will from now on have to live with the pain of losing near and dear ones and their property. This, certainly, is a difficult time for Haitians. The lack of food, water and essential supplies, coupled with the incidents of theft, corruption and riots, is likely to make matters worse for those who have survived.          
	The aftershocks are also dangerous, and may acquire the intensity of the original earthquake. The international community should unite in its efforts to help the people of Haiti and expedite the rescue operations to alleviate the sufferings of the people of this country.

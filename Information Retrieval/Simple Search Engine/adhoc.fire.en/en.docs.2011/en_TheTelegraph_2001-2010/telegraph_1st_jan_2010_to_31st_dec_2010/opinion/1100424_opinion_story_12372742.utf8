	There exists a perfectly valid model to run an organization like the Indian Premier League, which is a subsidiary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. From the very beginning, it should have been run by a salaried professional who would be a full-time employee of the BCCI. In other words, to be the commissioner of the IPL, Lalit Modi should have given up all his business interests and become an employee of the BCCI with the responsibility of running the administration of the IPL. This model works on a simple assumption: the stockholders of a firm should not have the responsibility of executive functions. Stockholders should ideally meet at regular intervals to oversee the functioning and to lay down the broad parameters of policy. The responsibility of looking after the business should be vested completely with the executive head who ought to be a professional. There are sports bodies across the world that operate on this model. In Indian sports, especially in cricket, this model has not caught on. The BCCI is the best example of a body that is not administered by professionals but by politicians, lawyers, accountants, businessmen and what have you. These people decide who should be on the selection committee or even who should be the captain of India.        
	The reluctance  indeed refusal  of the BCCI to professionalize itself despite no lack of resources is somewhat inexplicable. It could easily take a page from the manner in which CII and FICCI have refashioned themselves. Both these organizations can, with all justification, be described as representing the interests of business and industries. On their respective boards, they have powerful businessmen and industrialists but they are run by professionals. The CII professionalized itself under the leadership of Tarun Das, who, for a number of years, served as its director-general. The FICCI followed suit by appointing Amit Mitra as the secretary-general, and he has earned respect for the firm way in which he has brought about changes in the administration of FICCI, which is now run completely by professionals. All critical decisions in CII are taken by the director-general and in FICCI by the secretary-general. These decisions are then implemented by a team of professionals. Behind the respect that CII and FICCI commands lies the professional leadership of both the bodies.        
	What both the BCCI and the IPL need are individuals like Messrs Das and Mitra to be at the helm of their affairs. This is not an impossible or an inconceivable thing to do; all it needs is the will to do it. This will has so far been absent. The controversy that surrounds the IPL provides a great opportunity to clean the stables and to begin anew with a different model and a different organizational set-up. Able professionals will help in the cleansing process and also put in place best practices and safeguards. Will the BCCI wake up?

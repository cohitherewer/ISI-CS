                                Active player      
	Actions speak louder than words. The Maoists surely believe in this phrase. But sometimes, words speak louder than action, and that is what is worrying the Bharatiya Janata Party. It is, once again, in a fix over what to do with the words uttered by Varun Gandhi at a rally in Lucknow, where he is believed to have said that the statues of the UP chief minister, Mayavati, would be replaced by those of Lord Ram once the party comes to power in the next assembly elections. Many in the BJP think Varuns anti-Muslim comments during the Lok Sabha elections were partly responsible for the partys poor performance in the state, and that he has to stop shooting his mouth off if he is to fit into Nitin Gadkaris plan of becoming the partys answer to Rahul Gandhi. While Varun continues to queer the pitch for his party, his cousin is busy preparing the Congresss grand plan to take on the Maoists. In the past few weeks, he has met the men in charge of Jharkhand and West Bengal and summoned MLAs to give him a low-down on the Maoist problem. Not that all this has taken the party anywhere close to action. But at least Rahul is making sure of what the action, whenever that comes, will speak about.                            
	One plan has already been set in motion. It is to get back Renuka Chowdhury within shouting distance of Parliament, and perhaps inside it. The Congress president apparently is missing her voice in the house. So Chowdhury, who lost the Lok Sabha election, is all set to come to the Rajya Sabha. The Andhra CM, K Rosaiah, is believed to have got the names for the four seats cleared by Sonia Gandhi when he met her last week. One of these seats may fall on Chowdhurys lap as there are not too many women contenders. And since the Rajya Sabha carries a special meaning for women, Chowdhury may find herself being welcomed with open arms.                        
	 The state of Himachal Pradesh has a new poster boy. The Hamirpur MP and BJP young gun, Anurag Thakur, has become the darling of the hill people for bringing cricket to the state. The holding of IPL III at Dharamshala was a coup of sorts for Thakur that is likely to have a telling impact on his political future. The buzz is that people are already looking forward to the wonders Thakur may perform as the CM of the state.                            
	 Having spent much of his energy in trying to put together a government in Jharkhand, the BJP chief, Nitin Gadkari, has left for Germany to study latest developments in renewable energy. Gadkari is already a pioneer in the production of biofuel. His business trip will take him to Gssing, which has the European Centre for Renewable Energy. The mayor of Gssing is supposed to receive Gadkari and make him a presentation. Gadkari may visit other places as well. So expect a recharged BJP chief back home.                            
	 Ever wondered why Jaya Bachchan chose to opt out of the race for the Rajya Sabha seat? Apparently, the reason is none other than Big B. The man has been disillusioned with politics for a while now. A spate of controversies involving him and some political honchos has made matters worse. But the nail in the coffin perhaps came with the filing of a complaint by the headman of Daulatpur village in UP against the Bachchans for the delay in starting work for the setting up of a college in the name of Aishwarya. Politics, evidently, is not only sullying the image of the Bachchans, but also straining their ties with brother Amar Singh. Jaya, naturally, is keen to stay away from it all for a while.                            
	 Ever since the transcripts of telephone conversations between Sharad Pawar and a few other prominent persons got published, politicians have become wary of cell-phone conversations. They know that the equipment to tap cell phones is now available. The device, usually kept in a mobile van, can tape conversations from the radio waves within a certain radius. So to tap someones conversation in, say, Chanakyapuri, all one has to do is park a van near the area to pick up the airwaves. These days, if you were to call a neta on his cell phone, chances are he would tell you to call him on the landline, or he would disconnect the phone and call you back from the landline. Smart move!                          
	There is some talk that the PM is not media-savvy. But the fault does not lie entirely with his self-effacedness. There are reasons beyond anyones control. Take the perpetual inefficiency of the official television service provider that can never match its timings with his. Three months ago, Doordarshan alone was allowed to cover an RBI function with the PM as chief guest. At the time of the screening, DD failed to show the functions footage as its staff did not reach the venue on time. During the PMs national press conference, the telecast stopped after a few shots. A fire in DDs OB van disrupted the transmission. The function had more than its usual share of problems because of bickering between the I amp;B ministry and the PMO. Some Congress leaders also criticized the PMs performance. Bottomline: the PM does not rule the air waves.

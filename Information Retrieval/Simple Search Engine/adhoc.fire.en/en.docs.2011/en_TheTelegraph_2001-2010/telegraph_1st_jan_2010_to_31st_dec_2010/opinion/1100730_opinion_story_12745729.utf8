	Without going into the unseemly controversy regarding a memoir that is yet to be published, it should be noted that the controversy throws up important aspects of Indian political life. The reference is obviously to the memoirs of Somnath Chatterjee, the former Speaker of the Lok Sabha who was expelled from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) because he refused to resign as Speaker when the CPI(M) withdrew support from the first United Progressive Alliance government in 2008. The move to expel Mr Chatterjee was driven by the general secretary of the CPI(M), Prakash Karat. The irony of the situation was that the views of someone who had no popular mandate prevailed over those of a person who had come to the Lok Sabha after winning an election. This sounds somewhat odd in a democracy. (It is also true that it would have been proper for Mr Chatterjee to have given up his membership of a political party when he was elected Speaker.) This oddity is by no means particular to the CPI(M). The latters ideological rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is also led by a person  the party president  who is not an elected representative of the people. It stands to reason that, in a democracy, only those who have been elected by the people should wear the mantle of leadership. It follows that a political party outside the parliamentary party is an anomaly in a democracy.        
	There is another aspect that is related to the present discussion. Indian political parties, almost without exception, have a streak of authoritarianism in them. The crucial decisions in political parties are all taken at the top. This is true of a party with a rigid organizational structure  such as the CPI(M)  or a party with a powerful leader, such as the Congress under Sonia Gandhi. In both instances, opinions and interests emanating from the states tend to get submerged, or even suppressed, by what is perceived by the national leadership of the party to be in the national interest of the party. Just as the Indian State suffers from too much centralization, so do the political parties. Yet sometimes  the case of the CPI(M) and West Bengal comes immediately to mind  a particular state unit of the party is critical to the entire partys existence, but that units views and interests are ridden over roughshod. What is equally unfortunate is that these issues are seldom, if ever, debated in Indian public life.

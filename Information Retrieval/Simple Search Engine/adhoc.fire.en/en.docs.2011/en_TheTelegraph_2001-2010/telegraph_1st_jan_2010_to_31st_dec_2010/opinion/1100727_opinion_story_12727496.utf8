                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN THE THROES OF VIRTUE                                  Ministers, activists and archivists, all have a say on what is best for tribal peoples. As the debates rage around the draft national policy, it is the tribes that remain unheard                                            
	For the conscientious, there are always tribals to save. An amorphous, unnamed many, impassive as hieroglyphics on a page, tribals can be counted on to fuel furious moral debate. And tribal policy has emerged as yet another arena for the social conscience to battle its demons. Recently, Bishnu Pada Ray, the only member of parliament from the Andamans, demanded that the people of the Jarawa tribe be introduced to mainstream education and media. The Union government, he said, had no right to preserve them as museum pieces. Tribal rights activists bristled at this; the trauma of modernization would be disastrous for such people. What members of the Jarawa tribe felt is not known.         
	The National Tribal Policy, drafted in 2006 and due to be tabled in Parliament, is also shaped by this conflict between development and the preservation of indigenous culture. The dilemma in preparing any policy for the Scheduled Tribes in India, it states at the outset, is how to strike the right balance between the preservation of tribal identity, culture and values... while increasing and ensuring their access to mainstream education, healthcare and income generation. The first attempt at a comprehensive policy on scheduled tribes, it recognizes the difficulties of imposing a single, homogeneous policy on such a varied group of people.         
	It is a curious document, torn between opposing imperatives, defensive and cavalier in turns. For it has to reckon with a history of exploitation, injustice and, sometimes, well-meaning damage inflicted by the State. Post Independence, government policy on tribes had been determined by Nehrus Panchsheel for tribal development, which aimed to preserve the distinct cultures of the STs and ensure self-government for them. According to the recommendations of the committee headed by Verrier Elwin, certain areas were designated as separate tribal development blocks in 1953. Later measures moved towards integrating tribes with the national mainstream. Human development indices, however, registered little change.        
	The NTP is careful to claim roots in the Panchsheel as well as in constitutional rights to social and economic empowerment. But there is an acute unease with accepted definitions, a conscious attempt to adopt a more politically sensitive lexicon. The STs had been identified as backward and primitive people living in isolation. These words are now rejected as pejorative. Primitive Tribal Groups are fussily renamed Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups. But a change in language may not mean a change in sentiment.         
	The draft policy presents a seraphic image of tribal communities as people who hold beliefs that are simple, direct and non-acquisitive by nature. Such picturesque populations must be preserved largely as they are; some of them have even earned the label heritage group. The policy on the PVTGs involves conservation cum development schemes. These communities, their culture and their livelihoods, are to be preserved under control conditions, with little or no contact with the outside world. The NTP may have been talking about wildlife or historical monuments. In a quaint, almost Victorian, phrase, the document observes that the tribes are given to violent manifestations. All the political strife of tribal movements is somehow reduced to the antics of specimens under a scanner.         
	At the level of policy, at least, tribal people seem to have little say in the choices made for them. The dominant discourse remains strongly paternalistic, preoccupied with the ways in which policymakers should handle tribes. They will have more autonomy, the policy promises, their rights to land and resources should be ensured. They would be taught, fed, treated and housed. According to reports, adivasi organizations and activists were given a perfunctory 20 days to comment on the recommendations of the policy draft.        
	Yet, for more than four years, the draft of the tribal policy has been whittled and discussed, opposed and defended by various lobbies. Locked in a debate on the rival merits of integration and isolation, the NTP is yet to be passed and actually implemented. It has become a nervous, theoretical debate. A governments negotiation of its own guilt, greed and self-righteousness, it has little to do with the people it would affect.                    IPSITA CHAKRAVARTY

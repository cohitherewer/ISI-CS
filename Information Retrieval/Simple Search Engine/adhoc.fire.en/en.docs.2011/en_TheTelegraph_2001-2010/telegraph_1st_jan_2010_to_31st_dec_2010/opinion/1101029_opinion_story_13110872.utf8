	THE QUARANTINE PAPERS   By Kalpish Ratna, 
  HarperCollins, Rs 499
                
	To read The Quarantine Papers in contemporary India is to experience an eerie frisson with the past. Set against the backdrop of the Babri Masjid demolition, the novel focuses on, among a myriad other things, the communal riots that wreaked havoc on Bombay between December 6 and 14, 1992. But several histories keep trickling into this tale of love and hate as the dramatis personae assume Dickensian proportions and one almost starts missing the genealogical   
	Kalpana Swaminathan and Ishrat Syed, who write as Kalpish Ratna, are seasoned doctors as well as storytellers. This book is their most ambitious venture so far. The homework for The Quarantine Papers was done in their collaborative project, Uncertain Life and Sure Death: Medicine and Mahamaari in Maritime Bombay, published earlier this year. In the novel, however, the history of only one epidemic  the plague  is given a human face. With what one critic has called surgical realism, the duo explores the devastations unleashed on the body by the pestilence. And yet, as in Albert Camus eponymous novel, the plague is also invested with metaphorical power: it signifies the virulent germ of communal hatred. With time, the intrigue around the disease deepens and eventually provides the basis for a gripping whodunnit.  
	The mystery hinges on a pact signed by four men  the allusion to Conan Doyle is deliberate  in the late 19th century, to stop hate at any cost. This cryptic resolution is handed down through generations until, following an incredibly sinuous course, it reaches Ratan Oak, an unemployed microbiologist with an ailing father and a failed marriage, living in the Bombay of 1990s. Conveniently enough, Ratan is given to hallucinations, or perhaps he has mystical intimations from another world, in which he starts reliving the life and times of his great-grandfather, Ramratan. Having a split personality as protagonist is obviously useful. The writers do not have to wrack their brains to tie up loose ends. At opportune moments, they can happily let Ratan regress into a past life and thus lend credence to what may appear to be the most improbable developments. The reader will enjoy this rollercoaster ride through history as long as he is generously willing to suspend disbelief.         
	Nonetheless, the pull of a Kalpish Ratna novel is undeniable, even hypnotic. The prose is quick, often on the verge of exaggeration, but never afraid of experimenting with registers. It may be darkly poetic one moment, clinical and spare the next. Swaminathan, on her own, is the more gifted writer, keenly alert to the cadences of her prose, as is evident from her collection of stories, Venus Crossing. In this novel, attention is lavished on medical procedures, especially autopsies. These passages, graphically detailing the trauma of burnt or bullet-ridden victims, are certainly not meant for the faint-hearted. For those familiar with Kalpish Ratna, these moments are part of their signature style. However, instead of pity and fear, the relentless emphasis on blood and gore might end up arousing a morbid voyeurism in readers, nothing more.         
	One must, however, applaud the writers audacious vision. It is no mean feat to pull off a novel where John Lockwood Kipling, Rudyards father, is a key figure. The facts have been meticulously researched, the plot ingeniously crafted, and the story engagingly told. Fans may not mind the occasional purple patches or absurd twists, but Kalpish Ratna can certainly do better than this.

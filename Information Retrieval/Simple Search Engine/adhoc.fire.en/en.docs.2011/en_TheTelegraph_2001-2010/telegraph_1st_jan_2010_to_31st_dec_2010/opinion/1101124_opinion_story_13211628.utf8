The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Back to basics
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BACK TO BASICS                                                    
	Bringing Calcutta to a halt is old stuff of West Bengals politics. But the week-long siege from Wednesday that the ruling Left has planned at the heart of the citys central business district adds an ominous dimension to the states destructive political culture. It shows that 34 years in power has done nothing to change the Lefts ways. This is not the first time that the rulers of the state will be trying to disrupt life in Calcutta. But the plan for the siege at the Metro channel is particularly disturbing for two reasons. It shows that the Left has lost not just the capacity but also the will to rule. What is worse is the fear that the Left may go back to this kind of street politics once it is out of power. Ironically, the siege has been planned as part of the Lefts campaign to reach out to the people. The more the people reject the ruling Marxists, the more the latter threaten to return to their old politics. It is perhaps futile to expect Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to not surrender to the subversive politics of his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist). His rule has been rejected in one election after another in the past two years. Even if he wants to act like the states chief executive, his writ is unlikely to run. If it is not the Opposition, his own party will see to it that he remains powerless to act.        
	Recent elections clearly indicated the peoples desire for a change. But a change of guard at Writers Buildings may not mean much for the state and its people if the political culture does not change. The problem is that politicians across the parties have come to accept the cynical view that mobilizing the people by immobilizing Calcutta is the best way to get their votes. Much of Mamata Banerjees successes came from her own street shows. She used many of the Marxists old tactics in order to reach out to her people. In this politics of competitive street shows, it does not matter what the issue is. The parties and their leaders are not bothered about the hardships that their street shows inflict on the people. This suicidal politics has long been at the heart of West Bengals economic decline. For investors who might see fresh hopes in the states changing political landscape, the siege ahead will be yet another despairing signal. As for the Lefts hope of recovering lost ground through such shutdowns, the effect may be exactly the opposite. The siege should convince the people finally why the Left rule must end.

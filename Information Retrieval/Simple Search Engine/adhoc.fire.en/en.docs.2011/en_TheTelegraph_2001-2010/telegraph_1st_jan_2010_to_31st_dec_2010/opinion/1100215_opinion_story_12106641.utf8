The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The smile with the snarl
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE SMILE WITH THE SNARL                          - In all it does, China aims only to protect the Communist Party        Ashok Ganguly                                                        
	The Chinese leadership has been pursuing a policy to build a soft image as part of its international posture of being a wise, benign and caring global economic and political power. The universal Chinese smiling public face is supposed to be a symbol of the New China and to convey the rise of a self-confident and non-threatening global power. The Chinese leadership, quite purposefully, adopted the smiling-face policy to convey confidence and comfort, both internally to the Chinese people as well as to the rest of the world. This new and cultivated image was only rarely dented with a show of hubris, as was evident in the display of national pride tinged with arrogance during the 2008 Olympics.        
	Chinese leaders were convinced of the success of their smile as a symbol of their world strategy as waves upon waves of praise are showered on Chinas achievements by political, business and media leaders, especially from the United States of America and Europe.        
	From time to time, the Chinese smile has come under stress. For example, while dealing with disturbances in Tibet and Xian or during the massive earthquake and the infant food scandal. But these were seen as passing episodes of crisis which any large country has to face and deal with time and again.        
	This article was triggered by the latest episode of the Chinese official cyber attack on Google where Chinese hackers extracted information and texts posted by dissident Chinese. Google has threatened, or may have already decided, to exit China. This is a major event in the modern age of the internet. The Chinese are not defensive at all about their interference in private space and business, and have stated that those who wish to do business must do so adhering to Chinese laws. Nothing wrong with this as a sovereign principle. But as Google is discovering, and many others already have, there is an important aspect of the unknown in the so-called Chinese laws. Of course, if Google exits China, as it has announced, the Chinese will claim that it will not be a loss as its indigenous search engine, Baidu, can readily fill the vacuum.              
	But the Google episode raises a number of questions. The Chinese have taken for granted that no international business can afford not to be in China, given the vast domestic market and the even greater future promise. International businesses have more or less accepted the dictum, you cannot afford not to be in China, as a mercantilist pragmatism. As the experience of the past 25 years has shown, virtually all foreign companies, with a few exceptions, have incurred successive years of losses which have all been explained away as entry costs. The difficulty of doing business in China has been further compounded by the Chinese governments increasingly preferential treatment to State companies and local investors. Having built up the hype of doing business in China, foreign companies have little choice but to grin and bear the fast changes taking place in the business environment.        
	Chinas foray into Africa, Southeast Asia and other parts of the world in search of raw materials is an important part of its long-term economic strategy. It has extended massive aid to autocratic regimes in Africa in order to get a toehold in those countries. This has, in turn, propped up oppressive regimes in poor countries. China is comfortable with monolithic politics and is not in favour of democracy and human rights, so has little difficulty in establishing beachheads in countries where others fear to tread.        
	The world is in the thrall of Chinas growing influence and financial clout, and this was reinforced by the way it managed its economy in 2008-09 while the rest of the developed world was reeling under the huge financial crisis and economic downturn. The world sees China as the juggernaut consolidating its image as the global power to rival the US. So the G20 looks less real compared to the G2 and, who knows, some day China may turn out to be the sole G.        
	As in all matters concerning man and nature, nothing can be taken for granted. With the Google episode and Chinas handling of its human rights activists and pro-democracy scholars, the Chinese smile has begun to seem like a frown more frequently. Iron ore suppliers have banded together to resist Chinas high-handed attitude in price negotiations, and Chinas aggressive posture at the Copenhagen climate change conference was, not surprisingly, rebuffed by the Americans.              
	Whatever China does has a single objective, and that is to protect the monolithic powerhouse of the Communist Party of China. Although it is well known that there is a long-standing and ongoing power struggle within the politburo, these have been well managed for the sake of self-interest and self-preservation. China will go to any length to retain the absolute hold of the CPC, whether it is by favouring its own investors over those from abroad or by curbing those like Google, who may be seen as being not desirable for Chinas internal stability. What China will not tolerate is internal dissension or efforts to promote free speech. China sees restrictiveness and repression as essential elements for the greater good of its people and the stability of the nation. If it serves its purpose, China will bare its teeth and the smile may appear to be a snarl, but this would all be for the sake of peace and prosperity of the Chinese people.        
	As China becomes even more economically powerful and militarily menacing, it will continue to bolster its claim that international companies cannot afford not to do business in China and will have to continue to invest and work in China according to the rules and regulations which support Chinas political goals.        
	By not revaluing its currency, China has overtaken Germany as the worlds largest exporter. It has started to lay down the terms and conditions regarding the way it is going to do business in China and with the rest of the world. Those who do not agree with such rules, as Google is finding out, have the choice of bearing up or exiting. Google is a signal to the rest of the free world of the shape of the future to emerge as China decides to balance its smile with its snarl, as it may best suit its purpose in the future.

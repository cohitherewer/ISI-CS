	Blanked out                  
	Sir  Team India, under stand-in captain Gautam Gambhir, made a clean sweep in the one-day international series against New Zealand (Clinical finish by India, Dec 11) In the final match, India notched up a facile win over New Zealand with almost 29 overs to spare. Indias emphatic performance at a time when most of the senior players are away acclimatizing in South Africa for the upcoming Test series clearly demonstrates the depth of their bench strength. Little wonder then that India currently occupies the second position in the international ODI ranking. India has also been tipped as a hot favourite to lift the world cup by many experts. This could well be true, given the fact that India will be playing in familiar surroundings and would command huge home support.           
	On the other hand, New Zealand has had a miserable tour of the subcontinent. After being thrashed by minnows Bangladesh in an ODI series earlier, they were humiliated by a much stronger Indian side. New Zealand is not a bad team in limited overs cricket. They have a number of useful all-rounders and their efforts have often been praiseworthy in the past. Daniel Vettori and his team need to do a lot of thinking before the big event, which will again be played in the subcontinent. New Zealand should take up the challenge in a spirited manner.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The clean sweep registered by a young and confident Indian side against New Zealand was a perfect way to prepare for the forthcoming world cup. The Indian team dominated the series completely, and most of the players came up with all-round performances. From the Indian point of view, there were many positives from the series. Yuvraj Singh  one of the most dangerous players in limited overs cricket  seemed to have rediscovered his touch. Gautam Gambhir led from the front, scoring two back-to- back centuries and displayed his captaincy skills. Virat Kohlis consistent performance showed why he is considered to be important to the team. Yusuf Pathan scored an exceptional century and bowled well. He justified his inclusion for the number seven slot. India seems to have found in him the all-rounder that they were looking for.           
	The series result reflected the bench strength of the Indian team. It also showed that the young players of the Indian team are a matured lot. Consequently, the team played outstandingly in spite of the absence of senior players like Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, M.S. Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh.           
	The decision to experiment with the reserve players and send the seniors to South Africa to prepare for the Test series was a good move on the part of the coach, Gary Kirsten, and the selectors.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Too heavy          
	Sir  It has been reported that the Indian ambassador to Washington, Meera Shankar, was pulled out of a security line at Jackson-Evers International Airport in Mississippi and subjected to a pat down by a security officer (Sari gives US itchy fingers, Dec 10). Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state of the United States of America, has expressed concern over the incident and vowed to prevent a recurrence (Pat-down summon for US diplomat, Dec 12).           
	However, the US homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, has defended the action by security officials and insisted that they had gone about their task by the book. A Transportation Security Administration spokesman has stated that diplomats are not exempt from searches, and that Shankar was screened in accordance with TSAs security policies.           
	Meanwhile, South Bloc has registered a muted protest to the US deputy chief of mission in India, and indicated that if such incidents were repeated, India could be forced to withdraw certain diplomatic privileges to American officials. Why didnt the Indian government have the courage to use stronger diplomatic language? One wonders how the government of a developed country would have reacted if a senior diplomat had been singled out and treated in an unacceptable manner.                     
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  After 9/11, the US has become very cautious. The pat down of Meera Shankar needs to be seen in this light. Security is lax in India. Had Indias security arrangement been as tight as the USs, the terror strike in Varanasi would have been averted.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  Now that worms have found genetically modified crops tasty, the claims about the invincibility of GM crops appear to be dubious (Worms eat into GM crop myth, Dec 13). The power of worms is awesome. With their staggering diversity and their ability to survive under very harsh conditions, worms and insects can morph into tools of terror. They can also be of great help to mankind as they play a crucial role in the pollination of plants.           
	The tonnes of chemicals and pesticides showered on these species by farmers have not exterminated them. On the contrary, they have evolved and can now resist the impact of chemicals. Recently, scientists discovered a microbe that can feed on arsenic. If microbes are capable of surviving after eating arsenic, GM crops should be gourmet food for worms.                     
	Yours faithfully,

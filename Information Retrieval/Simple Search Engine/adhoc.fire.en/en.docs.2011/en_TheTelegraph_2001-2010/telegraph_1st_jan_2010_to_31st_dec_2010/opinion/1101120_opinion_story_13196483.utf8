The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | the first minister
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE FIRST MINISTER                                                          
	It is not unfair to assume that the prime minister of India is an extraordinarily busy man. It is easy to imagine that on any given day he receives innumerable letters, petitions, reports and other forms of communication. Is it possible for the prime minister or his office to respond to all of these? Obviously not. He and the officers assisting him sort the communications that he receives and decide which demand his immediate attention and which deserve to go into the wastepaper basket. This is the prime ministers personal decision and no external agency, private or institutional, can dictate to the prime minister on which matter to accord priority. Even the Supreme Court, the highest judicial body of the Indian republic, cannot decide that it was mandatory for the prime minister to respond to a particular communication sent by a particular individual on a particular matter. All this sounds self-evident, yet Manmohan Singh, the present prime minister, has become the subject of a huge controversy  indeed of something like a reprimand from the apex court  because of his delay in responding to a petition sent by a political leader asking for action against the former minister of telecommunications, A. Raja.        
	The controversy should be seen in its broader context. The Supreme Court is absolutely right to be concerned about an issue relating to corruption and loss to the exchequer. In fact, it has earned the gratitude of the nation by taking a very strong position on such practices. While applauding the court, it needs to be noted that there is a very clear distinction between the scope of the judiciary and the prerogatives of the executive. In fact, that distinction forms a critical part of the checks and balances that are essential for the functioning of a democratic polity. That distinction would suggest that the prime minister was well within his right to even ignore the concerned petition. The comments of the Supreme Court, despite being motivated by the noble intention of eradicating corruption from public life, tread close to blurring the distinction between the judiciary and the executive.        
	The prime ministers respect for the Supreme Court and for the latters concern regarding corruption in government will in no way be diminished if he upholds the distinction between the executive and the judiciary. It is the prime ministers duty to uphold the Constitution and the principles of democratic practice enshrined in it. After all, Mr Singhs executive powers flow from the principles laid down in the Constitution. Mr Singh has already taken action against the erring minister by asking him to resign. If necessary, he should politely assert before the Supreme Court his executive prerogative. The prime minister of India will lose nothing by behaving as the prime minister of India.

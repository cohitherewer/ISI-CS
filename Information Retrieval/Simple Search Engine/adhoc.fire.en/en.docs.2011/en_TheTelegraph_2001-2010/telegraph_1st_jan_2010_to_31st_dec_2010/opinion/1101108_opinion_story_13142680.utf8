	Arhar dal is an undistinguished food. Many Indians eat it in a soup which hardly reminds them of the yellow bean that gave itself up for them. But they sat up when its price rose by a quarter within weeks at the end of the last monsoon. The rains were late, and there was a fear of crop failure. Lentil is not a popular plaything of traders, so its market stocks are just about enough to last till the next crop; if the crop failed, there would be a severe shortage. The market activated itself to ration the shortage between consumers in the only way it could: prices went up. But few Indians would think of doing without dal in their meal, and since its cost was only a fraction of the cost of the meal, even a substantial price rise was not enough to persuade them to eat less dal. So prices went on rising till the crop came in.        
	Now an economist has come up with a theory that it was not the monsoon that was at fault, but Indians, who are getting too rich too fast. He is not really an economist any longer, for he has become the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India and has two executive assistants to do his intellectual work for him. But old habits die hard; Subir Gokarn cannot settle down to just making mollifying speeches in mellifluous language. He has strayed away from his ordained work and done some figure work which suggests to him that it is not just lentils that fuelled inflation, but all sources of protein including meat, eggs, fish and milk. Inflation in lentils subsided when the new crop came in. But in animal products, there was no new crop, and prices continued to rise. He thus wants to draw our attention to a wider phenomenon than lentil shortage; it was really growing shortage price inflation in protein sources.        
	Such a general inflationary spiral cannot be due to supply factors, but must be due to rising demand for proteins, which is normal amongst populations that are growing rich; as they prosper, they replace vegetable by animal sources of protein. Nor can it subside in time; Indians will continue to get more prosperous and eat more animal products, so their prices will continue to rise and to feed general inflation. He finds additional factors that point to rising inflation: rise in egg production is slowing down, as well as in milk production. He harks back to the white revolution which heralded a long boom in milk output, and calls for a similar revolution in protein products. While he is right that no country other than India eats lentils and can supply them in significant quantities, there is no reason why they cannot be persuaded to produce lentils for India  provided India promises unfettered access to its market.

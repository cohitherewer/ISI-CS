	Taxmen have traditionally been known to be arbitrary and brutal, and their victims have always considered it fair to hoodwink them and, if that is not possible, to run away from them. That is what rich Indians did when India was infested with socialism. That era passed two decades ago; today, it is doubtful if wealthy people keep much money abroad. But the government is always a couple of decades behind the events; it has, together with G20, decided to join a crusade against tax havens. There is another way of getting the rich without having to pursue them to remote islands: it is to tax what they cannot run away with, namely, their property. Traditionally, property taxes have been the prerogative of local authorities, since they are difficult for the rich to avoid. But that also makes municipalities a plaything of the rich. It is easier to rig elections in a city than in a province or a country; the rich make sure their slaves are elected, or buy those who have been elected, and keep property taxes low.        
	Rates of property tax depend on the base; the higher the base, the lower the rates that can raise a certain required revenue. Hence it would be rational to levy tax on the market price of property; as property prices rise, revenue will go up without any change in rates, and the local authority will get the money it needs to keep its city fit for the rich. But rising rates can be uncomfortable for those who are not getting rich. They are often the majority; they manage to keep rates low. That is good for the rich, but not so good for the municipal corporations.        
	The long boom in India has sent property prices skyrocketing. It creates an opportunity for corporations which none of them has utilized; they are either dominated by or afraid of the not-so-rich who do not want their taxes going up. But there is a way if only they would have the courage to adopt it. It is to revise property tax rates every year without aiming for overly high revenues. It would be equitable to keep property tax rates proportional to property values. Property sales are also more frequent in areas where prices are rising fastest; new owners are less likely to resist a rise in taxes than old ones. Hence annual revaluation is likely to face less resistance than a sudden hike in taxes. Revenue too should be raised, but no more than the income of a citys residents, so that the share of income they pay remains more or less the same. If municipal authorities exercise restraint in their revenue demands, and spend the revenue on the most felt needs of urban residents, there is no reason why they should not benefit from the property boom that is going on.

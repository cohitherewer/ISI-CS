                              Trouble on wheels        
	 Eleven accidents in 15 months have left 300 people dead. Could the stint get more nightmarish for the railways minister? The recent robbery on the Lal Quila Express in Bihar must have added to her woes. Who knows, it may reaffirm Mamata Banerjees suspicions of a political conspiracy against her. But it is not only the railways minister who is harbouring suspicions. Passengers too have long suspected that they ought to place more faith in the benevolence of the Almighty than in the abilities of successive railways ministers to ensure their safety. Faith, as we all know, not only moves mountains but also politicians. Sitaram Yechury, member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), declared recently, Railways abhi Ram bharose chal raha hai (the railways is running on the mercy of Ram). Shortly afterwards, Yechurys view was seconded by Shahnawaz Hussain, who announced as piquantly  Ab railways khuda bharose....                                
	 Talking about nightmares, the government in Bihar seems to be having a lot of them recently. Rajiv Ranjan, alias Lalan Singh, the rebel JD(U) MP from Munger, is giving jitters to Nitish Kumar by threatening to campaign for the Congress in the forthcoming assembly polls. Singh is in a rather helpless situation.      
	Singh does not want to resign from the JD(U) as that would mean giving up a Lok Sabha seat. But Kumar will not oblige Singh by expelling him from the party and making him a martyr. Singh is apparently so desperate that he was supposedly seen pleading with the JD(U) president, Sharad Yadav, to expel him. But the JD(U) will not make it easy for him. Hence the counter-threat.                            
	 Rahul Gandhi and Shahnawaz Hussain met recently while entering Parliament and soon got into a long conversation that carried on even after they had reached the Central Hall. It is difficult to get more than a few sentences out of reticent Rahul; so such a prolonged conversation naturally surprised many people. But what has caused more surprise is the fact that someone as garrulous as Hussain, who usually has a lot of problems keeping things to himself, is suddenly appearing to be as tongue-tied as Rahul. He has so far rebuffed all efforts at finding out what the talk and walk was all about.                            
	 Is it time to bid goodbye to Rahul Gandhis crusade for party reform and internal democracy? It may still be too early to sound the death knell, but surely, matters do not seem to be very bright for the Congress. In Jharkhand, the state party unit recently called off the inner party polls citing the Maoist threat. Since Maoists never run short of bigger targets and bigger elections, the excuse sounded rather lame. Now it seems that state leaders want the partys central leadership to take matters in their hands since Rahuls philosophy is taking the partys state unit nowhere. Things do not seem to be any better in the other states. In Bihar, LK Yadav, allegedly funded and supported by Pappu Yadav from jail, has been elected president of the Bihar youth Congress after Rahuls protg was found to be older than the cut-off age. Meanwhile, the Congress legislature party leader, Ashok Ram, is said to be pushing his sons case. In Tamil Nadu, P Chidambaram and his son, Karthik, are believed to be organizing the party their own way. Each to his own again.                            
	 Flip-flop-flip. The Bharatiya Janata Party has always lambasted the Central Bureau of Investigation for being a tool of the ruling party in power at the Centre. But there was a slight change in the rhetoric recently when the CBI director gave a clean chit to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leaders who, it was being alleged, were involved in saffron terrorism.      
	For a few days, the BJP vigorously cited the CBI chiefs comment to prove the RSSs innocence. That was till the arrest of Amit Shah, the Gujarat home minister who also happens to be a close aide of the chief minister, Narendra Modi. After this debacle, the BJP, unsurprisingly, went back to its sloganeering ways. Alas, the more things change, the more they remain the same.                        
	 In India, it usually rains politics. In Rajasthan, politics is about rains. The reason is not far to find, given that a majority of the people in this arid land depend on the monsoon to earn their livelihood. Given their centrality to life, the rains have emerged as a political weapon to bludgeon the chief minister with. Ashok Gehlot found himself being blamed by his political opponents for the weak monsoon. When it rained during the time the CM was on a foreign tour, it was taken as further proof of his inauspiciousness. But the heavens seem to have taken pity on Gehlots plight. During a rally attended by the chief minister, it started to rain heavily. Gehlot, drenched to his bones, managed to take a swipe at his opponents. The opposition wanted it not to rain, so that it can blame me. Well, no longer, or till the rain stops.

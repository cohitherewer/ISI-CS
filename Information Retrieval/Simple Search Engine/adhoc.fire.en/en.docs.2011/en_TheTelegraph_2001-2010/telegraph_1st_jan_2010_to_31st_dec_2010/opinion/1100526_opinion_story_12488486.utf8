The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Reform and   regulate
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        Reform and   regulate
				       A raft of new bills on higher education promises to shake up the sector like never before.  But will the proposed laws be   an unmixed blessing?   Seetha finds out                                                      ON THE TABLE: The new laws will revolutionise higher education in India     
	After shaking up the school education system, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal has now turned his reforming zeal to higher education. On May 3, Sibal tabled four bills in the Lok Sabha  a rare feat for any minister. Thats not all. Nine more bills related to higher education are in the offing. And a draft bill on a new regulatory body  the National Commission on Higher Education and Research (NCHER)  is being circulated for comments.        
	This is creating a framework for a quite different educational system from what we are used to. It crafts an eco-system for the delivery of educational services by multiple players while addressing issues of quality and transparency, says Dhiraj Mathur, executive director and India leader for the education sector at consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).        
	So the Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operation) Bill will set rules to allow foreign universities to operate out of India, the National Accreditation Regulatory Authority for Higher Institutions Bill will license accreditation agencies and set out rules for rating universities, the Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical Educational Institutions, Medical Educational Institutions and Universities Bill will penalise institutions taking capitation fees or manipulating admissions while the Educational Tribunals Bill will set up a mechanism for speedy redressal of disputes.        
	Each of the bills is addressing a particular need, says Amitabh Jhingan, partner and education sector leader at consulting firm Ernst amp; Young. They are a clear step towards an effective regulatory framework.        
	The bills on education tribunals and accreditation have attracted little flak as of now, though some educationists are sceptical about them. The tribunals were recommended as far back as 1986 in the National Policy on Education. A fast-track justice delivery system, the human resource development ministry explains, would build an effective system of checks and balances and help in the orderly growth of the sector.        
	The bill provides for national and state-level tribunals to decide on various categories of disputes relating to service matters, affiliation issues and unfair practices. Failure to comply with the orders of the tribunals could invite a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh and jail for up to three years.        
	But opponents of the bill point out that it may not be feasible to set up so many tribunals. Where are they going to get the people to man these, asks K. Shyam Prasad, chancellor, Martin Luther University, Shillong. It may turn out to be just a tamasha.        
	The bill on accreditation, which will make accreditation of all higher education institutions mandatory, has also got a mixed response. Currently, accreditation is handled by two agencies  the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), an autonomous body under the University Grants Commission and the National Board of Accreditation, part of the All India Council for Technical Education  and is optional. As a result, less than one-third of all universities and less than one-fifth of colleges are accredited.        
	The new bill will create an enabling environment for multiple accreditation agencies and specify norms for grading. That, says H.S. Ballal, pro-chancellor of Manipal University, is a welcome move, since NAAC was over-burdened with work. Benchmarking institutions with others is necessary. The National Accreditation Regulatory Authority will register, monitor and audit the functioning of these agencies.        
	However, Mathur points out that the effectiveness of the law will take time to assess, since accreditation agencies are still to come up.        
	Theres more scepticism about the Foreign Educational Institutions Bill and the Prohibition of Unfair Practices Bill and experts wonder if they will serve the purpose for which they are designed.              
	At least two provisions in the Foreign Educational Institutions Bill  that they should set up a corpus of Rs 50 crore ($10 million) and they should not repatriate profits  are likely to put off foreign universities. While Mathur feels Rs 50 crore is a lot of money for genuine, not-for-profit institutions, Jhingan feels it is not an unreasonable amount, provided institutions have the ability to build up the corpus as they scale their operations.        
	Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), one institution that is serious about setting up a campus in India, has flagged this as an area of concern. The corpus requirement will place a financial burden on legitimate institutions planning to initiate operations in India, specially in times when our budgets are already under pressure, Vijay K. Madisetti, professor and executive director of Georgia Techs India Initiative, told The Telegraph. It would be easier, he says, if this corpus requirement could be met through letters of commitment, cost sharing or other means like land and physical assets.        
	The clause on non-repatriation of profits isnt an issue for Georgia Tech. We are a non-profit government-funded entity, and will establish a not-for-profit entity in India, says Madisetti. Jhingan feels this will be a non-issue for at least the first 10 years, since educational institutions take that much time to generate any meaningful surplus. Mathur, however, feels this will put off foreign universities. Not all institutions are not-for-profit ones, he points out, and private companies will want a return on investment. It might be utopian to expect them not to make or repatriate profits.        
	As Dinos Arcoumanis, deputy vice-chancellor (research and international) City University London, notes, It would be useful to consider how legislation can encourage international universities in setting up overseas, without placing restrictions on them.        
	The bill, however, is silent on whether foreign universities will have to abide by caps on fees charged or regulations on teachers salaries. Foreign universities are welcome but it should be a level-playing field, says Ballal. Rules that apply to us should apply to them as well.        
	The bill on unfair practices, on the other hand, will please most people. It attempts to check unscrupulous and fly-by-night operators, brings a measure of transparency to admissions, makes capitation fees illegal, prohibits misleading advertisements and withholding of documents as well as refusal to refund fees if students switch institutions. All these attract stiff penalties ranging from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 50 lakh.        
	But Shyam Prasad wonders if the proposed law will be effective. The issues are identified but things are left hanging, he says. The bill, he points out, does not say how to ensure that capitation fees will not be taken at all. These fees, which are illegal even now, are never taken openly. And no parent ever comes forward to complain. Enforcement will be an issue, agrees PwCs Mathur. The more draconian the law, the greater its misuse.        
	Capitation fees, notes P.V. Indiresan, former dean of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, are the result of a demand-supply gap in education. It might be better, he feels, to institutionalise it the way many universities in the United States do, by admitting less meritorious students who can contribute to their endowment fund. These donations help them in subsidising bright students who cannot afford their fees. Dont go against the economics of the situation, he advises.        
	But is anyone listening?

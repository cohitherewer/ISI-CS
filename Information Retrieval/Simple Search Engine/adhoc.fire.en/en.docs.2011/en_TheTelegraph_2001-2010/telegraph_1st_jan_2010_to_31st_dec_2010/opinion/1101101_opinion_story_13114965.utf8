                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME TO TRIM                                                    
	The finance minister may not be aware of the fact, since he has so many irons in the fire, but his tax revenues have more than doubled in the past five years. The star is corporation tax, whose revenue has more than tripled. Even personal taxpayers are not far behind; their tax payments went up two-and-a-half times. Indirect taxes used to dominate the budget when the Congress took over; it is direct taxes that bring more revenue today. Despite the billions he has poured into the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme, the public distribution system and such other populist schemes, the prime minister will continue to campaign for inclusive growth. But his finance minister has certainly achieved exclusive growth of taxes from the rich.         
	That achievement gives him some freedom of manoeuvre in the next budget; he can give away some concessions. It is unlikely that he can reduce direct taxes without too much of a pinch to his socialist conscience. But one good candidate for concessions is import duties. They are not high on the average; but they are concentrated on a few commodities, which pay disproportionately high duty. In particular, agricultural products are subjected to scandalously high duties. Tariffs came down substantially when the Bharatiya Janata Party ruled the country; while it brought down all other duties, it hesitated on agricultural duties because it had a reputation of being a party of urban traders, and wanted to make inroads into villages. The Congress has had so many dreams that required expenditure that it did not give a thought to duty concessions. But duties on many agricultural products are much higher than the difference between import and domestic prices. In those cases, duties can be reduced without affecting domestic prices at all.         
	More important, agriculture is producing too much foodgrain. The Indian consumer has got rich  or at least become less poor  and no longer wants to eat more foodgrain. The government finds that most inconvenient, for it buys up all the wheat and rice offered to it at extremely high procurement prices; its stocks have been going up and up, and it is getting a bad name because it is letting them rot in the open. It is planning to build more godowns, in the hope that if the grains rot behind closed doors, no one will notice it. But while that may be a more efficient cover-up, the problem will get worse and worse unless the government changes its ways. Agriculture needs to produce more, and can produce more, but will not do so unless price incentives are allowed to work. The world market is 20 times as big as Indias, but farmers cannot access it unless domestic prices are similar to international prices. And they can be brought closer if agricultural import duties are abolished. The finance minister should do so, except perhaps for political crops like wheat and rice.

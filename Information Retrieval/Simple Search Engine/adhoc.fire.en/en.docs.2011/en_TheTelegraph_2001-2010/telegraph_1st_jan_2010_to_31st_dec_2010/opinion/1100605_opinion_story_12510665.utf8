	Sheer indifference                  
	Sir  The global food shortage is a cause for worry for economists all over the world. In India, the most fertile zones  the river basins  are under threat. Policymakers, in the Centre as well as in the states, seem to cherish the percentage growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors while ignoring the primary sector. Despite being the basic means of livelihood for most people in the Asia-Pacific region, agriculture continues to be neglected  macroeconomic policies in India overlook the agrarian sector, thereby increasing economic inequality.          
	Yours faithfully,        Md Ziyaullah Khan, Nagpur
        
	Deplorable act          
	Sir  The storming of the Gaza-bound ships by Israeli navy commandos shows the high-handedness of the Israeli military (10 killed as Israel storms Gaza aid ships, June 1). This atrocity needs to be condemned as it violates all humanitarian norms and international ethics. It is reported that people belonging to 50 countries were on board the three ships when the vessels came under attack. One fails to understand why Israel would launch an offensive on citizens of other nations. The ships were carrying relief weighing about 10,000 tonnes to the 1.5 million Palestinian population in the Gaza strip. Most of the people living there depend on foreign aid. The United Nations must step in and make sure that Israel refrains from such violence in future.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
N.R. Ramachandran, Ooty

                
	Sir  Israel could not have justified its attack on the Freedom Flotilla carrying aid to Gaza had it not been for the support of the United States of America. Israel has been spewing venom on its neighbour for the last four decades. But such injustice mostly goes unreported. Dozens of Palestinians fall prey to Israeli bullets every day, but no one terms this act of violence a terror attack. A 2005 UN address by Kofi Annan described terror as an act intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a Government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing an act. By this definition, the attack on the aid flotilla comes under the category of a terror strike. Peace- loving countries, including India, must come together not only to condemn such deplorable acts, but also to rethink their growing financial and military ties with Israel.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shafaque Alam, New Delhi

                
	Sir  The Israeli assault on an unarmed flotilla in international waters must be censured in the severest terms. Israel has been blatantly misusing the universal goodwill it had gained after the Holocaust. The powerful lobby it has in the US has emboldened it further. Palestinians right to live freely in their own land has been brutally taken away by the repeated displays of Israels might. It is high time that nations impose heavy sanctions on this country through the UN. Israel should be dealt with in the same manner as it has been treating the Palestinians all this while.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Narayanan, Ghaziabad

                
	Sir  It is not enough to merely demand an inquiry into the attack on the Freedom Flotilla. There can be no justification for assaulting civilians or for occupying their territory. Israel has been systematically ignoring UN resolutions, especially the one formulated in the 1960s that required it to end the assault on the occupants of the Gaza strip and to allow free circulation of humanitarian aid.          
	Yours faithfully,

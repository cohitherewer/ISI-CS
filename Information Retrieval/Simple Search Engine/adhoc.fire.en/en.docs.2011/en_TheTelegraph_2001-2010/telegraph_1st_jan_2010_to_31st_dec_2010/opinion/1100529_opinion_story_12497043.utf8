The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Separate paths of flight
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SEPARATE PATHS OF FLIGHT                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Now that the brood of new plays by Calcutta groups incubated by the Odeon Festival have taken wing on their separate flight paths and can be regularly seen in public, we can assess them objectively from a distance.        
	Swapna-sandhanis Bhay (picture) combines dramatist Bratya Basu with director Koushik Sen on an ostensible ghost story that develops into political allegory. A married couple goes holidaying to a remote forest, only to find their accommodation there seemingly haunted. The first half grabs us with comic and eerie effects, some of them spine-tingling, especially when loadshedding occurs in the lodge. Gradually, however, the two spooks become more human, engaging in dialogue and debate with the city-dwellers about betrayal. Without leaking the plot, suffice it to say that Indias internal crisis forms Basus real concern. It reminds me superficially of the original script I directed around the same time, Wire, in which two apparent extremists take a film crew hostage in a jungle. But any similarity is purely coincidental.        
	Sen ensures that the acting is credible and natural. Siddhartha and Deblina Datta create typical urban yuppies preoccupied with creature comforts. The ghosts from the past, as it turns out  emphasize retributive justice in their portrayals by Srabasti and Sen himself. Unfortunately the set, liberally pasted with collages of topical newspaper headlines, tends to give the game away.        
	Rangakarmees Bhor, written and directed by Usha Ganguli but based on actual observation of and conversations with patients (who remain anonymous) in drug rehab centres, deals with addiction and detoxification, true to her socially-conscious agenda. Like her powerful early production, Holi, it depicts the insecurities and frustrations of youth with psychological verisimilitude; in fact, one tragic scene towards the end instantly recalls an almost identical incident in Holi. But Bhor concludes with uplifting signs of hope. We may point out in passing Gangulis directorial note that substance abuse does not arise only from an overtly commercial society, which is just one cause of the problem.        
	Ganguli recruits many first-timers without any stage experience and disciplines them into theatrical competence for the episodes involving the 20 boys in the institution. Sagnik Mukherjees strong presence in the main role proves the case. Thus her workshop method, and not relying on any set, bear good results, although occasionally too transparent. In contrast, the celebratory rally at the close led by a kids marching band looks rather ragged.        
	Niva Arts Shashtha Ritu, dramatized by Atish Chanda from a Samaresh Basu story, relates the tough life of a Vaishnava Palagan singer today. Despite her devotion and spiritual songs, her social status corresponds more or less to that of a fallen woman kept by rich male benefactors. As she grows older, she realizes that her patron has transferred his gaze and desire to her adopted teenage daughter, whom she has trained in the same vocal tradition. The futures of both women are at stake; but more importantly than their individual fates, director Biplab Bandyopadhyay successfully focuses on the trying conditions in which such female performers survive and travel to earn their living in the spring season.        
	The three main cast members act well: Manisha Adak expresses the anxieties and burdens that the lead character must tackle on her own and Turna Das the rebellious independence of the young girl; Atish Chanda enacts the impulsive but loyal rickshawala who serves as their percussionist. The women sing the kirtans of Vidyapati and Govindadas perfectly, though Das could throw her voice more. It is a pity that Chanda cannot himself play the khol.        
	Ghosts return, in playful form, in Blank Verses Bhutum Bhagaban. Raja Bhattacharya has composed what he calls a musical joint venture between spirits and humans, that should entertain his target audience, children. The premise is that mortals have stopped believing in apparitions, so Ghostdom confronts an existential crisis, and banishes a ghoul urchin for suggesting that they should help humans. Meanwhile on earth, the father of a 12-year-old throws his son out of the house for failing his exams. The two outcasts, merrily performed by Aryabrata Bhattacharya and Sayan Banik, join hands and fight evil. Bhattacharya directs this simple adventure with lots of clowning, an array of colourful costumes and spectral makeup (by Aloke Debnath), and pulsating music.

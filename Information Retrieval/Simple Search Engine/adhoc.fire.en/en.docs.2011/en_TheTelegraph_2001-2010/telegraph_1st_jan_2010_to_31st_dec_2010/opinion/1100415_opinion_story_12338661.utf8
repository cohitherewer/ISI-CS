	India honours the outstanding figures of its history by declaring holidays on their birthdays. The debt to greatness thus paid, it seems no longer necessary to remember some of the most important aspects of their achievements or visions. B.R. Ambedkar, remembered though he is as the saviour of the oppressed and the backward, seems to have been forgotten as a maker of the Indian Constitution. In this age of quota politics, most recently with the tumult surrounding the womens reservation in legislative bodies bill, the wisdom and rationality of Ambedkars vision of affirmative action through reservations have been quietly jettisoned. Ambedkar, together with his colleagues in the constituent assembly, saw reservations as a way of making all Indians equal. As the Constitution indicates, it may be necessary to extend special provisions to those whom the injustices of history had put at a disadvantage. But Ambedkar felt that such provisions should be extended within a time frame, with the aim of gradually closing the distance between minorities and the majority. Reservations would thus not become a crutch, neither would they become a political tool. His suggestion of a time frame was 15 years, with necessary modifications and adjustments perhaps, till a disadvantaged group was ready to merge with the mainstream. The driving principle behind Ambedkars vision was equality: there would come a time, he hoped, when caste would no longer matter in an Indians life.        
	Indian politicians have seized upon reservations and thrown away Ambedkars principle. There is no question of a time frame, and no one thinks of periodic reviews either. The quota system has become purely a political tool, and caste identity a political asset to be used forever. Inevitably, this use of positive discrimination is beginning to undermine one of the most important principles of democracy, that of equality. By turning the principle behind the constitutional direction to protect the disadvantaged on its head, Indias politicians are filling their vote kitties on the strength of difference and fragmentation. Far from equality, distinction by caste has now become a part of everyday Indian life. Ambedkars vision was one based on the future equality of Indian citizens where caste will not matter. Indians have gone in precisely the opposite direction by letting politics annihilate principle.

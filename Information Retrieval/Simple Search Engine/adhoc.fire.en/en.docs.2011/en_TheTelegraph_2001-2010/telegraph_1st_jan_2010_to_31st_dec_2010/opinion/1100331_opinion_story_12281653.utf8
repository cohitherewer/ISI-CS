	Just when Russia seemed poised to enter a new phase in its relationship with the United States of America, its bitter enemy in the Cold War, history intervened. Days after agreeing on a nuclear arms reduction treaty with Washington, Moscow has been ripped apart by powerful explosions on its underground network. It may be tempting to read a deeper meaning into the timing, especially when the arrow of suspicion is directed at the usual suspects  Islamic separatists from the North Caucasus fighting to separate the republics of Chechnya, Ingushetia and Dagestan from Russia. In the days before 9/11, the axis of evil, for the US, passed through Russia, whose desire for supremacy over Central Asia went back to the Soviet era, and even further back to the age of imperialist expansion. With the war on terror, the US swiftly interchanged its friends and foes in the region, though Russia was already having a field day over its relatively weaker neighbours since 1999. Chechnya, in particular, has been bruised and battered by Russian soldiers, who have killed, raped and plundered with impunity. These atrocities were also perpetrated in Georgia  locked in a fierce struggle with Russia over South Ossetia and Abkhazia  by Russian peacekeeping troops, culminating in the devastating war in 2008.        
	In the two intervening years, the rhetorical battle between the US and Russia has changed into some sort of an alliance, to be now clinched by the upcoming nuclear deal. The coming together of these two major global powers serves well to keep the pressure on Iran to make a clean breast of its own supposedly clandestine proliferation programme. There is also the common goal of destroying the terrorists, to borrow a phrase that the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, used in the wake of the Moscow attacks. But then, Mr Putin should not confuse the enemy of the US with the one that threatens his own nation. Terrorism may be a global phenomenon but its roots are almost always local. Barack Obama appears to be aware of this dimension as he tries to negotiate the knotty question of how justice can be done to the Middle East, Cuba, South and Central Asia  regions that have figured as stubborn challenges in the chequered history of his nation. But in contrast, Mr Putins aggressive nationalism, modelled on a Stalinist absolutism, has not only undermined the political and human-rights reforms achieved by Boris Yeltsin and by Mikhail Gorbachevs glasnost, but also destablized Central Asia.

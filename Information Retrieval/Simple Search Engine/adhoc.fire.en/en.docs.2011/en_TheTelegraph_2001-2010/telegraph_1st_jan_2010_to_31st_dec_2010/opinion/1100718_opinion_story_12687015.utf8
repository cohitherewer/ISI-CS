	Major embarrassment                   
	Sir  Britain has been shocked by reports of massive swindling in India in millions of pounds granted as aid for the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (India aid from UK faces cut, July 12). This is a major embarrassment for India, and should check the tendency of its political class to lecture the rest of the world on values, morality, economics and what have you. It is time that we name and shame the perpetrators of such outright fraud. As India is now providing aid to other countries, it is incongruous that it continues to receive grants that are then misused by its own citizens.          
	Yours faithfully,        Bhaskar Majumdar, Kuwait 
        
	Makeover city          
	Sir  Subir Roy rightly points out the inherent flaws in Mamata Banerjees request to Sam Pitroda to prepare a blueprint for the further development of Calcutta (Towards inclusive growth, July 14). As someone who shuttles regularly between Calcutta and Siliguri, I dare say that this plan is not conducive to the development of the state. As Roy points out, other states like Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have ensured a more even spread of urbanization. This has given a boost to their own development programmes.          
	Though Siliguri is the second largest city in West Bengal after Calcutta, its pattern of development is haphazard, to say the least. While many satellite townships are coming up on its outskirts, people who live within the core area under the Siliguri Municipal Corporation face the same problems that Banerjee is trying to eradicate from areas under the Calcutta Municipal Corporation  waterlogging, lack of sanitation, poor road connectivity, and so on. Siliguri also lags behind in education, what with the shortage of colleges offering courses in the sciences and the humanities. In this context, Roys argument, with regard to further development of Andal, Siliguri and Berhampore, deserves kudos. Such plans, if implemented, will certainly ease pressure on Calcutta and ensure a more balanced spread of urbanization in Bengal.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Rony Patra, Siliguri 

                
	Sir  It is not enough for a Union cabinet minister to ask an expert to suggest ways of making Calcutta an international city comparable with London. It requires a lot of determination to realize such an objective. A classic case of the hiatus between repeated declarations of leaders and reality can be illustrated by what happened to Mumbai. For decades, leaders have been speaking of their aim to turn Mumbai into an international city. So a new city was duly created in Navi Mumbai. Yet, its infrastructure is creaking, health and educational facilities have not improved, and slums are proliferating.           
	It is heartening, however, that a leader is sparing some thought on remaking Calcutta. In the past, politicians from West Bengal never missed a chance to hold up the claims of Calcutta. In 1956, when Life Insurance Corporation of India was nationalized, a debate ensued in Parliament over whether to set up its headquarters in Calcutta. That enthusiasm waned over time, and when the State Bank of India shifted some of its operations out of Calcutta, there was no comparable public outcry.          
	Calcuttas proximity to Southeast Asia should persuade the state and the Central governments to turn it into a global city with air links to major destinations. Hopefully, the leaders who have begun to talk about this concept, however belatedly, will use all their powers to translate this idea into reality. That will also be in consonance with the Look East policy, which is all but forgotten now.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Subramanyan, Mumbai

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FALLING SHORT                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Girish Karnads dramatic preoccupation with sexual triangles, whether folkloric or contemporary, finds popularity yet again in a current Bengali adaptation and a high-profile Mumbai import adapted to a Hindi context. Audiences know both plays  Naga-mandala and Broken Images  fairly well now, so their plots dont need retelling, but both directors deviate from the authorized endings.        
	For Pratyays Nag-mandala (picture), Tapas Sinha uses Swapan Majumdars Bengali translation, which he had based on the Hindi and English translations. However, recently, Karnad printed a fuller English edition in his Collected Plays which Sinha should have looked at, because it adds a closure to the outer frame and has an alternate conclusion that he could have tried out and perhaps incorporated.         
	Instead, Sinha takes a completely different frame story created by Prithwish Roy in which a jatra partys leading lady persuades the manager to allow her to narrate a woman-centric tale rather than present the usual patriarchal perspective. This girl (Smriti Sanyal) actually performs with a liveliness that Monalisa De, in the heroine Ranis part, lacks. Meanwhile, Sinha himself as the hero disappoints because of his bad habit of silently mouthing everyone elses lines as they speak.        
	Shabana Azmi accepted the challenge of the one-woman show in Ace Productions Broken Images (presented by Weavers Studio and Sanskriti Sagar), which requires the soloist to talk with her own reflection on screen, recorded in one long take including pauses for her live interjections, so that it looks like real-time dialogue. The play hinges on technology and timing, which fell marginally short of the precision attained in the original directed by Karnad, starring Arundhati Nag. The transition from live feed to DVD should not be noticeable, but here a visible fade-in broke the illusion. And Azmis stage lines occasionally ran into her screen speeches, due to imperfect timing.        
	Other than these overlaps of picture and voice, Azmi acts the duplicitous novelist and her conscience/doppelgnger gamely. But Alyque Padamsee directs the finale into a melodramatic crescendo that I can only criticize as Bollywoods bad influence. He also avoids Karnads tougher design of the multiple monitors in the TV studio jumping to life with various images of the protagonist. Now, after watching three productions of Broken Images, I question why a guilty person would pursue a conversation with a probing alter ego in an unfamiliar place so readily. She would leave immediately.

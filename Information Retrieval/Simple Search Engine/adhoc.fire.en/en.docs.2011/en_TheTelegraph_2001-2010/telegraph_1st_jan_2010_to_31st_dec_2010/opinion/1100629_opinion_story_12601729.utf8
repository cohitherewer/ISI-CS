                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Faith matters                  
	Sir  It is unfortunate that Zakir Naik, a well-known speaker on Islam and comparative religion, has been banned from entering the United Kingdom for certain comments he is alleged to have made (UK bans Indian cleric, June 19). According to reports, Naik had said, Every Muslim should be a terrorist. Those who have heard Naiks lectures will agree that his speeches have been misunderstood by the UK government. His comment about the police officer being a terrorist for the robber was taken out of context. Naik had also explained that a terrorist is a person who strikes terror in the hearts of people.          
	As for the subject of Osama bin Laden, Naik has gone on record saying that since he does not know bin Laden and has never met him, he would not like to comment on him. However, Naik should have refrained from endorsing bin Laden for fighting the enemies of Islam. Perhaps Naik has gone a bit overboard in his enthusiasm, and needs to show some restraint.          
	While the UK is free to stop any foreign citizen from entering the country, it should also study the material placed on record carefully. With an open mind, it should try to understand the context in which the comments were made.          
	The ban should serve as a wake-up call for Naik as well. In his zeal for propagating Islam, the religious speaker should not criticize other religions. Religion is a matter of faith and an individuals personal choice. No one can prove that his or her religion is superior to that of others.           
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur 

                
	Sir  Britain decided to bar the influential Muslim televangelist, Zakir Naik, based on comments that bore, according to the British home secretary, Theresa May, evidence of his unacceptable behaviour.           
	Naik, who trained as a doctor, appears to be well-versed in the scripture of other religions, including the Bible and the Vedas. However, it seems that he often uses his knowledge to disparage other religions. He allegedly recommends the death penalty as punishment for apostasy. Naik would also have India function according to the tenets of the sharia. According to some reports, he railed against the Indian government and media for inciting popular outrage against the Talibans demolition of the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan.           
	It is unfortunate that in a secular India, Hindu bigots such as Praveen Togadia of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad are fiercely criticized but radicals like Naik are allowed to get away.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  Zakir Naiks behaviour with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, who is famous for his art of living lectures, cannot be condoned in any way. Ravi Shankar had been invited to appear on Peace TV, the channel founded by Naik, to participate in a debate.           
	While the teachings of the well-known guru may arguably be a luxury of the rich, Naik should not have attacked a guest on his show that aggressively. By doing so, the televangelist violated the basic norms of courtesy. The UK has the prerogative to ban Naiks entry. Indians, on the other hand, have to live with people like Naik and Praveen Togadia.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

                
	Sir  At present, the world suffers from the man-made scourge of terrorism. It is rife with distrust among people and countries as well as with religious intolerance. The strength of the majority encroaches on the culture, religion and rights of the minority. Many of these problems stem from an inadequate knowledge of different religions and cultures.           
	In these times, Zakir Naik has devoted his life to teaching people the essence of religious scriptures. His convincing and well-reasoned discussions have led to a better understanding of all religions. This has forged bonds of sympathy among people all over the world, and fostered mutual trust and respect among those from different faiths.           
	The UK governments accusation that Naik supports terrorism is unjustified. His public lectures are available in shops as well as on the internet. His critics only have to go through them to understand his stance on the matter. What has been published in the media is a deliberate selection of sentences taken completely out of context. It should be pointed out that not a single member of Naiks audience has ever made such allegations against him. I would request the British government to withdraw its unfair allegation and lift the ban on Naik.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Md. Afsar Ali, Calcutta

                
	Treasure hunt          
	Sir  According to recent reports, a survey conducted under the aegis of the Pentagon has unearthed mineral resources worth $1 trillion in Afghanistan (Whiff of Afghan treasure, June 15). These include deposits of copper, gold, cobalt and large amounts of lithium, which is used in making cell phone batteries. Meanwhile, a study conducted by the London School of Economics has revealed that many top Taliban leaders believe that they are being run by senior officers in Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence.           
	If such reports are to be believed, the chances of Pakistan or the United States of America leaving Afghanistan are slim. The US will do its best to exploit the mineral wealth and the ISI will find in the deposits another reason to continue its ties with the Taliban. Although the Pentagon report was circumspect about the possibilities of accessing the mineral wealth, it was probably calculated to boost the flagging morale of the American offensive in the region. The prospect of wealth might prove to be an impetus to the efforts to flush out militants from southern Afghanistan, near Kandahar.          
	Yours faithfully,

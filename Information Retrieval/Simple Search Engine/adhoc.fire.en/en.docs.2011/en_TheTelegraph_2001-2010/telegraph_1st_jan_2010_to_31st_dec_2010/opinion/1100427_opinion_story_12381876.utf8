The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Thank god for the subcontinent
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THANK GOD FOR THE SUBCONTINENT                                  The Heathrow Airport, gateway to the next Olympics, can perhaps learn a lesson or two from South Asia, writes Jonathan Todhunter                                      
	I forgot that we are living in the United Kingdom of Delayed Maintenance. Also that we are at the entry gate to the most sophisticated city in the world (London, in case you asked). Well, We apologize seems to be the mantra of this State. So as I got into Terminal 1 at Heathrow to go to Geneva, there was the usual loudspeaker apologizing for various things, and I didnt immediately get it, because it seems that this is what they do here in the airports and railways of England. There is a whole loudspeaker system set up to apologize for what is not working, and to warn you, every five minutes  in case it hadnt occurred to you already  against taking things from strangers to carry to your destination, or against leaving your bag unattended.        
	Slowly, the truth dawned on me. I discovered that the whole communications and computer system of the airport was down, not to be restored till somebody could come and fix it. When I started looking at the signs for the flights, they just said, We apologize; no information available. I didnt get it, until I walked around to several boards and saw the same notice. Of course, in such situations, you look around for someone who will help you. But in this age of saving money on personnel, and We apologize because we are short-staffed notices, you simply cannot expect to speak to a human being. And this, of course, was London, not to be confused with Accra or Mumbai. I am talking of Heathrow Airport, gateway to the next Olympics. So, no signs, and nobody around. Nobody knew when any flight was leaving or from what terminal it was leaving. We were just apologized to endlessly and reminded to stay next to the luggage and not to talk to strangers. Thats it!              
	Eventually, a really bright spark, who came from the subcontinent, and thank god for that, worked out, maybe from the subcontinents experience, that a large piece of paper and a walkie-talkie would do the trick. So we had a whole takeover of the airport by Hindi or Pushtun, I cannot tell the difference, language doesnt run that exotic with me. A lady from the subcontinent was putting up the boarding gates and the supposed schedules on a huge piece of paper with a marker pen, in two colours even, and holding it up for the mob of hundreds to see. Ergo, the eponymous people more or less got to their gate, thanks to the experience and down-to-earth practicality of the subcontinent. History doesnt relate when the computer system started working again, and people got to see their gates and departure times, and we got back to the 20th century in the next Olympic capital of the world.        
	Of course, from this capital there had been a lot of huffing and puffing and harrumphing in high places as to whether China.... yes, China, would be capable of staging the Olympics. I wonder whether there is some concern in Beijing now as to whether London can do that as well. Maybe, with some help from the subcontinent, it will make it. Heaven forbid that the subcontinent gets the Olympics  they havent done anything since the Raj, old boy, Poona is just not what it was  at least, that was what I heard in the drawing rooms of the great establishment. Thank god they came here to save us from ourselves, and so we can buy the newspaper and a bottle of milk in the morning at the humble corner store, and maybe, to take over the workings of the great Heathrow Airport when our United Kingdom of Delayed Maintenance is yet again in a fix.        
	So that was Heathrow. But I did make an observation on the late departure, where the time needed to fill the plane is critical. We have the luxury of placed seating on the great historic national airlines, but what does that do? It triples the boarding time, as everyone fusses around trying to find their precious seat number. If you fly Ryanair or easyJet, the seats just fill up in a third of the time. That is perhaps why we are now getting to pay more for Ryanair and easyJet, because they are on time and reliable, and especially because they seem concerned about being on time and reliable, and the old airlines dont seem to care too much, any one of them. Wake up, you great historic airlines, the low cost airlines are overtaking your fares too, because they do what airlines should do. They are easy to book, they fly you efficiently on time to your destination. Their coverage of Europe has liberated millions of people from Aberdeen to Cairo, and they are taking over, yes, because of the price, but also because they do a better job.              
	Then we had the Swiss problem. It snowed in Zrich on this particular morning, and so all flights to Zrich were late. Naturally, your correspondent here was trying to save money on easyJet, a full 20 euros, and flying Swiss. But, of course, it didnt go directly to Geneva, it went through Zrich, otherwise it would probably have cost twice. So after an hours delay, we were late, and I was pushed into another flight. Thats fine, but 300 other people were pushed too, and the line to change the tickets was at least 3 hours long, with five, yes five, desks to handle everyone. Now Switerland works like the fabled cuckoo clock, but they cant handle something different like this. Perhaps they too should get some help from the subcontinent on how to handle emergencies. Indeed, such problems are encountered daily on the subcontinent and handled with zest and determination. When such an event occurs, the crowd is immediately surrounded by an army of hucksters, facilitators, baggagewallahs, experts on every aspect of your travelling life, and somehow the problem gets resolved in amusing and interesting ways.        
	Ryanair and easyJet would have just left you there and saved the bother. Without a baggagewallah or a problem-solver, it is better in the end. However, this was Switzerland, and I decided to I bale myself out, pulled the cord, and walked to find a train to Geneva. What a luxury, but it cost as much as the return ticket to London.        
	So here I am in Val dIsre recovering, thanking god that we have got some solid citizens from the subcontinent over here to save us from ourselves, our pomposity, our smugness about the rest of the world, and our tragic inability to maintain anything.

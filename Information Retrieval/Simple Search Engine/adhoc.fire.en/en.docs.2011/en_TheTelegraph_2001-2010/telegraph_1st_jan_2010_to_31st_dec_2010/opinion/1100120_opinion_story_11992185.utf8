	Lost aura                  
	Sir  Tapati Guha-Thakurtas article, Visions at a bicentenary (Jan 13), raises quite a few relevant questions concerning the future of heritage conservation in Calcutta. There is nothing wrong in experimenting with the architecture of important buildings, as has been illustrated by Norman Foster and I.M. Pei in their renovation plans for the British Museum and the Louvre, respectively, especially if such proposals were to be prepared by architects with impressive credentials in heritage restoration, as Guha-Thakurta puts it. The empanelment of such architects by the city corporation is as much a licence for breaking the shackles of archaic thought as for increasing our sensitivity towards heritage buildings during these early stages of conservation activism in Calcutta. But if this licence were to be used for bending the existing rules without proper procedure, it is likely to generate a controversy.           
	Guha-Thakurtas argument that the rules pertaining to the architectural additions to Grade A buildings like the Indian Museum are a result of bureaucratic mindset and straitjacketed thinking may well be true. But then the proposal must be discussed threadbare within forums such as the heritage conservation committee and the West Bengal Heritage Commission. Moreover, if a rule were to be amended or a new criterion introduced, the process of change must be transparent and made known to each stakeholder.          
	Guha-Thakurta states that a proposal to construct a glass dome on the museum courtyard has already been struck down. The dome would have increased the buildings air-conditioning, thereby adding to its maintenance costs. Conversely, Lord Fosters glass dome in the British Museum reduced heating bills by trapping solar energy.           
	There is also a possibility of other flaws creeping in, and therein lies the case of protectionist anxieties. For instance, Guha-Thakurta refers to the proposal of creating a basement storage section beneath the building in the critical interests of augmentation of space. But can this be the only possible solution? Can financial prudence and long-term sustainability prevail over the desire for grand outcomes? Given the present economic situation, and the fact that public money is at stake, such concerns are valid and need to be addressed at the earliest.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Any proposal to preserve heritage buildings in Calcutta must bear in mind the bigger picture. For a building as illustrious as the Indian Museum, any hasty attempt to spruce it up, either by way of constructing an additional floor with a mansard roof or covering the open courtyard with a latticed glass canopy, might not seem consistent with the original style of this imposing edifice.          
	The faade of this building bears traces of Italian architecture, and a piazza runs along its inner wall. This awe-inspiring building on Chowringhee comprises two wings with a central portico set on Corinthian columns. The series of arches and the broad flight of marble steps add a touch of elegance to the structure. Therefore, constructing a mansard roof, mostly a feature of Baroque architecture (the style in which Writers Building is constructed), could look tasteless.          
	If the Indian Museums Bicentenary Committee goes on an overdrive in trying to add new features to this building, then the work of Walter B. Granville, the museums chief architect, will sadly lose its imperial flavour. A museum is, etymologically, a temple devoted to the muses. Therefore, it will not be correct to rework this sacred place according to modern tastes as such a step is likely to compromise its heritage value.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Act tough          
	Sir  The editorial, Driven home (Jan 5), correctly observes that the violence that is taking place in West Bengal today is rooted in the politics of revenge. It is not just the Left Fronts cadre that are responsible for inflicting misery upon the common people. Supporters of the Trinamul Congress too seem to be treading on the war path. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees retaliation to the unusual comments made by the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, about the deteriorating law-and-order situation in West Bengal, was justified. Bhattacharjee has every reason to feel let down by the Central government: it was because of Chidambarams flip-flop on the Telangana issue that the demand for creation of new states has gathered momentum. There is no doubt now that the demand for Gorkhaland is bound to become more and more strident in the coming days. Unfortunately, Bhattacharjees government will have to bear the brunt of this spiralling violence.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Driven home makes the pertinent point that law-and-order is a state subject and that P. Chidambaram has overstepped his jurisdiction by criticizing the violence in Bengal. However, Chidambarams main concern was the issue of Indias internal security. Since the Maoists indulge in murder and vandalism regularly, the home minister cannot remain a mute spectator. Bhattacharjee, on his part, must realize that if he does not act tough, a national disaster is inevitable.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

	Theatre of Conflict, City of Hope: Mumbai 1660 to Present times 
  By Mariam Dossal, Oxford, Rs 2,450  
	Bombay is a pre-eminent example of an industrial city. It is different from the ancient and medieval cities of Banaras and Agra that grew with the industrialization of India. Bombay is not only an industrial city, it is also a colonial city whose historical origins go back to the Portuguese and British occupation of the country. Mariam Dossals account of this megalopolis, where contested space is the prime focus, is informative and engrossing. Theatre of Conflict, City of Hope: Mumbai 1660 to Present Times tracks the changing patterns of land use. Amply illustrated, the book is divided into two distinct sections spanning approximately 400 years.  
	The first part covers the period from 1660 to 1860, when Bombay was a group of seven islets. Primarily a cluster of fishing villages, coconut groves and rice fields, it was fraught with tensions between its Portuguese and British colonizers, and internal rebellions. Dossal states that British presence in Bombay during the late 17th and early 18th centuries was precarious. The fractious relationship between the British and the Portuguese over the ceding of lands to the former required the intervention of the king of Portugal. It was only then that Viceroy de Mello de Castro, handed over the seven islets  collectively called the Bombay group of islands  promised to the British as Catharine of Braganzas dowry to Charles II.        
	Once the British had established control over Bombay, they devoted considerable attention to city planning and design. Each city in India under British control had a distinct architectural style. The architecture in the Fort area is reminiscent of a time in the history of the architecture of Bombay when it might have been counted as a Victorian city. Classic examples of neo-gothic architecture are Victoria Terminus (renamed Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus), Rajabai Tower and Elphinstone College.        
	The book then shifts to Bombays urban and political problems, which came into sharp focus when the collector of land revenue, John Richmond Smyth, insisted that the government end all land encroachments. He felt that incomplete and incorrect land use was such a serious matter, that if neglected it would threaten the very existence of the East India Company. The Dickinson-Tate Survey, conducted between 1810 and 1830, aimed to be accurate. It maximized land revenue and provided the authorities information on land use and land titles.         
	The second part concentrates on identifying anomalies in land use, the emergence of industry, and the bubonic plague. The years 1896 to 1906 were ravaged by the plague, disrupting civic life and adding to the existing political instability in Bombay. As news of compulsory segregation and hospitalization spread, panic gripped the inhabitants. Bombays population registered a decline of nearly 50 per cent in 1897-98, as some tried to flee the city while others tried to hide friends and family members from the plague inspection committees.        
	The more recent history of Bombay is marked by problems arising from the acute shortage of housing. The approach of Independence, coupled with Partition and the influx of refugees, aggravated the housing problem. The politician-builder lobby is also discussed at length, particularly in the context of the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act. Passed in 1976, it was meant to prevent the concentration of urban land in the hands of a few and to reduce the growing power of the builder-politician combine. However, many builders found ways to circumvent the act, making the need for affordable housing more acute.         
	The serious shortage of housing resulted in the proliferation of urban slums. While talking about the metamorphosis of Bombay into Mumbai, one cannot overlook the fact that it has the worlds largest concentration of urban slum dwellers. The book is carefully researched and well-written, and highly recommended to readers interested in the growth of cities. However, the quality of the production is disappointing and does not measure up to the standard of writing. This is especially disconcerting because the volume is by no means inexpensive.

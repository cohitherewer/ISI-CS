	Nat-rangas emergence as a group in the last few years owes much to the dramatic concepts and energy of its young playwright and director, Sohan Bandopadhyay. After its success with Gulbaj, Nat-ranga has already premiered two new works this year, contrasting in scale and scope. At the same time, it continues Bandopadhyays penchant for delineating decidedly different, if not weird, protagonists who stand apart from the rest of society.        
	Shuyonpoka merits praise for flinging aside Bengali theatres taboo curtain on the sexual awakening of female adolescents. The title recalls Megapod, Bandopadhyays earlier, but weaker, script that also applied a zoological analogy to our new-age generation. As in Megapod, Shuyonpoka shows the dangers that lonely, unmentored youth face  in this case, from easy access to graphic material and information, coupled with anxiety over a perceived lack of physical beauty. The teenager here  a very disturbing performance by the debutante, Ananya Bose (picture)  confuses sex for love, which she desperately craves from the few men she knows, with tragic results. Her working mother, alternately hurtful and indulgent, hardly helps; her terrified grandfather seeks an extreme way out. Mousumi Sengupta and Satyapriya Sarkar present these roles credibly. As the girls tutor, Sounak Sanyals abrupt transformation makes him less believable, while Sanat Chandras part of a lawyer is quite dispensable to the plot. Most problematically, Debshankar Halder (a former criminal who takes the girl under his wing) conflicts with them stylistically. Despite his virtuosic flair and realistic Hindi accent, he exaggerates intolerably. Bandopadhyays loud climactic music melodramatizes Shuyonpoka further  unnecessary because the story itself is so surcharged.        
	In a comic, Pirandellian, even absurdist vein, Bandopadhyay dramatizes and expands an extremely short story by the young blogger, Charlie Fish, titled The Man Who Married Himself, into Nat-rangas Ami Weds Ami. A man reasons that since he loves himself the most among all the people he knows, logically he should marry himself. Although his mother disapproves, a priest finds nothing in Christianity to prevent him from this course of action. Trouble arises later when he feels the desire to bear children, the only solution for which, according to him, is to solicit an extramarital liaison with a willing woman. Here the play becomes far-fetched, for science has discovered other ways to perpetuate ones genes.        
	Ami Weds Ami is memorable for Bandopadhyays own androgynous acting as the Austin Powers-lookalike anti-hero, affecting a normal male voice for the feminine half of his personality, and an effeminate demeanour for the masculine aspect. The other characters only provide support; Bandopadhyay should consider reducing their parts to intensify the impact of his own unexpectedly bravura performance, because his adaptation really belongs to the one-man genre.

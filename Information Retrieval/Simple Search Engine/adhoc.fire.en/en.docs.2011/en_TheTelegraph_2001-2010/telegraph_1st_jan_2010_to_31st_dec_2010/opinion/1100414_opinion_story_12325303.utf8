	Sometimes its the speaker, or the circumstances, not the words, that make a saying memorable. Take Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who died 65 years ago this week. The only American ever elected president four times, he was a giant of the 20th century, like his friend Churchill, but far less of a phrase-maker. Yet his words too are remembered.        
	Before his first election, in 1932, he talked of a new deal for slump-ridden America; no new phrase, but it became rightly famous. The only thing we have to fear is fear itself, from his inaugural speech in 1933, is a fine phrase  but more so as it is usually misquoted, We have nothing to fear but fear itself. An earlier President (Theodore) Roosevelt is remembered even now for the words that summed up his foreign policy, Speak softly and carry a big stick  though, in fact, he first used them for a quite different topic. FDRs notion was homelier, yet became as well known: he talked of being a good neighbour.        
	Curiously, his simple phrases tended to hide half-truths more than did Churchills sharp or sonorous ones. Whether Churchill was gibing in 1931 at Gandhi as a faqir... striding half-naked, or in 1940 defying Hitler with We will fight on the beaches... we will never surrender, he felt exactly what he said. Not always so FDR.        
	Witness his anti-imperialism. In 1940 he declared that America must be the great arsenal of democracy, meaning Britain; not quite how Indians saw the British. Later, FDR expressed vigorous dislike of the British empire. Yet his plan for Indo-China after empire was not far from British views of India under it: trusteeship have a Frenchman, one or two Indo-Chinese, a Chinese and a Russian, maybe a Filipino and an American  to educate them for self-government... His ideas for world development looked even further back: send hosts of European refugees or others to backward regions, with a sense of mission, like the early colonizers of the Americas. Ask Native Americans about that.        
	Nor did his dislike of empires include Americas. In 1935 he agreed to free the Philippines from American rule  but not from American apron-strings and not till 10 years later, 20 times as long as it took the British, once theyd made their minds up, to quit India.        
	There were worse gaps than these between FDRs rhetoric and his practice. There never has been any race of people fit to serve as masters over their fellow men, he once said. Except in America, maybe. In the mid-1930s he opposed a federal bill to punish state officials soft on lynchings. Only the threat of a march on Washington by blacks in 1941 pushed him into an order opening jobs in defence factories to them. And Americas armed forces remained segregated, indeed tried to enforce this even in off-duty places abroad such as British pubs. It took a fierce German counter-attack in late 1944 to alter that nonsense, slightly, on the ground. In law, it lasted until Truman ended it in 1948.        
	The four freedoms that FDR proclaimed in 1941 did not, even then, include refuge in America for Jews fleeing from Hitler; let alone earlier, as one shameful episode in 1939 had shown. Americans still cite his phrase for Pearl Harbor: a date which will live in infamy. Yet it was he who prepared the way for two far uglier dates in August 1945, those of the first atomic bombs.        
	And yet. The New Deal did happen. However one-eyedly, Britain was defending democracy. For FDR, these were the big issues, and they shed light on others. His excuse for dawdling on black rights was (and it was true) that he needed southern-state Democrats to get the New Deal into law; as he saw it, to save America from collapsing. And whatever his dislike of British colonialism, he knew Nazism and its allies were worse. A far subtler politician than Churchill, he was less straightforward. But his hypocrisies helped toward worthy ends. Politicians word-play can do worse.

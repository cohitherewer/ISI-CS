                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Without a thought                  
	Sir The media, especially in Calcutta, religiously try to propagate the theory that bandhs achieve almost total success in West Bengal because of laziness and poor work culture among Bengalis. Given the total success of the recent Bharat bandh in as many as 15 states, and its partial success in five, will the media still have the moral courage to declare that Marathis, Gujaratis, Kannadigas, Malayalis and the Hindi-speaking people are equally adept at shirking work? (BJP spies people-connect in bandh, July 6) When will the media in this city wake up to the fact that unlike Calcutta, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Bangalore remained unaffected by Left-sponsored bandhs in the past not because of the workaholic nature of non-Bengalis but because of the limited influence of the communist brigade outside West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura? Now that the influential National Democratic Alliance has come out on the streets, the cat is finally out of the bag, rendering West Bengal at par with other states in their love for bandhs.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Opposition leaders and some other politicians are gloating over their solidarity and success in enforcing the bandh on July 5. But what have they really achieved? They have only caused untold misery to the common man, whom they are supposed to serve. Shops selling essential commodities, banks and even ATM machines were closed on that day to protest against the hike in fuel prices. Yet, the leaders did not stop to think of the costs of plying endlessly in their own cars. Trains were either cancelled or running late and bus services came to a total halt. Naturally, the handful of autorickshaws and taxis fleeced the commuters.          
	Why can politicians not sit at a table to try find a solution? They are, in fact, part of the problem itself. Much of the governments cost accrues from the misuse of privileges given to the representatives of the people. Another thing: why the hullabaloo over the rise in gas prices? Users of gas cylinders need not be given any subsidy. Almost all of them are above the poverty line. Let us be pragmatic instead of opposing every government policy.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh 

                
	Sir  What, precisely, is the use of bandhs? Of course, they are peaceful modes of protest. But then, they do turn violent from time to time. Today, bandhs are no more than publicity gimmicks that the Opposition takes recourse to at the drop of a hat. If hundreds of crores of rupees are wasted every time a bandh is enforced, how will the national economy ever get any better?          
	There are two aspects to the governments finances  receipts and expenditure. However, the government concentrates only on receipts, never on expenditure. To cover up its excesses and follies and wastage of public money, it falls back on taxation. Thus, it is the aam admi who ends up paying through his nose to make up for the national loss.           
	Our leaders claim that petrol prices are lower in Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. They never point out that the price is higher in the United States of America. The economic situation is getting more complicated everyday what with the Maoist challenge and terrorism requiring a lot of funds in order to be countered. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, may have been a competent finance minister but he is turning out to be not so successful in his present avatar.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
S.P. Sharma, Mumbai 

                
	Sir  There are two main reasons for the rise in fuel prices, one domestic and the other international. Domestically, the economic progress India has made over the years has been lopsided. The country has had to feed a lot of mouths with idle hands as it has not been able to create enough employment. The productive hands have borne the cost of this luxury.          
	Internationally, Indias emphasis has been more on exports than on maintaining the value of the rupee. A higher value of the rupee would have resulted in cheaper imports, say, of crude oil, in terms of the rupee. It would have deterred clandestine Swiss bank accounts, too, which have thrived on the depreciating rupee. The repatriation of the rupee after a while brings in handsome returns to the account holder, offsetting the low Swiss bank interest. I call it exchange rate jugglery. The rupee that fetched 28 cents in 1950, now fetches a little over 2 cents.           
	Recently, the United States of America asked China to let the yuan rise. Why has it never asked India to do the same with the rupee? Perhaps the reasons are obvious.          
	Yours faithfully,       
V.P. Divecha, Nagpur 

                
	Sir  The media seem to represent the interests of big business houses. They have no real empathy with the man on the street who suffer the most during bandhs. Yet, it is the people who vote governments to power. The rich alone cannot do it. Manmohan Singh may have his heart in the right place, but his inefficient and opportunist ministers have no real interest in the well-being of the poor.          
	Yours faithfully,

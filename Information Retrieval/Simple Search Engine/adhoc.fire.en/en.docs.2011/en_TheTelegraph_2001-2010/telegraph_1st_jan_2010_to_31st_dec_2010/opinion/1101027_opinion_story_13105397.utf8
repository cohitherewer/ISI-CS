                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FOR THEIR HOME AND EARTH                                  The new Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill may turn out to be significantly more farmer-friendly than the existing law, says V. Kumara Swamy                           FARM IRE: Trinamool Congress supporters set ablaze a plywood model of Tata Motors Nano in Singur in 2008                                  
	From Jhajjhar in Haryana to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, from Barmer in Rajasthan to Singur in West Bengal  protests by farmers against land acquisition have led to stalled projects worth thousands of crores of rupees. With the government planning to introduce an amended law on land acquisition in the winter session of Parliament, everyone hopes that it will be acceptable to both the farmers as well as industry this time round.        
	The Land Acquisition Act came into being in 1894. But repeated attempts to overhaul the law in recent years have failed for one reason or another. In fact, the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill and the Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R amp;R) Bill were passed by the Lok Sabha in February 2009. But before the Rajya Sabha could take it up, Parliament was dissolved before the general elections in 2009 and the bills lapsed.        
	Subsequently, the UPA government tried to re-introduce the bills, but backed off after facing stiff resistance from its ally and railway minister Mamata Banerjee. Now the bills are likely to be tabled again with some further changes.         
	One of the likely changes in the LAA Bill is diminishing the role of the government to a minimum when private companies buy land from farmers.         
	The land acquisition law enables the government to acquire private property for public purpose. The bill that was passed by the Lok Sabha in 2009 stated that buying land for a public purpose was the provision of land...useful to the general public, for which land has been purchased by a person under lawful contract or is having the land to the extent of 70 per cent.         
	The person here refers to any company or association or body of individuals, whether incorporated or not.         
	The bill states that if a private company managed to buy 70 per cent of the land it required and had problems getting hold of the rest, the government could step in and invoke the provisions of the law and acquire the remaining 30 per cent for it.         
	This provision of the bill became a sticking point as Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) felt that the government should not play the role of a facilitator and help companies acquire the 30 per cent of land required.         
	Although Banerjee is opposed to any intervention by the government, she is reportedly in favour of a 90:10 formula, insisting that the government should only step in if the private company has been able to acquire 90 per cent of the required land. Others, such as Dharmendra Malik, spokesperson, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), are in favour of a 80:20 formula.         
	Those in the know say that in the new LAA Bill that the government is set to introduce, the 70:30 formula will, in fact, be abandoned for a more farmer-friendly 90:10 or 80:20 formula.         
	Of course, there are those who feel that the government should not have any role whatsoever in helping industry acquire land. The government should stop playing the role of a middleman. If private companies want to buy land, let them buy it at market rates, says Om Prakash Dhankar, president, National Kisan Morcha, a BJP outfit.         
	But not everybody agrees with this view. BKU, which was involved in violent protests in Uttar Pradesh recently over forcible land acquisition by the state, says that the government should have a role, albeit a minimal one. We understand that some farmers might have a problem selling their land for development projects and that the government may have to play a role then. But it shouldnt side with private companies, says Malik.         
	Hannan Mollah, CPM leader and former member of Parliament who was the head of the standing committee on rural development when the bills were referred to it in 2007, too feels that if the government were completely out of the picture, farmers could be at the mercy of land mafia and local goons who could force them to sell their land at throwaway prices.         
	The other important change in the LAA Bill, experts say, could be the incorporation of the Haryana model to compensate displaced farmers.         
	In Haryana  and lately, in Uttar Pradesh too  farmers are not only paid a lump sum amount at the time of land acquisition, they also receive a certain amount every year for the next 33 years. This annuity in Haryana has been fixed at Rs 15,000 an acre a year, with an increase of Rs 500 every year per acre, for 33 years. In Uttar Pradesh the annuity has been fixed at Rs 20,000 per acre for 33 years.         
	However, though praised by both Congress president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Rahul Gandhi, the Haryana model is not without its critics. Farmers who sold their lands are ruing their fate after seeing the same lands fetching 300-500 per cent more within a few years. They feel completely cheated now, says Dhankar.         
	According to Krishnamurthy Subramanian, a professor at the International School of Business, Hyderabad, instead of a pre-fixed rate of annuity, the scheme could be linked to current land prices in the area every year. So farmers would benefit whenever there is an increase in land prices.         
	The bill could also propose profit sharing between farmers and private companies if the acquired land is sold to a third party at a later date. The government may even accede to demands that the R amp;R Bill makes rehabilitation and assurance of jobs to those displaced mandatory before the actual acquisition of land.         
	Then again, Section 17 of the existing Land Acquisition Act gives the government special powers in case of urgency  a provision that many feel is widely abused. Says Paritosh Chakma, co-ordinator, Asian Indigenous amp; Tribal Peoples Network, Delhi, In West Bengal and many northeast states, thousands of acres of land have been gobbled up by the government under this urgency clause in the name of border fencing. The government should clearly define and limit its emergency powers in the new law.         
	It remains to be seen whether the LAA Bill addresses all the concerns of the stakeholders and pressure groups. Whats clear is that the law will be a success only if the interests of the farmers have been adequately looked after. As Vijayan M.J., co-ordinator, Delhi Solidarity Group, a network of peoples movements, asserts, What we need are land acquisition and rehabilitation and resettlement laws that look at the needs of the people rather than the convenience of the big corporations.

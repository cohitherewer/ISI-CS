	The putting back of the clock for the pull-out of foreign troops from Afghanistan had perhaps started the moment it had been set for 2011 by Barack Obama. By the time the Kabul conference took place in July, Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, had put it back by three more years. The members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization engaged in the conflict have been more realistic. At the recently-concluded summit at Lisbon, they have not only acquiesced to the aspirational target of 2014 as the final date of military engagement, but have also committed themselves, by inking an agreement with Mr Karzai, to stay put till the time Afghanistan becomes self-sufficient in dealing with insurgency. However, Natos real pragmatism lies not in infinitely extending the deadline, but in casting the loop of engagement wider into Asia. At Lisbon, the Nato leadership attempted to draw Russia directly into its battle plans by prodding the latter to expand its supply routes to Afghanistan and unleash its specialized helicopters to assist the combat operations. But the real marker of a revolution-in-the-making is Natos invitation to Russia to join its missile defence system that has recently hooked up with that of the United States of America. If Russia takes up the offer, and the US obliges by ratifying the strategic arms reduction treaty that Russia so wants, Nato and its open heart policy in Afghanistan could become the fountainhead of major global realignments of power.         
	It goes without saying that behind much of this Nato perspiration lies US inspiration. There is no doubt that Nato has been thinking out of the box for a while, and has even rewritten the scope of the alliances purpose and fundamental security tasks by being willing to engage beyond its traditional theatre of activity. But there can be no denying that the USs security needs in the region have proved to be powerful instigators of much of the Nato rethink. By engaging Russia, the Nato forces in Afghanistan, headed by the US, would manage to undercut Mr Karzais unilateral move towards both Russia and Iran, and thereby hope to keep him under control. By allaying Russias distrust, they could also hope to keep a leash on Iran and Pakistan, and maybe even China. Lisbon may therefore be said to have made a beginning  as much for Afghanistan as for the world.

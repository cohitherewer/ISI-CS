	Instead of moving from the start to the finish, the Centres handling of the Telangana controversy shows that it is moving in the reverse direction. The constitution of a committee  such as the one formed under the stewardship of B.N. Srikrishna  to investigate the contesting claims of Telangana to separate statehood and the rest of Andhra Pradesh to remain united should have been the starting point in the resolution of the problem. But the Central government has initiated the political process by first conceding to the formation of a separate Telangana, and then allowing a much-needed evaluation of the possibility (and necessity) of bifurcation to take place. This loophole, no matter how much the Union home minister may want to play it down, has made the Centre a sitting duck for all kinds of political attacks. The latest has already been flagged off by the Telangana Joint Action Committee, which has called for the resignation of all legislators and public representatives from the region after announcing that the terms of reference for the Srikrishna committee are a betrayal of promises that had been made. So far, the response to the JAC diktat, barring that of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti legislators, has been lukewarm and produced around 15 resignations. But with the temperature on the streets and in educational institutions steadily rising, peoples representatives from the region may have to think twice.         
	The only way they can stave off this eventuality  there is no denying that the hostile public mood has often forced the hand of political parties, even that of the TRS  is by giving the committee the importance that is its due. The committee has been asked to recommend Andhra Pradeshs political course not only after taking into account the opposing views on Telangana, but also after assessing the impact of political developments on different regions of the state and on different sections of its population  women, children, students and the minorities. The brief, undoubtedly, is expansive, but without such a comprehensive evaluation, a decision on Andhra Pradesh will fail to satisfy the needs of those whose lives it will affect the most. The commission needs time, and more importantly, peace and quiet, to complete its task. Let its recommendation be less hurried and less forced than that of the Centre.

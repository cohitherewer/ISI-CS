	Troubled waters                  
	Sir  The Indian government seems determined to go ahead with the mammoth river-linking project without consulting Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, countries that will also be affected by this plan. The project envisages an inter-basin transfer of water among the rivers flowing from Tibet, Nepal and Bhutan into Bangladesh and India. As a result, the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna river system would suffer a lot, as diverting water from its natural course is bound to have a serious environmental impact on the rivers as well as the entire region.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Tall theories          
	Sir  In A glut of horror fairy tales (April 11), Ruchir Joshi writes that there are huge corporations who are after the tribals land and the mineral wealth that lurks under that land. However, the mineral resource under the land is the de facto property of the State. The government is free to use or lease out the land for the extraction of minerals as it pleases. It is also a fact that no adivasi has the capital to mine these minerals for the benefit of their own community. It is only the big players (the coal boards, for example) that have the resources to exploit this rich mineral wealth.          
	Not only are minerals essential raw materials for industries all over India, but they also have tremendous export value. However, a mineral that remains beneath the ground has no value of its own. Only when it is dug out of the earth can it be put to any use. If the resourceful corporations or the governments mine for these minerals, the tribals do not lose anything. On the contrary, they may get employment and the condition of their local economy may improve.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Huge corporations are after tribal land and its mineral wealth, which, Ruchir Joshi feels, is the root cause of the Maoist insurrection in the adivasi belts. However, in the junglemahal of West Bengal, no huge corporation is seen looting tribal wealth. Yet the Maoists are an active presence in this region. This makes the theory of the so-called intellectuals, who consider business houses the fount of all ills in the tribal belts, seem nave.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Outraged          
	Sir  It was shocking to see Peerless Hospital being destroyed by a mob. The locals, apparently angered by the deaths of two persons who were allegedly denied treatment, took to rampaging the premises (Oath of service, April 15). It is incredible that the police could not stop the assault. In India, incidents of angry relatives of patients attacking doctors and destroying hospital property are not unheard of. People do not refrain from violent protests, causing inconvenience to other patients. The authority of the police receives a blow each time, although that has not improved the latters ability to tackle such situations.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Shreya Choudhury, Calcutta

                
	Sir  The attack on Peerless Hospital was not a one-off incident. Calcutta is on the brink of more such disasters. The city has swanky malls, lush apartments and luxury hospitals surrounded by slums in which people live an undignified life. The latter are angered by the neglect and wait for an excuse to vent their rage. With the law-and-order situation being abysmal, the mob gets away with causing damage to public property.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Significant developments are visible in Bangladesh that could leave their imprint on the nature of the polity and on its future. Landmark judgments from the courts and decisions of the government have laid the foundation of a structure that goes even beyond what a commentator has described in The Wall Street Journal as Bangladeshs Secular Revolution. Two recent judgments by the supreme court and the high court, respectively, have addressed fundamental issues that have remained unattended for decades.        
	Almost from the time of its birth in 1971, there evolved in Bangladesh a culture of impunity that ignored genocide and averted the gaze as killers of national leaders were rewarded with diplomatic assignments. Military usurpers took decisions that sought to change the fundamentals of the State. A time for reckoning may now have arrived.        
	Sheikh Mujibur Rahman must share the responsibility of a less- than-focused stand on the perpetrators of the genocide in 1971, even as one acknowledges his international constraints. But what was obvious to impartial observers for decades has now been stated unambiguously by the high court of Bangladesh. On August 26, it stated that Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, had ravaged the constitution, released the anti-Liberation War forces that committed crimes like murder, rape, and arson during the Liberation War in 1971, and introduced religion-based communal politics by replacing secularism in the constitution. In the view of the court, the subsequent military takeover by General H.M. Ershad and the infringements on the constitution would not have taken place without the way shown by Zia. The issue under dispute, the Seventh Amendment which legitimized Ershads rule, was struck down.              
	A month earlier, the supreme court had upheld an earlier high-court verdict and delegitimized the Fifth Amendment of 1979, which had, inter alia, sanctioned the rule of Zia and the martial law proclamations of his regime. These, in turn, had desecularized Bangladesh and redefined the persona of its citizens. As the latest high court order states, Zia wiped out the fundamental state principles  secularism and Bengali nationalism  that were the main guiding spirits of the Liberation War.        
	It will take some time before the implications of the judgments are analysed. And there will surely be appeals. Disentangling the sensitive skeins, woven over decades of manipulation and augmented by court judgments, will not be an easy task. The government has asked for a 15-member parliamentary committee to look into the future actions, which the Bangladesh parliament would need to take in view of the court judgments to guide the ship of state to the course that had been charted originally. The main opposition party has, so far, declined to participate.        
	Separate from the judgments of the courts  which have delegitimized military takeovers and made the perpetrators subject to prosecution  another effort is under way to bury past inconsistencies. Sporadic action during Mujibs governance and Zias deliberate political calculations had resulted in the criminals of 1971 never being held to account. They went on to occupy the highest positions in the land. Mounting demands from the next generation and the singular persistence of the surviving sector commanders of the Liberation War have reopened that chapter. The time may have come for the bell to toll for those who had been guilty of crimes against humanity in 1971 and had yet been permitted to extract personal and political benefits from the nation whose emergence they had violently opposed.        
	The recent judgments have established the primacy of law and demanded accountability from those who have transgressed the constitution. This shall remain as a lasting legacy, with a warning for future adventurers. The war crimes trial would, in turn, serve to assuage the trauma of those who had suffered grievously at the hands of the Pakistan army and its collaborators. Investigations are under way separately to bring to book culprits of the co-ordinated grenade attack five years ago that intended to decimate the Awami League leadership.        
	The nature and pace of recent events in Bangladesh have been remarkable. Nor could these have been expected, given the decades-old history of impunity, be it for violence against the people, as in 1971, against the political leadership, starting with the assassination of Mujibur Rahman in 1975, or against the constitution by successive military regimes. If the judiciary has been in the forefront in recent weeks, one must assume that there has been a mandate from the people manifest in the massive endorsement to the Awami League for a proactive policy to sweep away some of the festering wounds of the past.        
	Events in Bangladesh will be shaped by the internal dynamics of that country. But it will be important for Indias political leadership to be sensitive to the developments there and to the challenges faced by both the people and the state as they try to fashion a new present and a future relieved of some of the odious burdens of the past. In its relations with India, the present government of Bangladesh appears to have shown serious intent in meeting Indias primary and long-standing security concerns. There are some issues, such as those relating to the sharing of waters, which have no instant solution and require understanding among all co-riparians. But there are many that can be resolved with a modicum of political will and some bureaucratic energy. The present would be a good time for India to provide tangible evidence of its goodwill in moving ahead expeditiously with all the agreements reached during the visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.              
	India needs to be sensitive to irritants that impinge negatively on the public mind, such as incidents of firing on the border. Local political considerations, even if they are seen as important from the viewpoint of coalition politics in Delhi, must not be allowed to postpone the bringing of the boundary question to a final closure. A liberal trade regime should be announced at the earliest. India needs to ensure that the issue of Teen Bigha disappears from the radar screen of Bangladeshi perceptions about Indian non-delivery on commitments.         
	There has been an inclination in the media and among commentators in India to focus on the perceived growth of jihadi fundamentalism in Bangladesh. There were reasons for this in terms of Indias experience and the complicity of past governments in Dhaka in such activities. While Indias concerns shall remain, it is important that attention is focused on the difficult challenges that the people and the government of Bangladesh face today in their efforts to seek a new future.

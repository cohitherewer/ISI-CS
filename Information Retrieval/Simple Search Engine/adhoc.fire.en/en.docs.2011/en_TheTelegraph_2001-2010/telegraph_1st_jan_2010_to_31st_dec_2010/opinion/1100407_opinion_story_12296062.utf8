	Learn the basics                  
	Sir  Sukanta Chaudhuri has pointed out some of the anomalies in Indias education system and proposed changes to set them right (The economy of knowledge, April 1). The government, in the 63rd year of Independence, has come up with the resolve to provide every citizen with lower as well as higher education. But something also needs to be done for the 10 million people who have not been to school at all. The rate of literacy among adults must be increased. We should also concentrate more on womens education than on the womens reservation bill.          
	Private institutes undoubtedly operate with the profit motive in mind. But we should acknowledge the fact that several private institutions have set excellent examples in creating a well-informed faculty and good research facilities, in addition to ensuring job placements for its students. Government-run universities, in comparison, have failed on these counts. But having said that, can we endorse a proposal that calls for an indiscriminate increase in the number of private institutes?           
	The process of setting up of foreign universities in India must be regulated so that they deliver their services at a reasonable fee, provide a good research environment and keep up collaboration with the mother university abroad. Private banks and insurance companies have successfully worked towards promoting the national interest. Why should private educational institutes and foreign universities not be able to do the same?                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Saroj Upadhyay, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  The government has played a historic April Fools joke on the people by launching the Right to Education Act on April 1. What is most reprehensible about the whole exercise is the unseemly haste, the lack of reasoning, and the approach, which palpably reeks of political motivations instead of showing true concern for childrens education. The government is sure neither of its stance nor of its modus operandi.          
	The lethal repercussions of this law can hardly be exaggerated. One fails to understand the necessity of meddling with the workings of the institutions that already exist without taking their representatives  owners, principals and teachers  into confidence. There are a number of grey areas in this law that need to be clarified before it can be expected to yield the results envisioned by the legislators.          
	Kapil Sibal needs to be reminded that he cannot tackle the problems that plague Indian education by using coercive measures. Unless a consensus is worked out whereby everyone is given an equal opportunity to present their side of the story, this law is bound to create doubts and suspicions, and ultimately fail in its mission. Private institutes that do not depend on the government for funding could well refer this education law to the Supreme Court, as it can be seen as an infringement on their right to function autonomously.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  April 1 will remain one of the most memorable days in Indian history. Though it took 63 years for India to introduce the right to education law, it has come into force with immediate effect. Manmohan Singh and Kapil Sibal deserve congratulations for conceiving the idea and turning it into reality. Though the United Progressive Alliance government failed to check inflation, one cannot overlook the fact that it has given us not only the RTE Act, but also the Right to Information Act, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, and will hopefully also pass the womens reservation bill in the Lok Sabha.           
	The education act will ensure that India achieves universal elementary education. If the Central or any state government fails to provide education till the age of 14, it can be sued. Millions of children, regardless of caste or creed, will now get the chance to study.          
	People in rural areas still pay little heed to childrens education, which often means a double loss for the family  loss of the money the child may have earned, and the money spent on education. The only way to implement the new law is to depend upon the local bodies, teachers and NGOs who can motivate parents to get their children admitted in schools. We should not forget that raising literacy levels is essential for our overall socio-economic development.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

      
	Sir  The RTE Act is the most prominent feather in Kapil Sibals cap. He has not only cleansed the accumulated rot within our education system, but has also heralded a renaissance in learning. The Indian population of nearly 1.2 billion can truly progress only by being exposed to the right kind of education.          
	A high standard of learning will have to be maintained in schools if any meaningful benefit is to be expected from this law. Perhaps a uniform syllabus will do much good. Every child should be admitted to a school in its immediate neighbourhood. It is also important to ensure that private schools reserve 25 per cent of their seats for the backward classes. This rule must be implemented with a firm hand. Institutions must upgrade their facilities and infrastructure to take up this challenge.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Raghubir Singh, Pune 

                
	Sir  It is hoped that with the implementation of the RTE Act, all children will get to enjoy their fundamental right. It is also important that political parties, who are in the habit of declaring bandhs and rasta rokos at the drop of a hat, instruct their rowdy elements to stop harassing school managements. This act would be meaningless if schools are closed down every now and then. I hope that education will soon come under the purview of the Essential Services Maintenance Act, because that would prevent political parties from disturbing normal academic life.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
N. Nagarajan, Secunderabad

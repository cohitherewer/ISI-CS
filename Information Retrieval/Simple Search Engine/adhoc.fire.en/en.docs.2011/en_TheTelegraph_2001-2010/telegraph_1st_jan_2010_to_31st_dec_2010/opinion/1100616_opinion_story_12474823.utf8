The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In a state of speedy decline
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN A STATE OF SPEEDY DECLINE                                  Fifth Column -Sumanta Sen                              
	Politics in Jharkhand continues to be a nauseating affair. A former chief minister who wanted to curry favour with the ruling dispensation at the Centre for a berth in the cabinet ditched his ally in the state in the Lok Sabha. The angry ally decided to pull the rug out from under his feet in Ranchi. The man developed cold feet, begged the ally not to withdraw support, and offered the chief ministership on a platter. The ally  the Bharatiya Janata Party  relented but could not quite decide on a successor. The former chief ministers son insisted that the BJP must share its term in office with his fathers party, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. Thereafter, things took a predictable turn. Owing to the differences, the BJP withdrew its support and the state came under presidents rule yet again.        
	Things are so hopeless in Jharkhand that on one occasion, it was even ruled by independents for quite a while. It is the only state in the country to have been run in this manner. This is not the only record that Jharkhand boasts of: it is also the only state whose representatives in the Lok Sabha bailed out a prime minister in return of handsome largesse. One of the richest states in terms of mineral wealth, its people are the poorest in the country, thanks to the quality of political leadership.        
	Its creation had led to a lot of excitement around the country. Those who believe the adivasis to be gods chosen people had hoped that having got their own state, the tribal people would set a model for the rest of the nation to follow. They had shut their eyes to the vast gulf that separates the poor adivasis from their leaders who were quick to make hay while the sun shone. It could not have been otherwise. Industrial activities in south Bihar had inevitably given rise to the contractor class. Moreover, there was plenty of easy money floating around and the political class was drawn to it. This happens everywhere, but in Jharkhand the leaders have always displayed more than the usual disregard for propriety.                 
	Failed politics        
	Perhaps Jharkhands politicians thought that the people being mostly impoverished and unlettered, they would be able to get away with their shenanigans. And they have got away with their crimes, taking advantage of the conditions of their ethnic brethren in the most shameless manner. It is this shamelessness, this monumental cynicism, that makes Jharkhands political life distinct from that in the other states, a distinction it could have done without. Even a party like the BJP, which talks of principles in the field of politics, behaves differently in Jharkhand. This has been evident in recent times.         
	All the players in Jharkhand are firm believers in democracy. Irrespective of what happens, an elected ministry must be in office. However, what is never asked is ministry for whom, and for what purpose. The crying need of the hour is to put in place a stable administration in Jharkhand. Since politicians in the state have clearly failed in this aspect, it is time the bureaucrats stepped in to tide over the crisis.         
	Presidents rule is not desirable, but a basket case requires special treatment. Even at the cost of shocking the supporters of democracy, one must examine the possibilities of creating and implementing a new law that will allow for the continuation of Central rule for a longer period in the state. This, of course, is an unlikely possibility as all political parties would want a share of the pie. When Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar, the latter looked set to be doomed. But in the last five years, the rot has been stemmed in Patna. No such good fortune seems to be in the offing for Ranchi.

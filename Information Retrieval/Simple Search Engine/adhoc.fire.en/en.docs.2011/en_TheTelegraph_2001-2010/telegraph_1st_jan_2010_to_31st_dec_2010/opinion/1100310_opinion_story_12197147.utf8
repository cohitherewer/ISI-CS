The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Bill for Change?
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BILL FOR CHANGE?                                                    
	It was a difficult feat for the Congress to get the bill for womens reservation in legislative bodies passed in the Rajya Sabha, although the bill has a long way to go before it becomes a law. The victory itself is dubious. The indiscipline in the Rajya Sabha on March 8 demonstrated that little has changed since 1996 when the bill was first introduced in Parliament. Each time it came up, the same opponents put up the same objections and disrupted Parliament with equal violence. Yet there was more than enough time for discussion and debate, not merely within Parliament but also with parties, in states and in public fora. In all the rhetoric around the bill  including the bill as gift to women on the centenary of International Womens Day  there has been a remarkable absence of effort to prepare the nation and the polity for the change. The Congresss idea of barrelling through the bill simply because the party was confident of the support from the Opposition was just a way of politicking with numbers. This is hardly worthy of a decision that means amending the Constitution.        
	Does change depend on law alone? The system itself makes space for women who rise to the top through the political process, as Mamata Banerjee and Mayavati have done. More than law, it is often convention that is the better teacher. But no party, not even the Congress with Sonia Gandhi at its head, has yet nominated election candidates of whom 30 per cent are women. Such practices lead to a natural, as opposed to coercive, form of change. The passage of the bill in the Rajya Sabha has done little to establish the governments credentials regarding gender-justice. The quota system has been legitimized in India as affirmative action, although it functions more as tokenism useful in getting votes. Tokenism glosses over fundamental issues, such as the fact that there is no shortcut to the empowerment of women. Or that an undemocratic principle, whatever its rationale, is a marker of a failure of democracy rather than a sign of its power of creative change. The government has time to rethink before the bill becomes a law  if it can shed illusions of prestige and seriously address the problems that lie behind the bills formulation.

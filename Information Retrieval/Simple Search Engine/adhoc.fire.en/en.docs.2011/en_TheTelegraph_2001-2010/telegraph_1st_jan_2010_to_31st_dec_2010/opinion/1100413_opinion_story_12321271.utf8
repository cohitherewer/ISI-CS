	In his critical evaluation of the recently announced measures to ensure the implementation of the universal Right to Education Act, Sukanta Chaudhuri (The Telegraph, April 1, 2010) has drawn our attention to a unique feature of knowledge or education, a feature that stands in the way of viewing it as a marketable commodity. As Chaudhuri puts it, We are treating knowledge as a commodity and not as infrastructure, as buying a car rather than building a road. One can build endlessly many shops to sell cars, in other words, but shops selling extended roadway networks are non-existent.        
	It is common practice for economists to trace the source of economic growth to capital accumulation. However, since the mid-1980s, research in growth economics has been driven by a major concern. What is the nature of the growth inducing capital itself? There have been a number of answers to the question and, without exception, they have all been concerned with drawing a clear distinction between private and public capital, or the car and the road, to use Chaudhuris example.        
	The need to develop public capital, or infrastructure, in tandem with private capital, is best understood with reference to an elementary example. Suppose a popular bakery, in response to an increasing demand for its products, expands the scale of its operations. It can buy larger ovens, employ more workers and so on. There are, however, certain means of production that are largely beyond the power of the bakery to increase simultaneously with its use of labour and equipment. An important example could be electricity. If there is a shortage of power supply to the area where the bakery operates, a mere rise in labour and ovens will not help the bakery grow. (Clearly, the baker can install a generator to meet his demand for power, but it is an inefficient technology for producing electricity.)              
	Similarly, if the mill that supplies flour to the bakery is located some distance away and the two are connected by roads that are too narrow for a medium-sized truck to negotiate, then the mill may not be able to supply to the bakery its increased demand for flour at one go. The delay will force the baker to turn away his customers.        
	Electricity, roadways, ports and so on are, strictly speaking, stocks of capital too. However, the distinction between the services they produce and the ones produced by the bakers oven lies in the fact that, under normal circumstances, a given power plant or a road caters to the needs of several private organizations at the same time. As opposed to this, the bakers oven serves the bakers interest alone.        
	Extrapolating from here, most micro units constituting the macro system must grow for the gross domestic product to register a positive growth rate. But, for the GDP growth rate to be sustained, the micro units will be collectively dependent on macro infrastructure. A single piece of infrastructure must be endowed with a capacity that is large enough to handle the growing needs of (possibly a growing number of) firms. As a result, a sine qua non for the emergence of a meaningful growth path is a large-sized infrastructure. Sustained growth requires expanding airports, railway connectivity, irrigation facilities, communication networks and a host of other utilities.        
	It is in this connection that modern growth theory identifies human capital or an educated labour force to be a rather potent form of infrastructure. Before analyzing the reasons underlying the potency, let us study a table of figures.        
	The telltale figures leave little doubt that education, or more generally, knowledge, has a significant impact on the economic performance of a country. (It would be incorrect to conclude that the figures for Turkey and Sri Lanka tell a different story. The fact that Sri Lanka lags behind Turkey, notwithstanding its higher literacy rate, is easily explained by the negative impact of terrorist activities.)        
	What is the common link between electricity, roadway infrastructure and so on, and knowledge? This question is best answered by referring to the works of new growth theorists like Paul Romer (1986, 1990) and the Nobel laureate, Robert E. Lucas (1988). It was Romer in particular who suggested a conceptual separation between a produced commodity and the abstract design underlying the produce. It is the design that constitutes knowledge and a single design is freely replicated to produce as many pieces of the concrete good as one pleases, be they toothbrushes, power plants or automobile engines. A single road caters to thousands of cars. A single design for an aircraft engenders the arrival of whole fleets of airplanes. However, unlike the road, the design is not subject to congestion problems. There are a maximum number of cars a road can handle, but the number of airplanes that are producible on the basis of a single design is literally endless.        
	Thus, knowledge is infrastructure because, like a single power plant, it serves many customers. Moreover its enormous potential is demonstrated by noting that there is no conceptual upper limit on the number of students that can consume a single body of knowledge. Given one piece of knowledge, unlike a slice of cake, the amount available per student is a constant independent of the number of students. Knowledge, concretized as human capital, multiplies with the number of users, whereas a roadway, even if freely usable, subdivides with a growth in cars.        
	There is a second important reason why knowledge resembles infrastructure. A national highway causes externalities by helping hotels and other commercial enterprises come up along its border. Knowledge too gives rise to an externality in the form of an improved social fabric surrounding an economy. However, its externality is not restricted to this fact alone. To own a Nano, one needs to purchase the car. Once the car is possessed, however, a researcher has free access to the abstract design underlying its engine to produce a new competing design. In other words, old knowledge is a free input for the production of new knowledge. This is a form of externality that is peculiar to knowledge alone.              
	Both television shows as well as knowledge are classic examples of what economic theory describes as public goods. A pure public good is a commodity that is non-rival as well as non-excludable. A non-rival good is one which any number of persons can enjoy simultaneously without reducing its availability as in the case of a private good like petroleum. By contrast, a non-excludable commodity is illustrated by the difference between Doordarshan and a pay-TV channel. Private broadcasts exclude those who do not pay for the service. Doordarshan on the other hand is non-excludable.        
	Quite obviously, leaving the propagation of knowledge to private hands or foreign universities amounts to stultifying its growth potential, for commercial ventures will necessarily exclude learners, thus divesting knowledge of its most important technological property, unlimited reproducibility. To realize the full potential of knowledge, it has to resemble a Doordarshan broadcast, which can be viewed without paying anything more than the price of a TV set. To use Chaudhuris analogy, market-driven knowledge may serve the needs of magpies in search of shiny bric-a-brac. It does not help India harness the greater part of its potential workforce in the interest of overall economic development. Keeping a potentially trainable worker unskilled amounts to sinking further in the vicious circle of poverty.         
	Unless the government sits up and thinks more clearly about an education strategy, the much hyped education act may turn into a stillborn babe.

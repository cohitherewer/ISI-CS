                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LEARNING FROM AMERICA                          - The most open society in the world					 					      Politics and play - Ramachandra Guha                                                            
	Few Indians are indifferent to the United States of America. Some dislike or detest that country. Others admire or worship it. Generally, these sentiments are held in toto  that is to say, either one is wholly for America, or one is wholly against it.         
	Might it be that both extremes are untenable? And that there is something to admire about America, and something also that is distasteful? If so, how do we discriminate between one and the other?        
	The US is the country I know best apart from my own. I have visited it on at least 15 different occasions, for periods ranging from a week to 18 months. I have lived in small towns on the East and West Coasts, and travelled to the Midwest and the South. I have been influenced by American scholars and scholarships, admired American sports and sportsmen, and read very many American novels. And I have had conversations with very many ordinary Americans as well.        
	There remains one deficiency in my education  since I rarely watch films, that particular window into American society remains closed to me. Still, I think I can speak on American politics and culture out of something other than ignorance. What, then, have these experiences taught me about what my country can learn from theirs.        
	To me, what is really appealing about the US is how it is organized internally, not how it projects itself to the world. Unburdened by the aristocratic heritage of Europe, the Americans have created a society where individual achievement matters far more than birth or lineage. There is greater mobility in America than almost anywhere else in the world. For instance, many of the countrys top businessmen, politicians, doctors, lawyers and university professors were born in obscurity or poverty.               
	To be sure, there remain sharp inequalities of wealth and status. However, American society is organized in such a way that, depending on their own abilities and ambitions, the children of the rich can slide downwards, while the children of the poor can make their way up. And while there is a class structure, there is a virtual absence of class sentiment. The CEO of a company addresses the workers on the shop-floor as a fellow human, not (as would be the case in some other countries) as a superior species of being. There is considerable respect for the dignity of labour. Not only does the company boss value the physical labour done by his employees, at home he is happy to work with his hands himself.        
	Here, America may be contrasted to Europe, as well to our own country. Down the centuries, Indians in general, and Hindus in particular, have constructed a culture steeped in hierarchy and deference. The social distance between worker and manager, or between chaprasi and minister, is staggeringly large in India. One manifestation of this obsession with hierarchy is the value placed on professions conducted principally by the brain, and the consequent disparagement of work done by the hand.         
	Class and status matter less in America than in other modern societies. The country is made more democratic by the fact that, in professional or career terms, the family does not play an important role. The Bushes are atypical here; far more characteristic is Bill Gates, who earmarked the larger part of his wealth for philanthropy. He set aside a modest inheritance for his children, and forbade them from working with or taking advantage of Microsoft. They had to make their own way in life, more or less, since they were Americans.        
	Once more, the contrast with Europe and (especially) India is great. In Britain, there tend to be more father-and-son duos in politics and the law than in the US. And in this country, ones life chances are massively determined by the home one is born into. In upper-caste and upper-class families, parents energetically, not to say shamelessly, promote their children, using their own success and status to cushion them from failure or disappointment. The safest way to do this, of course, is to get them to follow your own profession.         
	The damage, actual and potential, done to our democracy by the conversion of political parties into family firms is well known. Less noticed, perhaps, are the equally corrosive effects of cronyism in politics. When Rajiv Gandhi unexpectedly became prime minister of India in 1984, many people were willing to overlook the fact that he came to that job by virtue of birth. For he was uncontaminated by corruption and authoritarianism. And he was apparently sincere and unquestionably charming.         
	In character and personality, Rajiv Gandhi seemed quite unlike his mother, and even less like his brother, Sanjay. However, on gaining power he followed them both in convening a group of friends to work for him. Before entering politics or government, these friends of Rajiv had been middle-level managers in the private sector. None was a person of great achievement  that is to say, not one was a N.R. Narayana Murthy. However, the men had what in India is a more relevant distinction  they had been been to school or college with, and came from the same social class as, their boss. That group identity mattered a good deal more than individual achievement was made clear by the appellation quickly cast upon them: these were the baba-log.        
	Compare these appointments of Rajiv Gandhis with the appointments made by another young, articulate, and immensely likeable man on his assuming high office. Barack Obama has also brought into his administration people who had no previous experience of politics or public service. However, these men and women were chosen for their ability rather than out of personal friendship, having previously made their mark as top lawyers, scientists, and fund managers.               
	To be sure, not all of Obamas appointments might work out satisfactorily. The transition from academia or the corporate sector to the world of public administration might be hard to navigate. If that be the case, these misfits shall be quickly found out, by the various Congressional committees, and by the media, two institutions that are more robust and honest in America than they are in India. For in that country, high government appointees are put through a gruelling examination by members of the legislature. Even after they are confirmed in their posts, their performance is subject to continuing scrutiny by the Congress and Senate on the one hand and by press and television on the other. As a consequence, incompetence or corruption are more likely to be detected and punished than is usually the case in our country.        
	I have not spoken yet of the part of America I know best, namely, its education system. For all its reputation as the home of private enterprise, the best schools in the US are often in the State sector, and so are many of the best colleges. In any event, whether school or college, public or private, they function well principally because they tend to put the interests of the institution above those of the individual in charge, or his family and community.        
	On the world stage, the US can be aggressive and even imperialist. Within its borders, it is rather more democratic and egalitarian. Thus, while we should not make the mistake of identifying too closely with the foreign policies of the US government, we must still seek to understand what has made America the least hierarchical and most open society in the world.       ramachandraguha@yahoo.in

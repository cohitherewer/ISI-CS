	Cracking the puzzle called India                
	Indian Essentials (Penguin, Rs 450) is a collection of apparently humorous writings that tries to make sense of the mysteries of the Indian psyche. The contributors  mostly journalists, writers and teachers  have selected and analysed social institutions and cultural practices that represent an ethic, which is quintessentially Indian. Geeta Doctor rightly compares the Great Indian Family to a patchwork quilt whose intricate, but contrasting, patterns are confounding and alluring at the same time. Chalta Hai is Bachi Karkarias take on the exasperating Indian habit of remaining indifferent to some of the starkest kinds of inequalities and inefficiencies. Among the rest, Hum Log, the Sex Log, by Samrat, reflects on the collective hypocrisy surrounding sexuality, while Namita Gokhales funny piece examines matrimonial advertisements. What is disappointing to note is that most of the articles end up strengthening the stereotypes that are used to simplify the countrys complex socio-cultural fabric. Is it impossible to imagine India without cricket, Bollywood, sex and marriage?                                   
	Monkey-man (Penguin, Rs 299) by Usha K.R. begins with a strange sighting that takes place on a nondescript Bangalore street. A short, dark, hairy... light-emitting beast is seen by a college teacher, call-centre employee, woman secretary and an office boy. The four are invited to a popular radio show to share their experiences and the event changes their lives profoundly. Usha deftly identifies the links that bind the protagonists with each other and with the city. What emerges in the process is the intriguing possibility that a city often shares its destiny with its people.                        
	Love over coffee (Penguin, Rs 150) by Amrit N. Shetty is another of those books that make one wonder why they are written in the first place. The plot revolves around Anup, a blithe, chirpy IT professional, who has a difficult job, and an even more difficult love life. Anup, despite his caring colleagues, discovers that he is a misfit at work. The parents of the woman he loves are equally unenthusiastic about accepting Anup as their son-in-law. Anups furtive romance is further jeopardized by complicated developments in his office, forcing him to take a tough decision. He quits his job to pursue a career in writing. One only hopes that he will end up doing a better job than his creator.

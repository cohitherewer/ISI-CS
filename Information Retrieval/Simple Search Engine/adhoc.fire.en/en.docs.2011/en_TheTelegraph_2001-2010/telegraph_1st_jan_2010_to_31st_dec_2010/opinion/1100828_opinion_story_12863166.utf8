The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | How to be a little less unjust
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOW TO BE A LITTLE LESS UNJUST                                  The current debate on food security pays little attention to questions of justice, fairness and dignity, writes Ananya Mukherjee-Reed                          Double failure                                  
	There is surely something grossly amiss in this acclaimed theatre of democracy when a handful of people get to decide how much or how little the hungry should eat at what price. This begs a rather fundamental question of justice. Yet, while we hear endlessly about efficiency and affordability in connection to food security, we hear little about the underlying criteria of justice. The (implicit) assumption is that the institutionalization of food security itself is an act of rendering justice. But is it so? According to whose notion of justice? As Amartya Sen has warned, there can be no consensus on a single ideal of justice. We should eschew that pursuit and ask instead how we can make the world a little less unjust. But who determines what is less unjust? Sen argues that the key here is reasoned public discussion. Current discussions on food and hunger, however, appear hardly public or reasoned. What they reflect are the vastly unequal power relations among the various stakeholders.        
	Consider, for example, the failed food summit in Rome in 2009. It failed in that the Food and Agriculture Organization failed to raise the $44 billion it needed (no more than $41 per person for the 1.07 billion hungry). Startling as that is, there is much more at stake in this failure. In the lead up to the summit, the FAO undertook consultations with major stakeholders in order to arrive at a consensus strategy for combating hunger. A civil society forum was organized to ensure that the aspirations of the poor, the disadvantaged, the marginalized and the hungry are successfully voiced.              
	Simultaneously, a private-sector forum was held in Milan, where the largest agribusiness corporations participated. The aim of the latter was to secure a vital link with the private sector which would be a key to improving the food security of one billion people. Farmers, labourers, indigenous communities  who are the real producers of food  were not recognized as an equally vital link in this key United Nations forum. They were simply civil society. Their agenda of food sovereignty has found no place in the summit declaration (or in any policy discourse around hunger).        
	Put simply, food sovereignty is the right of peoples, communities, and countries to define their own agricultural, labour, fishing, food and land policies which are ecologically, socially, economically and culturally appropriate to their unique circumstances. It has four non-negotiable elements: the right to food, the right to produce food; the right to determine how food is going to be produced, and the right to food-producing resources. Accordingly, it is against all forms of corporate intervention in food and, more generally, against mechanisms that allow profiteering from food and hunger.        
	In India, the Right to Food Campaign set out with a very similar set of essential demands: [Right to Food] requires... sufficient availability of food, which in turn calls for strengthening of sustainable agricultural production systems, with special focus on the small rain fed farmer. It requires that land and water must never be forcibly diverted away from food production for cash crops or industrial use. It also requires effective systems of minimum support prices, price stabilisation, effective grain movement and storage, as well as strict regulation of speculation and trade.        
	In Haiti, mobilizations for food sovereignty began even before Haitians had recovered their loved ones from the rubble of the January earthquake. In Bangladesh, the Nayakrishi Andolon has long argued that food security cannot be guaranteed without guaranteeing the security of the food producing households. From Bangladesh to Bolivia to Mali, social struggles are calling for food sovereignty as the only substantive solution to endemic hunger. At the heart of this struggle is the wish to redress one injustice: that the majority of the worlds hungry are those who produce food  but are powerless to determine how it is produced or consumed.        
	Seen in this light, food entitlements, however generous they are, can make only highly tenuous, emaciated claims to justice, if at all. As conceived in the current framework of the Food Security Act, they can, at best, only impact distribution while keeping the undemocratic productive structures  which generate hunger in the first place  untouched. Could it then stand to reason that we try to limit  rather than maximize  even that impact on distribution? That we render the entitlements of the hungry entirely negotiable and dependent on hard evidence of their depravation? Surely, such an approach risks even greater injustice? Also, as a recent news story illustrated, it may have the potential for further assaulting the human dignity of our fellow citizens.              
	In Seoni, Madhya Pradesh, a hundred families woke up to see I am poor marked on their doors. Apparently, panchayat officials were trying to perfect their BPL count. It is very painful to be branded like this, said Bheekham, whose door was so marked. The affected families have filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission.        
	Bheekhams pain reveals something endemic to deeply unequal societies claiming to be democracies  that those who make policies to benefit the poor or the hungry have little patience for what their beneficiaries value or demand, or what constitutes justice from their perspective. This is why the demand for democratizing food production is off the table; and the goal of universal right to food  which could guarantee not only food but also some dignity  can so easily be substituted with a watered-down, undemocratically determined notion of food security. For a society that makes tall claims for its representativeness, this constitutes a double failure of justice and democracy.

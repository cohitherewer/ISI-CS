The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | stand up and be counted
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STAND UP AND BE COUNTED                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	The Right to Information Act was one of the most salutary initiatives of the United Progressive Alliance government, endorsed by the Congress. Recent rumblings that the prime minister and his administration would like to amend its constitution, applications and other modalities make one wary of the possibly limited and isolated intentions that merit changes and, therefore, dilution. There was a time in the not-so-distant past when secretaries to the government of India, people like L.P. Singh, L.K. Jha and endless others, were proud and honourable, correct and careful, when marking their comments on the file. They stood by their markings, were in complete control of the subject and not given to lobbies or delivering favours. There were exceptions to that rule, but few and far between. Today, alas, the reverse is true. In this context, we in the public domain cannot support exempting public servants from scrutiny. There is no other way to cleanse the system of governance that has overwhelmed India.        
	Most Indians want this nation to return to clean, inclusive governance. Any attempt, however mild, to protect the erring civil servant or to veil him in secrecy will be unacceptable. Sonia Gandhi has been steadfast in her support to initiatives such as this in an effort to restore dignity to government. For the UPA government, led by her and the Congress, any tempering down would amount to tampering with the essence of the act. I have often wondered why honest administrators and jurors would object to scrutiny. Surely, they must stand up there and be counted. Unfortunately, our rulers have complicated the laws with a plethora of addenda, making them untenable and impossible to enforce. Those who make our laws today neither live by them nor enforce them. Now they are demanding protection, terrified that their exploitative processes will be exposed.                
	Long wait        
	The Indian administration does not need protection for its inaction, for politicizing what was deemed a non-partisan civil service machine and for corrupting the processes of function and delivery. This breakdown neither merits explanation nor must it be permitted under any circumstances to operate in the unacceptable manner it has adopted over the last few decades. If anything, it needs radical administrative reforms that each successive government has shunned. As a technocrat, Manmohan Singh understands well that a service such as the IAS or the police must be incorruptible, must abide by and enforce the law, and stand by the notings made on file. The abject lack of transparency and running amok of coteries that change with shifting power manipulations have made India a laughing stock. A committed process of correction is essential and who better than a technocrat to lead the charge. So, please lets have no dilution whatsoever of the RTI Act.        
	The unspeakable performance in Parliament by members of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party has shamed all Indians, and insulted the mothers, wives, sisters and daughters of this civilization. Small wonder that women continue to be brutalized by men if the male leadership in place can behave in such an uncouth manner on the floor of the House and get away with it. Of course, the RJD, SP and other such parties will stall the bill and find different reasons to do so. Why did these leaders not ensure a place for women in their own parties? Why was it a wife who was pitched into the fray and not 30 per cent of the Dalit and Muslim women since these men claim they are the saviours of the less privileged? Fourteen years is a long time and there is no explanation except that they do not believe in allowing any such representation at all.

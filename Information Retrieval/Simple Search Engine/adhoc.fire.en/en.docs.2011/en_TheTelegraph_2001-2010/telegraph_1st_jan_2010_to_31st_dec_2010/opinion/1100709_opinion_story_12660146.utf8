	India is in love with the word honour. Even when the word is applied to an activity that has to do with coercion, violence, torture and bloodshed  instigated, typically, by a representative group led by traditionalists, elders or champions of regressive political opinion  it is treated with awe. This peculiar psychology distinguishes honour killings from common or garden murder. Khap panchayats, particularly active in the north and west of India, have made honour killings their insignia of power. With no legal standing but supported by regional political leaders, they continue to arrange grisly deaths of young people, undeterred by law or the government.        
	So powerful is the effect of the word honour that even the State appears to be acknowledging its magic. To counter the murderous practices of khap panchayats and the families that seek their help, the Union home ministry is thinking of inserting a new clause under the section in the Indian Penal Code that deals with murder. The special target of this clause would be those who plan and carry out killings of youngsters perceived to have brought dishonour to their caste, gotra or community. In what way are such killings different from premeditated murder? The IPC is nuanced enough to deal with all sorts of murder; an extra clause will not make it more effective. The proposed clause is merely a way of giving respectable space to a false and vicious notion of honour, and accepting that murderers, if they gang up in the name of clan or caste, are killers of a different kind. The proposal includes the condition that everyone associated with this kind of killing, that is, the family and the clan elders too, will be brought under the main charge of murder. Maybe this is being thought of as a deterrent. Experience suggests, however, that the wider the scope of the charge, the lower the chances of actual conviction. Also, the accused would have to prove their innocence. Given that Indian justice proceeds on the principle that a person is innocent till proven guilty, this change is questionable. It implies another weak-kneed acknowledgment that the justice system would be unable to establish the guilt of locally important bullies and murderers by the usual method, since they derive their power from caste, gotra or community. These categories are the mainstays of vote banks even today.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Still alive                  
	Sir  More than three decades have passed since Sanjay Gandhi died in a plane crash, but his ghost continues to haunt the eminent historian, Ramachandra Guha (What democrats hope, Sept 11). Sanjays demise has not resulted in the end of authoritarianism, which continues to manifest itself in different ways. This is particularly evident when the State machinery is completely politicized, as is the case in West Bengal. Only a few days back, some journalists were assaulted by the cadre belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The principal correspondent of The Telegraph fractured his arm as a result of the attack. Was this not yet another attempt to muzzle the freedom of the press? This act was not planned by a single individual. It was orchestrated by a political party that is known to have created an organized and violent group of followers.           
	Guha alleges that Sanjay had inherited his power from his family. It is no secret that politics has turned into a family affair all over the world, and India isnt an exception in this matter. But it has to be remembered that some of Sanjays ideas are particularly relevant, given Indias present condition. His concept of family planning had no takers in the 1970s because of the manner in which it was implemented. The plan was executed in a tearing hurry and lacked proper monitoring. This resulted in it being misused by the authorities during the infamous Emergency. But given Indias burgeoning population, family planning as a concept has become a political necessity.           
	Sanjay had also focused on clearing slums to beautify cities. If this strategy was implemented properly, it would have prevented politicians from treating slum dwellers as vote banks. Recently, the government of Delhi was forced to relocate slums before the start of the Commonwealth Games. Sanjay should also be praised for his decision to induct leaders like Pranab Mukherjee. In doing so, Sanjay tried to infuse new blood in the cabinet.           
	At a time when India is grossly overpopulated, perhaps it is necessary to take hard decisions that may appear to be unsavoury to politicians who are not interested in addressing the situation with a sense of urgency.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhankar Mukherjee,

      
	Borehat, Burdwan                    
	Sir  Ramachandra Guha should be congratulated for his article that reminded readers of the role played by Sanjay Gandhi and his sycophants during the Emergency. The blame for the Emergency lies with the people who elected leaders who were only interested in short-term gains. The role of an educated people in choosing leaders is of critical importance.           
	Yours faithfully,       
B.K. Saha, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is clear that as a nation India must always be ruled by a dynasty, which is ably assisted by sycophants. Did freedom fighters lay down their lives or waste their youth so that such a state of affairs would come to pass?           
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Banerjee, New Delhi

                
	High alert          
	Sir  Two Taiwanese nationals were injured when a couple of men on a motorbike fired several rounds at a tourist vehicle near Jama Masjid in Delhi (Call rush after Sunday shocks, Sept 20). The shocking incident, coming days before the start of the Commonwealth Games, was not only disturbing but also raised concerns about the security arrangement in Indias capital.           
	It is high time the state and Central governments beefed up security in Delhi for the Games. A number of foreign nationals and players are expected to reach Delhi soon. The security bandobast should be foolproof to allay fears in the visitors minds. There is no use in blaming the security forces alone. Ordinary people should also take up the responsibility of alerting and reporting any suspicious activity to the concerned authorities.                     
	Yours faithfully, Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad            
	More trouble          
	Sir  The unrest in Kashmir is largely due to the Centres lax approach (Centre finds starting point in Valley, Sept 28). Misgovernance on the part of the National Conference cannot be discounted either. It is quite surprising that the Centre failed to take any cohesive step to win over Kashmiris when the situation was better. By its show of force, the government has ended up alienating Kashmiris further. The call for azaadi by protesters does not mean that all Kashmiris want independence. This is only a ploy to get the government to address problems like human rights abuse or unemployment. Ordinary Kashmiris know that they can attract the Centres attention only by raising anti-India slogans. The Centre must realize that harsh measures allow pro-Pakistan groups to spoil the ties between civilians and the government.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Shiladitya Gupta, Calcutta

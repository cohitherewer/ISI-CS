	Deep in Rohtas district in Bihar, not far from the Sone barrage, is the village of Shivpur. The village has a school. From a distance it looks as though it must be a private school. The building is well-painted. The boundary wall encloses the large playground. The low structure has many classrooms, the premises are well kept. Attendance is high in the school on a daily basis. As the school day begins, everyone can see hundreds of children line up for prayers.         
	The story of this school is an interesting one. Over 10 years ago, it was a small one-room school. Over time, village people have donated time and money to make it one of the finest schools in the district. Even today, there are very few teachers on the government payroll. Most teachers are local people who give time in a structured way to ensure that their village children get the best education possible. The Shivpur example is one of sustained work by people in the village over a decade to change the face of schooling in their community.         
	But across the state, do people in Bihar have the enterprise, energy and the initiative needed to improve their own lives? Against the backdrop of decades of underdevelopment and insecure livelihoods, large-scale migration of Bihari workers to all corners of India is evidence of people taking the initiative to find better lives for themselves. Among the middle classes, the lack of industrialization and low growth in the service sector have meant that families look to government employment as an attractive and preferred career path. All of this leads to high pressure to perform well in competitive examinations. It is also true that in Patna and in district towns, the per capita availability of coaching classes for college admission and admission to premier institutions at university level is very high. It is said that the numbers of young people from Bihar appearing in entrance exams for the Indian institutes of technology and medical colleges is extremely high compared to other states.         
	As we look ahead, what do we see as possible for primary education in the state? Schools are being built, childrens enrolment is rising, teachers are being recruited. But these must translate effectively into visible and changed behaviours if they are to lead to big improvements in childrens attendance and substantive increases in learning levels. To a large extent, people must regain trust and faith in schools as places where transformations can happen. Without visible changes in outcomes, this faith or belief will not grow.         
	At the very core of development in Bihar today, there are at least two critical elements. On the one hand is what the state does  the states investment, intervention and input. On the other hand is what people do  peoples initiative and engagement. State action is necessary, but it is not sufficient. State provisions are critical in a backward state like Bihar if there is to be any chance of ever making accelerated progress. State provisions are not simply allocations done at the state level, but also everything that it takes, through the different layers of the government system  inputs, processes, participation  to bring schemes and programmes alive at the ground level.         
	For development to happen and be sustained, it is people who must take the initiative and effectively take the opportunities that are arising and own them, not just for themselves as individuals but for themselves as communities. The state alone cannot build the foundations of a new Bihar. It needs people across the board to feel that change can happen and that this change can only be brought about if they work towards it.         
	For the first time, Bihar celebrated education day in November, 2008. Addressing a public meeting in Gandhi Maidan in Patna, the chief minister said, One of the big constraints for development are people  people who believe that kucho nahi ho sakta hai (nothing will happen). These people  nirasha ke masiha (messiahs of despair)  hold up the process of development.               
	*************              
	It is October 2009. The Block Resource Centre building is not far from the main market in Bettiah. Down a winding lane and across a field is the familiar-looking building. There is a three-day training going on for the Cluster Resource Centre coordinators of Majhauliya, Lauriya and Narkatiaganj blocks. There are about 45 people in the room. Each is responsible for 10 to 15 schools. Most of them have been government schoolteachers for many years before being appointed CRCCs. These are the people who visit schools and monitor them. Today the training session is about how to improve childrens ability to write in standards III, IV and V.         
	The trainer has handed out a number of colourful and attractive picture cards to the group. Each card has a picture of a scene. One is a picture of a bustling marketplace with lots of people. There is another one of a railway station. Sets of these picture cards are going to the schools. The aim is to use these pictures to help children talk, discuss and then write on their own.        
	Right now, the same exercise is being done with the cluster coordinators. The big group has been divided into smaller groups. There is silence in the room as everyone is looking at the pictures and writing about them. No ones cell phone has rung in a long time and neither has anyone gone out of the room to do errands. Typically such trainings are plagued with people who are not engaged.              
	Now it is time to read out what has been written. There is a clamour. Everyone wants a turn. One gentleman has written about the railway station, he has given names to the characters on the cards and describes a journey from Bettiah station to Motihari. The crowd applauds. Another lady reads out what she has written about the scene at the dhobi ghat. The CRCCs seem to be enjoying themselves. One of them admits that it is a long time since he has written a story for children and that he is loving doing it. He has a long journey home and he thinks that by tomorrow he will have a much better story to share.         
	On the first day of training, it had been agreed that the formal session would end by 4.30 pm. People have a long way to go and trains and buses to catch to reach their village homes. Although it is well past 4.30 in the afternoon, no one is moving. People are still talking to each other and discussions are going on and on about what to write and how to write and what children are likely to do when they get these colourful picture cards.         
	Suddenly one man gets back and announces that he would like to address the group. He has a military look. I am very happy to participate in something new, he says, for example, look at this writing exercise. We all know how to write, but the pictures have made us think in a new way. For us, who live in dehaat (countryside), we dont know how to compete with people who live in cities. With new ways of preparing our children we too will be ready to compete with the whole world.

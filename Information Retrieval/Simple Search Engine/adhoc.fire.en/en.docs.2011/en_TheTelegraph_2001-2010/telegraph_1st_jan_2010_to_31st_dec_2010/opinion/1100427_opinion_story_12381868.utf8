										      BUILDING BLOCKS                                                
	Geneva, March 30, 2010. Beams of protons circling around in opposite directions collided at 7 tetraelectronvolt in the Large Hadron Collider at 13.06 Geneva time  a historic moment. Never before has man reached such energy levels in the history of science. The whole world is rejoicing, and the scientific world is jubilant. It is not only a unique achievement but has also opened up a thousand windows to new concepts and ideas till now shrouded in the darkest preserve of nature.        
	There was no dearth of anxious moments. Beams started circling the night before without colliding  suddenly around 7 a.m. there was no beam. Something went disastrously wrong. The proton simply refused to be pushed around. After some clever tricks, at around 10.30 a.m. on March 30, the beam came up again.        
	Higgs Boson; dark matter; what can be the source of dark energy; do supersymmetric particles exist  these fundamental questions are going to be addressed at the LHC. Further, when the two nuclei will go into colliding mode, we shall have a glimpse of the universe through the lens of mini bang, a microsecond after the Big Bang.        
	Technologically, the LHC is a marvel. It is the hottest place in the universe (a million times the temperature of the interior of the sun) as well as the coldest (a couple of degrees Kelvin), even colder than the microwave background radiation encompassing the entire cosmos. It is the hiss of the universe, the remanence of its creation in a Big Bang and therefore, the hiss of the expanding universe. Already, the data coming out of the colliding protons are overflowing the computers at the detectors: Alice, CMS, Atlas, LHCb.        
	The invention of grid computing system, which networks all the computers in Tiers 1 and 2 around the world, has been so fantastic that immediately after March 30, the facility has been fully operational. The Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre, Calcutta, and Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics are members of Tier 2.        
	The fundamental questions that have bothered man are going to be examined critically: why is there matter and not antimatter? Is it possible for all forces to be grandly unified? What is the origin of mass? Indeed, when the nuclei collide in near future and (hopefully) create a plasma of quarks and gluons (the fundamental building blocks of nature), we shall have much deeper insight into the nature of strong interaction that binds neutrons and protons inside the atomic nucleus.        
	Guido Tonelli, the spokesperson of the CMS experiment says, Well address soon some of the major puzzles of modern physics. A collaboration spokesperson, Fabiola Gianotti, says, LHC experiments are propelled into a vast region to explore and the hunt begins for dark matter, new forces even new dimensions. In the Alice detector, VECC, Calcutta, and SINP have made major contributions in terms of Photon Multiplicity Detector and the Manas chip of the dimuon spectrometer. We are jubilant to have already collected the newest data that man has ever seen. The director-general of Cern, Rolf Heuer, said, It is a great day to be a particle physicist.        
	Cern will run the LHC for 18-24 months with the objective of delivering enough data to make significant advances across a range of physics channels. As soon as it has re-discovered the known Standard Model particles, a necessary precursor to looking for new physics, the LHC experiment will start the systematic search for the Higgs Boson. With the amount of data expected, called one inverse femtobarn by physicists, the combined analysis of Atlas and CMS will be able to explore a wide mass range.        
	The LHC has a real chance over the next two years of discovering supersymmetric particles, explained Heuer, giving insights into the composition of about a quarter of the Universe. Over 2,000 graduate students are eagerly awaiting data from the LHC experiments.        
	A moment has come when the young can make their mark and become famous for more than 15 minutes. The world will not be same again. The LHC will take man up to a different height.

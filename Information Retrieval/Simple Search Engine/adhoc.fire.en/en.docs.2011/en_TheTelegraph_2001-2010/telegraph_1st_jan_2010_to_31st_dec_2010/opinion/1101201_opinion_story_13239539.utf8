                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LOOK FORWARD                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	Five years ago, when the people of Bihar voted out the 15-year-old Rashtriya Janata Dal regime and brought to office the Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party combine, they had acted more out of anger than with any hope for a better future. It was thus a negative vote. This time, however, they have voted positively for the same combine and have done so in such a determined manner as to render all Opposition parties irrelevant in the state, at least for the next five years.        
	They did this in spite of the fact that the objective conditions were not wholly in the ruling alliances favour. The elections were preceded by a massive flood and then by drought. Like other state governments, the Nitish KumarSushil Modi administration was found wanting in meeting the challenges. Then came the Allahabad High Court verdict on the Ayodhya case that had caused many pundits to suggest that Muslims would turn away from Nitish Kumar because of his alliance with the BJP. Those who insist that politics in Bihar is only about caste also felt that the government will find it additionally difficult to face the joint opposition of the backwards and dalits as represented by Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan. Much hype was also created by Rahul Gandhis appeal to the youth to vote for the Congress.        
	None of these factors worked for the Opposition. The natural calamities caused much suffering, communal and caste educations could not have totally disappeared from peoples minds, and Rahul Gandhi did present the fresh face of an otherwise jaded party. On the other hand, however, there was the peoples daily experience. For the first time, they had seen an administration trying to make their lives a little easier and, perhaps more importantly, a little more peaceful.                
	Breathe easy        
	That this experience had heavily outweighed all other factors became clear by the way in which women had come out in far greater numbers than ever before to cast their votes. In the Indian countryside, it is the woman of the family who has to face the first brunt of adverse conditions, and the Bihari woman had evidently breathed easier in the last five years. In short, for the first time, the ordinary Bihari did not allow caste considerations to overshadow all other features of life. If it had been otherwise then the RJD-Lok Janshakti Party combines performance would not have been so dismal. Clearly, the anger against Prasad continues to persist.        
	This has to be understood clearly. Even as the results were coming in, political observers talked of better social engineering on the part of the JD(U) and the BJP. The implication was that by clever arrangement, they had got more caste groups to support them. Such engineering might have been in the rulers minds but their actions in the last five years convinced the poor of all castes that they have friends in Patna. If the political analysts stick to the social engineering theme then they will only show themselves as caught in a mindset which the poor, and often illiterate, Bihari has been able to get over.        
	Politically, the results are more shocking for the Congress than for the RJD-LJP combine. The Congress had thought that the triumvirate of Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi would be able to ensure that the party emerged stronger than before. The reverse happened  people turned a deaf ear to criticisms levelled by the Congress against the Nitish Kumar government.        
	The coming days will be interesting. The BJP has emerged much stronger. Will it be more assertive or will the moderation of Sushil Modi continue to guide it? Logically, the latter will be the case, as the alliance has gained for the BJP a wider acceptance. It is unlikely that it will do anything which may disturb the applecart.

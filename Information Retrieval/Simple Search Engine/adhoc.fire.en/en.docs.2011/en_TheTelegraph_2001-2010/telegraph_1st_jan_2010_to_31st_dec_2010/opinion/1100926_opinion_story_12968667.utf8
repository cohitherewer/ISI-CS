	Surprised by honesty                  
	 Sir  I witnessed something unique on my way to north Bengal in the Kanchankanya Express on September 16. A businessman offered the train ticket examiner a bribe of Rs 100, pleading to be allowed to travel in the two-tiered air-conditioned coach. To my surprise, the TTE refused to accept the money. When corruption has corroded the basic foundation of the Indian Railways, this kind of behaviour from a railway official reinstates the faith of the common man in our national institutions.

	Not exempt          
	Sir  The entire nation must be stunned by the allegation of the former Union law minister, Shanti Bhushan, that eight out of 16 past Chief Justices of India were corrupt (Corrupt judges, Sept 17). Such an accusation has never been made in the history of independent India, that too in the form of an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court. But a few questions arise in this context. What prevented Bhushan from accusing the CJIs when they were still in office? Why has he moved court now, when his son, Prashant Bhushan, is facing contempt charges? Prashant Bhushan had been spearheading a campaign for making the judiciary more transparent and accountable when he was accused of contempt of court. Whether the allegations against Prashant Bhushan are justified or not, I think people should have the freedom to criticize the judiciary. Unless there is criticism, there would be no introspection among the law-makers, and hence no attempt to amend any incorrect action. Constructive criticism would only help the Indian judiciary maintain its high standards.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Shanti Bhushans allegation is disturbing. It reinforces the need for following stringent rules in selecting judges. The process by which high court judges are currently picked lacks transparency. Vacancies for the posts of judges ought to be advertised in the media to promote fair competition.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Aires Rodrigues, Ribandar, Goa 

      
	Sir  While a candid admission of judicial corruption by a veteran jurist like Shanti Bhushan is likely to create heated arguments among the legal community and in society, common men have little doubt about the existence of corruption at various levels of the legal system. The rot has worsened in recent years for more reasons than one. Although Bhushans actual motive in filing the affidavit in the apex court may be questioned, one must appreciate the courage exhibited by this senior advocate in trying to expose the flaws inherent in the judicial system.           
	When corruption has permeated the very core of Indian society, judges cannot possibly remain free of the vice. One of the chief reasons behind the existence of corruption is to be found in the judges selection process. In India, judges are chosen by a small group of peers without any public scrutiny. In the United States of America, the federal judges are nominated by the president. But the nominated person must go through a rigorous process of scrutiny conducted by both Houses of the Congress. Many candidates have been rejected by the Congress after they failed to pass the public cross-examination.           
	Such a transparent system should be followed in India. We have every right to demand that only people with the highest standards of morality be appointed as judges.          
	Yours faithfully,

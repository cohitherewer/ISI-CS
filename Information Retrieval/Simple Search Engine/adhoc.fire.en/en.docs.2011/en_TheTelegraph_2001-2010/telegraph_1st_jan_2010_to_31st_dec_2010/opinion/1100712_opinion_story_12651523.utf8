	As the American withdrawal gains speed, there are fewer American troops in Iraq than in Afghanistan for the first time since 2003. By the end of August, there will be no US combat troops left in Iraq, though some tens of thousands of support troops will remain until next year. And still there is no new Iraqi government, although it is now four months since the election on March 7.        
	The US vice-president, Joe Biden, was in Baghdad urging Iraqi politicians to end the political deadlock, but Americas influence over events in Iraq has been falling as fast as its troop numbers. In the end, the same broad coalition of Shia Arabs and Kurds that ran the country before will probably rule again, excluding the Sunni Arabs, but its unclear who will lead the new coalition. The last election made Iraqs sectarian and ethnic rivalries even sharper. The corruption is universal, and dozens of people are still killed by suicide bombers every week. But the country cannot really fail, because there is just so much oil.        
	After three decades of foreign wars, UN sanctions and American occupation, Iraqs oil exports bottomed out at 1.8 million barrels per day in 2008, but they are already back up to 2.5 million b/d. Baghdad plans to be producing 9.9 million b/d 10 years from now. That would make it the worlds first, second or third largest exporter (depending on what happens to Saudi Arabian and Russian production). The target is plausible, because this is not speculation about production from new oilfields; it is just enhanced production from existing fields. Contracts to build the infrastructure to pump that extra oil have already been signed with two dozen foreign oil companies. Since the foreigners are only paid a fee per barrel, Iraq gets most of the profits.                
	Striking deals        
	On the reasonable assumption that the price of oil will not drop below $50 per barrel in the next decade, the Iraqi government will have an oil income of at least $150 billion a year by 2020. Two-thirds of the current governments income is stolen by the political elite and there is no reason to think that this will change, but that would still allow some $50 billion a year to trickle through and serve the needs of ordinary Iraqis.        
	That is probably enough to buy the grudging loyalty of most Shia Arabs to the Iraqi State. The Kurds are a different case, but the hostility of all their neighbours to full Kurdish independence will probably persuade them to maintain their semi-detached relationship with Baghdad. The Sunni Arab minority can be either bought off or repressed. All that the Iraqis can hope for, in the aftermath of the US occupation, is corrupt governments riven by sectarian and ethnic divisions, but that is probably a stable outcome provided there is enough money. To be fair to the Americans, no other post-Saddam, post-occupation outcome was ever likely.        
	The union last month between outgoing prime minister Nouri al-Malikis secular, but overwhelmingly Shia, State of Law party and the two religious Shia parties in the Iraqi National Alliance creates a bloc that is within striking distance of a parliamentary majority. Recreate the alliance with the Kurds that Maliki had in the last coalition, and the deal is done. That coalition has not yet happened because Maliki would almost certainly not be the prime minister in it: one of the Shia religious parties, led by Moqtada al-Sadr, hates him too much. Talks may continue till September as Maliki seeks to stay in power, but he will probably fail.        
	Meanwhile, the Americans are leaving quietly. As quietly, that is, as you can move 1,900 heavy tanks and fighting vehicles, 43,000 trucks, 600 helicopters, and 34,000 tonnes of ammunition. Some of this will go back to the US, but a lot of it will be repaired in Kuwait and then sent on to Afghanistan. The dumb war, as President Obama called it, is over. The almost-as-dumb war continues.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The sigh of phantom trails
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE SIGH OF PHANTOM TRAILS                                                                
	As the train ground to a halt at the sleepy Biman Bandar station, Pinaki Ghoshal hurried out to make his way to work. From a distant compartment, one other passenger got out. The train had been emptied of all its occupants. A gaggle of children instantly climbed into one of the compartments, as if embarking on an adventure. It proved to be short-lived, however, as most of them clambered out in a second. Down at the ticket office, an attendant snoozed peacefully.        
	The overhead train link connecting Dum Dum Cantonment and the airport had been flagged off by Lalu Prasad in 2006. At Rs 112 crore, it was an expensive project. The train would connect the city with its peripheries and be a vital link to Dum Dum airport. The creaky, mournful locomotive at the Biman Bandar station was supposed to fill the part of this astounding modern convenience. Less than four years after its inauguration, the ghost train will be laid to rest.         
	We have four or five monthly passengers who use the train regularly, says Sandhya Datta, who sells tickets at the Cantonment station, On a daily basis, we sell between 12 and 15 tickets. Then there are the gleeful fugitives. They are just schoolchildren, probably in Class V or VI, Sandhya says indulgently. Ticket sales for the shuttle average Rs 150 per day, she estimates.        
	The shuttle train is enigmatic about its timings. Personnel at the Cantonment station insist that there are two shuttles daily, one at 7:05 a.m. and the other at 14:04 p.m. At Biman Bandar, one is told there are three: two in the afternoon and a third one at 5:42 pm. The schedule at the station tells another story.         
	As the empty train pulled into the Cantonment station, the general response was one of mystification. Does this go to Sealdah? some asked hopefully. Pinaki Ghoshal, an Air India employee, is one of the few regulars. Its always this empty, he says. The timings are bad and it is not well-connected. Nobody who gets off this train actually catches a flight at the airport.        
	The airport seems to be the centre of a number of ambitious schemes. At the other end of town, outside the Tollygunge Metro station, a gleaming, red Volvo bus waits for passengers. An initiative of the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation, these buses ply on two routes: Tollygunge-Airport and Airport-Shantragachhi.        
	There is a bus every half-an-hour. At the moment, the first bus starts at 9:15 am and the last bus is at 6:00 pm, says Indrajeet Auddi, an enthusiastic young bus conductor. Fares start at Rs 20 and go up to Rs 60. A couple of passers-by climb into the bus but leave once they are told of the rates. When asked if the fares are a bit steep, Auddi is defensive. The total price of this bus is Rs 95 lakh. That rear-view mirror alone costs Rs 25,000, he declares triumphantly. Evidently, this is no substitute for ordinary local buses.        
	The bus eventually sets off with just a handful of people. Only a few more passengers board at the stops on the way. Inside, the atmosphere is festive. The radio is turned on loud, a couple of friends take turns to pose for pictures, a pair of lovers giggle at the back, two girls get down at Mani Square, evidently eager for a shopping spree.         
	The empty seats, however, are ominous. With high running costs and few passengers, it remains to be seen how long this service can be sustained. In spite of the jaunty exterior, one is reminded of the doomed Airport shuttle, of the sigh of train wheels across the city.        
	An improbable thought occurs. Despite its local trains bursting with people and oranges and its traffic-crazed streets, Calcutta is a city veined with desolation. Like its abandoned projects, its erratic timetables, its trains that rush into oblivion and its hollow bluster of buses, it is perhaps an elegy of vacant seats.                    IPSITA CHAKRAVARTY

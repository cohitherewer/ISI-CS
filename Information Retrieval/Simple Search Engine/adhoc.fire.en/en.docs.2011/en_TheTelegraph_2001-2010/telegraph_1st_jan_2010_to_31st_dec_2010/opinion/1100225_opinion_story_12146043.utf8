The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Close to the paradise on earth
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CLOSE TO THE PARADISE ON EARTH                                                                  
	The tiger may yet be saved. That is, just the 1411 of them, if the number is right. It is an old average dependent on what seems pure faith. The number of tiger deaths actually recorded since that trusting average was made comes close to a hundred, but it is nice to stick to 1411. It is an odd enough number to sound credible. And maybe it is better not to do too many sums, in case the tiger turns into a mythical beast and we are left wondering where all our donations to the save the tiger campaigns are going. Highly conscious and deeply concerned we may be, but we have not been told precisely how the tigers are being counted. Immediately after the embarrassment at Sariska, where the tiger had indubitably become a myth of the past, a lot of tiger wisdom was broadcast for the public. One bit said that pugmark measuring does not yield accurate results, scientific techniques such as the camera trap are needed. Maybe a radio collar in the rare case. But that story has remained incomplete. Should we, the gawping public, just rest assured that since everyone is fighting everyone else regarding the correct count  states, all-India government bodies, wildlife NGOs, forest officials  something must be going on. Everyone is holding on to the tiger. Or its shadow. Everyone has something, material or metaphysical, to gain.        
	We too are being given a chance to be part of the action. Various companies, mobile service providers, tastefully inclined restaurants, are dispensing awareness and collecting support and funds. For the tiger, of course. Stars of the cultural firmament are attractively pledging support to the tiger on television, asking us, the non-starry public, whether we are doing so too. We can SMS, blog, twitter  presumably rave in general on cyberspace  so that our roar becomes louder than the tigers. We can also, always, donate. What happens then? Apart from generating a lot of gains for a lot of invisible people, how will our virtual roar help? Had the programmes for conservation been properly executed since they were first thought up, surely the poor tiger would not have needed our roar? We can pledge away from the bottom of our hearts, but that will not make the various people concerned more committed to their jobs, or more efficient, more thoughtful or more honest.         
	The tiger is Indias crown, its pride. It is sensational, it is picturesque, but conscious citizens must not play favourites. What about the tree? We can help there too. Do away with waste of paper and timber  leave the timber for governments and thieves  and just use mobile phones for everything. That is truly a marvellous idea; in these days of frankness, one must not mind if it is a little bare-faced. And why limit oneself to trees? If youre out to save, go ahead and save the planet. Throw old mobile phones away in designated boxes and for every phone thus correctly aimed, the company will plant a tree. All that ruthless mining and deforestation will thus be compensated for and the good citizen will be able to enjoy cutting-edge technologies while feeling deeply virtuous in the bargain. The paradise on earth is within our reach.

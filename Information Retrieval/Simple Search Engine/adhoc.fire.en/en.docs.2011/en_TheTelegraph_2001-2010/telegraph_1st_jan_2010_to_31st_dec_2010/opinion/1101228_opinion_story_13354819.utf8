Desai                                                        
	I have been caught in a storm. I have had more invitations to speak in the last week than in the three months before. I have been feted. It has left me a bit shaken, for I am not used to being admired. I more often enrage people. So, thankfully, have I done this time too, including friends I value. That gives me hope that I may be right. I should make an attempt to persuade them; if that requires boring sobriety, so be it.        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of Indias committee to examine issues arising from the ownership and governance of market infrastructure institutions is concerned with the prevention of contagion and instability in financial institutions and markets which can impact the rest of the economy; presumably it was appointed because Sebi got worried about the contagion and instability in the Western economies in 2008 and 2009. It deals with stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories; I shall ignore the latter two because they are subsidiary to stock exchanges. Every stock exchange must be wedded to a single clearing corporation to ensure integrity of transactions on it. Share transfer, however, does not have to be instantaneous; so there is no necessary connection between exchanges and depositories.        
	Ours is a British-type government. It gets legislation approved by Parliament which gives it power to make rules. It has used this power copiously in respect of the capital market. The committee refers in particular to the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, Securities Contracts (Manner of Increasing and Maintaining Public Shareholding in Recognised Stock Exchanges) Rules, 2006 (abbreviated as MIMPS), and some rules that are being redrafted. Just what they are is unclear; the committees footnotes are vague and source notes are perfunctory (and refer only to literature that supports the committees view). But it seems that the government is thinking of making big changes in the control of stock exchanges; this committee was an instrument in the exercise.        
	MIMPS ordains dispersal of shareholding in stock exchanges as follows. Traders on a stock exchange must always be in a minority amongst shareholders; they cannot together own more than 49 per cent. Within this limit, a single foreign institution can own 26 per cent at most (but none has been allowed to do so). A single Indian institution can own 15 per cent at most; but it must be ICICI, IFCI, IDBI, LIC, UTI, IDFC, or a company controlled by the Central government, or a bank, insurance company, stock exchange, depository, or clearing corporation. A human investor can own five per cent at most. Note that all the acronymous bodies started as government companies; it has a controlling share in them except for ICICI.        
	The committee wants to introduce a new anchor institutional investor, who would be allowed to take an initiative in setting up new stock exchanges and take 24 per cent of equity initially, to be reduced to 15 per cent in 10 years. All the permitted institutional investors I have listed above can be AIIs, except stock exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations; and an AII must have net worth of Rs 1,000 crore at least. In other words, the committee wants to stop stock exchanges from setting up new stock exchanges, and wants to reserve the setting up of future stock exchanges to government financial institutions, except for ICICI  the trivial exception that proves the committees intent; it wants to make sure that the Central government would control all future stock exchanges from inception.        
	That would still leave existing private exchanges. For them, the committee has another proposal. At present, a quarter of their directors can be trading members. The committee wants them to be thrown out, and relegated to a so-called advisory committee  one which can advise all it wants but decide nothing. If brokers cannot be directors, who is left? The committee wants all to be what it calls public interest directors. It gives a negative definition of such a director: he must have nothing to do with either stockbrokers, investors or listed companies. And how are such gems to be found? Ask who would control the stock exchanges, and you have the answer.        
	Can stock exchanges be listed? The committee opposes their listing. So an investor  that five per cent fellow  cannot just sell his shares on the market. Why then should he invest, when he cannot become a director, and when he has no influence on the management except that he can go to the annual general meeting and perhaps open his mouth?        
	Because of the dividends? The committee says stock exchanges must not be allowed to make more than reasonable profits. And who will decide what is reasonable? You have got it  the government. Who will invest in a stock exchange on these terms? The committee has carefully weeded out all rational investors. So investors would have to be ordered to invest. And who can be so ordered? The dutiful daughters of the government mentioned above.        
	If implemented, the recommendations of this committee will create jobs for retired and surplus civil servants. The government is run by civil servants. They have created many jobs in public enterprises, commissions and regulatory bodies where they can earn salary plus deputation allowance in comfort and their bosses can dispose of them without giving them useful work. Now they want to annex the stock market to their empire. And why? Because, according to them, only they have the integrity and public spirit to serve and protect the investor.        
	This is entirely the wrong turn to take, 19 years after the reforms. A stock exchange is a computerized trading system; the minimum scale it requires to be profitable is a fraction of the current size of the market. Most world markets have a handful of exchanges; but this only tells us how they have been regulated. There is no reason to look for an optimum number of stock exchanges, let alone force it on investors. Technology today makes it possible to protect the investor completely, to identify errors or misbehaviour of traders instantaneously, and to interconnect any number of exchanges seamlessly. Regulation is easier today than ever before; if proof is needed, one only has to look at the long list of traders whom Sebi has punished.              
	Competition among stock exchanges is not only possible; it is necessary. The number of businesses in India is hundreds of times the number of listed companies. If these small and medium businesses were listed, access to the capital market would enable the efficient ones to expand faster at the expense of inefficient ones; it would raise the rate of growth of productivity, which is the essence of national growth. Competition in the capital market is as powerful a force for improvement as competition in the market for goods and services. If listing requirements were eased and controls on the setting up of exchanges removed, local exchanges would come up to connect local producers and investors. Growth would spread further across regions and activities. All that is needed for it is withdrawal of the dead hand of the Central government. Let it fatten itself on the tax revenue that the growth would bring.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HURT STATE                                                    
	If ministers can go for eight months without work or with very little of it, it is obvious that there is no work for them. Maybe the ministers of state who complained of lack of work to the prime minister recently should have thought that through. Of 38 junior ministers in the United Progressive Alliance government, 33 attended the heart-to-heart meeting with the prime minister. Of these only three or four claimed to be satisfied with the work they did. The junior ministers complaints that they had hardly any files to sign and little work to do, that they were ignored when policy decisions were made in their ministries or even when press notes were circulated, that they were not interested in power without responsibility reflected the deeply hierarchical mindset that underlies governmental organization, one which is also related to the intense desire for control among senior politicians. But there were suggestions too. One junior minister said that the prime minister should evolve a policy for workload distribution while another suggested that the respective senior ministers should set targets for their juniors. This would be good practice.        
	Charming and heartening though these sentiments sound, the fundamental issue remains unchanged. If the government can function without engaging the majority of 38 ministers, then the government does not need them. In a time of reduction of unnecessary public expenditure, calculating what is spent on jobless ministers and multiplying ministries has become more relevant than ever. It cannot be the case that a sprawling organization makes for efficiency, because it has been proved time and again that the greater the number of departments, ministries and officials involved, the worse the coordination and progress rate in any task. India has an astonishing number of ministries, the result of splitting up, for example, transport into aviation, roads, shipping and so on, violating logic and hindering efficiency but appeasing coalition partners and pleasing all segments of the dominant party. Just as such extra ministries should be merged or abolished, ministers of state with no distinct portfolio and no allotted job cannot become apprentices to power on public money. The strangest are the ministers of state with independent charge  which particular split hair prevents them from becoming full-fledged ministers if their jobs are so necessary?

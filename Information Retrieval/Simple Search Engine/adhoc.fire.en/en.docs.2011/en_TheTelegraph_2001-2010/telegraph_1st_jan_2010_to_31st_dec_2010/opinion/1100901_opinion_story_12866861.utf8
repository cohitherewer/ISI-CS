The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Lets kill all the lawyers
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LETS KILL ALL THE LAWYERS                                  Stephen Hugh-Jones                              
	He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. So, reportedly, Jesus answered a crowd of men who had brought to him a woman taken in adultery, pointing out that Jewish law said she should be stoned, but what did he think? Surprisingly, instead of stoning him too, at his rebuke her accusers slunk away, while he told her to go, and sin no more.        
	And whats odd about his answer? I dont mean its ethics, though I imagine that to any ayatollah, theyre very odd indeed. No, just the wording. It comes from the great 1611 translation of the Bible, but you could easily find its like today.        
	The oddity is let him. We use that phrase often enough today, and still more often ones such as lets go. That lets go sounds pretty colloquial, but its simply short for let us go, and there are thoroughly formal parallels: let us pray, for instance, used in church services. And the question is: why him and us, not he and we? After all, it is he who is to cast a stone, we who are to go or to pray.                
	Private grammar        
	The easy answer is to see him and us as merely the standard forms of those pronouns when they are the objects of a verb, as in, say, humour him or hell shoot us. Not so. The let of let him cast or lets go is utterly bogus. Its no equivalent of allow him/us to. No third party is being told to do the letting. In practice, those phrases are commands, that he or we should carry out, and the let is hardly a verb at all, merely a meaningless part of the imperative mood of the verbs cast or go. To quote one expert, lets is being treated as a quasi-modal. (And lets hope that leaves you wiser than it left me.)        
	Most languages have an imperative available for phrases like these. Frances Marseillaise opens Allons, enfants de la patrie  lets go, children of the fatherland  not Permettez-nous aller, as if the enfants needed permission. The French equivalent of let him cast is more complex, but it too uses their version of he, not of him.        
	In English, phrases like let he cast or let we go can be found as far back as the 17th century. But they were oddities then, and theyre plain wrong now. Youll find todays usage in Shakespeares Henry V: he which hath no stomach to this fight, let him depart. Or Henry VI: lets kill all the lawyers. Not that Shakespeare was above a bit of his own private grammar, as in Hamlet: break we our watch up, which is plainly a kind of imperative, a substitute for lets break  and is indeed at once followed by lets impart.                
	Spell out        
	So thats settled? Not quite. Even now, the we/us confusion is reflected in one subtlety. If you say lets go, would you spell out that us as you and me or you and I? Trollope went for I, writing and now, my dear, let you and I say a few words about this unfortunate affair. Half a century later, William Faulkner had a character say lets you and me take em on. However colloquial, thats surely correct: if its us, it has to be you and me, not you and I.        
	Well, so I would think, and many a pedant would affirm (as indeed the great and unpedantic H.W. Fowler did, reproving Trollope). Yet in 1910 T.S. Eliot, hardly an illiterate, in The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock was writing let us go then, you and I, exactly as if the two people concerned were the joint subjects, not objects, of let. As in real life they are. At which point, my pedantic friends  just how am I to put this? lets admit were beaten, you and me.

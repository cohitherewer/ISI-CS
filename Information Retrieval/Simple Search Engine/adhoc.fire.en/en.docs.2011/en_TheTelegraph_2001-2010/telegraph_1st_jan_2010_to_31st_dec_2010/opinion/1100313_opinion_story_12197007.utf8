                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Conspiracy theories                  
	Sir  The Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is in the habit of issuing controversial statements. Some time back, he had stirred a hornets nest by saying that the Holocaust never took place and that it was merely the imagination of the Jewish people. Now he has come up with his own theory about the 9/11 terror strike on the World Trade Center in the United States of America  he has termed this attack fake, claiming that it was nothing but a ruse floated by the Americans in order to invade Afghanistan.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Candid camera          
	Sir  Most of the so-called swamis are cheats and liars, having no consideration for the trust that people place in them. Swami Paramahamsa Nithyananda is just one of them (Tamil seer in sex net, March 4). Individuals like Chaucers monk, who claim to bridge the gap between god and men, exist in our society even today. If the rumours about Nithyanandas involvement in illegal trade and crime are true, the swami is in big trouble. Just as well for someone who had the daring to insult god by engaging in immoral acts, as evident from the recent sex scandal. In the guise of a sadhu, he could easily go on supporting flesh trade and the mafia.          
	However, it is the people who give these otherwise common men the courage to abuse their faith in god. The exploitation of believers at the hands of these dubious men would not have been possible had the people not taken their spirituality to fanatic levels. Instead of trusting a fraud, could they not have rather trusted themselves? Unless the worship of such demi-gods is stopped, people will continue to be duped by impostors.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Amrita Mallik, Calcutta

                
	Sir  It is unfortunate that sants and mahatmas like Swami Nithyananda, hiding beneath saffron robes, play with the sentiments of their followers. But it is also interesting that in both parts of the controversial video, Ranjitha, the Tamil actress with whom Nithyananda was allegedly involved, mostly looks away from the camera.          
	However, this episode could be viewed as a blessing in disguise. It will act as a strong deterrent for other seers who engage in similar activities. They must all realize that sex and sainthood do not go well together. Taking a lesson from the present case, they will perhaps try and control their urges, and concentrate on religious and welfare work, sans sex. But we must be careful not to tar all seers with the same brush, as some of them really do valuable social work.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Difficult drive          
	Sir  The national highways, which the National Democratic Alliance government started building, are widely cherished. But the United Progressive Alliance government seems indifferent towards the maintenance of these roads. Those living around Asansol and Durgapur travel to Calcutta by road rather than in trains these days, as that takes less time. But the fun of these otherwise enjoyable drives has been lessened because a stretch of about three kilometres near Panagarh is still under construction, causing major traffic snarls every evening. Even the portion of the highway near Rajbandh, which the National Highway Authorities of India started repairing three months back, has not been finished yet.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
D.P. Ghatak, Durgapur

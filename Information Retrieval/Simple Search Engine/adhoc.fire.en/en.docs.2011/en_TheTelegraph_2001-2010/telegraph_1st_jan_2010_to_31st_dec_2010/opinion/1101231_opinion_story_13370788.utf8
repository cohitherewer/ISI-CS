                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GLOOMY ENDING                                                    
	The new year is unlikely to bring good tidings to the beleaguered people of Pakistan. After a year of devastating floods, administrative failure at various levels of public life, soaring inflation and charges of corruption against a section of its political class, Pakistans woes are yet to end. There is now fresh grief in the form of an unstable ruling coalition. The Pakistan Peoples Party, even as it came to power on a wave of public sympathy after the death of Benazir Bhutto, has never been quite as popular under the leadership of Asif Ali Zardari as it was under the Bhuttos. If people tended to be generously charitable towards the latter, Mr Zardari was derided as Mr Ten Per Cent. Now, with the prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, sacking a couple of allegedly corrupt cabinet ministers belonging to the PPPs allies, the crisis has reached a threshold. The secular Muttahida Qaumi Movement and the Islamist Jamiat Ulema Islam party have both threatened the reigning administration with dire consequences. Though the MQM has withdrawn its candidates from its two cabinet posts, it is still willing to wager its support for the PPP. But the JUI has decided to defect to the Opposition benches. This decision does not have any bearing on the stability of the government as yet  at least not until the MQM decides to follow suit, if at all. Although top leaders of all three parties are trying to work out an acceptable middle ground, the MQM and the JUI would not be happy with anything less than Mr Gilanis removal from office.        
	However, it is unlikely that the aggrieved parties would act with undue haste. Given the long tradition of military coup in Pakistan, no party would like to be held responsible for instituting a military regime by removing a democracy. But the form of governance that the PPP has practised so far can be called robustly democratic. Plagued by the unabated march of Islamic insurgency, the PPP has had to take on board a rainbow alliance of parties with strikingly differing ideologies. Even though such strategies of appeasement have been tested time and again  mostly with disastrous results  by the pioneers of the PPP, its value seems to have endured for one reason or the other. If not for the people, then at least for the sake of its most important provider of aid, the United States of America, the PPP and its allies might try to salvage the fragile coalition somehow.

	LUKA AND THE FIRE OF LIFE By Salman Rushdie, Jonathan Cape, Rs 499              
	Eighteen years after the birth of   Haroun, Luka is born to Rashid   Khalifa and his wife, Soraya, in the   city of Kahani in the land of Alifbay. If   there was more to Haroun than met the   blinking eye, Luka is a wonder child, ldquo;a fellow who can turn back Time itself rdquo; and   make his ageing parents young again.   Twenty years have passed since Salman   Rushdie created magic of the highest order   in Haroun and the Sea of Stories (1990),   which was dedicated to his eldest son, Zafar.   In Luka and the Fire of Life, he attempts to   recreate the spell once again for his   youngest son, 13-year-old Milan. But it is   doubtful whether this novel can turn the   clock back for its creator. For Luka hardly   contains any fire. Rather, quite alarmingly,   it seems to be strewn with the dying embers   of a once-brilliant mind. Like its predecessor, The Enchantress of Florence (2008),   Luka and the Fire of Life niggles the reader   with memories of a magic lost. It is a sad   and uncomfortable feeling, as if the famous   Ocean of Notions is finally losing the battle   with Khattam-Shud, ldquo;the Prince of Silence   and the Foe of Speech rdquo;.  
	Luka begins with loss, as Haroun did. But here the loss is more terrifying, since Rashid Khalifa is threatened with the loss not just of his powers, but of life itself. As Rashid descends into a deep sleep from which he refuses to wake up, his embodied death, Nobodaddy, grows stronger, and 12-year-old Luka must journey across perilous waters with Nobodaddy to get the fire of life for his father. At one point in the novel, when Luka is struck by the similarity between his daddy and Nobodaddy, and almost begins to trust the latter, you think that this is about learning to get familiar with death, if not about loving it. But Rushdie spoils the moment by not following it up. As the novel progresses, and Luka gets nearer to his goal, Nobodaddy keeps losing his attractiveness till he becomes a cardboard villain who must be vanquished at the end for all things to be bright and happy again. Luka is full of such possibilities that are never realized. On the one hand, there looms a shadow over this novel that is darker than the one cast by the fatwa over Haroun. On the other, Rushdie seems determined to wish away the darkness by being cloyingly sweet, which Haroun never was. As a result, Luka moves between crests and troughs till it finally settles in the trough.   
	The problem with Luka is that, unlike his elder brother and his father, he is no old-fashioned lover of words. He is expert at playing video games, and so his quest for the fire has levels, save buttons and Terminators, which just have to be negotiated for the search to be successful. The fierce and angry battle between Gup (translated as gossip, or fib, the storytellers source of sustenance) and Chup (quiet, the end of stories) that made Haroun much more than mere childrens fiction is not there in Luka, making it rather glib. It is also too beatific at times, as when Luka has the revelation that his saviour and guide, the Insultana of Ott, actually has his mothers face. Moreover, since Lukas victory is foreordained, and Rushdie seems to be in no mood to spoil the thoughtless fun ever so slightly, one is strongly tempted to abandon the book midway.         
	Rushdie also stuffs Luka with unwanted information about mythical figures like the Sphinx, Menetius, Aphrodite or Prometheus (who is, of course, Lukas prototype) which creates the impression that the author has taken upon himself the task of enlightening his young readers. The catalogues of ancient gods can be quite exasperating, especially since they go on relentlessly, considerably loosening the narrative tension. When Luka is on the verge of stealing the fire, the talking squirrel, Ratatat, starts on a list of Fire Guards for Lukas edification: Spotted Kerberos, the fifty-headed dog of Greece and the former gatekeeper of the Underworld; Anzu, the Sumerian demon with the face and paws of a lion and an eagles claws and wings; the decapitated but still living head of the Nordic giant Mimir  and so on. Only an unexpressed desire to be an epic poet can make a modern-day author digress so at a crucial moment.         
	One senses Rushdies old spark in places, as when he makes the thin-skinned Border Rat say, If you prick us, we bleed, and then we make you bleed double, or when Luka ponders, Maybe dying was always like this: an argument between death and life. At one level, Luka is the book where the author-magician breaks the spell of his illusion once and for all, drowning his wand as he lets real life take over. The threat of Rashids death is more real than all the gaming that follows. The novel begins, and appears to end, in the moment when Rashid feels an unaccountable heaviness in his limbs that reduces him from the Shah of Blah to the Sleeping Beauty, only not so beautiful. As his father fades, Luka reflects on the World of Magic that Rashid had woven all through his life: It hadnt been real in the way that love was real, or unhappiness, or fear. It was only real in the way that stories were real while you were reading them, or heat mirages before you got too close to them, or dreams while you were dreaming. Admirers of Rushdie need not be alarmed since he is already on his next book, but Luka is, inadvertently perhaps, more a nod to mundane life and its companion, drab death, than to glittering and ageless looking-glass worlds.         
	It is appropriate that one of the most remarkable lines in a book about the fire of life should concern burning. When Lukas confidence in his fathers powers dips, Nobodaddy tries to lift his spirits by lecturing him thus: You of all boys should know that Man is the Storytelling Animal, and that in stories are his identity, his meaning and his lifeblood... Man alone burns with his books. The last line should assure one that the writer who has burned for his words can burn still, brilliantly.                           ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

	Something is better than nothing, although environment activists would not agree. The weak set of agreements in Cancun saved both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Mexican hosts of the latest conference from total embarrassment, but practical action remains up in the air. The United States of America is pleased, of course. Legally binding steps to reduce emissions are not part of these agreements. What has been achieved is a common platform on which industrialized countries and emerging economies say they can work together. The former will report annually on their emission cuts, while the latter once in two years. But with no figures or time-frames the target of cutting emissions down to 1990 levels in the foreseeable future, or containing global warming below two degrees celsius, seems unlikely. The agreement to fund developing countries for clean-energy technology and compensate them for protecting rainforests, however welcome, remains vague too. Figures have been quoted, but not the mechanism of the international funding pool, its contributors or principles of disbursal. Perhaps these will occupy the projected discussions before the 193 countries meet again next year in Durban.        
	One big evasion is the question of whether the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, with its emphasis on legally binding commitments, should be extended after it expires in 2012. The argument against this is that the US, India and China are not bound by it. Maybe the Cancun agreements have achieved something by getting everyone on board and verbally committed to action. But there is no way yet to stop countries from calmly reneging on their promises. India helped to get the agreements through, and made transparency a necessary condition of emission cutting efforts, although its conciliatory role may not be universally popular. No one has been made accountable for anything. The real bone of contention is intractable. Is it fair that after polluting the world, developed countries should want to impose an equal or almost equal burden of correction on the emerging nations, thus effectively blocking their development? But there has been enough time since 1997 for nations to address this question of political ethics and act responsibly, simply because the degradation of the environment puts the whole world at risk. The Cancun agreements have postponed that again.

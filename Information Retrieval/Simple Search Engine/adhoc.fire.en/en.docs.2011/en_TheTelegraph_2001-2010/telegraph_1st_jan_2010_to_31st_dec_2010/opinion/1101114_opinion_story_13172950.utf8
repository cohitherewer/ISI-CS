                              Similar note        
	 Lets call it human nature, and since our politicians (who might play demigod at times) are all too human, they could not resist the temptation of doing their bit to impress the Obamas. Take Milind Deora, the young Congress MP from south Mumbai. A major part of Deoras brief interaction with Barack Obama was spent discussing the blues. A keen guitarist, Deora has jammed with Buddy Guy, friend and idol of the US president. Then, at the state banquet for the Obamas, there was Kamal Nath, who took an unconscionably long time to greet the president. There was much derisive laughter in the long queue of people who awaited their turn when someone commented, He is offering his services to make highways in the US now that he has finished doing them in India. The only person who proved to be an exception was Didi. In her trademark crumpled sari and sandals, Mamata Banerjee did a quick namaste to the Obamas from a distance and plonked herself at the allotted table. Simple ways of humble folks?                              
	 But then, one should not read too much into anything, certainly not politics in Rabindrasangeet. That was Didis message to all those who turned to look at her when a professional singer at the capitals first sumptuous dinner party of the season, hosted by the Union minister of state for health, Dinesh Trivedi, broke into Ekla cholo re. The Union railways minister was enjoying her Thai curry. When the singer finished the song, Mamata Banerjee made a request for songs which would lend themselves to less controversial meanings. Did the singer find any?                            
	 When it comes to public conduct, women politicians have their own set of problems. Margaret Alva is no exception. The Uttarakhand governor feels distinctly uncomfortable when hugged by people, particularly senior party leaders like ND Tiwari, whose reputation is not exactly unblemished. Alva has cut down on her public engagements. Unfortunately, Tiwari hasnt. He even shared the stage with the saffronwallahs on Uttarakhands formation day.                            
	 Prithviraj Chavans elevation as the Maharashtra chief minister has caused a bit of disappointment to his constituency in Delhi  journalists covering the Congress, parliament, PMO, science, technology, atomic energy and other such things. They unanimously agreed that Chavan would be sorely missed. The genial Prithviraj never turned down a request for conversation and was always eager to explain the finer points, be it of politics or the N-deal. He was, however, not the only benefactor of the press. The media corps from Maharashtra based in Delhi used to receive Diwali gifts from the Maharashtra CM. Given the political uncertainty, the states PR department did not send out the customary gifts this time, in spite of, one is told, prodding from the outgoing CM, Ashok Chavan. The new incumbent, one hears, will make amends during Christmas time.                            
	 It is not surprising that in keeping with the great Indian family tradition, both Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan have followed in the footsteps of Sonia Gandhi and anointed their children as bearers of their political legacies. Prasad and Paswan have used the Bihar assembly elections to unveil their future plans. Tejaswi, Prasads son, has been seen working hard during the campaign and even scored a point by taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi. Prasad believes that a son who does not come to the aid of his father is no son at all. Meanwhile, Paswans son, Chirag, too was seen doing his bit. Unfortunately, he had to leave for his film shoots soon after campaigning in the first three phases. Perhaps the results will show if Chirag needs to kill his other career for the sake of a better one in politics.                            
	 Bollywood stars may swear by Yeh dosti, hum nahi todenge on screen, but off screen, they let their instincts take charge. Shilpa Shetty and Akshay Kumar were once thought to be dear friends  but not any more. At her casino-style house-warming party on Diwali, Shilpa Shetty Kundra dropped Akkie and wife, Twinkle, from the list of invitees. When asked why the star couple were not among the guests, Shilpa replied with a disarming smile that Akshay and Twinkle had not invited her either to their own Diwali bash. Tit for tat.

	 The Congress spokesperson, Mohan Prakash, got flak from the party high command for making a hero out of Rahul Gandhi. Prakash had compared Rahul with his own hero, Jayaprakash Narayan. JP was the symbol of the anti-Emergency movement and a virulent critic of Indira Gandhi. Worse, the Congresss opponents in the Bihar assembly elections, which provided the context for Prakashs sycophantic outpouring, are headed by JPs disciples  Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar. Prakash naturally attracted the ire of both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. Within hours of the comment, there were rumours of Prakash being axed. But a worse shock was in store for Prakash. On returning home that day, he apparently found that a short circuit had blown up his television set.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A place for love and hiccups
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A PLACE FOR LOVE AND HICCUPS                                  The prime minister is scheduled to meet the heads of a few leading cultural institutions in the city. So how are some of these iconic institutions faring?                                            
	I was dragging my feet as I entered the Indian Museum after almost three years. My experience last time of strolling round this world of shades, with its mildewed walls, heady smell of moth balls, and glass cases cloaked with dust, did not make me eager to retrace my steps. But once inside, I had the sneaky feeling that some things have changed inside the premises, and curiosity drove me on.        
	Most of the galleries on the ground floor looked less sooty than before. Even more surprisingly, the personnel on duty were not dozing or chatting among themselves, but were steadfastly staring ahead. Bawling children, cooing lovers, grumbling crones and rowdy young men could not disrupt their meditation. Taking a lesson from their book, I too decided to concentrate, but on the literature accompanying the exhibits rather than on nothingness. So in the Pottery section, I learnt that pots and shards were essential for reconstructing (sic) the history of mans struggle towards civilisation. Chiding myself for picking out typos even when I was not proofing copy, I hurried to the deserted Mineral room, and found some discoloured photographs of stones from Tamal Nadu. The reign of dust was obviously undisturbed in this place, possibly because this was one of the less-visited galleries.        
	Somebody must have hit upon the idea of enlivening the vault-like Geology section with gaily-painted flow charts. Whether the parti-coloured charts serve the aesthetic objective is debatable. But they certainly serve the educational purpose. They recreate the dcor of state government schools down to the last detail, including the usual spelling mistakes in the texts.        
	Renovation work is in full swing inside the museum, probably in preparation for the forthcoming bicentenary celebrations. Masons have carelessly draped the ancient statues standing on the aisles with dirty plastic sheets, which cover nothing but their heads. Making my way underneath the bamboo scaffoldings, I found myself in the Anthropology section. That the museum authorities do not have a bright view of human progress could be guessed from the darkness inside this gallery. The ancestors of modern man hunt, gather, or cook in gloomy, dimly-lit glass-covered niches. The entire north wall of the gallery was standing empty, probably waiting for the next mutation of homo sapiens.        
	I entered the Zoology gallery on the first floor with trepidation. The last time I was there, I had been appalled by the declarations of love scratched on the massive bones of mammals by numerous couples who have visited the museum over the years. I searched the skeleton of the Little Piked Whale for those signs of woe, but to my relief, they were not there. The bones have been bleached clean, it seemed. My joy over the erasure of love was short-lived. The gigantic jawbones of a whale that stand on the two sides of the entrance have now become a palimpsest etched with with passionate avowals of love, even for rum, as in the case of one called Mushku.        
	My last stop was the Bharhut Gallery, which I had found locked on my last visit. As soon as I closed the doors of this temperature-controlled room behind me, the dust and noise of the museum were shut off. In the enveloping silence, punctuated only by the soft clicking of the AC machine, I felt afraid even to breathe. I tiptoed past the imposing pillars and railings from Bharhut with friezes depicting episodes from the life of the Buddha in red sandstone. The yaksha-yakhshinis and dwarpalas from first century BC stared out from the panels, and yet their gaze was turned curiously inwards. I shivered in spite of myself. Time stood still, until the gallery door opened again to let in a young couple with a child who hiccuped at regular intervals, shattering the stillness.        
	On my way out, I found an intriguing combination of motion and passivity among the museum personnel. Most of them were scurrying about, but did not seem to know what they were supposed to do. In the room with the closed-circuit television sets, the lone female attendant was in a pensive mood, her eyes not on the screens but on the throng of visitors going up and down the stairs. The sweeper at the entrance diligently wiped one particular spot below the metal detectors, making them go crazy with beeping. As I was taking back my bag, the man at the counter remarked lazily that there is this usual hullabaloo every time some event takes place in the museum. Kichhudin porei thik hoye jabe (Things will be alright after a few days), he assured me.                          ANUSUA MUKHERJEE

	Futile battles                  
	Sir  The death of Swapan Koley, a student of commerce, and the severe damage to the eye of another student, Souvik Hazra  as a result of clashes between two rival political parties  are truly unfortunate (Comrades bring on the young, Dec 18). The incidents reassert the fact that 33 years of the Left Fronts rule have destroyed the healthy academic ambience of West Bengal. The politicization of academic institutions has ruined the education system. Now the situation seems to have gone out of hand. Given the manner in which the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, along with other ministers, grieved for the students, it might seem that they were more interested in further instigating campus violence than in preventing it. Their provocative speeches are likely to agitate students, and political clashes in colleges and universities may start again with renewed vigour. One suspects that Bhattacharjee and his party are trying to keep the educational environment of West Bengal unstable and chaotic in order to ensure their hold on the academic bodies of the state.          
	The governor, M.K. Narayanan, said that he was greatly worried about and deeply grieved by the recent episodes. He appealed to students to refrain from violence and said that campus clashes need to be put down with a firm hand. The governors words are to be applauded, but people expect such words to come from the chief minister too. Perhaps Bhattacharjee hopes to gain political mileage by blaming Mamata Banerjee for this dreadful situation. But as the head of the states administration, he cannot but be responsible for the disastrous law and order situation in West Bengal.           
	The Trinamul Congress member of parliament, Sudip Bandopadhyay, was probably right in suggesting that since the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has realized that its chances of winning the forthcoming elections are getting thinner, it is trying to mobilize its students force against Banerjee. The CPI(M) should stop making outrageous statements about campus violence as it will gain nothing from them any more.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Colleges and universities in West Bengal have their fair share of political fights, thanks to students unions. We have, during our stint at university, seen members of students unions engage in mud-slinging. However, a certain decorum was maintained, and at no point did difference of opinion lead to extreme animosity and violence, as it happens with the students unions today. What occurred in Andul and at Ashutosh College is shocking and condemnable.          
	Political parties have infiltrated students unions so deeply that the unions have turned into political units. The students who have been involved in the fights in the colleges and universities are hoodlums in the making. They lack the basic education to be able to accept other peoples political affiliations with grace.           
	Time and again, politicians in this country, along with their puppet-like followers, have made a mockery of the concept of parliamentary democracy, which is supposed to be a system based on parleying or on the thrashing out of differences through discussion, not on abuse. The recent incidents are not only a blot on the education system but also prove the disgraceful nature of our political leaders.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Ashutosh College incident reconfirms the futility of students politics. One fails to understand why young people engage in political squabbles, and destroy their own lives and careers in the process. Despite being educated and intelligent, they fail to realize that they are nothing more than pawns in the hands of politicians.          
	The recent fight between the two students unions of Ashutosh College injured a student who does not seem to owe allegiance to any political party. He became a victim of the mindless violence carried out in the name of politics. Students unions must understand that their foremost duty is to look after the welfare of the students. If the unions fail to fulfill their duties, they should be banned from all academic institutions. Aggression can never achieve anything constructive.          
	It seems that violence has become the norm in Calcutta. The peoples representatives instigate hatred among the people for their own political gains. One wonders why Calcuttans are so reluctant to protest against injustice. If we fail to assert our fundamental rights, incidents such as the one at Ashutosh College are bound to recur.                    
	Yours faithfully,

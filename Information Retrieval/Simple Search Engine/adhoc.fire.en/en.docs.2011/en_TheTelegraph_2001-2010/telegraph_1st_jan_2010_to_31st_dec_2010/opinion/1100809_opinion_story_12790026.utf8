	The passive voice is a mixture of things convenient, mysterious, evasive, flexible depending on the use to which it is put. The Supreme Court recently ruled that DNA tests in paternity cases should be ordered only when eminently needed. The question here is not only who will do the ordering but also who will decide on the eminence of the need. A lot turns on the latter because fathers need to be identified usually when the complaint is against an injustice done to a woman. But the Supreme Court stated clearly, in the context of a particular case, that a state womens commission could not order a DNA test. Here a woman had been fighting a matrimonial case against her husband, who had moved court to have his marriage annulled. But she also applied to the Orissa womens commission, alleging that he had dumped her after making her pregnant. The commission asked for a DNA test to establish who her childs father was, and a lower court had upheld that order. The Supreme Courts ruling puts 17 more such DNA tests that the OWC ordered in limbo. Among these is one relating to a paternity case against a Biju Janata Dal legislator. The ruling amounts to a clipping of the commissions wings.        
	Who is to decide whether knowing the identity of the father is eminently needed? The Supreme Court has warned against the possibility of bastardizing an innocent child in this search for truth, especially if the mother and her spouse were living together at the time of conception. The Supreme Courts sensitive appreciation of the possible social problems of a child from a broken or divided home is truly heartening. But it is disturbing to think that the OWC could also have thought those 17 DNA tests absolutely necessary, that the high number may not be an index of its casual attitude but an indicator at the rate at which women are exploited or abandoned or betrayed. No doubt the court in its wisdom has in mind the fine balance between the good of the child in society and justice for wronged women.

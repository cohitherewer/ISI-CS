The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | From terror to Tagore
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FROM TERROR TO TAGORE                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	British Councils Inter-School Drama Festival, presented now by the Central School of Speech and Drama (University of London), took off like a rocket with over 40 entries in just the second year of its new avatar. Whittled down to six, the prize-heavy final round showcased, laudably, institutions that have not had much visibility in previous editions. They touched upon a variety of topical issues, extremism topping the list as the concern of two schools. The eventual winners, Birla High (Boys), depicted an underworld demoralized by the decreasing arrival of natural deaths, because terrorism is killing people prematurely. St Helens (Howrah) highlighted the making of child soldiers forcibly drafted by insurgents. The crucial difference lay in treatment: Birla High were the only ones to employ humour consistently (for example, Yama rides  what else  a Yamaha), whereas the cast of St Helens was guilty of exaggeration approaching melodrama. Birla High could have perfected their act by connecting their fantastic and realistic subplots better.        
	Army Public School displayed a bickering motley gaggle of residents ultimately uniting against a promoter, in a parable about ethnically divided India. The landlords absence in the proceedings lost the play some credibility. I liked Techno India Groups difficult conceptualization of the marginal lives of hijras. Despite unnecessarily maudlin emoting by the lead actress, Pranjal Biyanis physical uninhibitedness stole the show as the same character at a younger age.        
	Tagore entered twice. Bidya Bharati dramatized Kshudhita Pashan and caught our attention as the only school to have a proper set (a painted and latticed medieval wall) and ensemble dancing (Kathak, see picture), but the dance continued too long, taking away from the suspense. Shri Shikshayatan staged a reality contest quite convincingly, on Tagores use of Western music. The heroines fascination for Western culture and her transformation received a measured portrait from Shalini Sen. However, I would still agree with her father that our children first need an education on Indian arts, which they lack.        
	Some general comments. Often at such events, participants reuse common techniques that therefore look more clichd through repetition in close succession. Army Public, St Helens and Techno India all resorted to flashback, detracting from their inventiveness. Something else that rarely works in school theatre is narrative voiceovers linking scenes. As for performances, I noticed those banes of acting  wild gesturing (not knowing what to do with ones arms) and random shuffling (ditto for ones legs). Centrals workshop facilitators should come in earlier during the process to remove these basic shortcomings.

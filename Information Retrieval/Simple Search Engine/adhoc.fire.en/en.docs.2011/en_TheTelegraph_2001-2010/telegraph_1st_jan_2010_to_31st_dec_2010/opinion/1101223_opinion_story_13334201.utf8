	An identity card is an imperative here, issued by the State, and to be carried at all times. This has been the rule since Mao. Yet, despite decades of strict implementation, a teenage student lost almost a year in jail for a crime committed by someone else of the same name. Though he was compensated to the tune of 23,000 yuan (Rs 1.5 lakhs), he hasnt yet recovered from the traumatic experience.         
	The 17 year old  called Wang  first came into contact with the police two years back, when he was just 15. He did commit a crime  selling stolen goods on the request of a classmate who had dropped out of school. The classmate was arrested for a series of burglaries, but he told the police that he had stolen only a few pieces of jewellery, and had asked his young friend to sell them. Wang was picked up, but because of his age, he was let off after his father paid a fine.         
	However, the police didnt give up investigating the case, and soon his classmate was confessing to all his robberies. The latter told the police he had stolen a mobile phone along with Wang  but forgot to tell them that this was a security guard named Wang. The police swooped down on the 15-year-old Wang while he was at an internet cafe. All his protests went unheeded. He was threatened, assaulted, his classmates testimony was read out to him and he was forced to repeat it. This was then recorded as his confession.         
	This went on for three days, but Wang continued to insist that he wasnt the one they wanted. In vain did he try to convince the police that his classmate had another friend called Wang. Finally, on the fourth day, the police told him that if he confessed, he could go home. He did  and was immediately put on trial. Two months later, he was sentenced to two years in prison.         
	It was while serving his sentence that he met the dropout whod committed the burglaries. As soon as the latter realized what had happened, he informed the police. After an internal report was prepared, the police allowed Wang to meet his parents. They sought legal relief, and a retrial was held. He was declared innocent and released, after having spent seven months in jail for a crime he didnt commit.                 
	Identity crisis        
	The story doesnt end there. It wasnt easy for Wang to go back to school. As part of his punishment, he had been made to publicly confess in three different schools, stand on stage and read out a statement that started with the words, Ive been stealing since I was a child, and was also made to describe other crimes he had never committed. This was supposed to be a deterrent to other students. Poor Wang wept while reading it; the police looked on approvingly, thinking he was beset by remorse. It didnt seem to act as much of a deterrent Wang told a newspaper that the assembled students laughed as he read out his confession. I really wanted to die then, he said.         
	Unlike in India, the story isnt entirely hopeless. The policemen responsible were punished, though not as much as they should have been. Two of them lost their bonuses, were suspended from duty and sent for internal training. The others were subjected to internal criticism. Wangs parents are trying to appeal for more compensation. But will that help Wang recover?         
	Whats interesting is that this story was published in the official China Daily so as not to expose police brutality, but to advise students to give their children unique names. And at least one response was from a man whod been denied a new electricity connection for not having paid his previous bills, and also congratulated for his ability by envious friends whod heard he had married again. Both times, the culprit was a namesake.

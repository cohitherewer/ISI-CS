The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Something quite different
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT                                  this above all   khushwant singh                        Much loved				                                       
	Asked Shakespeare, Whats in a name? And himself replied, nothing, because a rose with any other name will smell as sweet. He had not travelled abroad, nor had he known any other language besides English. Unfortunately, a word or a name in one language can mean something quite different in another. The latest victim of double meaning is our much-loved chief minister of Delhi, Sheila Dikshit. Dikshits are high caste Brahmins. In English slang, the name can be broken into two words, dik shit  which mean birds droppings (beeth). So an ill-mannered Kiwi commentator mocked Dikshit by pronouncing her name in his own way. Our government lodged a protest with the New Zealand high commissioner in New Delhi. He tendered an abject apology.        
	It reminded me of a similar incident. I was in Stockholm to attend a meeting when I met a Professor Lund, who was about to leave for India on a lecture tour. He came to me to get some tips about my country. After answering his questions, I warned him: Dont be surprised if some of your audience break into smiles or snigger when you are introduced.        
	Why?        
	Because in Hindustani, your name means Professor Penis.        
	Ah so! he exclaimed, I am glad you told me. Only last month, I had to escort a lady professor from your country around Swedish universities. Her name was Professor Das.        
	Das is a common surname in India, I said.        
	In Swedish, das means shit.                
	Not human                
	Two small townships 
  Muree in Pakistan and Kasauli 
  in India
  What is that common to both?
  Both hill resorts of repute, right;
  But says the geologist there is more
  to it
  Than mere scenic charm of
  the hills:
  Same the rocks theyre
  founded on,
  Common their basin of
  deposition
  And same their geological
  age 
  Some 20-odd million years.
  The common ricks of shale, 
  sandstone
  Though assigned different 
  geological names
  As Kasauli and Muree 
  Formations
  Extend from Kasauli to
  Muree, uninterrupted 
  For no less than four 
  hundred kilometres 
  No LOC for them, no 
  barbed wire fence either
  Along the border of India
  and Pakistan
  Because they are rocks, stones
  Not human beings!

	Being the father                 
	God decided to encourage people to have less children and introduced an award scheme. At one point during the ceremony, he concentrated on the situation in India:        
	He first met Jawaharlal Nehru in heaven, and asked him how many children he had had during his time on earth. Nehru replied, Only one!        
	Indira Gandhi was next, and god asked her the same question. She replied she had had two children, and god thought, not too bad, and he gave Indira a BMW.        
	Sometime later, both Nehru and Indira were going around in their new cars, and they saw Mahatma Gandhi on foot. Wondering what went wrong, they asked the Mahatma why god hadnt been merciful with him.        
	The Mahatma replied in disgust: God did not even ask me! Some idiots had told him that I was the Father of the Nation!

	For Punjabis only                
	Colonel V.K. Naroola has sent me his contribution, which only Punjabi speakers will be able to understand. My apologies to those who do not know Punjabi:        
	Punjabi is a mathematical language!

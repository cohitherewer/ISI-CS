The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | To open the games
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TO OPEN THE GAMES                                                    
	Lazy minds love tempests in a bathtub. Witness the meaningless controversy over who should open the Commonwealth Games soon to start in New Delhi. The very name of the event should make the name of the inaugurator obvious, but there are Indians who love to quarrel with the obvious. The Commonwealth Games should be declared open by the head of the Commonwealth. This happens to be Queen Elizabeth, the reigning monarch of Great Britain. If, for some reason, Queen Elizabeth is unable to attend the opening ceremony  as is the case with the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi  her delegate should do the honours and read out her address. Queen Elizabeth is well aware of this and her son and heir is representing her at the opening ceremony, and he is prepared to read out the address. But this simple and logical procedure appears as a slight to some patriotic Indians whose stock-in-trade is a spurious anti-colonialism. Their contention is that in the absence of the head of the Commonwealth, the head of the Indian State should declare the Commonwealth Games open. This position does not stand up to the scrutiny of logic.        
	It is entirely fortuitous that it is Indias turn this time round to host the Commonwealth Games. As the country hosting the Games, India has no special rights that prevail over those of the other participating countries. Thus, the head of any other participating country has as much right as the head of the Indian State to declare the Commonwealth Games open. Some stowaway ideology should not be allowed to confuse this simple issue. India belongs to the Commonwealth. This was decided when India became independent as a proud republic. India thus accepted a monarch as the head of the community of nations that makes up the Commonwealth. This fact of history cannot be undone by claiming that the president of India should open the Commonwealth Games. As long as the Commonwealth exists in its present avatar, its head or a representative of the head has the right to open the Commonwealth Games. The Games in New Delhi have had enough mud and controversy smeared on them even before they have begun. What is least needed is a pointless debate about who should start the Games off. History has already decided on this matter and let it remain that way without any interference from any distant cannonade.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A story well told, but lacking a soul
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A STORY WELL TOLD, BUT LACKING A SOUL                                  DANCE: Kathakali Jana                                                  
	A dance drama, as we understand it, is a synthesis of various art forms such as storytelling, dance, music, pantomime, mimicry and spectacle. And, as with any mishmash of diverse elements, success lies in the seamless balance of these essentials in an expressive whole. Judging by these parameters, one might say that Barnali Mitras recent presentation, Soundaryalahari, staged at the Rabindranath Tagore Centre, accomplished its objective. Well, it did so, if only upto a point.        
	The linear narrative of the life of the 8th-century Indian saint, Adi Shankaracharya, enlightened those had played truant in their history classes. The story of the philosophers propagation of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, after the word of god was revealed to him on Mount Kailash, came alive in Mitras production. His journeys to acquire, and later impart knowledge and to engage in philosophical polemics in order to establish his doctrine, were brought home. It is to Mitras credit that she chose a difficult subject for a dance drama and proceeded to interpret it in her own way.        
	Mitra was ably assisted by dancers, musicians and singers, who helped her achieve a happy equilibrium of song and verse, melody, dance and expressiveness. Tejendra Narayan Majumdars music and Anindya Duttas script and narration were effective in exploring the rather complex theme. The dance languages oscillated between Mitras own, Odissi, and Kathakali, with Kalamandalam Piyal fleshing out the character of the Shankaracharya with grace and dignity in the latter form. Efficient light arrangement raised the bar of the presentation.        
	Left to the performers, the narrative might have flowed smoothly, without a hitch. But that was not to be. Technical poverty crept in as soon as undue importance was placed on the element of spectacle and stagecraft. The crude device of having syllables in the Devanagari script manipulated with threads on stage did not add much to the production value, and seemed like a stupid exercise that the crew was distinctly uncomfortable with.        
	The video depiction of the Shankaracharyas long journey through obstacle-laden terrains (with close-up shots of his face revealing the same degree of clean-shavenness throughout) was stretched, monotonous and entirely unnecessary. A less awkward way of saying the same thing would certainly have helped. Lastly, having named the production Soundaryalahari, it was as though Mitra had undertaken to base her work on a collection of 100 hymns attributed to the Shankaracharya, 49 of which he is said to have memorized on Mount Kailash and the remaining 51 he had composed. But the work did not go beyond touching upon a couple of these hymns. That too, perfunctorily.         
	And so, the capable storytelling apart, the presentation remained somewhat devoid of spiritual content. Mitra would do well to infuse her work with more of a soul.

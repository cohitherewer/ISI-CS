The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Worries amidst hope
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WORRIES AMIDST HOPE                                  Fifth Column -Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	A recent article in the Financial Times talked about the grim situation in the job market on both sides of the Atlantic. This may not have a direct bearing on India. Nevertheless, one should not be too optimistic, given the economic, political and diplomatic turmoil that is likely to affect the Indian diaspora and Indias quest for a place on the diplomatic high table.        
	It is important to clarify the present plight in the West. Citing one fact will be enough in this context. All 16 users of the euro, and all 27 members of the European Union, have witnessed surging unemployment. In Asia, the most visible sign of decay could be of Tokyos flagship company, Japan Airlines, which is getting ready to file for bankruptcy protection. The other Asian financial giant, Singapore, has suffered a 13.5 per cent fall in container business, despite being the worlds busiest container port.        
	Amidst the financial turmoil afflicting developed economies, comes the unprecedented news that China  the sick man of the 1930s and 1940s  and India  the poster boy of stagnant growth  have reversed the recent negative trends in the global economy. China is set to overtake Germany as the worlds leading exporter. India, which has often been described as an exotic destination, is also expected to achieve a four-fold growth in motor trade by 2016. Moreover, India also boasts of universities, white-collar jobs, research and development laboratories, shopping malls as well as numerous high-profile industrial conglomerates.With a boom in segments such as the automobile sector, telecommunication, and IT, India suddenly looks like the promised land among English-speaking countries.                
	Take care        
	However, the hype surrounding India  reflected in popular slogans like India Shining, Superpower India, and so on  is unlikely to deliver positive results for the members of the diaspora who are now being threatened by a sluggish global economy and an equally sombre job market.         
	Indeed, matters may take a turn for the worse for this country as it strives to acquire big business projects located in the developed world with the help of home-grown entrepreneurs such as the Tatas, Mittals, Ambanis, Birlas, and so on. Thus, in one stroke, the economic engine is likely to shift from Boston to Bangalore or Georgia to Gurgaon. This is likely to be followed by a role reversal of sorts: students studying abroad may invade the classrooms of Indias education institutions during the day and hold part-time jobs at night. The locals would then resent their defeat in the labour market and the education system.         
	Thus, the four factors that are required for economic output  land, labour, capital and organization  seem to be going Indias way. Students are returning for education, and to be a part of the countrys labour market. Indian entrepreneurs are also buying land in other countries, investing in foreign capital and are poised to take over some global business organizations in the near future. However, the downturn continues unabated in the global market. There is also the news that an Indian company is supposed to acquire two Australian aviation firms. All this makes one wonder what is in store for members of the Indian diaspora on foreign soils.         
	As is well known, India does not produce combat or civil aircraft. The fact that an Australian company, owned by an Indian firm, is likely to meet this need is fascinating. Yet, such developments can have dire consequences for Indians living abroad. Indians abroad need to wait and watch. Else, an economic slump in a developed nation can have unpleasant consequences for them.

	Scratch the surface and all sorts of unseemly things crawl out. The properties of those who left for Pakistan after its war with India in 1965 were given in charge of the Indian government as custodian by the Enemy Property Act, 1968. In 2005, however, the Supreme Court ordered the custodian to return the property of the raja of Mehmoodabad, who had become a Pakistani citizen, to his son and legal heir, who had always been an Indian citizen. This was the crucial scratch. Apparently unnerved by the number of claims from allegedly legal heirs within the country to property taken over by the government and then leased or rented out, the government issued an ordinance last July that annulled the court order. It allowed the custodian to repossess the property returned to the rajas heir. There is an embarrassing ugliness in this that has not been ameliorated by subsequent events. In the first place, an ordinance is reserved for pressing issues of governance that need to be acted upon when Parliament is not in session. The government obviously felt that this issue was of prime importance. Why? Second, the ordinance overturned a Supreme Court order. Encroaching on the judiciarys territory is the last thing the executive should be doing if it is at all concerned about the health of this democracy.        
	The unseemly realities behind the issuing of the ordinance were further exposed when objections to it prompted the government to bring in the enemy property (amendment and validation) bill, 2010. This allowed legal Indian inheritors of enemy property to reclaim their due, but also declared that leaseholders rights would be protected. Faced with this mysterious bill, the Bharatiya Janata Party and groups of traders are insisting on the return of the ordinance, while leaders such as Mulayam Singh Yadav and Lalu Prasad claim that the ordinance is anti-Muslim. Unnerved all over again, the government has postponed turning it into a law till the winter session. So the ordinance could not be ratified within the mandatory six months. The government must decide whether it wants to look spiteful and greedy and retain control of the properties  and consequent revenues  of those Indian citizens whose only fault is that their fathers have left for Pakistan, or whether it will be a fair, democratic and secular government and follow the direction the Supreme Court pointed out in 2005.

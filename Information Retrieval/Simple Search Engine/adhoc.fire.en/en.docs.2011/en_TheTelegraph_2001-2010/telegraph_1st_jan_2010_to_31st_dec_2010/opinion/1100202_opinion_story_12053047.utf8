	There is nothing unreal about the confusion over who the real chief minister of Meghalaya is. Illusion and reality have long been part of politics in a state where party-hopping is always setting new records. The confusion over the states chief minister is thus an extension of the perennial dilemma of knowing which party a leader belongs to. The same leader could be with three different parties between breakfast and dinner, as a leader of a tribal community so aptly put it. And, all this is done in the name of political stability. Even this time, the elevation of a fourth leader to the rank of the chief minister is sought to be justified by the same logic. The real reason, though, is no secret. D.D. Lapang, the chief minister of the Congress-led coalition government, is an insecure man. The only way he can hope to foil threats to his position is by offering his rivals equal privileges, if not equal power. Not that the ploy works, because few governments in the state have survived their full terms; but Meghalayas politicians obviously know no better.         
	It would be unfair to the people of Meghalaya to suggest that they get the kind of leaders they deserve. It cannot be the peoples fault that their leaders violate their trust so brazenly. But it certainly is the business of ordinary people to cry halt to this vicious process. Mr Lapang belongs, at least for now, to the Congress, the biggest and oldest political party in the country. Holding onto power in a small state at any cost cannot do the Congresss image any good. The sham that goes on in the name of politics in Meghalaya can have very damaging consequences both for the state and for democracy. Meghalaya is one state in the Northeast that has been free from large-scale militancy. But if the people lose faith in their elected politicians and in the democratic institutions, a dangerous void can be created. The Congress leadership cannot afford to treat the game in Meghalaya as an insignificant matter in a distant outpost.

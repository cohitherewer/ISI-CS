	Pervez Modys first appearance in Calcutta at the fundraiser concert for the Calcutta Chamber Orchestra was presented at the ICCR auditorium on December 1. He began with a selection from Chopin, which was introduced by a witty speech by the governor, M.K. Narayanan. Modys formidable education  the Moscow Conservatory and University of Music Karlsruhe  has resulted in a strong and articulate technique. The first part of the concert began with the Scherzo No 1, Opus 20. Was it the acoustics of this auditorium, the lack of resonance in the old, but well-tuned, Steinway baby-grand, or perhaps the apparent youthfulness of the pianist that brought it just this side of very good? The electrifying brilliance of that opening chord, and the nano-moment of suspense before the floodgates open on the next phrase, were somehow missing. Our pianos certainly hold a few cruel surprises for pianists. The tudes that followed were played with brilliance, including the ever-popular Revolutionary. The three mazurkas, next, were executed with style, if rather hastily. Then came two waltzes  Opus 70, No 1 and the Posthumous No 2. They were interpreted with emotion and a little too much rubato; the pedalling was faultless.        
	After the break, the Calcutta Chamber Orchestra assembled to perform the Concerto No 1 Opus 11 by Chopin. There has been a great improvement in the CCO: in the bowing discipline, the concentration of the players, and the intonation, which was almost there. Yet,the CCO isnt quite ready for the vast interpretative knowledge required to tackle this concerto, though tackle it they did and almost brought it off, but for some scary moments. Modys confident and heroic performance kept it together despite a slip or two at the cliff-hanger end. With continued help, there is hope for this ensemble.        
	On the second day, Pervez played a mostly Scriabin recital at the Calcutta School of Music auditorium. Mody delivered a sensitive Scriabin and his Prelude for the Left Hand was beautiful. On December 3, Mody conducted a masterclass at CSM with a few students of varying ages and levels. Outstandingly promising was Ritayan Biswas, a student of Kaushik Das. In spite of a number of nervous slips and wrong notes, Biswas produced a clear and sincere interpretation of Chopins Nocturne in E. The final performer of the evening was the very young Kanishka Saha. A pupil of Surendranath Majumdar, he riveted listeners with three pieces from the Grade III examination repertoire. Modys teaching skills were laced with humour, energetic illustrations, and a judicious use of limited time. A larger audience of teachers and students would have gained hugely from the experience.

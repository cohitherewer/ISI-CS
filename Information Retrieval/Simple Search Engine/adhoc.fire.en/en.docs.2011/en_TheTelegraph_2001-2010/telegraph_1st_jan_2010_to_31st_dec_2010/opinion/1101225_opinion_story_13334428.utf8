	Important lessons                  
	Sir  In Remarkable moments of real education (Dec 19), Amartya Sen expresses his gratitude towards Tapas Majumdar who introduced him to a critical understanding of economic theory. Sen also mentions Majumdars ability to inspire intellectual self-confidence which is essential to instil creativity among students. At a time when the state of West Bengal is being threatened with intellectual bankruptcy, Sens eloquent piece will hopefully inspire the authorities to undertake measures to revive Bengals glorious intellectual tradition.           
	Yours faithfully,         Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge
        
	Common woes          
	Sir  Ramachandra Guha has highlighted the curious symmetry that binds the reputations of Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh (Prophets outcast, Dec 18). Obama and Singh, two of the most important leaders in the world today, have had to face criticism in their respective nations and both men now have a task on their hands. Obama came into power when the United States of America was going through one of its worst economic crises, and he tried to improve the situation. It is not easy to become the president of the US or to travel from one nation to another to create jobs for the people back home. But Obama has demonstrated a hands-on approach and should be praised for his efforts. Given his middle-class background, he will surely address the grievances of the people concerned.           
	Manmohan Singh has been the epitome of honesty and integrity since he became the prime minister. But in a country like ours, he is truly a good man among thieves. Singh has had to put up with the constraints of a coalition government, while taking action against tainted colleagues. But the people expected Singh to be firmer in his approach in this regard. Hopefully, Singh and Obama will emerge stronger from the crises. Both of them are inspirational figures and the world needs them to make it a better place.           
	Yours faithfully,

	In a mess   
	Sir  I would like to draw attention to the poor condition of the website managed by the Indian Railways that has inconvenienced a number of people.           
	I was part of a large group of eleven people who had decided to travel to Jammu on the night of December 21 by the Himgiri Express. The train was supposed to leave the station at 11.55 pm. Not everyone in the group possessed confirmed tickets. As a result,we decided to check the PNR status of the unconfirmed tickets on the website of Indian Railways regularly as well as the departure time of the train we were supposed to travel in.           
	On the day of the journey, we discovered that all our tickets had been confirmed and that the train was supposed to depart at the appointed hour. Accordingly, we made our way to Howrah station. On reaching Howrah, we were informed that the train had been re-scheduled. The new departure time that was announced was 1.25 in the afternoon on the following day.           
	As a result of the irresponsible conduct on the part of the railways, we had to cancel our bookings for the hotels and transport that had been arranged at the spots we were supposed to visit.           
	Hopefully, the railways authorities will wake up and take necessary corrective steps. The people are facing a number of problems but they seem not to be raising their voice.                     
	Yours faithfully,

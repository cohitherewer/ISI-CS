	Raza, Souza, Husain. If the dictates of the market are taken seriously, that should be the latest pecking order of the top three contemporary Indian artists. The great determinant is the prices the three have fetched in the last international auction. Both Gaitonde and Tyeb Mehta, who ruled the roost for a brief period, are nowhere in the reckoning.        
	Born in 1922, Syed Haider Raza has lived in France since 1950, his home being Paris. Born in Madhya Pradesh, Raza has maintained strong ties with India and he continues to use motifs, concepts and ideas that have a strong Indian identity. His exhibition of recent works (S.H. Raza, July 03-21) at Akar Prakar proved that he is strongly rooted in the ethos of this country. In fact, it is quite strange how very Indian he has remained in spite of all those years in foreign climes. When one speaks to this soft-spoken artist, he still talks about his childhood in Babaria village, the river Narmada and the two great Indian epics as if it was yesterday.        
	His paintings, too, have not altered much ever since he began to create his famous bindus and his variations on forms that combined geometry with some motifs that are identifiably of Indian origin, long before artists of a much younger generation here and abroad appropriated them. This show had its fair share of those bindus, mercifully relieved by other images as well.        
	Razas paintings have a certain aura, enhanced by the brilliant colours he often uses. Many of these works are on paper, and although he freely uses triangles and circles intersecting each other it is clear from the combination of indigo, cobalt blue, sap green, vermilion and yellow  colours that have been used down the ages in Indian art of all kinds, from miniatures to paatachitra  that they are meant to be meditations on the essence of life and form (picture).         
	One giant black bindu is like the eclipsed moon with clouds floating across its face. It is counterbalanced by red, orange and blue on three sides and a cool grey on the fourth. In the middle of this dark space is a tiny grey bindu, creating a sense of equipoise. In another painting, the linga floats in a void defying the pull of the earth. Prakriti pulsates with hot colours contrasted with darker shades. A red and a white circle are positioned like street lights, without the green though. In Naga, the cosmic serpent is represented as a series of concentric circles brooding over a turbulent surface of swift brushstrokes. Whatever the variations, they are circles nonetheless.         
	Unlike Husain who has a restless mind and is never content to repeat himself for long, flitting from one idea to another like a bee diving into various beds of pollen, Razas talent is of the more pensive and contemplative kind, repeating forms in various contexts and colours like classical musicians weaving a melodic pattern by reiterating certain phrases, each time with subtle inflections and variations. Some of our great singers can execute this brilliantly. Raza tends to be bromidic at times.         
	In this exhibition, however, Raza was more adventurous. He uses calligraphy in Devanagari and Roman scripts as well as in two works, although in the latter the result is posterish. Moreover, has not the appeal for peace been done to death? The exhibition featured some outstanding paintings as well, particularly the vertical ones in which he breaks out of the mould and uses colours and bold brush strokes with a great sense of liberation without sparing much thought for conventions. Going by their titles, some of these works have an erotic stimulus, but even that does not matter much for they are suggestive of landscapes and flowers and states of mind in a style that may be reminiscent of Rabindranaths paintings in dark shades with the occasional bursts of red or yellow.

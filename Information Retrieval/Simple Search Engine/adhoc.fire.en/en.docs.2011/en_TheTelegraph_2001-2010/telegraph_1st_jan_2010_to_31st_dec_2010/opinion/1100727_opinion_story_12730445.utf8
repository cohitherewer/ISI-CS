	Bijan Kumar Tudu, an intern at the Calcutta Medical College, is a Santhal from Chandrarekha village in West Midnapore. He was young when he came to live in Haldia, and that helped him access mainstream education and merge with urban society. For most in his village, formal education and urban life are distant notions. As distant as Tudus village is from the urban mind  no metal roads, very little use of electricity, a primary school for which teachers have been appointed but no building has been erected: something out of a Garcia Marquez novel. Tudu, understandably, is wary of government efforts to develop his village.        
	His words resonated with mistrust: Its all a game of vote banks. Preservation of tribal cultures and all... just to distract us from the real questions. The government wants to confine us to little pockets and play on our demands to get votes. Although, with an afterthought, he added that a genuine effort to preserve tribal cultures may not be a bad thing, if only that includes a sincere drive to give the tribal populations a better life  food, hygiene, basic amenities and sustained education. Preserving tribal people as specimens cannot help them, Tudu said. It is not that only we have a culture to preserve. Every race has its own culture and each preserves it in its own way. What can the government do about it? It should try instead to give us a decent life so that we can fight the social bias against us and make our own choices.        
	Only 10 of the 76 seats reserved for scheduled tribes have been filled in Tudus college. The quota system only works for those who can cross the threshold of primary education on their own... but most tribals dont even know about quotas. How will one who goes hungry every other night think of education, he asked. I asked if he thought urbanization was necessary for them. Is there a choice? he retorted. If the tribal people had their own system and resources... that would be a different world. But in this world one has to come to the city and get formal education to lead a good life.        
	The Santhals were once like the Jarawas, locked in their own world, before they were introduced to TV and cars. What a Santhal has gained by breaking out of that world into the mainstream is a difficult question. One is reminded of Chuni Kotal, a tribal woman who committed suicide in 1992 after being subjected to years of casteist discrimination in the city, and of the frightened faces of the aboriginal children in the Indian Residential Schools in Canada.        
	Now the question is should the Jarawas be preserved as museum pieces or should there be a policy to drastically mainstream them. This debate is a glaring example of the arrogance of the majority. Culture cannot be preserved in a glass jar. Besides, it is not for the State but for the tribes to decide how they want to be developed. Instead of feeling smug about giving Jarawa children the gift of a civilized world, the givers should ponder who has encroached upon whose civilization.                    ADHEESHA SARKAR

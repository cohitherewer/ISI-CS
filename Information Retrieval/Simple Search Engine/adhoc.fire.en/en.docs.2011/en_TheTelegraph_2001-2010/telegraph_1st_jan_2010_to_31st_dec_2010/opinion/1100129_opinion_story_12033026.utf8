	A DEAD HAND : A CRIME IN CALCUTTA By Paul Theroux, Hamish Hamilton, Rs 399        
	Lawrence Durrell once wrote, A city becomes a world when you are in love with one of its inhabitants. So it was with Darley, Justine and Alexandria in his Alexandria Quartet. So it was with Alain, Maitreyi and Calcutta in Mircea Eliades Bengal Nights. So it was with the two unnamed lovers and Saigon in Marguerite Durass The Lover. And so it is with Jerry Delfont, Mrs Unger and Calcutta in A Dead Hand, except that it is not love as much as lust in this case.        
	And who is a better person to explore the layered, textured worlds of Calcutta than Paul Theroux, with his sniperscopic travel writers eye, his deliciously crabby worldview, and his precise, astringent prose?        
	The book operates on many levels  love story, crime thriller, literary novel, a book on a city. Jerry Delfont, an ageing travel writer, lands up in Calcutta in search of a story that will open up his writers block (or dead hand, as Theroux creepily describes it). Here he meets the sensuous Mrs Unger, one of those American do-gooders whose mission is to rehabilitate street children, and he becomes obsessed with her. She toys with him, and tempts him into a sinister scheme of her own, until he suddenly discovers more than she had intended him to. The story is pure Theroux.        
	The first thing to notice about A Dead Hand, perhaps, is that the reader suddenly sees Calcutta, as if for the first time, through Therouxs eyes  though it is unlikely that his observations will earn him any popularity. Consider this: Other cities are well-cemented and engineered, all seamless surfaces. Calcutta was roughly plastered and painted; the Corinthian columns, the Ionic capitals, the rounded balusters and porticos, and much else that seemed like marble was really white-washed wood. It was not beautiful, but its handmade look gave it a human face.        
	He can be clinically cruel:  the lopsided designs, the mismatched joints, the tottering staircases. Nothing was square, nothing was plumb. Peering closely at this bulging and buckling city I saw the hasty joinery, the hardened putty, the rusty nails, and I thought: a barefoot man did that with an old hammer in his skinny hand.        
	But at other times a hard-bitten affection shows through: One of the many things I love about Calcutta is its Victorian texture. Not just the grandiose architecture, but the people, too. Women need chaperones. They dont marry for love. Dr Mukherjee is a Victorian figure. His mustache is dated. Even the words he uses. Repository. Blighter. Mountebank.        
	Theroux takes us into some of Calcuttas familiar nooks and corners such as the Roxy Bar and the New Cathay restaurant  The Oly Pub on Park Street I liked for being scruffy, and its seediness matched my mood. I indulged myself in the most un-Indian of activities, eating Olys beefsteak. At other times he is more elliptical, and one has to just guess that the Hastings Hotel, where Jerry is staying, is actually the Lytton; or that the Fairlawn Hotel, where that wonderful scene with the visiting Paul Theroux takes place, is actually the Kenilworth.        
	Theroux has always been a marvellously playful author. In My Other Life he entertained his readers with a fictional character called Paul Theroux, who has written a book called The Great Railway Bazaar, and who treads an ambiguous line between fact and fiction. And here, in A Dead Hand, Theroux plays a kind of post-modern trick by suddenly introducing himself into the narrative to have tea with his protagonist at the Fairlawn. Paul Theroux and Jerry Delfont, two middle-aged travel writers, one very successful and the other a hack, spar and feint with each other, as authors probably do in real life. Theroux patronizes Delfont, and tries to pump him for information, then abruptly leaves. He had made a reputation out of fooling other people, yet he didnt fool me grumbles Delfont after Theroux is gone. He made me confront myself, my failure, as he flashed back my reflection in the writers mirror he hid behind I knew that he would write about me, about meeting me, and that hed get everything wrong.        
	A Dead Hand is an intensely visual book and reading it one can almost see a movie play inside ones head. It would be directed by Peter Weir, Therouxs favourite director. Or maybe Mira Nair. The music would be by Ravi Shankar and Peter Gabriel. Tommy Lee Jones would be Jerry Delfont. Jessica Lange could have made a good Mrs Unger if only she was slightly younger. The exotic Parvati  a danseuse, a poet and a kalaripayyatu expert  may be played by Kajol or Bipasha Basu. And, of course, Paul Theroux would be Paul Theroux.        
	But the most important issue with the casting is, who would be the cameraman? For it is the city of Calcutta that is the real heroine of the film, or the book. Which cameraman could do justice to the task of capturing her scabrous, luminous beauty?                          ANVAR ALIKHAN

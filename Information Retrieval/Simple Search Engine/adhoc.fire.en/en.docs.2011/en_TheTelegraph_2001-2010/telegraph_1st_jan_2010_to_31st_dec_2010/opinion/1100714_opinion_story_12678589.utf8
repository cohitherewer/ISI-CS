                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DIGNITY FIRST                                                    
	One of the most unedifying aspects of the present United Progressive Alliance government is the propensity of some of its members to squabble with each other. The most recent example is the public spat between Kamal Nath, Union minister of road transport and highways, and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. A little earlier than that, a minister of state went on a rant against the secretaries in his department. Even more astounding was a cabinet ministers refusal to attend cabinet meetings because she did not quite approve of some of the decisions being taken by the cabinet. Instances can be multiplied. These are not good indicators about the status and prestige of the government. They reveal that even the basic norms of a cabinet form of government are not being followed. Ministers are saying and doing whatever they want with scant regard for what their words and deeds do to the dignity of the government. A confrontation between a minister and a mandarin, or a ministers public criticism of the bureaucracy, can only lower the dignity of the government and erode its credibility.        
	It would also appear from his silence that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, is not taking sufficient cognizance of the matter. He should remember that any diminution in the status of the government is actually a reflection on himself as he epitomizes the government. Mr Singhs characteristic reticence and politeness about speaking firmly to his colleagues may not be the best instruments to counter and quell this growing drift towards indiscipline. Mr Singh is perhaps assuming, completely erroneously, that most of his cabinet colleagues are as conscious of the dignity of office as he himself is. Very few members of the political class carry themselves with as much dignity as Mr Singh does. His humility makes him see his colleagues in his own image. The time has come to talk down to them and to tell them that at the heart of the cabinet system of government, and of democracy, is a set of norms and conventions, most of them unwritten. These have to be learnt, respected and followed. The alternative to this is a form of lumpenization that will destroy democracy. This is the only way that the prime minister can restore order and discipline in his house. If to do this he has to act as the head prefect rather than as the prime minister, so be it.

	The Taste of Sorrow By Jude Morgan, Headline, Rs 350        
	Oh, my children. Oh, God, my poor children. A Taste of Sorrow bursts into life with this racking lament from Maria Bront, dying of what was later perceived to have been ovarian cancer. The cry foretells both the theme and the tone of the novel, a fictional account of the lives of the Bront siblings that Jude Morgan decided to write with as little fiction as possible.         
	The temptation to write fiction about historical figures is always double-edged, and in the case of the Bronts, particularly dangerous. Jude Morgan (a pseudonym of Tim Wilson) is keenly aware of the danger. The story of the Bronts is so known, he tells himself in alarm when the idea of writing a novel about them occurs to him. Besides, he finds that the hard-working, dedicated and thoroughly professional authors have been changed into mythical creatures, inspiring more silliness and speculation than any other major English literary figure.        
	Yet Morgan finds through his research that the true drama of [the] amazing human narrative is yet to be told. The prolific writing of and about the Bronts has ultimately produced a few stark and simple tropes soaked in melodrama. Maybe the real story here lies in Morgans inability to free himself from the Bronts spell, drawn as he is, like many others, to the apparently inexplicable phenomenon of path-breaking creativity in three sisters brought up in narrow surroundings, with limited exposure and the constant proximity to death. It is not just that their mother dies early, followed by the two older sisters, Maria and Elizabeth, long before they themselves go to their early graves, preceded by their brother Branwell. It is also that Haworth Parsonage, their home, jostles on one side with the graves that come right up to its uncurtained windows. Their father was too scared of fire to allow curtains.         
	Morgan weaves each such detail into his narrative to give depth to his characters, for that is where interpretation has its strongest role. He seems at his best in the first section that begins with Maria Bronts death and ends with Charlotte unwillingly leading her remaining siblings behind Elizabeths coffin.         
	In the first scene, the mothers grief for her children is infused with a kind of wild, inarticulate anger, breaking surface when she asks her husband sarcastically if he wants the freedom of her bed even then, as he leans over to comfort her. It is a deeply unsettling few minutes, as the reverend Patrick Bront, terrified by something intractable he senses in his hitherto dutiful wifes eyes and words, struggles with both her pain that hoists her in obscene impalement, and the devil, who seems to be fighting for possession of her soul.         
	The mystery of that unspoken rebellion is never solved, but Patrick cannot be fully redeemed from the implicit accusation. His faith in god, his vision of a moral universe, his poetry  inadequate explanation for his childrens brilliance, his liberal permission to them to read whatever they wished, all these do not ever erase the impression of his self-absorption, escapism, fleeting hints of repressed appetites, and conventionality. This is only exacerbated by his obsessive affection for his only son, about whose talents Morgan injects quiet doubt, and about whose pre-eminence Charlotte harbours occasional resentment.        
	The hideous experience of the school at Cowan Bridge that results in the deaths of the two older sisters is powerfully recreated. Maria, the eldest, and Elizabeth, come alive in this section, and little Charlotte and Emilys closeness to them is invested with childish but deep emotion. Yet here too the story is punctuated by facts: the names of girls who died of the unhealthy environment, bad nutrition and heartless routine of the school. Similarly, Morgan lets the family doctor explain their mothers death in terms closest to the diagnosis: that she died of too many pregnancies in too short a time. It is hard to forgive Patrick.        
	But Morgans laudable determination to rid the tale of melodrama does not always have positive results. Sticking to all the facts is equally laudable, but the effect of the two together is often to flatten the narrative, perhaps because the facts are so well known. He is at his best in interactions which must be built up almost from scratch, such as those between Patrick and his sister-in-law, Miss Branwell, who keeps house after her sisters death. Re-imagining Miss Branwell is good fun. More disturbing, but equally credible, is the series of interactions between Charlotte and her brother, as their closeness wanes with the disintegration of Branwells personality. The lack of melodrama works best in Morgans depiction of Charlottes passion for Monsieur Heger and her resentment of his wife. Morgan walks the fine line between Charlottes fiction and the facts resurrected by scholars about the conduct of the Hegers. But the real gift of the novel is Annes character. Morgans research unveils a steady and practical personality, not a shrinking violet but a quiet, perspicacious woman who is more capable than even Charlotte to work in the world outside the parsonage.        
	The other problem with Morgans goal is that he has chosen a family whose real lives were inescapably melodramatic and mysterious. He cannot avoid stereotypes: Emily, with all the facts and documentation, remains unattainable, closed, never quite there. The sisters devotion to their childhood accounts of Angria and Gondal, which they kept on writing as adults to escape the horrors of life in the world, cannot account entirely for the startling vividness of her imagination. Charlotte has more to say  in letters and in the accounts of others, she can be conjured up; Emily is taciturn, forever courting the imagination as if only to resist the world. Even her rigid determination to die without succour is more than what imagination dare delineate.        
	Morgan wants to present the reality of the Bronts lives as if no one had ever heard of them. That is a good way to popularize research. But, even with the best that anyone can do, it is the Bronts voices that haunt us. In June, 1849, Charlotte writes, alone but unvanquished: A year ago... I should have thought... this can never be endured. It is over. Branwell  Emily  Anne  are gone like dreams  gone as Maria and Elizabeth went twenty years ago. One by one I have watched them fall asleep on my arm  closed their glazed eyes  I have seen them buried one by one  and  thus far  God has upheld me. From my heart I thank Him.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

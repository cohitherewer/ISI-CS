                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RESOLVE TO REFORM                                  BONA FIDE - MALVIKA SINGH                              
	Happy New Year and welcome to the second decade of the millennium! Sitting far away from the madding crowd, with no breaking news to interrupt a normal, happy day, there is nothing depressing or disturbing that I can comment on. That is what has made the last day of 2009 worthwhile. The political shenanigans that have overwhelmed India, from Jharkhand to Andhra to Bengal and elsewhere, made one uneasy about the horrors that a few have been inflicting on Indians. Tribal leaders  corrupt, violating every fiscal and social law, misusing their position as elected representatives, greedily filling their own coffers through endless wheeling and dealing  have betrayed their communities and insulted the democratic institutions that India lives by. When these same people start to interpret the tribal bill in their own way, and therefore wrongly, they will destroy whatever little remains of our forests and wilderness.        
	New Year resolutions are the need of the day. One of the resolutions that India should make is to add a green cover to its great land mass. If every panchayat were to pledge two acres of village land to a sacred grove where every villager would have to plant a tree, be responsible for it, and nurture it to maturity, and where men, women and children of all ages could spend time quietly with themselves and their thoughts, India would have begun a journey of renewal. The Youth Congress could lead this endeavour and change the mindset of the new generation by giving them the responsibility of caring for their future.        
	Another resolution could be to force the administration to do its job well and on time. The prime minister needs to pledge that every department will deliver, and if there is a citizen complaint that is legitimate, action will be taken in 48 hours flat. For example, you can get a license honourably without paying a bribe, you wont have to wait for six months to get an electricity connection. So far, the PMO has a standard reply to such problems  this is a state subject. Whenever one criticizes the administration of this country, the babu is ever ready with a quick response and washes his hands off any public demand in the public domain. The babu must be made accountable.                
	New beginnings        
	At the human and collective level, if every panchayat were to get the mothers of children attending village schools to grow healthy, organic vegetables to cook for the mandatory midday meal, then parents could participate, sensitively, with the teachers of their children. Sounds convoluted, but it is straight and simple, a true ring-a-ring-a-roses! Then, if the mothers are at the school vegetable garden patch every morning, the teachers too will find it tough to do the usual no-show. Neither of the two suggestions needs huge amount of money, which is why politicians and babus discourage such activities that bind communities together.        
	Sitting in front of a stone wall, made of all shapes and sizes of chipped and rejected stones, one realizes how we have allowed some of the finest skills of our land to fade away. Time is ripe to revive these traditions and establish a new but autonomous corporation  Creative Industries. We should begin to solve the employment problem by respecting traditional information technologies of India and making sure that we do not allow these to become a distant mirage of the past instead of an energetic truth for the future. Building strong and aesthetically pleasing walls without cement and mortar, making perfect water pots using earth, creating araish from eggshells, lime and oil, as the paint for walls and other surfaces, building water tanks and storage bins for harvesting what is now becoming a scanty elixir of life, and much more. Our traditional skills are congenitally linked with the environment and we need to restore them to the position they deserve.

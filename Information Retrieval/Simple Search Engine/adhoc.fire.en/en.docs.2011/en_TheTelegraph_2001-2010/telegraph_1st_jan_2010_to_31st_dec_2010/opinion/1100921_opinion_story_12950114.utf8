	Mixed signals                  
	Sir  The ministry of external affairs was right to decide against sending a delegation to China for a cultural exchange programme (India culture snub to China, Sept 10). According to some analysts, China has fomented trouble in the northeastern states and in Pakistan in order to destabilize India. Like India, China has immense diversity among its people and languages. Yet the oppressive policies of its government have bred discontent, resulting in a number of ethnic clashes. This discontent is compounded by a general demand for greater freedom and democracy in the country. Already under such pressures, it is possible that the Chinese government feels threatened by a stable, thriving India.          
	Chinas main territorial dispute with India had been over Arunachal Pradesh. But according to the latest reports, it now refuses to recognize any of the northeastern states as part of India. Such behaviour can only be aimed at inciting trouble among communities in India. After all, when China itself is riddled with conflict, it would reflect badly on its government if India, which has an equally diverse society, lived in peace.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  China seems to have ruffled diplomatic feathers by stipulating that no one from Kashmir or the Northeast could be part of an Indian delegation to the country. According to reports, What offended the Indian side most was that this time Beijing was making an issue not just of Arunachal Pradesh but the entire Northeast. China has sustained a policy of not recognizing certain areas as Indian territory. India, bent on appeasement and in denial mode, has been trapped into accepting this.          
	It is time the Indian government adopted a firmer line instead of persisting in its current passive stance. Tolerance of Chinese policies or dialogue with China is fruitless. None of these is going to stop the Chinese government from further acts of aggression and calculated provocation.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  China seems to be following an actively hostile policy towards India. But it is cloaked in a veneer of friendliness. In areas such as cultural relations or business ventures, the Chinese government appears willing to co-operate. But in other vital matters, such as territorial boundaries, it is unambiguously aggressive. India may be confused about Chinas intentions but the Chinese leadership has always known its own mind. Incidents from the past bear witness to this.          
	The bonhomie between India and China did not stop the latter from launching a military offensive against India in October 1962. China still remains adamant in its claims on Arunachal Pradesh. Moreover, the Chinese leadership appears to be undivided in its conviction that Tibet is, and should remain, a part of China. It has maintained this stand with grim determination, even in the face of international outrage.          
	None can compete with China in the art of practical diplomacy. India has always been susceptible to Chinas double-dealing, fooled by the latters overtures of friendship. It is time India toughened its stance and strengthened its defences against China.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Calcutta                    
	Sir  China recently refused to grant entry to Lieutenant General B.S. Jaswal on the ground that his area of command includes Kashmir (PM huddle on China, Sept 1). Chinas standpoint on this subject is outrageous. It can only be regarded as a blatant breach of diplomatic norms.          
	The dispute over Kashmir is a bilateral issue between India and Pakistan. Chinas interference in the debate is unwarranted, no matter how close a friendship it shares with Pakistan. Moreover, the latest incident is not the first of its kind. A few years ago, China told members of parliament from Arunachal Pradesh that they did not need visas in order to visit the country, thus implying that Arunachal was part of Chinese territory.          
	These two events are not isolated. China seems to have consistently followed a policy of provocation and barely veiled aggression. It has posed a serious threat to Indias territorial integrity. The policy also seems calculated to hinder Indias economic growth by diverting its focus to defence rather than development. After all, Indias growing economic prosperity may well be a threat to Chinas undisputed supremacy in the south-Asian region.          
	According to reports, China has deployed troops in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. This seems ominous, although the Chinese claim that the troops have been sent for relief work in the region (The dangers of going into denial, Sept 14). Despite such obvious belligerence from China, India has been slow to react. The Indian government, fearful of taking firm measures against China, has not yet been able to settle on a course of action. Such indecision has only encouraged China to take advantage of the situation.          
	Perhaps it is time India became more cautious about granting visas to Chinese officials and considered slowing down on joint naval and anti-terrorism exercises with the Peoples Liberation Army of China. India should make it amply clear that it will not allow itself to be bullied into submission by China.                    
	Yours faithfully,

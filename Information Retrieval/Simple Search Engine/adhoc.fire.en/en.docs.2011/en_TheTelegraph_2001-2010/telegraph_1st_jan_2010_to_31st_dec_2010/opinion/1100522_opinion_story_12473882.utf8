                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PRIME TIME                                                          
	One year is not even a tick of the historical clock but it might seem an eternity at the head of a coalition government with a tenuous majority in Parliament. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has, however, no reasons to feel exasperated. On the contrary, he can feel satisfied as he looks back on the first year of his second term as the head of the government. Despite the slender majority in the Lok Sabha, the United Progressive Alliance is under no threat as its main opponent, the Bharatiya Janata Party, is in disarray and no political formation is in a hurry to take the country to the polls. This and the slow and steady economic recovery are the two principal objective factors working in favour of Mr Singhs government. There have been some rumblings about inflation but the latter could be the outcome of a deliberate policy to keep the terms of trade favourable towards agriculture.        
	The prime ministers main problem internally has been the growth of Maoist violence. In this sphere Mr Singhs government, through its home minister, P. Chidambaram, has made it clear that there will be no compromise with violence. The quelling of the violence has been rendered difficult because, according to the Constitution, law and order is a state subject and therefore out of the Centres jurisdiction. Critics of the States counter-insurgency policies will have to recognize that development work for tribal people  an imperative if the influence of Maoists is to be eradicated and not just temporarily quelled  cannot be carried out unless the writ of the State is established. Development can only be an instrument post pacification. Externally, the prime ministers success has been marked. In a series of initiatives, he has opened up the space for dialogue between India and Pakistan. He has made it clear that seeking routes to peace is more important than excavating the roots of discord.        
	Mr Singh is on a stronger wicket than he often cares to admit. His low-key approach to most things, including his successes, has always been one of his strengths. He could perhaps be urged to be a little bolder as he moves into the second year of his second innings. There are areas like education  not to be confused with human resources  that await the indelible stamp of his cerebration. Attention to education could be critical in working out the kind of development that needs to be introduced in districts that are now under the cloud of violence. Any step Mr Singh takes now will proceed from a position of perceived strength rather than being an attempt to protect vulnerabilities. Skilfully dismantling the scaffoldings of the past, as the mastermind of economic reforms and of the Indo-US nuclear deal knows, is vital for growing the art of the possible. Mr Singh has nothing to lose. He has a place in history to gain.

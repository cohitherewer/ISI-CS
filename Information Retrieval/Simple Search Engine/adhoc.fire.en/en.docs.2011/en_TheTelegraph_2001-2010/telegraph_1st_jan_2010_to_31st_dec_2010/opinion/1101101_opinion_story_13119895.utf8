                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A DIFFERENT INDIA                          - Many reforms are yet to be instituted in various spheres					 					      COMMENTARAO: S.L. Rao                        Waiting for reform				                                                   
	With half the population depending on agriculture, its proportion of the gross domestic product has fallen to half that in 1992-93. Growth is not benefiting vast numbers in agriculture. An important reason is the declining level of government investment for many years (in dams, storage, roads, canals and so on). Others are the unproductive, non-asset building, vast and poorly targeted expenditures on giveaways (cheap fertilizer, cheap or free electricity, below cost diesel, write-off of loans to farmers). More, the scheme of subsidized grains to the poor, complicated and corrupted by physical procurement; transportation, storage in poorly maintained warehouses whose capacity is inadequate, with rodents, insects and weather damaging considerable proportions. The identification of poor beneficiaries is a source of massive corruption and leakage of grains. Much is diverted to the market. Reform must abolish government agencies like the Food Corporation of India and others involved in physical procurement, handling, storage, and so on, and instead give vouchers to beneficiaries that can be used like money. It would be best if low-quality grain were sold by the government at a single subsidized price to all, without ration cards, obviating bogus cards and poor targeting. Farmers too get below- international prices in this set-up.               
	The government must invest in cold storage and transport for further diversifying into dairy, broilers, horticulture, and other non-food crops. The use of genetically modified seeds, incentives and technical help in organic farming to make it economically viable are urgent needs. A national policy on the use of water in agriculture and reform in groundwater use, regulation to ensure recharge of underground reservoirs, metering and no overuse are necessary. So also is rational water pricing, which does not pay today the cost of operation and maintenance of irrigation projects. Effective land reform and computerization of land transactions and records are other needs. Ideally, private property rights over water must be replaced by making water the property of the state so that its use will require government permissions under rules and regulations. This will require amending the Constitution and is a task that cannot be postponed.         
	There has been talk of labour law reforms. The problem is not so much for large units which have learnt how to handle the law, namely, by employing contract labour on a large scale. They can be laid off in a downturn without high cost. The problem is that our labour-intensive industries could benefit, as has China, from a much more relaxed set of laws that permit large numbers working together, but under less stringent legal conditions. This could benefit millions of workers who could contribute significantly to exports of garments, toys, leather products and so on.        
	Indias growth story is unviable with growing deficits on the current account in balance of payments, high interest rates and a booming stock market. Massive short-term capital inflows cause booming stocks and a rise in the external value of the rupee, stimulating imports and making exports more difficult in a severely competitive situation. Volatile capital inflows are encouraged by exemption from short-term capital gains taxes routed through countries like Mauritius, now the largest investor in India. Illegal Indian funds also use this route to make tax-free speculative profit while laundering their funds. This route has added to foreign exchange reserves but they are volatile and we need instead foreign direct investment, which builds assets on the ground. Curtailing this volatile capital flow, and opening up markets to foreign investment to the maximum are essential.         
	Money markets require reform and regulation for competitive interest rates. Restricting volatile inflows will reduce uncontrolled liquidity. But the government and the Reserve Bank of India seem to disagree on limiting volatile flows. Perhaps the reasons are both the desire to continue hawala money being sent abroad for laundering profitably, and to keep high reserves, though volatile. Taxation reforms have made most progress and the impending national goods and services tax will create an environment for free trade across India.         
	Infrastructure requires the independent regulation of highways, airports, coal, and railways. Oil and gas have ineffective regulatory legislation. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board must get powers over all tariffs and not be subservient to the ministry. Above all, we must have uniformity in infrastructure regulatory laws, rules, their powers, and in those who decide them. There must be uniformity in objectives, authorities, appointments and accountability.         
	Education and health require urgent reform in many ways. There is a dire shortage of teachers at all levels from primary education to higher and professional education. Quality is, on the whole, very poor and graduates from schools and colleges do not receive an adequate education. But there is also a severe shortage of schools, colleges, professional institutions, skill development institutes and so on. These need to be established. The Azim Premji University is a good initiative for building quality faculty. We must have many more of them.         
	In spite of national missions and government expenditures, health for the poor is a bleak area of neglect, high cost, poor facilities and treatment. Most critical is the neglect of public health, water and sanitation. In both sectors, Tamil Nadu has demonstrated that institutional change and delegating powers to the local village or other elected bodies are helpful, along with treating health as one subject and not distinguishing it from public health. We must have a disciplining mechanism to ensure that doctors, nurses, teachers and others actually turn up for work and perform their duties.              
	The most difficult reform is of our administration. It may be better than in some developing countries but it has strong vested interests in the status quo, procedure and precedent. It is incapable of managing huge development expenditures, especially on social programmes and on physical infrastructure, efficiently without waste and large-scale theft. Every innovative social programme  from the public distribution system to the national rural employment guarantee scheme, sarva shiskha abhiyan, national rural health mission, and others suffer from inadequate spending of budgets, massive corruption and diversion to wrong targets. Controls are highly centralized at state capitals. The local communities have little say on how the funds are to be spent and no authority over the local officials delivering the social service.        
	Similar problems afflict infra- structure spending on roads, storage, bridges and so on. The allocated sums are vast, and either not fully spent or prolonged over an excessive period. The quality of work is shoddy and there is massive corruption.         
	Many reforms are needed but the top echelons of the bureaucracy have for years successfully stalled the implementation of every report that suggested reforms. The employment of specialists instead of generalists, stopping the abuse of transfers as happens today to control recalcitrant officers, accountability of individual officials and not the present system of group accountability so that no one is punished, performance evaluation on objective criteria, horizontal recruitment from the private sector and academia, independent investigation of charges against officials and prosecution of corrupt officials without requiring government permission, are all essential reforms.         
	There are of course many more ways in which we can transform India and the way it functions. But these are my list of the most urgent reforms.

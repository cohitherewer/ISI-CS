                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NOT A JEWEL                                                    
	Indians can always be trusted to go overboard at the slightest scent of success, especially if the field of achievement is the game of cricket. Already, proposals have been mooted to award the Bharat Ratna to Sachin Tendulkar. The Bharat Ratna is the countrys highest civilian award. Keeping this in mind, it needs to be asked if any game is a serious enough sphere of achievement to be included in the hallowed list of Bharat Ratna. The highest civilian award of the nation should by definition have some gravitas attached to it. Sports does not have that aura attached to it. More specifically, cricket may be a mass phenomenon in India but it should be borne in mind that only a handful of countries play cricket. Cricket, in that sense, is not open to international competition. The other point often overlooked by lovers of cricket is that the game does not demand great feats of fitness from those who play it even at the highest level. In fact, top athletes hardly ever take to cricket; they pursue other, more strenuous, games. Thus, before being carried away by popular sentiment, those who have it in their power to bestow the Bharat Ratna should bear in mind these issues: whether sports deserves to be in the Bharat Ratna list, and if it does should cricket have top priority?        
	If in their wisdom the authorities answer in the affirmative to the questions above, they should ask if Mr Tendulkar should be the first cricketer to become a Bharat Ratna. This is not to deny Mr Tendulkars fine qualities of batsmanship and the many records he has made. But these too should be placed in their proper context. Contemporary cricket has made the task of batsmen very easy: there are restrictions on bowlers and on field placings; batsmen go out to bat dressed as if in armour; pitches are prepared to make run-getting easier. All these go against the claims made by Mr Tendulkars fan club that he is the greatest ever Indian batsman. (The claim that he is greater than even Donald Bradman is too ludicrous to be taken seriously.) What needs careful study is how many times Mr Tendulkar has scored when the chips have been really down and the wicket has been really difficult. All these factors would probably prompt most keen students of the game to place Sunil Gavaskar a peg above Mr Tendulkar, the current icon. The authorities should be warned not to commit a double fault: Bharat Ratna to a cricketer and that too to Mr Tendulkar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A nation for the people
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A NATION FOR THE PEOPLE                                  Neha Sahay                              
	Sometimes, one wonders whether China really lacks democracy. Two recent incidents are illustrative. A villager living in a rural district in Wuhan, a highly industrialized provincial capital, has built himself a cannon to ward off the demolition squads sent by a company that has requisitioned his land. He has used this deadly apparatus, comprising old rockets charged with firecrackers, twice already. The first time, the demolishers hid behind a bulldozer; after the cannon fire was over, they thrashed the farmer, but stayed away for three months. The next time, they came armed with shields. By then, the farmer had erected a watch tower, and could fire well in time. No one was hurt.        
	Yet all that the police had done is call him for questioning, tell him he has violated public-safety regulations, made him sign a statement that he wont do anything illegal, and taken away his fire crackers. The villager claims that he has done nothing illegal; that its the company which is in the wrong because it refuses to give him the government-approved price for his land. All around his house, he has put up placards with slogans: Personal interests are trivial, but failure to implement official policies is serious; Retaliation and revenge are not allowed by government policy and law; Oppose using public power for personal reasons; Open and fair actions in accordance with the law, and so on.        
	He now awaits the third demolition squad, having put a couch on the tower so that he can be on vigil all the time. Imagine the fate of someone like him in democratic India, where demolitions of slums and village homes for grand projects go on all the time, but rarely make news.                
	Angry voices        
	The power of the people was demonstrated again in a mining city in the east. A students cycle brushed against an officials car, upon which the officials wife  who was driving  hit the student. The official too got off and slapped him. On being questioned, the wife yelled, I am a government cadre. I know that you are from the Number Two Middle School. I can send people to cause you big trouble in school. This provoked bystanders, and soon the crowd began throwing bricks and watermelons at the car. The police quickly arrived and took the couple into their own vehicle, but the crowd refused to disperse. Finally, the city communist party secretary had to come and plead with the people to disperse, assuring them that if this incident was not handled properly, they could come and see him directly.        
	The violence stopped, but the crowd wouldnt let the police vehicle carrying the couple leave. An hour later, the secretary announced that with immediate effect, he had dismissed the official from his post of director of the city tourist bureau. Even after that, the police had to burst tear gas to get their vehicle, with the couple inside it, out of there. The official was detained on charges of assault; the student had already been taken to hospital.        
	Imagine such a scene in India. A lathi charge, perhaps even police firing, would have ensued, the bureaucrats would have got away and the student arrested. There may not even have been any protest against the slapping of a mere student! Do you know who I am? I am an official, has now become the proverbial red rag to the man on the street. As one commentator noted, it may have worked when people were terrified of power, but not in todays China, which is making the transition from a power society to a rights society.        
	But old habits die hard. Three days after the incident, the censors ordered that the report be deleted from the newspaper  perhaps referring to the online edition. Now thats something that wouldnt happen in democratic India.

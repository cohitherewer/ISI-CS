The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A certain kind of sensibility
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A CERTAIN KIND OF SENSIBILITY                                                                  
	Celebrating Delhi Edited by Mala Dayal, Penguin amp; Ravi Dayal, Rs 350        
	Delhi hasnt given its residents much to celebrate lately. A demonstratively happy chief minister pirouetting to the theme song of the Commonwealth Games cannot alone lift the gloom that abounds. The mood must have been remarkably different in 2006. The Commonwealth Games were being held in Melbourne and Delhi had the leisure to lovingly recall the past, muse on the present, and worry about the future.         
	All this and more happened in the series of lectures started that year at the India International Centre under the aegis of the Sir Sobha Singh Public Charitable Trust and Intach. The lectures, held over a nine-month period, were immensely popular; the first by Sobha Singhs son and Indias most malicious writer, Khushwant Singh, drawing a crowd which numbered more outside the IIC lecture hall than inside it. His account of his father and his undying (but mostly uncelebrated) legacy must have regaled the crowd.         
	It is a slice of this time in the life of the city that Celebrating Delhi traps within its covers. It is perhaps necessary to keep this in mind in order to appreciate the choice of the essays in this anthology. Without the recollection that William Dalrymples The Last Mughal: The Fall of a Dynasty, Delhi 1857 was published in late 2006, when it rekindled intense interest in 1857, Dalrymples single essay in this book on how religion influenced the Delhi uprising and how Bahadur Shah Zafar tried to prevent the revolt from taking on a communal colour would seem incongruous in a collection that tries to prise open the mundaneness of Delhi and reveal the intricate layers of history that lie beneath it.         
	The question which most essayists try to answer is not where to look for the intersection of the layers of past and present histories of the city. For a place strewn with medieval and modern structures, and where remains of an ancient past (Acheulian hand-axes or other microliths) turn up as innocuous stones at the bus stop or on the university grounds, accosting history, obviously, is no trouble. Upinder Singh, in fact, asks morning-walkers to be on the lookout during their walks on the ridge. What the essayists stress and try to teach is the way of looking, both at the past and the present, and the way they entwine to assume new roles and meanings.         
	The attempt to create what Singh calls a certain kind of sensibility in the manner of looking is best seen in the two essays which alone, I think, would have made this anthology a worthwhile read  one by Sunil Kumar and the other by Pradip Krishen.         
	Kumar traces the history of two Sufi shrines in Delhi  the mazar of Khwaja Maqbul Shah in Saket, with an antiquity that could be traced back to the Sultanate period and the shrine of Jalal al-Din Chisti Auliya in the Jahanpanah forest with a debatable history. Kumar recollects watching them grow in importance over a period of several years. The 16th-century shrine of Shah and its masjid have now become the repository of doctrinal Islam. The second shrine, which was initially an anonymous grave zealously promoted as an authentic Sufi mazar by its enterprising servitor, has become a flourishing centre of Sufism that now finds mention in the internet. Instead of looking at them as indication of the spread of dogmatic Islam, Kumar says that the triumph of scholastic Islam in the Saket masjid and of Sufism in the Jahanpanah shrine should be seen as a reflection of how multiple strands of Islam continue to flourish and gain adherents within one kilometre of each other. In other words, he says, both stand as a heartening reassurance of the survival of multiplicities, debate, dissension and the politics of negotiation that determine... free choices.         
	Krishens essay is on the trees of Lutyens Delhi which are of about 13 varieties, none of them native to Delhis soil. Krishen looks at who the people were that made the selection and what made them choose these plants from among several hundreds. This engaging essay unearths fascinating details about the way the imperial city was envisioned. It also shows how nature upset the most carefully laid-out plans of the city builders.        
	Dunu Roy introduces a different perspective on who actually constitute the citys builders and breakers. The real builders, or makers as he puts it, are the people who have been pushed to the periphery  of the citys geography and of its life. They are the masons who have been forgotten by history. Today the forgotten constitute the bulk of the people who perform the most necessary and the most menial jobs that keep the city going. Yet, these people have not only been cheated by history, but also by successive governments and the judiciary that see them as squatters or illegal settlers.         
	In 2006, Roy is able to forecast many of the complications that are now derailing Delhis tryst with glory as the host of the Commonwealth Games, but he does get a bit carried away. Roy blames the administration for evading its responsibility and for failing to make the right estimates about the growth and demands of this population. He does not take into account the fact that no amount of planning would have been able to accommodate the influx from the rural areas and Indias eastern borders that continues to swell this population of marginal people. Not all of them can claim to be the citys makers.         
	Three essays have been added to the original batch of lectures, many of which could not be accommodated for a variety of reasons. One of them is Ravi Dayals take on the city as a Kayastha Mathur who, till his death in 2006, liked to believe that Delhis refinement and language were as yet untainted by Punjabi. Sohail Hashmis on Delhis language and Priti Narains on its cuisine are the other two. Dayal probably had never read these. Had he done so, he would have found out how Punjabi, or all that he feared, had become part of what Delhi spoke and ate.                    CHIROSREE BASU

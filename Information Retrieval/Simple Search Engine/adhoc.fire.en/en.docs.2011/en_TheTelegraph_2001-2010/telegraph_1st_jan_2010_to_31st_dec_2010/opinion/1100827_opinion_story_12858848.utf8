                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NAME GAME                                                    
	There may be nothing or a lot in a name, depending on what one wants to make of it. It cannot be a matter of great importance to the residents of New Town on the eastern fringe of Calcutta if it is renamed after Jyoti Basu. After all, streets, neighbourhoods and even towns are routinely named and renamed everywhere after public figures. But overzealous followers can sometimes end up looking silly in trying to play the naming game. This seems to be the case with West Bengals housing minister, Gautam Deb, who has come up with the idea of renaming New Town after Basu. The way he has gone about the plan makes it look like a covert operation and does no good to Basus memory, even for the faithful. Mr Debs peremptory manner suggests that he treats New Town as his personal fiefdom. He is the local boss of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and obviously thinks that his word is law there. Decency and democratic norms demand that such issues be debated openly and the views of the local residents heard and respected. Obviously, Mr Deb does not believe in such niceties in public affairs.         
	Nobody can deny the CPI(M)s right to try and preserve Basus memory, despite the debate on his actual legacy. But Mr Debs move raises avoidable suspicions about why he and his party are in such haste to use Basus name. A few months earlier, the Calcutta municipal corporation floated a proposal to name part of the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass after him. That was in blatant violation of the convention that such moves may be made at least two years after a leaders death. The fact that the convention is not always followed does not make the violations right. With the Left out of power in the corporation, the move died a political death. Mr Debs haste may have been prompted by a fear that the Left could lose power in Bengal in next years assembly elections. He will end up initiating an unnecessary controversy if a new regime in Writers Buildings were to change New Towns name again. The bitter political rivalry between Left and non-Left camps in West Bengal makes such a fallout distinctly possible. It is also possible that the CPI(M) hopes to exploit that controversy in order to win back some public sympathy. All this makes the renaming plan rather spurious. The CPI(M) must be in a really desperate state to hope to make some dubious political gains by using Basus name.

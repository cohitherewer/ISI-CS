The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | offensive case
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        OFFENSIVE CASE                                                    
	It is not an offence to live together just as it is no offence to say so. The Supreme Court decisively brushed off the cant that surrounds these issues in the hearing of the petition of Khusboo, the Tamil actress, who had asked the court to quash the cases against her. The actress had said that there was nothing wrong with pre-marital sex. Immediately a rash of cases were filed against her for expressing immoral views that could influence young people and for articulating opinions against the Indian ethos. Apart from violating Ms Khusboos constitutional right to the freedom of speech, the complaints seem to have confused a pompous moralism with the law, leading the judges in the Supreme Court to say that what was seen as immoral by certain sections of society could not be termed an offence.         
	In a number of earlier cases, the higher judiciary has made clear that there is nothing remotely wrong with live-in relationships or sex between consenting adults. The question, of course, is why the court should have to pronounce on the private arrangements of citizens at all. If people brandish the law as a weapon when the girl-next-door spends the night with her male friend, it is a mark of ignorance and poor social and intellectual evolution disguised as moral disapproval. But what is even more dangerous is the deliberate identification of morality with Indian culture, hinted at in the cases against Ms Khusboo, but experienced by victims of Valentines Day vandals with greater physical immediacy. The source of M.F. Husains decision to give up his Indian citizenship lay in this kind of contrived identification, with dollops of religious sentiment thrown into the poisonous brew. Yet in such cases, although the law is broken through violence, the courts point of view is barely heard. It is drowned in the hullabaloo of idiots. It is a pity that the Supreme Court must deal, instead, with equally idiotic efforts to punish Ms Khusboo for expressing her opinion in matters that do not, under normal circumstances, concern the law at all.

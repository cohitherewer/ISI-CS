                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Spot the difference                  
	Sir  I went to watch the recent derby between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan and was lucky to return safely (Spectator critical, Nov 27). More than one lakh people had turned up for the match, but there werent enough police officers present. A spectator was injured by a crude bomb, and there was a near stampede as supporters rushed towards gate number 3 after the match had ended. When a cricket match is held in Eden Gardens, the police remain extremely alert. Should not a football fan be made to feel safe as well?          
	Yours faithfully,         Sneha Majumder, Calcutta
        
	Shameful conduct          
	Sir  On November 30, as news broke of the Bharatiya Janata Partys gallantry, I rushed to pick up my daughter, who studies at Loreto Day School, Bowbazar (For success in Bengal, teach your children how to throw stones, Dec 1). On my way, I saw a horrible sight. All the shops had their shutters down on B.B. Ganguly Street. Students of several schools were running for cover, even as their guardians scrambled madly to find their own children. Women were crying, youths were pelting stones, and there were injured policemen and pedestrians everywhere. A certain moral turpitude seems to have taken hold of the government and the Opposition parties that are equally depraved, resulting in the deterioration of law and order. The atmosphere is extremely vitiated, and people are powerless to change things for the better.           
	Thanks to a brave policeman (the same officer who is seen in the photograph that The Telegraph carried on its front page on December 1), I managed to reach my daughter who stood weeping disconsolately in front of a small shop. Her eyes were red and swollen, not just because of the tears, but also because of tear-gas shells that had been fired. Perhaps the BJP leaders ought to know that it is hard to make a comeback when their journey has not yet begun.          
	Yours faithfully,

	United stand          
	Sir  In Look forward (Dec 1), Sumanta Sen analyses the factors behind the National Democratic Alliances success in Bihar in an intelligent manner. Significantly, Bihars Muslim voters seem to have taken the Ayodhya judgment in their stride and bore no ill-will towards the NDA coalition. The attitude of the minority community shows that it saw through the game the Opposition parties  mainly the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Congress  sought to play, of driving a wedge between religious communities. I hope Muslims from all over India take a cue from the Bihar polls and decide to move ahead.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I travel between London and Calcutta thrice a year. Dum Dum airport can only be compared to Sealdah station. The experience at Dum Dum is symptomatic of the chaos that marks the activities of Bengals political parties. Mamata Banerjee wants to turn Calcutta into London. Londons Heathrow airport has five terminals. If Banerjee were to pass through Terminal 5 alone, she would be able to witness the discipline of passengers and the quality of work of the airport employees. The culture of discipline is totally absent in Calcutta and West Bengal. Its revival is the key to avoid the frequent delays that take place in Dum Dum.          
	Yours faithfully,

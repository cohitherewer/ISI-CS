	Kushal Das, the sitar player, appearing at the end of a programme to celebrate his 50th birthday organized by Kalashree Music Circle at G.D. Birla Sabhagar on December 26, 2009, chose to play the surbahar instead of the sitar in his opening item: a 40-minute alap in raga Jog.         
	A larger and lower-pitched version of the sitar, the surbahar has double bass strings like the Ravi Shankar model sitar but much greater resonance and string elasticity that facilitate the deflection of upto 7 semi-tones in meends. Originally, the instrument was played with three mizrabs (wire plectra) in a quasi rudra veena (Been) style since its first exponent, the 19th-century sitar player, Ghulam Mohammed, had it made to learn the Been-style alap from Beenkar Ustad Omrao Khan. Ustad Imdad Khan, the grandfather of the late sitar maestro, Ustad Vilayat Khan, introduced the current practice of playing the surbahar with a single mizrab in the manner of the sitar. Ustad Imdad Khan and his son, Ustad Enayet Khan, usually played the alap on the surbahar, and followed up with gatkari in another raga on the sitar. Kushal Das followed this format. His surbahar alap in the raga Jog was followed by gatkari on the sitar in the raga Manjh Khamaj.        
	Kushal Das usually excels on the sitar bass strings. So, armed with the broad fret board and thick elastic strings of the surbahar, the journey downwards started earlier than usual: on the third minute or so. He was down to the deep bass in another three. Now the current Jog has an attractive, but rather restricted, compass. And Kushal seemed too intelligent to indulge in string-bending fancies at the cost of repetitiousness. So having boomed out the necessary number of figures in the bass octave, he was back in the middle register in six minutes and had even moved up the middle pancham in another minute. The circuitous movements upward to the high tonic took another five minutes or so and the alap was complete: a perfect example of artistic self-restraint. Both single directional and double directional meends were played with his usual mastery but he avoided the quicker multi-directional deflections known as murki to keep the alap more or less within the classic surbahar ambit.         
	The jod started with lapets: the slow, two-note-at-a-time core of gamaks. Faster lapets came in the drut jod but there was no larlapet or largathao, which actually come from the rabab rather than the Been style. The jod ended with some highly melodious thhok jhala and normal sitar sulat jhala eventually.         
	The vilambit teental gatkari on the sitar in Manjh Khamaj was centred on a composition made famous by an Ali Akbar-Ravi Shankar 45-rpm disc in the 1960s and was a good example of melody and rhythm blending with complementary, if at times rather loud, inputs from Kumar Bose on the tabla. The drut gatkari had a surprise element: it was knit around a well-known Hafiz Ali composition in Mishra Gara. This composition happens to loosely have the same note compass as Manjh Khamaj. The rhythmic and melodic elaboration and the taankari continued to be in Manjh Khamaj. The recital ended with fast, clear and melodious jhala. The evening had opened with a composition titled Full moon, played by 40 students of Kushal Das with guest artists on tablas, keyboard, guitar and percussion.         
	Sarod player Debojyoti Bose, a senior pupil of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, proved his mettle as an able exponent of his teachers style with a melodic mind of his own at a recital presented by Neev Foundation at Kala Mandir on December 30, 2009. His 23-minute alap in the raga Kalavati expanded the pentatonic raga with cross-octave melodic movements in a manner that showed unusual artistic ability. The jhaptal gatkari presented melody-packed rhythmic figures, layakari and bolkari. The saath-sangat, with Subhankar Banerjee on the tabla, was intelligent and colourful and the power-packed taan-toda was very impressive. The madhya drut and ati drut teental gatkari were equally impressive and featured excellently structured high stroke density movements that put equal emphasis on melody and rhythm. The variety and structure of the figures that elaborated the madhya drut gat and the rapid-fire bolkari development in the ati drut section were exceptionally good. The gatkari in a Hindustani version of the Carnatic raga, Latangi, (S R G m P d N), with pupil Partha Saha on the sitar and Anindo Chatterjee on tabla in the second half of the recital also provided enjoyable listening.

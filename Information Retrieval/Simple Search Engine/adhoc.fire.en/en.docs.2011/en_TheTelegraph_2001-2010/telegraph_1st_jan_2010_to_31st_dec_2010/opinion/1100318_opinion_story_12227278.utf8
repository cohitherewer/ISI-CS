                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MONEYED GLORY                                                    
	The show of power sometimes has a mad edge, and that madness can teeter over into the dark pit of black laughter. Not even the creator of the Mad Hatter could have thought up a scene where the chief minister of a state addresses a rally on the 25th anniversary of her partys foundation with a huge swarm of bees swirling around her, just after she has smugly accepted an enormous garland made of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. The chief components of the scene belong to such incredibly different planes of experience that the scene itself could have been pure fancy. But everything is possible in Mayavati-land, just as, only a few years ago, everything was possible in Lalu-land. Perhaps the funniest part of the bee-story was Ms Mayavatis determined, if inwardly nervous, persistence with the programme, and her supporters paeans to her for her courage. But even bees baulked at stinging the chief minister, although she has, even more uproariously, accused unknown enemies of trying to attack her and disrupt her partys celebrations by unleashing bees. Her highest administrative officers are still looking for the culprit.        
	The bees must have been frustrated to find that the huge garland was made of money, not flowers. Herein lies the darker side of the comedy. Apart from the mind-boggling crudeness of the gesture  although the actual threading together of the notes must have required extraordinary skill  the question of where so much money came from is inescapable. Although the Lok Sabha was repeatedly disrupted with this question and the income tax department has claimed to be looking into the matter, the Bahujan Samaj Party has defiantly gifted its leader with another money garland on Wednesday. The party claims that the leaders admirers in Lucknow contributed to make up the first garland, while BSP supporters from Karnataka are making a similar claim. Related questions regarding the fund sources of the BSPs Rs 200-crore anniversary celebrations are also being raised. That such merrymaking is possible while the communal tensions in Bareilly remain unresolved is an index of the depths to which the political culture of Uttar Pradesh, as of India, has descended. In a way, Ms Mayavati is doing the right thing. She is dropping pretence. Flaunting money before the nation is an honest display of the way Indian politics is run.

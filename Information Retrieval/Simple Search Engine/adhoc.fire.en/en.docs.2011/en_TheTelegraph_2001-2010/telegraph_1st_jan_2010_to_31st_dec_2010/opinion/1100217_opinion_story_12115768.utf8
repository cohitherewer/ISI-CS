	Q: I have a house in Salt Lake, Calcutta. I had rented out the house for 22 months. The agreement had been signed on stamped paper. But my tenant is not vacating the premises even after seven years. Moreover, he has not paid any rent for the last one year. Prior to that, his cheques bounced nine times. We went to the designated court at Barasat. But the case has hardly progressed. I am a retired senior citizen. Is there a fast track court that deals with such forcible occupation?        
	P.K. Bhattacharyya, New Delhi                
	A: The fast track courts in Calcutta do not have the jurisdiction to deal with eviction suits at the trial stage. However, since you are a senior citizen, you can file a writ of mandamus (a court order that requires another court, government official, public body, corporation or individual to perform a certain act, which falls within its duty but which it has failed to do) before the Calcutta High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution on the grounds stated by you. The court may direct the designated court at Barasat to dispose the entire suit within a specific time frame.              
	Q:I hold a leasehold property jointly with my mother. She expired in 2008, leaving a registered will where she left her share of the property to me. Is there any way in which I can verify if this is her last will? The said property is in Salt Lake, Calcutta, which comes under the jurisdiction of North 24 Parganas (Barasat court). Can I take probate through Calcutta High Court, without having to travel to Barasat?        
	Pranati Basu, Calcutta                
	A: Verifying whether a particular will is the last one made is difficult. However, since your mother registered the will, she would have also had to register any cancellation of the will or a fresh will or codicil (modification of will), if any. So you could conduct a search in the concerned registry offices with the jurisdiction to find out whether she did any of the above. In case your mothers will deals solely with the property in Salt Lake, you have no option but to initiate proceedings for probate in the Barasat court. But if your mother has also bequeathed properties in other areas of West Bengal in her will, then you can apply for probate before the Calcutta High Court.

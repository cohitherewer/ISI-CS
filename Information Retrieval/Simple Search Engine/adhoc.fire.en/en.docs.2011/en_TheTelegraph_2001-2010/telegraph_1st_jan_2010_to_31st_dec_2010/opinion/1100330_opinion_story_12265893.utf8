	In the unliberated days of the Roman empire, the satirist, Juvenal, mourned the plight of absentee Roman husbands who had to entrust the chastity of their wives to the vigilance of their guards. But who  lamented Juvenal  would guard the guardians?        
	The judicial process in India is now in the throes of a Juvenalian crisis. A senior advocate of the Supreme Court, in an interview to a news magazine, has impugned the integrity of half of our last 16 or 17 chief justices. Allegations of corruption against the higher judiciary are flying thick and fast in an atmosphere made murkier by judicial immunity and resolute resistance to transparency and disclosure. A growing public perception that our judges are not only corruptible but perhaps corrupt as well has added to the discontent generated by a system that delays justice almost forever while judges enjoy long vacations and some allegedly collude with lawyers in fleecing clients through indefinite adjournments on the most frivolous pretexts.        
	As we question the capacity of our judicial institutions to dispense justice without fear or favour and, indeed, to handle the volume of litigation that we choose to burden them with, alternative models of the judicial process inevitably attract our attention. Perhaps the most interesting and instructive of these is the judicial system of classical Athens.        
	Athens restricted participation in political and judicial decision-making to free, adult male citizens, thus excluding slaves, women and youth. Within these limits, however, it evolved a most elaborate, sophisticated and yet egalitarian system for the speedy and impartial dispensation of justice.        
	Athens employed no judges  only magistrates, who weeded out purely frivolous lawsuits. All other cases were decided by a citizen jury.              
	One had to apply for jury duty. Jurors were paid reasonably well relative to the daily wage of the artisan but not enough to financially attract the wealthy. The poor, the unemployed and the retired had the strongest incentives to volunteer for jury duty. The composition of applicants for jury duty was therefore strongly biased towards the poor (though travel cost to the courts worked in the opposite direction). Since the actual choice of jurors in every case was purely random, the composition of actual juries reflected that of applications: it was strongly egalitarian.        
	There were no public prosecutors. Each case was initiated by an accuser, or a set of accusers, who might have been aggrieved parties, but might also have pleaded the public interest, much like public interest litigants in contemporary India.        
	The Athenian citizen population comprised 10 tribes. Jury selection ensured equal participation of each tribe in each jury. From among the applicants for jury duty from each tribe, 600 were chosen by draw of lots, constituting a bank of 6,000 potential jurors for the year. On each day appointed for trials, some 10 separate courts would be in action, adjudging 10 different cases, but no one knew in advance which jurors would be assigned to a particular case.         
	On the appointed morning, jurors converged on the courthouse, each bearing his individualized invitation, indicating name and tribe. Each man deposited his invitation in the urn marked by the symbol of his own tribe under the eyes of an officer guarding that urn. A very elaborate ceremony, involving urns, columns, tubes and black and white balls (reminiscent of the hypothetical problems one solves in probability theory), a procedure too complex to be described here, then ensured the indisputably random selection of about 500 jurors from each tribe. Those not chosen were released for the day. Finally, the selected jurors drew lots that assigned them to specific cases. Each juror received a baton colour-coded for the court-room in which his particular case was scheduled: this baton was his ticket of admission to that specific court-room.        
	The main purpose of this elaborate process was to ensure that no jury could be bribed in advance since no one knew till that morning which juror would adjudge a particular case. Nor was bribery possible thereafter: jury selection was immediately followed by the hearing in open court where no covert transaction was possible and the entire procedure, from opening argument to sentencing, had to be completed during the day. Jurors were simply not accessible to potential bribe-givers before sentencing.        
	Jury duty lasted nine hours and a half. The first hour was spent in jury selection. The rest of the day had to be equitably rationed between the plaintiffs and the defendants with some time reserved for the jury to vote. In each court, a water-clock kept time: one of the jurors (chosen by lot, of course) watched the clock and allotted times accordingly. The proceedings commenced with speeches by the accusers, explaining the crimes of the defendant and seeking to establish his guilt by producing evidence as well as proposing an appropriate punishment. The defendant then had the opportunity to argue his innocence and present his evidence. Thereafter, the jury voted on the guilt or innocence of the accused. The voting was by secret ballot: another elaborate procedure guaranteed secrecy and ensured that jurors could reveal their real opinions without fear or favour. Decision was by simple majority; in the event of a tie, the defendant was presumed innocent. To discourage frivolous cases, plaintiffs who could not elicit the support of 20 per cent of the jury were heavily fined by the State. If, however, the majority found the defendant guilty, the latter got an opportunity to address the court again and argue that he should not be punished as severely as the accusers proposed. In fact, he was expected to propose a counter-punishment, presumably milder than that proposed by the plaintiffs. The jury then voted again by secret ballot, indicating which of the two proposed punishments it preferred. As in the first ballot, decision was by simple majority.              
	The main characteristics of the Athenian system were the speedy delivery of justice and the elaborate precautions against corruption. And these characteristics were intertwined: it was because trials had to be completed within nine hours after jurors learnt which cases they were assigned to that opportunities for corruption were minimized. In India, on the other hand, two and a half millennia later, our judicial institutions seem designed to maximize both delay and corruption. Everyone knows well in advance which judge will hear a particular case. Interested parties have ample time and opportunity to offer him bribes. If they have failed to do so before the first hearing, they are given an indefinite extension of time to rectify this error as the trial drags on in perpetuity. Sequestration of judges for the duration of a trial is out of the question. And to make bribery a low-cost option, only one judge (or at most, a very few judges) have to be bribed, as against the 251 jurors who needed to be bribed to guarantee a favourable verdict in Athens.        
	Life  and the law  are no doubt infinitely more complex in 21st-century India than in Athens 400 years before Christ. One-day trials with a legally untutored jury would no doubt fail to capture all the nuances of a contemporary law-suit. The Athenian model cannot possibly be replicated in toto in India today. It is notable, however, that we have no solutions to the two critical problems of the judicial process, problems that the Athenians resolved with exquisite finesse 2,500 years ago.

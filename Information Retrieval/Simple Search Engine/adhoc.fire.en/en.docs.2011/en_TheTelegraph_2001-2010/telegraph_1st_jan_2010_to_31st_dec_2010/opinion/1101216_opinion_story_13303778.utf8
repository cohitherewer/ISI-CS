	There are so many issues raised by the Niira Radia tapes that any discussion of their implications should begin by disclosing what it will ignore. I will ignore the rights and wrongs of phone-tapping by the government. I will assume that publishing leaked conversations is in the public interest when these conversations illuminate the behind-the-scenes manipulation of public policy and journalism. I will further assume that its legitimate to focus on particular media figures like Barkha Dutt and Vir Sanghvi in spite of the fact that the lobbyist in question had hundreds of conversations with a range of journalists and politicians. All of these exclusions and assumptions are debatable, but I think that if were trying to make a judgment about professional misconduct or ethical transgression, its useful to hold these matters in abeyance and focus narrowly on whether the things said in these tapped conversations add up to a moral indictment and then, if necessary, cite them in mitigation or bring them into play to qualify that indictment.         
	The first thing to be said is that listening to the tapes leaves you with a poorer impression of Barkha Dutt and Vir Sanghvi than reading the transcripts does. Theres an impression of collusion, a complicity conveyed by the spoken conversations which is cringe-making and repellent in a way that the written transcripts are not. This creates a problem: our moral sense about public wrongdoing is largely based on written evidence. The stock-in-trade of investigative journalism and history writing has traditionally been paper documentation and proof. In an earlier age, the tapes would only have been available to the reading public as written transcripts. So if were going to measure these transgressions in context, theres a case for purging them of inflection and expression and drawing our conclusions from the substance of the written word.         
	Theres no dispute that Dutt and Sanghvi undertook to do Niira Radia favours that, had they acted upon those undertakings, would have constituted corrupt practice. To act as a go-between for a lobbyist is a bit like cruising for a tout, not a condition to which professional journalists should aspire. Dutt and Sanghvi deny that they are guilty of this: their explanations for the promises they made and their apparent willingness to do a lobbyists bidding, is that they were stringing a potential source along in private, something, they argue, all journalists do to gather information.         
	For those of us who havent worked as reporters or professional journalists, this is a claim that is hard to judge. If you look at political reporting in the US, specially Beltway journalism in Washington DC, where access to the political establishment is crucial for leaks and tip-offs, where gangs of professional lobbyists constantly try to shape the media discourse, it isnt hard to believe that this sort of conversation occurs. That said, if Wolf Blitzer or Anderson Cooper were caught on tape promising a Shell lobbyist that they would tell Rahm Emanuel, Obamas chief of staff, to appoint someone open to off-shore drilling as chief of the Environment Protection Agency, Im reasonably sure that their careers would suffer, regardless of the professional purity of their motives. And if, subsequent to that conversation, such a person was appointed and a drilling disaster ensued, the professional consequences are likely to be even more dire.         
	On the other hand, my one experience as a political reporter makes self-righteousness difficult. During the last general election, I was commissioned by a news magazine to report on the Moradabad contest because Mohammad Azharuddin, the great batsman and Indias former cricket captain, was the Congresss candidate for that seat. This meant following Azharuddins cavalcade around Moradabad as he campaigned in its towns and villages. It also involved interviewing Azharuddin, which I did, both in his SUV and at his headquarters in Moradabad city. Had someone taped those interviews, I suspect I might have come across as an ingratiating journalist, because at the time, it seemed important to keep Azharuddin well-disposed towards me. I subsequently wrote a piece that was critical of Azhar and the Congress campaign, but Im not proud of my interviewing manner and Im delighted that it isnt available on tape for public consumption.         
	To return to Dutt and Sanghvi, we should note that theres an important difference in the two sets of conversations. Barkha Dutt is heard volunteering to be a political go- between, offering to communicate, perhaps even endorse, Rajas candidature for the telecom ministry to the powers-that-be in the UPA. Vir Sanghvi mentions the people he might meet and talk to but his conversations with Niira Radia centre on how he can air her arguments and the interests of her clients in his newspaper column, Counterpoint. Both transactions (had they been completed) would have been unethical, but Sanghvis offer to tailor his writing to a lobbyists instructions sounds particularly bad.         
	Both Dutt and Sanghvi claim that their actual journalistic practice remained untouched by these squalid conversations. This is hard to judge because its impossible to recall all the programmes Dutt anchored or all the columns Sanghvi wrote. On the face of it, though, theres no smoking gun which proves that their practice was decisively compromised by their promises. Sanghvi comes close: he can be heard telling Radia that he had, in his column, dressed up his support for Mukesh Ambani as an argument about the allocation of national resources. But he would probably argue that he was putting a spin on his column to encourage Radia to believe that he was making her case, when in fact his writing could be read in a perfectly neutral way. That said, to hear a lobbyist brief one of Indias most influential journalists, and certainly its most widely read columnist, on how his signature column should read, seemingly with every confidence that his writing would reflect her briefing, is startling.         
	Barkha Dutt and Vir Sanghvi are asking for the benefit of the doubt. The reason that they are often denied it has something to do with the fact that they are, in the public mind, seen to be close to the Congress party and the UPA government. This isnt culpable in itself: journalists and the organizations they work for often wear their ideological and political affiliations as badges of honour. I read the Guardian online more frequently than I read the the Daily Telegraph because Id rather read news and views that come out of a liberal worldview than a conservative one. The reason Sanghvi and Dutt are closer to the UPA government than they would be to an NDA government is, I suspect, because they see themselves as liberal and secular individuals, drawn to the historical pluralism of the Congress and wary of the majoritarianism of the BJP.         
	The problem is that both of them are seen not just as sympathetic to ideological positions of the Congress but as intimate with its personnel. Its no secret that Vir Sanghvi was closely associated with Madhavrao Scindia, and Barkha Dutt has tweeted her admiration for Indias home minister, P. Chidambaram. They are, in a word, seen as insiders and it is in that capacity that someone like Niira Radia approaches them. More to the point, they see themselves as insiders and this self-perception might have begun to affect their journalism.         
	Manu Joseph, the editor of Open, the first magazine to break the Niira Radia story, in his questioning of Barkha Dutt on NDTV, hammered home the point that Dutt let herself down as a journalist by failing to see that a lobbyist trying to fix a lucrative ministerial post on behalf of corporate clients was the story. Dutts defence was that, as an editor, she was called upon to make story choices every day and, in her judgment, the story wasnt interesting enough to run. This is a reasonable defence, except that as a consumer of news, Im enormously interested in the story, so it puzzles me that Barkha Dutt wasnt. One explanation is that as a news anchor with the inside track on politics in Delhi, she was so used to the nexus between business, media and politics that Niira Radias phone calls seemed routine, not exceptional. In which case, familiarity had cut her off from a journalists instinct for what was newsworthy.               
	Middle-class desis respect intelligence, success and institutional power. Barkha Dutt is the managing editor of NDTV and Vir Sanghvi used to be the editor and editorial director of the Hindustan Times. The shock of the Niira Radia conversations is not that they prove that Dutt and Sanghvi are corrupt: they dont. Theyre shocking because they show us that journalists of their standing seem to think its normal and necessary to abase themselves by pretending to be for hire or volunteering to run covert errands for lobbyists and touts. Each time they argue that they were massaging a contact for information, they prompt their viewers and readers to wonder if there isnt a more matter-of-fact, less compromised way of gathering the news? Why in the world would distinguished and influential journalists choose to work in a way that suggested to their sources that they were for sale (even if they actually werent)? Id like to think that there are enough journalists who make other choices for this not to be a naive question.       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

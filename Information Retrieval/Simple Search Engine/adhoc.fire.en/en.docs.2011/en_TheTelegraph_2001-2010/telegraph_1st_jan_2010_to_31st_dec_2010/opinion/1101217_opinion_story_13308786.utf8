	Some incidents abruptly uncover the scaffolding on which a cultural tendency has developed. An eruption of temper in St Aloysius Orphanage and Day School in Howrah may have shocked and embarrassed students and teachers, but it did serve to expose the way mutual violence works. For a society in which ruthless aggression and bloodshed have become routine in all spheres, domestic, political and professional, it is important to have a glimpse into its beginnings. A student of Class IX, slapped twice by his principal for trying to change seats during a show, retaliated by kicking and punching the principal with such intensity that the two had to be separated. The matter is being investigated and the student forbidden to come to school till that is complete. But a preliminary investigation by the school authorities claims that the boy had been disrupting rehearsals for a few days. In itself, this sounds strange, and raises the question why he was not disciplined earlier. The boy himself reportedly felt humiliated because, after being slapped before the whole school, the principal was trying to drag him out by his collar. True, the principal had warned the student once, and the boy had argued, saying that he could not see the stage. But the fact remains that the violence was initiated by the adult, at a time when corporal punishment is forbidden in schools by law.        
	In an unequal situation such as this one, the adult must be judged first. Impatience, an unchecked temper, its physically violent expression, an indifference to what a growing boy might feel are signs that cannot bode well. But would his retaliation have been possible without, first, the painful public humiliation he felt was undeserved, and second, the growing sense in todays jostling, bullying, edgy social milieu that aggression pays? When the principal of a school, who should be ensuring that there is no corporal punishment, is so quick to slap and grab  even if he is at the end of his tether  he is making violence a legitimate form of interaction. The boy hit back  the kicks and punches suggest a lot of pent up rage, and perhaps not all of it against the principal  but other students may be less open, using immediate or planned violence elsewhere. The rise in juvenile crime signals a kind of instability in society, one source of which is the behaviour of adults in school.

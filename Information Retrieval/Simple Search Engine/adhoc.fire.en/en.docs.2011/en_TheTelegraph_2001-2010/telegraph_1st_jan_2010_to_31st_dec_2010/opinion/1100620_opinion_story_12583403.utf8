	At what age does a teacher stop adding value to his profession? Some countries would say that there can be no fixed age, only achievement and accountability. Social security policies in countries like the United States of America are an important factor too in decisions regarding when to retire. But the Union human resource development ministry feels that longer years of work, together with higher pay, would go a long way towards making teaching more attractive. The sixth pay revision for university and college teachers says teachers should retire at 65 rather than at 60 years of age. Although the Centre is willing to pay  for a time  80 per cent of the additional cost incurred by the new pay, states will get the funds only if they raise their teachers age of retirement. But some states, including West Bengal, feel that the allocation of funds cannot be made conditional. This undermines the states independence with regard to subjects on the concurrent list. Education has been on that list since the late Seventies.        
	The states do have a point, although their arguments are either legalistic or partial. To Rajasthans argument of the need to let the old yield place to the new, the HRD minister had a ready reply: with 32,000 colleges by 2020, the younger generation would have no problem. It is rather the dearth of qualified teachers now that is worrying; Madhya Pradesh has raised the retirement age to 65, while many states allow re-employment, for two years after 60 and then year by year till the teacher is 65. Of course, the teacher gets no increment during this period.        
	But this points to the broader argument that the states might present, that of flexibility. In principle, a state should be free to adjust conditions in its educational institutions to a reasonable extent according to the situation in the region. This is apart from the fact that teachers operate under different conditions in different types of institutions. Certain research institutes, for example, offer no pension. Then, there are two types of provident fund. These are meant to be optional, but some institutions offer no options. Yet security after the required years of service should be one of the factors in fixing retirement age. A mandatory age of retirement with no parity in retirement conditions cannot make a profession attractive. Keeping the best brains in the profession would need focused incentives instead of an inflexible age limit. For example, institution- or faculty-building and acquiring funds require experienced teachers with wide networks of academic connections. Similarly, research and teaching in certain subjects may need cutting-edge skills and updated knowledge. Debating over an inflexible age of retirement without a system of accountability and incentives in place is unlikely to improve the quality of education or teaching.

	Debal Sens photographs of nature were less about landscapes than about states of mind. So much so, that he seems to have clicked his camera keeping in mind the title of the exhibition, Inscapes (Weavers Studio, Feb 3-10). Some of the photographs had fancy tags, such as Wave and Spirit or Phoenix Ascendant, hinting at the thoughts they were supposed to inspire, while others, thankfully, had just the place names as titles. Sen has been to remote corners of India, as the photographs of Devasthali and Jenabil  little-known places in Orissas Simlipal Tiger Reserve  made evident. A grey tiredness hung over both these pictures, that, perhaps, had as much to do with the landscape as with the fact that the former had been shot in sepia and the latter in black-and-white.         
	The brilliant play of colours in the other photographs captured the various stages of dawn and twilight in the mountains. In Mukteshwar, the dun-coloured sky was streaked with gold, in Rudranath the mountains were dyed in purple, while in Barfu, the indigo sky was sprinkled with a thousand stars. A gossamer-like rainbow lay stretched over the lichen-covered rocks in Kumaon. Arabesque in Blue could have been an accompanying photograph to Coleridges This Lime-tree bower, my prison. For here was the roaring water drawing strange patterns on the blue clay-stone indeed a most fantastic sight! But Ophelias pool in the photograph of that name looked happy enough, making one wonder about the title.

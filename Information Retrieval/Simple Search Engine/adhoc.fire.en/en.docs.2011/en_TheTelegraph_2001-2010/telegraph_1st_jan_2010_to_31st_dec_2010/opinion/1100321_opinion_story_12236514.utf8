The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | sweetened by a siesta
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SWEETENED BY A SIESTA                                                          
	If lawyers in India were as sensible as those in Spain, then the babus of Writers Buildings (among other august government institutions) could have led an even less strenuous life  if that is possible at all. Instead of a stealthy catnap, they could have then proudly snored away every afternoon after a satisfying lunch. An advocate for the protection of animals was recently snubbed by the conservative regional government in Madrid, when the latter decided, defying a petition by the former, that bullfighting should figure on a list of items of special cultural value. The petitioner replied by filing a fresh application, arguing that the siesta (bhaat-ghum to Bengalis) should also feature on the same list. After all, a brief spell of sleep in the middle of the day has been historically as much a part of Madrids cultural life as bullfighting.        
	Could there be a happier proposition? Some scientists endorse the idea heartily. Apparently, a few hours of rest around midday clears away the clutter in ones head, allowing one to focus better towards the evening. The idea made sense to no less than Winston Churchill, who managed to get into bed, even for a few minutes, between lunch and dinner, come what may. Spain really takes the virtues of the siesta to heart. As late as 2006, all federal agencies used to have extended lunch breaks (three hours on an average), which meant pushing back work hours to 8.00 pm. Instead of jubilation, there was disgruntlement. Since European workers, unlike Bengali babus, have to work rather hard during work hours, most were too tired by the end of the day to spend quality time with family or friends. As in the subcontinent, Mediterranean nations prefer late dinners, and later nights. So another set of scientists concluded that the siesta was not a good idea: it could pose a health hazard in the long run.        
	But it is as sacrilegious an idea to deprive seasoned Bengalis of their beloved bhaat-ghum as it is to try putting an embargo on adda, another hallowed marker of Bengali cultural identity. Bengalis have never much cared for health (if their cuisine is anything to go by) or for work (work culture in Bengal is a contradiction in terms). So, the subtle contest in Spain, between the individual and the State, over the ownership of time is unlikely to make much sense in the context of modern Bengal. It is revealing that in Bengal, the demand for a legitimate siesta hour can only be allowed as an idea to be made fun of or simply baulked at. It can never be tied to serious issues of health or be perceived as a physiological necessity, as it is in parts of China and Japan (where offices have napping rooms and schools have compulsory rest hours). The cultural value of the siesta does not exist as a given. Rather, it evolves over time, and can only be earned through hard labour. The siesta is sweetened by the storm and the stress that precede, or proceed from, it. Such a joy, alas, the Bengali babu can never know.

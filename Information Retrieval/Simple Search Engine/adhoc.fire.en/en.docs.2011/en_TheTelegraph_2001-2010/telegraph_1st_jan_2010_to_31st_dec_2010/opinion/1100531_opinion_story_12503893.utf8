	In Calcutta, it is always a chronicle of destruction foretold. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation labelled the Strand Warehouse unsafe in 2004, and then called it hazardous and condemned it after a few little fires in it culminated in a major one last February. After that, it was up to the owner to follow up. Now, the owner of the building, the Calcutta Port Trust, had the best intentions, but was stayed in its good work by an order from the court in response to a petition from the tenants. So, much of the warehouse collapsed, taking lives and limbs in the process. There is nothing novel in this; Stephen Court is still recent. But there is an inconceivable yet routine callousness in the culture of the city that leaves institutions, officials, tenants and citizens pathologically indifferent to regulations, common sense, safety and to innocent lives. While the usual game of passing the buck is once again in full swing with each institution and official claiming to have gone by the book, the fact that three people have died and many more injured seems almost an irrelevance. Common human decency is no longer to be expected. So it would be too much to ask for a coordinated plan among all the institutions involved to ensure the safety of a building, whether the Strand Warehouse or any other, once it has been condemned.         
	That would be at the very basic level. But the old warehouses are part of the legacy of the citys architecture and history. Ignorance, greed, a complete lack of pride and sense of belonging, and what is perhaps a craving for ugliness have led to an apathy towards old structures that could be restored as places of historical and aesthetic interest, and put to new uses in tune with the old. Yet the plan to restore the warehouses while beautifying the riverside as a whole has long been abandoned. Apparently, the tenants resisted. Calcutta is perhaps the only city in the world that happily steps back from civic beautification, restoration and development when tenants object. It is as if reasonable solutions are mythical creatures. The citys fathers  and mothers  thrive on unsolved problems; it does not matter if the citys most valuable edifices vanish in puffs of dust.

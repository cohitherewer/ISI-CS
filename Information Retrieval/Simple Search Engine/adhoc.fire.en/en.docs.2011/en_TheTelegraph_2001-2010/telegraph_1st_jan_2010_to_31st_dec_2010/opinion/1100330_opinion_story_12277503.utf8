	In places where certain foreign visitors are greeted with suicide bombings, common sense dictates that such visits be kept from public knowledge. When the visitor is no less than the head of State of a country most of Afghanistan is at war with, a total blocking out of information is perhaps necessary not merely for the safety of the visiting dignitary, but also for that of the likely victims within the country. So it is inadvisable to read too much into the secrecy surrounding the visit of President Barack Obama to Afghanistan. The timing of the visit, of course, is open to deductions, as also its message. With the battle over the health reforms legislation behind him, the presidents prioritizing work over a holiday at Camp David was, for all one knows, a public relations move needed to convey to the public at home, to the world (which recently watched, horrified, the Obama administrations supineness in Israel) and to the Nato allies, that the United States of America remains in the driving seat in Afghanistan and committed to the deadline it has set for itself. That Mr Obamas little speech at Bagram will do wonders for the morale of the US forces  that are seeing a spurt in body bags as they push deeper south in Helmand  is an understatement. With the impending drive into Kandahar weighing on their minds, Mr Obamas visit will undoubtedly be as important to them as it is to the president.        
	There is another less apparent reason why the visit is important to the trajectory of the war. Ever since General Stanley McChrystal took over the command, he has been stressing two factors  a surge, which is happening in phases, and the need to focus on the Afghan people instead of the Taliban in order to convince the people that the war is for their sake. To win in Kandahar and to sustain the advance made in Helmand, the allied troops need to win this battle of perceptions. This win would be impossible without the Hamid Karzai administration fulfilling its primary duty of providing a corruption-free government that will give the people the incentive to stay away from or turn against the Taliban. It was precisely this message that Mr Obama is said to have delivered to the Afghanistan president. The problem is, Mr Karzai may not know right now whether he needs to concentrate on winning the hearts of the Taliban or the people first.

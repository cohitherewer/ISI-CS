	Bengali cinema: an other nation By Sharmistha Gooptu, Roli, Rs 395        
	There are a myriad ways in which a community aspiring to be a nation imagines itself. The imagination of a community is a veritable theatre of cultural signifiers like ethnicity, language and religion, some of which are prioritized over the others in a specific historical epoch. Technology often plays a crucial part in this process, as does capitalism. If we were to conceptualize cinema as a visual culture that is extensively consumed, we would have to agree that it is a construct comprising a few commonly acknowledged representational idioms. These idioms build a consensus among the viewers, who, subsequently, form an imagined community. When that consensus becomes fragmented, a different community emerges.        
	Sharmistha Gooptu shows how Bengali cinema distinguished itself as an other nation, and refused to be subsumed under the overarching nationalist project of Bollywood films. The book encompasses a period of nearly 90 years. Starting from the first cinema shows in Bengal in 1896-97, it goes on to include the transitional phase in the 1980s when Bengali cinemas clientele changed from the educated middle class to daily wage-earners. Gooptu shows how, in the interim period, the governing ideology of Bengali cinema was driven towards the construction of Bengaliness among the bhadralok community. Gooptu is loath to accept it as a status group. Instead, the author argues that post-Partition, the group became segmented economically, socially and politically. She identifies bhadrata (gentility) as the most defining marker of this group. Gooptus argument is persuasive, but her definition appears constrictive because it does not take into account the issues of taste and morality.        
	Gooptu begins with the early years of Bengali cinema, discussing the emergence of and the cross-sections within the film-going public as well as film enterprises. In the first chapter, Gooptu shows how the paradigm of cultured Bengaliness came to be embodied in New Theatres Limited  Bengals premier talkie studio  thereby giving a fillip to Bengals national aspirations. The next two chapters analyse the iconic status of New Theatres and the subsequent transition to regional films in the wake of the Partition and World War II.        
	But the notion of Bengaliness was not fully developed in the New Theatres era. It happened when Uttam Kumar burst on to the scene in the 1950s. In the fourth chapter, Gooptu examines how the on-screen magic of Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen helped flesh out love stories that projected sovereign individuals making ethical choices within a dwindling familial/social structure.         
	The sixth chapter studies the impact of Satyajit Ray on Bengals filmscape. Rays distaste for Bengali films of the 1930s and 1940s is well known. But Gooptu takes pains to show how Ray borrowed certain tropes of Bengaliness from earlier films, and turned conventions on their heads. Not only did he give Bengali films unprecedented international exposure, but he also made the regional an emblem of the national. With his characteristic minimalism, Ray redefined acting styles, introduced location shooting and also ferreted out new dimensions of trademark themes like romantic love. He also established authenticity as the new identity marker of Bengali nationalism.        
	No history can claim to be comprehensive, and this one too contains some gaps. Other historians should accept the invitation and step forward to fill them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Points to Ponder
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        POINTS TO PONDER                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	I am an Indian and am quite perturbed by the way the Western world, led by the United States of America, the sole superpower, treats those countries that are not as powerful as it is.        
	The American president, Barack Obama, was reportedly very angry with British Petroleum. He was irked not only because BP failed to take proper safety measures while conducting its industrial activities but also because it spilt countless barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Although this environmental disaster has already destroyed marine life and will affect the livelihoods of those living along the Gulf coast in the long run, till date it has claimed no human life.         
	Obama is mad with BP for its reckless, irresponsible act and negligence. Hence BP must pay damages. BP has obliged Obama in record time by announcing that it will shell out $20 billion for the worst oil spill in the US history. BP has also agreed to create a fund of $100 million for the oil rig workers who have lost their salaries because of a moratorium on deepwater drilling. There are signs that if BP ends up paying such a high amount as compensation, bankruptcy will be the likely epilogue to the messy spill.         
	BP is no doubt the culprit. But on second thoughts, how culpable really is BP? After all, the company was in the Gulf of Mexico causing unavoidable environmental damage by drilling in search of hydrocarbon below the ocean floor to meet (at least partly) the insatiable American demand for oil.         
	So is the US partly responsible for the tragedy in its own back bay? Today, the attention of the world is rightly on BP, the Gulf of Mexico and the anger of Obama. But what about another disaster zone called Niger Delta in Nigeria? Do the world media know that big oil spills are no longer news in this vast, tropical land in the heart of Africa?                 
	Pay up        
	This is indeed a classic case of ruthless exploitation of a poor countrys resources for the profit and prosperity of the advanced nations of the West. Needless to say, as the oil giants brazenly violate all the laws of industry, international relations and local governments, they also get protection for their wrongdoings from the host governments. Thus, the peoples complaints fall on deaf ears.         
	Let us now turn to the macabre massacres enacted in Asia, and so in India. Unlike Nigeria, New Delhi today is a strategic partner of the US owing to its (comparatively) rising economic status in the midst of the financial collapse affecting the Western world. The Indian ruling class is generally enamoured of the US. What brings in a discordant note in the Indo-US mutual admiration society is the excessive intrusiveness and arrogance of the American leadership.         
	Thus, despite the death of numerous people in December 1984 in Bhopal, owing to an avoidable accident caused by dereliction of duty and lack of professionalism, the US multinational company, Union Carbide Corporation, has gone scot free. The arrogance of the boss of the erring company is there for all to see. A person no less than the US president deserves to look into the matter. If Obama can get angry with BP for an oil spill that has not caused a single death and manage to extract $20 billion in one week, why should he not help the strategic partner of Washington DC ?        
	To make matters worse, it now looks as if the government of India brought about the Bhopal disaster. Otherwise, why should it jump into the fray to compensate the victims kin when Union Carbide caused the tragedy? Why is the real culprit, headquartered in the US, not being made to pay? Will the US president kindly intervene?

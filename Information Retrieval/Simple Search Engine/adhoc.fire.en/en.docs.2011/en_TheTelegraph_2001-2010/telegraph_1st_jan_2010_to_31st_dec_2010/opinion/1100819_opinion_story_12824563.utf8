	From Chairman Mao to Hu Jintao, all the countrys rulers can be blamed for the gruesome deaths of 1,248 residents of the Zhouqu county, who were buried under the huge landslide that occurred at the dead of night recently. Situated in what was said to be originally a beautiful valley surrounded by lush wooded mountains, Zhouqus downfall began under Maos Great Leap Forward, an attempt to boost grain and steel production in the newly-independent country. Trees were cut to feed the backyard furnaces on which every household was supposed to forge steel, and forests were converted to farmland. Zhouqu county, nestling at the foot of mountains, is part of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in northwest China. This is the second disaster to strike Chinas Tibetan population this year. In April, an earthquake struck Yushu county, killing 2,220.        
	The governments response was prompt  soldiers arrived immediately. The armys International Search and Rescue unit, which was set up in 2000, has been busy this year, first with the Yushu earthquake, then with the floods that have left 1,700 dead or missing, now at Zhouqu, and over the last few days at Sichuan, the scene of another huge landslide.        
	Officials have cited torrential rain as the reason for the Zhouqu landslide. However, Woeser, a Beijing blogger of mixed Tibetan and Han origin, has compiled a list of official reports that have consistently warned about the danger to Zhouqu. Among them is one by the Zhouqu County Soil and Water Conservation Board prepared last year. In 2003, says the report, to promote economic development, Zhouqu introduced preferential investment policies, mainly the development of hydro power. From 2003 to 2007, contracts were signed for 53 hydro-power projects, of which 41 had been completed. As a result, there had been large-scale deterioration of the water and soil quality.                
	Strategic silence        
	A third factor has degraded the environment  excessive mining. A study by Lanzhou University in 2006 recommended that the population of Zhouqu be relocated. The area has seen regular landslides, but with the recent process of development, there was a strong possibility of terrible destruction if a huge landslide took place, said the study. The local authorities had belatedly started trying to repair the damage to the environment, but relocating the entire population had been ruled out.        
	As usual, Premier Wen Jiabao rushed to Zhouqu and directed rescue efforts. The nation observed official mourning. This is the third time such mourning has been observed in the last two years; first for the Sichuan earthquake in 2008, then for the Yushu earthquake. After the first few days of reporting tragedies, including the dashed hopes of poor students who had been all set to enroll in university till the disaster wiped out their farmlands, the official media is now reporting positive news about volunteers and survivors.        
	Those who were weeping just a day ago, were now making future plans. They were actually asking for water, wearing cleaner clothes, and at one relief camp, told the China Daily reporter: We live pretty well here. We will make it through with instant noodles and bottled water. These were people whod been searching for their relatives in a sludge from which human limbs, caked in mud, could be seen protruding; a place where entire buildings were struck down, where survivors witnessed their family members being swept away in different directions by a sea of mud.        
	China Daily sent seven reporters and photographers to the site, but the one thing none of them wrote about was the kind of development that had brought about this disaster  the same pattern of development at work in India.

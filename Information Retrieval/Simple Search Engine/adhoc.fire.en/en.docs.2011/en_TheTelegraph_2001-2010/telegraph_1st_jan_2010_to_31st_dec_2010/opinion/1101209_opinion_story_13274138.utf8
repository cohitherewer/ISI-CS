                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DEATH AGAIN                                                    
	A dead child and more than 30 people hurt, some grievously, is the toll the terrorists can claim this time in Varanasi. Planned for a Tuesday, special to worshippers of Hanuman and watchers of the evening arati, the explosive device in Sitala Ghat did enough, even if it did not do more. With similar planning four years ago, the terrorists had managed to wreak greater tragedy with serial blasts, although this time too, some more explosive devices had to be dismantled. The Indian Mujahideen has claimed responsibility, possibly because it wants everyone to know that it is back in business; the arrest of many of its leaders in Uttar Pradesh some time back has not succeeded in dispersing it. The German Bakery blast in Pune in February was suspected to have carried the same message. The information that killers refuse to give up can only be conveyed through the killing of the innocent. The reason the group has reportedly given is that they have killed as a memorial to the Babri Masjid demolition. Therefore the timing. The recent Supreme Court judgment and the freeing of Narendra Modi of the taint of involvement in the post-Godhra devastation may have made this anniversary especially sensitive. Sensitive enough to provoke questions, discussion and debate, even a widespread build-up of dissenting public opinion. But murdering the innocent is done for its own sake; the killers merely look for an excuse to shed blood, hurt and frighten people, blackmail the State and destabilize everyday life and social and political relations.        
	It is precisely because what happened in Varanasi is somehow typical that it seems amazing it was not prevented. The Union home ministry claims that it duly sent its advisory to the state government, while some state authorities seem to think not. But how does that matter? Should not Indian states by now each have developed its own security schedule and system according to its own vulnerabilities? Political parties have their attention elsewhere as usual: they have already begun blaming one another. But whether Mayavati should resign, whether the Congress is too soft, or what damage the Bharatiya Janata Party caused in Kandahar hardly makes a difference to the dead childs family. Perhaps intelligence and security will both grow keener when citizens lives are placed above the rants of politicians.

                                                    BE A SPORT                                                    
	The way to an all-powerful State is often paved with good intentions. A recent example of this is the sports ministrys decision to limit the tenure of those who head the various bodies under the National Sports Federation. On the face of it, this seems to be a good idea since many politicians, bureaucrats and other individuals continue to remain at the helm of various sports bodies for an indefinite period of time and some of them even behave as if the posts were their sinecure. One example of how long a person has actually been holding a post is that of Suresh Kalmadi, who has been the chief of the Indian Olympic Association since 1996. Limiting the tenure of the head, the argument runs, will help in better governance and greater transparency. A mere alteration in regulations may not, of course, result in a change of attitudes and the prevailing modes of running the various sports bodies. What the sports bodies need is professional management committed to introducing and conducting best practices. What India has today is sports bodies run by people more interested in the loaves and fishes of office than in the improvement of the sport concerned.        
	There is, in fact, a deeper problem. This is suggested by the very decision of the sports ministry to limit the tenure of the chiefs of sports bodies. Why should the State get itself involved in this matter? The sports bodies should be left within their own autonomous domains to determine the norms and regulations that will govern the terms of office of the chief. It should cause no surprise that the original regulation that capped the tenure of office-holders in sports bodies goes back to 1975, the high noon of Indira Gandhis maximalist State. India is now under a different kind of dispensation. In the age of liberalization, the State should gradually withdraw its frontiers and stop interfering in matters that are of no consequence to it. The interference in the internal affairs of sports bodies is an example of how the State continues to flex its muscles in various domains. That heads of sports bodies should have timebound tenures is a valid position, but the State should not ram it down on the bodies. The latter should be left to take their own decisions. It is not sporting of the State to be involved in sports. Indeed, the more fundamental question to be posed in this context is: is there any need for a sports ministry?

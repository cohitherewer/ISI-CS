	Forgotten leader                  
	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas article, If Shastri had lived (April 24), was an enlightening treatise on the late leader, Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was a reformer and a visionary. Indias post-Independence journey indeed took a sharp turn with Shastris sudden demise in Tashkent. It is ironic that today Shastri is seldom mentioned, while certain late and living leaders belonging to particular political families are glorified.          
	Shastri was a leader who was not easily swayed by emotions. He would not have shied away from using arms against enemies when necessary. Had he lived, by now the Kashmir problem would probably have been solved, making way for peace in both the Valley and in the rest of India. The present government would do well to emulate his policies instead of sending dossiers to and fro across the border, and complaining occasionally to the Big Brother, the United States of America.           
	It was Shastri who had understood that India must become self-sufficient in the production of food grain if it were to become a stable economic power. He coined the famous slogan Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan to inspire his countrymen. Shastri comprehended the importance of the abolition of licence raj in resurrecting the Indian economy  a theory that was put into practice by P.V. Narasimha Rao. It is strange that both Shastri and Rao have been conveniently forgotten by their parties and successive governments.          
	It is not just Indias history that altered course with Shastris demise, but the trajectory of the Congress also underwent a change. With Indira Gandhi assuming a key role, many events and practices, both good and bad, followed. She showed the door to many Congress veterans while building a cocoon of faithful followers around her who were placed in high offices and rewarded for jobs well done. This is a practice that still prevails in the Congress. Shastris prime ministership was different from that of Indira Gandhi. Yet he too was the initiator of many reforms and measures, which, if adhered to by his successors, would have changed the face of India. He never advocated sporadic growth for the nation but took a slow and steady approach to progress. That he was pretty accurate in his estimates is evident from the current turmoil in the country which has resulted from a huge economic and social disparity among different parts of India.          
	It is time our present leaders studied and followed the constructive policies of Shastri. Paying homage to a worthy son of the soil does not just mean naming government schemes after him. Instead, our leaders must work together to make Shastris dream for the nations peace and progress a reality.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  An unassuming man, clad in dhoti and kurta, Lal Bahadur Shastri was not flamboyant, but a leader of vision and integrity. He was also a pragmatic reformer, as Ramachandra Guha says. But he remains an unsung hero of our times. We all appreciate his conduct in the war against Pakistan, but seldom acknowledge him as a better leader than Jawaharlal Nehru in matters of strategic planning in times of war. Very few people are aware that Nehru had refused to sanction the use of the air force during the war with China in 1962. As Guha rightly points out, had Shastri lived till the 1967 general elections, he would probably have led the Congress to victory, and With a solid majority behind him, he might have undertaken to find a final resolution to the Kashmir dispute.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ramachandra Guhas insightful article on Lal Bahadur Shastri makes an excellent analysis of Shastris personality and potentials. In a period of crisis characterized by food shortage, Pakistani invasion, and an unresponsive international political community, Shastri took many bold and intelligent decisions. The opening of the second front on the Punjab border was a tactical move by Shastri, who proved to be a more effective decision maker than his predecessor, Jawaharlal Nehru. Shastri was Nehrus superior in another respect too. He grasped and stressed the importance of agriculture in Indian economy. Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan was not merely a slogan but a call to make the country self-sufficient in agriculture. Had Shastri lived, India could have had a more organized agrarian sector, and a more balanced economy with peaceful coexistence of agriculture and industry.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Paradise lost          
	Sir  I am a resident of Keota Latbagan, which is within walking distance of the famous Bandel church. The area is well known for its cultured and well-educated residents, most of whom are senior citizens. This once-peaceful locality on the banks of the Hooghly has now become a safe haven for rogues, who live in the slums around Bandel station. An illegal country-liquor den operates after sunset, run by some hooligans who enjoy the patronage of local leaders.          
	Now another problem has been forced on the residents by the Hooghly Chinsurah Municipality, which is indiscriminately sanctioning plans for the construction of multi-storeyed buildings. An apartment block consisting of around 90 flats and 40 car-parking slots is coming up. The Keota Latbagan area slopes towards the Hooghly, and in the absence of a proper drainage system here, there is every chance that the waste water from such a large complex will be flow into the river, adding to the pollution. Besides, roads are being turned into dust tracks by the trucks carrying construction material for the housing project. Although there is water shortage in the area, the builders are using huge quantities of water to do the bricklaying and plastering.           
	Yours faithfully,      
R.N. Gangopadhyay, Keota Latbagan, Hooghly

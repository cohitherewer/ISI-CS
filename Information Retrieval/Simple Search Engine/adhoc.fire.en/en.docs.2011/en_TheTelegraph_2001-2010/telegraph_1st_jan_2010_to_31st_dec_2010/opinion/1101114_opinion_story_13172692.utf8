                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        PRIDE AND PREJUDICE                                                          
	To be big and to be accepted as big, it is necessary to think big. China proves this again and again; India refuses to learn. India thinks and behaves like a third world country; China like an international power. Patriotic souls, basking in the light of shining India and in the enjoyment of being patted on the back by the president of the United States of America, may be wounded by the statement and by the comparison, but the facts are too many to be denied and brushed aside. The spectacle of the launch of the Asian Games forms one part of the massive empirical evidence. On Friday, in a tiny island in the Guangdong province of South China, the dragon showed that when the occasion demanded it could temper its aggressiveness and show the world its aesthetic side. In a magnificent show it brought into play technological innovations that merged effortlessly with the traditions of the Middle Kingdom. It was an awe-inspiring display in which water, fireworks, laser beams, floats, fairy lights and music came together. The world applauded as China pirouetted.        
	The comparison with India is inevitable because the Commonwealth Games closed in New Delhi barely a month ago. Nobody, not even Indias strongest critics, will say that the opening and closing ceremonies of the Commonwealth Games were lacklustre. They had spontaneity, they had involvement and they had planning. In spite of all this, the ceremonies did not quite measure up to being spectacles. They lacked the scale, they lacked the imagination and were bereft of the magic spark of creativity. In their total impact the opening and the closing ceremonies just did not match up to the show that the Chinese put up on Friday. The comparison does not end there. When it was the turn of the Chinese to host the Olympic Games, they hired one of the top architect firms of the world, Herzog amp; de Meuron, to design the Olympic stadium. The Birds Nest stands today in Beijing as one of the iconic buildings of the world: a marvel of modern architecture. When it was Indias turn to host the Commonwealth Games, old stadiums were refurbished by the public works department. A country that had once called upon Le Corbusier to design a new city could not think in 2010 beyond a government department. That alone marks the distance between India and China; between feeling proud about flapping ones arms in a stagnant pond and swimming gracefully in an open sea.        
	India, in terms of its collective mindset, as distinct from its potential, has miles to go before it arrives. If the mindset does not change, the point of arrival may, in fact, be deferred perpetually. Indians have an enormous amount to learn from the spectacular achievements of the Chinese, provided India is willing to learn. Ironically, an enemy of the open society in this instance could actually teach the worlds largest democracy.

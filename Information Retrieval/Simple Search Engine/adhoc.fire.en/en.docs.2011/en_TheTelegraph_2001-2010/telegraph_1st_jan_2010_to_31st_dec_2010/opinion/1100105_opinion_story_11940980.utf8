                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DRIVEN HOME                                                    
	There is something very unseemly about the Union home minister and the chief minister of a state having a public exchange of sharp words. In this particular instance, the home minister, P. Chidambaram, will have to bear the responsibility of having cast the first stone. And he is certainly not without sin. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has only retaliated. Mr Chidambaram had no business shooting off a longish missive to Mr Bhattacharjee on the subject of the law and order situation in West Bengal. In his enthusiasm, he overlooked the simple fact that law and order under the Constitution is a state subject. It is nobodys argument that law and order in West Bengal has deteriorated. Even Mr Bhattacharjee has been honest enough to admit this. What is equally true is that much of the violence that is visible is rooted in the politics of revenge. For the escalation of this violence, the Trinamul Congress, a coalition partner in the United Progressive Alliance, has to share some of the blame. The TMC supporters have not been kind to a rival that is now down and maybe on its way out. Thus the second mistake that Mr Chidambaram made was to take a view that was too obviously one-sided and partisan. The third error was the hectoring and holier-than-thou tone that he adopted. On many counts therefore, Mr Chidambaram, in his gratuitous letter to Mr Bhattacharjee, did not bring dignity to the august office he occupies.        
	There is another, graver aspect to consider. The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, recently described the Maoist threat as one of the most serious before the country. By making this issue a debating point between himself and Mr Bhattacharjee, the home minister has trivialized the problem. Maoist violence is too big a matter to use to score points over a political rival. There are many districts in India, falling into four or five states, where the Maoists are creating mayhem. No state administration has been very successful in eradicating this kind of violence. There is no evidence that the home minister has written to the chief ministers of the other states in the same vein and at the same length as he has done to the chief minister of West Bengal. The question, why Mr Bhattacharjee was singled out, is thus legitimate. Mr Chidambaram deserves the short shrift he got from Mr Bhattacharjee

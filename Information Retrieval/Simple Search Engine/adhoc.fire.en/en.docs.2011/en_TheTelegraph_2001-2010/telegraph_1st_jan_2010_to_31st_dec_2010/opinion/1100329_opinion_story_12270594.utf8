The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Strained loyalty   Gwynne Dyer
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        Strained loyalty           Gwynne Dyer                                     
	At the same time, the British government was warning its citizens that they risk having their passports cloned if they travel to Israel. Twelve members of the Israeli hit-team, which murdered the Hamas leader, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, in Dubai, used passports that had been cloned by Israeli officials at Ben Gurion airport from genuine British passports.Such misuse of British passports is intolerable, said the foreign secretary, David Miliband. The fact that this was done by a country which is a friend, with significant diplomatic, cultural, business and personal ties to the UK, only adds insult to injury. He then ordered the expulsion of the head of the intelligence services at the Israeli embassy in London. The French and German governments may do the same thing, for the Israeli assassins in Dubai used French and German passports too. But none of that will bother most Israelis, since they already see the Europeans as hypocritical and disloyal.        
	But falling out with the loyal Americans is a different matter. Israel depends heavily on the United States of America for weapons, financial aid and diplomatic backing, and now Netanyahu finds himself in a contest of wills with Obama. His problems with Washington became acute with the announcement, during the US vice-presidents visit to Israel, that 1,600 more homes for Jews would be built in occupied East Jerusalem. It was an insult to the US, said the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, as it deliberately sabotaged American attempts to restart the peace negotiations.                
	Several options         
	That is Washingtons interpretation of the event, and it certainly does resemble Netanyahus tactic during his previous stint as prime minister. His goal has always been to expand Israeli settlement and control in the occupied territories and ward off any peace deal that hinders that process. Now that he finds himself in a confrontation with the White House, what are his options?        
	One, obviously, is simply to give in and stop expanding Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. That would cause the immediate collapse of the far-right coalition government Netanyahu now leads, but an alternative coalition including the centrist Kadima Party would not be hard to construct.The main obstacle to that option is Netanyahu himself. Despite his reputation as a slippery character, he has always been rock-solid on the issue of land, particularly with regard to Jerusalem.        
	What other options does Netanyahu have? He can just wait for the wind to change in Washington. The mid-term Congressional elections get closer by the month, and Democratic members of the Congress, who fear that the powerful pro-Israeli lobby will subsidize the campaigns of their opponents, will be begging Obama to let Netanyahu have his way.        
	It would be humiliating for the White House, but its almost traditional for American presidents to be humbled by Israel, and they all survived the experience. If Obama sticks to his guns and the confrontation becomes a political liability for Netanyahu, he can always change the subject entirely by attacking Iran. Washington would be privately furious that Israel had embroiled it in a dangerous confrontation, but publicly it would have to back Israels play. So perhaps we should hope that Obama backs down at some earlier stage in the proceedings. After all, its not as if the Israeli-Palestinian proximity talks were going to produce anything useful.

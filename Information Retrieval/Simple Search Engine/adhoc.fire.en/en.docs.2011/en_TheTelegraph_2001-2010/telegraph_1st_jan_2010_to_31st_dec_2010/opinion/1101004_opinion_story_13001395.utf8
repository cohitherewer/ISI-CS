	The British Labour Party has a new leader. I wonder how much, if at all, this matters to anyone in India these days. At one time, it would have done. Even in the 1980s, it was still possible to meet a senior police officer in Calcutta who read the New Statesman, or a retired bureaucrat in Delhi who remembered his days at the London School of Economics and the old bonds between the Labour and Congress parties. But that generation has largely passed away. In terms of economic and political clout, India has risen in the world as Britain has fallen  on his visit a couple of months ago, David Camerons only too obvious need to flatter and appease India showed just how far the seesaw has tipped. A new Labour leader may matter as much to India as a new chief minister of UP would to the average Londoner (Uttar Pradesh? Wheres that?). A better question is: how much does he matter to Britain?        
	A few days ago, I watched his first leaders speech to Labours conference in Manchester. Like the Tory Cameron and the Liberal Nick Clegg  the leading partners in the government coalition  Ed Miliband has picked up the informal rhetorical tricks of Tony Blair. He says Lets be honest a lot and inserts a yknow now and then to make himself more demotic. Like Clegg and Cameron, hes in his early forties. Like them, too, he has a floppy thatch of dark hair. All three could be played by the actor, Hugh Grant, when he was younger  theyre remarkably unravaged and rather likeable, though in Cameron and Clegg neither quality is likely to survive the coming winter, after the public spending axe comes out and voters begin to lose their jobs.        
	There are differences. Miliband is Labours first Jewish leader. Were he to win a general election, hed be the first Jewish prime minister since Benjamin Disraeli left office in 1880. This hardly matters. Outside the supporters of militant Islam and the British National Party, and perhaps the membership committees of a few crusty clubs, Britain isnt noticeably anti-semitic; and in any case Miliband, like Disraeli, is Jewish by ancestry  his parents fled the Nazis in Europe  rather than by religious conviction. Disraeli was a convert to the Anglican church while Miliband goes further and doesnt believe in god. It was mildly shocking to hear him admit his atheism in a television interview. Britain is increasingly irreligious, but leading politicians always try to fudge or deflect questions about their personal beliefs so as not to alienate voters who hold different views. Blair, as we now know, is a fervent Christian, but in office he was never happy talking about it, and got shirty when he was asked if he prayed with George Bush.        
	Even more unconventionally, Miliband lives with a woman he so far hasnt bothered to marry. They have one child together, with another expected soon. Again, this hardly marks him out as a social radical: many couples choose to live in the same way. (My own case is typical. When my wife and I got married, the two children wed had together came to the wedding.) But again, its highly unusual in a leading politician. His child is technically illegitimate, born out of wedlock. There have been plenty in the past  the children of mistresses to prime ministers, for example  but theyve been kept secret. Miliband is entirely open about his domestic arrangements, which do no more than reflect the way so many couples live, even though the coalition government and its media allies insist on holding up marriage as the key weapon in their plan to re-moralize British society.         
	Interesting though these facts about Miliband may be, however, they are easily eclipsed by the fact that everyone knows: that he stood against his elder brother, David, in the leadership election and beat him, to general surprise. David, after all, was the favourite, the better known and far more experienced brother whod served in the cabinets of Blair and Gordon Brown. His loss to Ed got splattered all over the media as a psycho-drama, a sort of fratricide that echoed Old Testament stories and Shakespeare. The conventional wisdom became that the wrong brother had won. In many ways, this is probably right: David has the far clearer speaking voice (Ed sounds as if he is chewing a Mars Bar), the more confident delivery, the straighter and taller stance, and all these physical aspects of a personality matter hugely where politics is played out  on TV.         
	But Ed could stand on a platform and say something that David, as a former member of Blairs government, could never say. He could say, as he did in his conference speech, that the Iraq war was wrong. You could argue that this was moral luxury afforded to a man who hadnt even been an MP when that war was declared and approved by a vote in the House of Commons. None the less, most Labour supporters (perhaps most of the country) wanted to hear him denounce it. Year by year, day by day, it becomes clearer that Britains moral and military support of the American invasion was this countrys biggest foreign policy blunder since Suez: an illegal, expensive and bloody disaster. In the United States of America, Obama can say that his party wasnt in the White House to make the decision and that he voted against it. No such option is open to Blairs old colleagues, which is why the Iraq issue has suppurated so poisonously in the body of the Labour party for so long.        
	This, so far, is the reason the younger of the Milibrothers matters. Like many others of the millions who protested and argued against the war, when I heard the word wrong, I raised a small cheer. Who can tell how successful a Labour leader hell turn out to be? All we know is that, at the very start, he said something necessary and right.              
	**********              
	The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Charlie Bean, wants me to spend more money. Mr Bean sits on the banks monetary policy committee, which sets Britains base interest rate. Before 2007, my savings were earning up to 5 per cent in their various deposit accounts, but in the years since the Bank of England has shrunk its base rate to a historic low of 0.5 per cent and looks unlikely to raise it any time soon. This is because, as Mr Bean announced last week, the bank wants people to spend money rather than save it. What were trying to do by our policy is encourage more spending, he told a television interviewer. Ideally wed like to see that in the form of more business spending, but part of the mechanism that might encourage that is having more household spending; so in the short term we want to see households not saving more but spending more.              
	As Britains prosperity depends on consumption, this makes sense at the macro-economic level. But at the micro-economic level  me and my bank balance  I want to take Mr Bean outside and hit him around the head. During the mad decade that ended in the financial crash, I behaved cautiously. I didnt borrow, I saved  money that would put our children through university and keep us in our old age. Governments commend this sort of behaviour. The present government, especially, has shaped its rhetoric around the principle that States, like people, should never live beyond their means and always save for a rainy day. When the deep cuts in public spending are announced in two or three weeks time  cuts which fly in the face of Mr Beans advice to get down to the shops  we can expect more of the same: living within our means, getting the States budget back into balance, repaying our debts.        
	Its puzzling. Individuals are encouraged to behave like little Keynesians, spending their way out of the recession, while the government does the opposite. The one certainty is that it hasnt paid to be a saver. Since the crash, official statistics suggest that reduced interest rates have lost savers 18 billion and saved borrowers 26 billion. Inflation persists at more than 3 per cent. The value of savings falls. I should have bought gold and buried it in the back garden.

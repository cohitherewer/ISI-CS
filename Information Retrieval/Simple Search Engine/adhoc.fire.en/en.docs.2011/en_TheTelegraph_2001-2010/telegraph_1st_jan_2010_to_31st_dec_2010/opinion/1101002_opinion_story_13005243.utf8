                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ELECTRONIC EMBRACE                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                                                      
	Artfulness does not necessarily lead to successful art. The five artists currently showing at Experimenter (Say Everything, till October 31) use various media  from film to plaster of Paris  with admirable control and ingenuity. Yet, the kind of art that most of them make exudes only a superficial charm. The result is good enough to make the viewer pause awhile, but rarely does it endure in the mind.        
	The participants have taken on a formidable challenge. The crisis of privacy in an age of compulsive self-revelation is a well-worn theme. An obvious response to it is to reflect on the pros and cons of social networking sites in times of geopolitical instability. The brutal suppression of Twitter in Iran, followed by the recent embargo on Google in China, have sharply brought into focus the flip-side of empowerment through the technological revolution.        
	Serious artists like Shirin Neshat of Iran or Mehreen Murtaza of Pakistan have a way of responding to such socio-political crises without coming across as bluntly propagandist. However, Sajad Malik, who is based in Kashmir, wastes no time in even trying to be subtle. In his drawings, he documents the fearful reprisals visited upon young Facebook users from his state who are targeted by the police for exposing the atrocities of the armed forces. Maliks intention is to record a situation vividly, so his texts and images are perfectly synchronized, one illustrating the other faithfully. This is a technique that any comic-book artist routinely follows. So notwithstanding the sociological value of Maliks project, its place in an art gallery remains highly suspect.        
	In Baptist Coelhos installation, Neighbour, digital prints of interiors, barely glimpsed through open windows, are framed in aluminium and slits of glass  which simulate other windows. The viewer, simply by looking at the work, becomes a voyeur. Intellectually teasing as the idea may be, its semiotic range is limited. So, proliferating more of the same kind of work, as Coelho seems to be interested in, may not enhance the value of this concept.        
	Pushkar Thakur has installed an oversized computer keyboard made of laser-cut mirror and called it Cut//Copy//Paste. Once again, one feels duly impressed by the cleverness of it all. As the viewer stands before this work, his reflection appears all askew over the glassy keys. He is literally cut, copied and pasted across the gigantic keyboard, glistening like a many-eyed monster, and ensnaring cyber-addicts with a Medusa-like gaze.        
	Another kind of fragmentation occurs in Shreyas Karles installation in plaster of Paris. Morbid and mysterious, a number of body parts jut out of the wall or lie scattered on the floor. Eyes are painted on nails, as if each severed hand or foot on which they appear is spying (picture, left). Drawings stuck on the adjacent wall show conical sections of the human head and an amusing obsession with wigs, hinting obliquely at the effortless ease with which individuals often switch among multiple personae. These diagrams look like pseudo-scientific analyses with copious marginalia in Hindi. Oddly, the Devnagari script, in contrast to the Roman letters, becomes a secret code, deepening the sense of a private mode of communication that must be kept guarded against public access. Out of the confused babble of Karles concept note one can just about glean his intentions, though his imprecise thinking, thankfully, does not take away from the intrinsic appeal of this work.        
	Conceptual art may be difficult to fathom, but genuine complexity, even obscurity, can inspire and provoke the viewer by throwing up intellectual and aesthetic challenges. Judging by such standards, Sukanya Ghoshs optical collage on video, Flicker, appears to be the only work with a core of mystery in it. Unlike Karle, Ghosh does not rely on highfalutin theories to substantiate her ideas. Flicker is a powerful single-channel video installation drawing on vintage horror films, film noir and surrealist imagery from cinema and the other arts. Beginning with the physical space of a room, into which the viewer is led through a barely ajar door, Ghosh moves into metaphysical mindscapes (picture, right). As we observe the detritus of dreams, broken thoughts, and Bergmanesque fragments, we are stung by what Coleridge called the despotism of the eye  in this case, the artists unsparing eye. Visceral structures  throbbing, palpitating, imploding  flash by, leaving one disoriented. The couple of minutes for which the video runs are taut with unrelieved tension, which seems to intensify in the absence of canned sounds. The viewer is held in thrall to Ghoshs visual theatre, as she captures the slow, subterranean process of psychological disintegration in the cold comfort of her films electronic embrace.        
	Ghoshs other offering, Visible Code, is a mixed-media work that resembles a contraption put together with an odd assortment of materials  galvanized iron sheet, copper, acrylic, and so on. The finish, in this case, is more self-conscious, even a bit contrived.

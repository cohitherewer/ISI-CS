                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SPELL OF A DIFFERENT KIND                                  The perception of communists binding themselves hand and foot had its limitations, writes Tapas Majumdar                          Indrajit Gupta addressing an AITUC conference in Chandigarh                                        
	 ldquo;Minds in thrall rdquo; (January 19) brought back memories of my own youth and its surrounding political world mdash; memories of the late 1940s and early 1950s, when I would spend time moving to and fro between Presidency College, the always cramped university, and the Coffee House (which had become our common room for lack of space in more authentic academic surroundings).  
	I can also remember those enchanting moments that I spent looking at, and sometimes gently turning the pages of, the old, discarded books enterprising small-time booksellers used to put up on the railings of our campus in College Street. Those were the days when we at Presidency thought we were the people, or at least had the right to think it all out on their behalf. Communism came easily to mind without the guidance of Rajani Palme Dutt. I remember Dutt came to Calcutta once and, on his insistence, was led to the ancestral house where R.C. Dutt had lived. But he probably did not visit Presidency College.  
	Bhabatosh Datta once said to me jokingly: ldquo;Anyone under 22 in our times who was not thrilled or even enthralled by communist ideas and ideals had to be a fool. Anyone older remaining a full-fledged communist would have to be mad mdash; whether one had remained actively in the party or not. rdquo; Jyoti Basu was not mad. He was human. He was also humane. He tried in all his political actions to think of manush, the current version of janagan or people. His fault was that of nearly all political personalities. They thought mdash; Marxists, Leninists, Trotskyites, Stalinists, Maoists, grassroot Didi-ites, or people climbing the great banyan tree that was the Congress mdash; that all manush were equal but some manush were more manush than others. It is nothing new mdash; the Greeks had thought democracy (they called the better version of democracy ldquo;the polity rdquo;) belonged to all good people provided they were well-born, male and Greek.  
	As Rudrangshu Mukherjee said in Minds in thrall, Basu had once been called a sahib communist. That epithet referred to those sons of affluent Calcutta families who had been drawn to communism in the 1930s in England. Many of them went to one of the Oxbridge universities. Others, perhaps equally endowed in financial resources and brain power, but less inclined towards academics, were drawn to one of the Inns of Court. For them, the option of radicalism led to one of middle-class Calcuttas age-old dreams: life at one of the Inns and return to Calcutta as barrister. Radicalism usually meant joining the London Majlis and similar bodies. Sometimes there was an overlap of the hunting grounds of the two radical groups at the London School of Economics, particularly around Harold Laski, a mesmerizing professor of political science who later became the non-conformist (and non-performing) chairman of the Labour Party.        
	Indian political leaders, including communists, did not always live a simple life. P.C. Joshi was one the few communist leaders who lived simply, almost at the level of the working class or, later at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, at the level of ordinarily paid teachers. There were also those like K.C. George, who lived almost in the Gandhian style in Kerala. Then there was Indrajit Gupta, who lived in a two-room apartment at the Western Court, and walked to the Lok Sabha until he became a minister. Subsequently he too shunned many of the facilities he was entitled to. When he was minister, he never allowed the official car to enter the airport tarmac and used the airline bus to reach the terminal. But even the number of old-time communists who opted for a simple lifestyle was not large.        
	The revolutionaries of the 1950s did not carry their political egos about all the time. In my first year at university, we heard a funny story, perhaps exaggerated, about Gupta, who was then underground at the orders of the Communist Party of India secretary, B.T. Ranadive. His alias was Surya. At the same time, his elder brother was very high up in the civil service hierarchy as the home secretary or perhaps even the chief secretary of West Bengal. Surya had to remain underground, but he surfaced from time to time at his fathers bidding, and the two brothers would be forced to have dinner together. How our secret police managed to keep their sleuths away we never found out. While this may have been a concocted story, many of even my CPI-oriented classmates found it endearing.        
	An account given by Amartya Sen on receiving the Nobel honour is about his days at Cambridge with three professors with very different political identities. Sen found the peaceful  indeed warm  coexistence of the brilliant but theoretically unaccommodating Maurice Dobb, D.H. Robertson and Pierre Srafa quite remarkable and wrote: Srafa told me a nice anecdote about Dobbs joining of Trinity, on the invitation of Robertson. When asked by Robertson whether he would like to teach at Trinity, Dobb said yes enthusiastically, but he suffered later from a deep sense of guilt in not having given Robertson the full facts. So he wrote a letter to Robertson apologizing for not having mentioned earlier that he was a card-holding member of the Communist Party. Robertson wrote a one-sentence reply: Dear Dobb, so long as you give us a fortnights notice before blowing up the Chapel, it will be all right.  
	The perception of the communist binding himself hand and foot had limitations, because of the nature of the Social Man. Even revolutionaries had kept some things hidden in their hearts. I knew of many who secretly fretted and some eventually broke the mental shackles they were meant to carry by the Communist Party of Great Britain or, rather, that mighty dictatorship which stood behind its meddling in the Indian subcontinent mdash; the Third International or Comintern. I often think it was this meddling that was largely responsible for the communists rsquo; blunders of disowning Gandhi rsquo;s Quit India call and Netaji rsquo;s ldquo;Delhi chalo rdquo; call.  
	In Calcutta, we have had many communist parties. Once a friend counted a dozen of them, all infallible, all swearing by Marx and Lenin, some adding Trotsky or Stalin and finally Mao Zedong to their list. I do not think ideological differences had everything to do with this. The CPIs split, for example, never could be explained ideologically without counting the personal preferences of strong-willed leaders. If you tried, you would end up with a puzzle: Gupta and Hiren Mukherjee in one segment and Basu in another. All our political leaders had been bothered by their egos  only a few knew what good behaviour was and what was unacceptable. It was West Bengals good fortune that Basu was one of those few. The profusion of tributes at his passing, I think, was Calcuttas way of saying goodbye to the bhadraloks of a bygone century.

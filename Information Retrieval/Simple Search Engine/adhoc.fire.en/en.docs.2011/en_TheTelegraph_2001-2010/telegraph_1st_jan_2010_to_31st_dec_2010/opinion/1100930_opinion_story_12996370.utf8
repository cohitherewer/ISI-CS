                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RELICS AND AUGURIES                                  Nick Clegg copes with a tough job in the Liberal Democrat conference and the pope gets away with mere words of regret, writes Anabel Loyd                                            
	The summer is over and autumn is all too clearly upon us as evenings darken earlier by the day and we awake to a heavy mist over the lawn. The Liberal Democrats have had their conference in Liverpool: hairy work for their leader, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, with the most committed, if least articulate, member of the left-wing fringe of his party crying foul and traitor. The body of the party is still torn between possible pleasure in partnered office and fears that the partnership is really the beginning of final disappearance as Liberal doctrine is manipulated to fit the coalition mould and party members fall out to Left or Right.        
	Clegg successfully pulled off his end of conference address  he is the very model of the modern politician after all. The Left-leaning grassroots may not be satisfied with anything that smacks of Conservatism and may hate the partnership but those nearer real power are determined to keep the show on the road. Those of us who voted LibDem in hope of a coalition also have no wish to see the partnership quietly morphing into a Conservative government.        
	One of my sons, reading politics at university, is thoroughly disenchanted with the quality of political debate in this country at the moment. He worked in the American Senate during the 2008 elections and is much more enamoured of the highs and lows and sheer lunacies of American politics that are so open to public view.        
	The real story of this month has been about the expected clash between religious believers and non-believers, between one style of Christianity and another, and about an old conservative theologian, head of a very small State and still one of the most powerful men in the world. The simplest reason for not wanting the pope here, whatever personal beliefs, was the cost, unless spiritual balm for the few overrides further economic strain for the many. The Catholic Church sits smugly on bulging coffers and could well afford the cost of its leaders visit to his British flock. Instead, he travelled as head of the Vatican State; we will all be paying for last weeks State visit.        
	The most extraordinary thing about the visit is that the pope has somehow managed to get out of this hostile country home free  his apology for the sexual abuse of thousands of children by members of his clergy apparently accepted as heartfelt regardless of a history of cover-ups that has certainly involved him; his vilification of secularity, gays and birth control overcome and an image of him as a gently charming, grandfatherly intellectual obscuring that of the reactionary old rottweiler who categorically refutes the expediencies of 21st-century life in the name of faith.        
	I fear it is just another event typical of the ultimately disinterested British and a press happy to reflect its non-feelings. As usual its all a bit of fudge, or perhaps we just think it is good manners to be nice to our guests even if they have been forced on us at our own expense. David Cameron has publicly agreed with the pope on the importance of faith and possibly our blas, blowing-in-the-wind attitude to belief of any sort accounts for the lack of fireworks on church or secular stages and the fizzling out of campaigns and protests. That is probably why our politics has become so dull, barring occasional election excitement  nobody believes in anything for longer than the shift of the popular mood and so we all become a grey mass of unoriginal thought. As for the Anglican Church, that really is dying under apathetic and uncharismatic leadership and an ever vaguer sense of what it stands for.        
	Maybe we do need a few more extremes to make life interesting, especially for the young, but we have all spent so much time in the last 50 or more years trying to create a middle way that we dont exactly blaze for anything for long. In middle age, it has to be said, that the middle is quite a comfortable place to be, however much the insanities of the Tea Party and others of that ilk unfortunately present greater amusement value. The finale to the popes visit and its main excuse was to beatify the 19th-century cardinal, John Henry Newman, the most famous convert from the Anglican faith, in a step towards his ultimate sanctification. Miracles or not, and I have seen just the one healing of a bad back reported, which could, by any normal laws of coincidence, be considered serendipitous, Newman is an unusual candidate for sanctity. Perhaps as a questing theologian he is one calculated to appeal to this pope even if he also questioned papal infallibility which might be considered an obstacle. He has lately, too, been claimed by gay lobbies on the basis of his long and intensely close relationship with Father Ambrose St John in whose grave he was buried. No trace of his body was found on exhumation of the grave in 2008. An incorrupt corpse is usually seen as a further sign of sanctity.              
	You would have thought the pope might have a few doubts but poor Cardinal Newman, who probably is never to be a saint and whose writings are his proper memorial and legacy, has been hijacked for PR purposes. The Roman Catholic Church believes it needs a new figurehead on which to pin the survival of the faith in secular Britain and he will do. Really, it doesnt matter here or there but if, as is rumoured to be the case, Newman sped up the natural process of dust to dust by leaving instructions that his body should be buried in faster working peat, I hope it was done in the expectation of an unwelcome posthumous role.        
	So dreadfully undignified to be dug up and have your relics displayed for posterity. Poor blackened St Clare, lying in her nuns habit, tended by the silently gliding, veiled sisters of her order behind the grill of a crypt in Assisi, is a nightmare image and far too many other Italian churches are booby-trapped with glass fronted altars holding ghastly, saintly, skeletal remains. There is some perplexity over the missing remains of Newmans coffin; handles and other hardware usually survive in any grave. Perhaps their disappearance with his body is a real miracle, or maybe he was never buried there at all and lies peacefully still in some hidden grave away from the glare of papal publicity. One rather hopes so.

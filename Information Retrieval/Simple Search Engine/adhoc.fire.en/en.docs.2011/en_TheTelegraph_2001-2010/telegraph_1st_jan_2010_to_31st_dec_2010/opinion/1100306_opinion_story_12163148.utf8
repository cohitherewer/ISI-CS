The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A lasting romance with paint
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A LASTING ROMANCE WITH PAINT                                  Visual Arts - Rita Datta                                                  
	The first thing that you note about the art of Sourav Chatterjee is his romance with paint. He is taken up with its quality, for example, and its colours; particularly with the tones induced by mixing acrylic with earth colours that make them bright but matte; with the textures that he can work up and their warm tactility. He is, in other words, engaged in exploring, with eager openness, the possibilities that paint offers.        
	The canvases he presented at Studio 21 (Pulsation, February 19-March 5) werent too many. But in them, you could read the action of the artist and the process of his art as it took shape. There is the brusque brio of his brush, for instance. And the drama of the paint that is splashed onto the canvas, to splinter and spread in fields of inflected tones and congeal in ridges. And of its motion where the paint has been allowed to drip in stubborn trails. Or where it has been artfully layered in varying densities, in the manner of scumbling.        
	Which, of course, means that Chatterjees focus is on the surface rather than on the subject. In fact, it would be interesting to see the surface as the subject in paintings like Bathing (No 10) and Touch (No 2), both semi-abstract works. This becomes particularly clear when you study his handling of space, even where he chooses figuration. Although there was one painting that flirts fleetingly with perspective, space has been kept shallow and largely vertical. Rather than conjure up illusions of receding vistas, the artist tries to draw the eye upwards to trace the movement of the brush or disperse your attention all over the canvas.         
	Despite his feel for the materiality of paint, however, it is not certitude that comes across in these works but a concern with movement, even chaotic movement. Movement that refers to flux, which is the very condition of life. He isnt, therefore, its dispassionate observer but an involved, perhaps anxious, participant.         
	While Bathing balances exuberant blues that evoke gushing water, Touch is a terrain in turmoil. Brown-greys and brick-reds meet, melt, churn, drip and coagulate through hectic strokes. On the other hand, The Point (No 6) is figurative, with a sculpturesque head in sturdy outline that tends to get scratchy and tattered. But its solidity is lost as the dark ground seems to meet the flattish torso on the same plane to turn the figure skeletal, brittle.         
	Chatterjee also showed some acrylic works on paper. The artist is economic in these images, leaving much white space around. Their play of breezy lines, anchored on fluent, rather calligraphic, brushstrokes that sometime leave the print of bristles in the dry, thin paint, is buoyant and amusing.

	 Suresh Kalmadi has suddenly realized that friends turn into foes, and vice versa, very quickly in rajneeti. Congressmen have been keeping their distance from Kalmadi in Parliament ever since the Commonwealth Games peccadillos came to light. The other day, Sharad Yadav of the Janata Dal (United) alleged that Kalmadi had stolen the thunder from Shera, the mascot of the CWG, and that too for the wrong reasons. But, surprisingly, Bharatiya Janata Party members sprung to Kalmadis defence. They trained their guns on the government for the glitches but chose not to attack Kalmadi directly. Kirti Azad declared that he has the highest regard for the embattled chairman of the CWGs organizing committee. He was seconded by Pinaki Mishra, who alleged that venal elements had made poor Kalmadi the fall guy. Even MS Gill gave Kalmadi a tough time. When Kalmadi requested the Union sports minister to take a look at a sheaf of papers he was carrying, Singh retorted that he had no time for the documents as he was getting ready to answer the prickly questions from the Opposition. Kalmadi then walked over to LK Advani, who took the trouble to go through the papers carefully, thereby showing how quickly personal ties can change in politics.                              
	 Meanwhile, MS Gill is bringing down the House with his hilarious attempts to defend the governments antics in the CWG. Whenever he is called upon to speak during a debate, Gill peppers his responses with healthy doses of earthy humour but not everyone is in a mood to see the lighter side. The other day, for the umpteenth time, Gill compared the CWG to a traditional Indian wedding and argued that despite the inordinate delays in the execution of several projects, everything will get sorted out in the end. Unable to draw a favourable response from the members, he proceeded to recount a tragic folklore from the Punjab that features two doomed lovers called Sassi and Punnu. Not a tear was shed after Gill ended his story. Instead, irate members demanded to know whether Gill was trying to deflect the Houses attention by recounting irrelevant things. Someone needs to tell Singh that for the Opposition there can be no story as interesting as a government caught on a sticky wicket.                            
	 We knew that elephants have long memories. But Amar Singh would like us to believe that politicians  especially those who pride themselves on having kshatriya blood in them  seldom forget or forgive. Amar has not quite got over his expulsion from the Samajwadi Party. Recently, Amar accosted the SPs Mohan Singh and reminded him that he hasnt forgotten the uncharitable things that Mohan had allegedly said about him. When Mohan denied having spoken ill of Amar, the latter responded that he possessed the tapes that could establish the truth. On hearing this, Mohan, we are told, clutched Amars hands and said that brothers should forget bitter exchanges and forgive one another.                            
	 Nitish Kumar will be happy to know that with the elections drawing near, cracks have begun to surface in Lalu Prasads camp. Devendra Prasad Yadav, a former Union minister and a powerful Yadav leader, is said to be unhappy with Lalu. So much so, that he is looking out for greener pastures. In a letter written to the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief, Devendra alleged that there is very little internal democracy in the party, and that Lalu ran the show by issuing tughlaqi firmans (edicts). Devendra also added that if the issues that he was raising were not addressed at the earliest, he would be forced to consider himself an independent. He also wrote that he was quitting the core group and resigning from the national executive. The word is that the aggrieved man is in touch with a Congress leader, who wants to engineer a split in the Yadav votebank. Didnt we say that it is election time folks?                            
	 Many people were surprised to see the BJPs Sudhanshu Mittal attend a do organized by the Congressman, Rajiv Shukla, that was graced by the prime minister. An elaborate, rain-proof tent had been put up at the venue under the special protection groups orders. Apparently, the SPG maintains a list of tentwallahs whose services are requisitioned quite frequently. Mittals name features on the top of the pile in that list. Well, that explains his guest-appearance in the rival camp.                        
	 Rahul Mahajan has got himself admitted to a Mumbai hospital after complaining of chest pain. Some are saying that with his wife, Dimpy, threatening to walk out of their doomed and violent union, Rahul is nursing a broken heart. Mischief-makers are also speculating that Dimpy must have given back as much as she got, forcing Rahul to nurse his injuries in a hospital. But the real reason is different. Dimpy  aka Saumyoshri Ganguly  had shot some sizzling scenes in a Bengali film called Hello Memsaheb. The director says that Dimpys dare-bare act in the film that includes Jeet and Priyanka Trivedi would even put Mallika Sherawat to shame. Well, it seems that Rahul, and not Ms Sherawat, is Dimpys first victim. The poor man is in hospital, after discovering that his filmi wife is too hot to handle.

	Storm alert                  
	Sir  The district of North Dinajpur in West Bengal and the adjoining parts of Bihar got a taste of natures fury on the night of April 13 when a tornado swept over these areas, killing more than 100 people and leaving thousands homeless (Midnight tornado crushes 110, April 15). The country will witness many more of such natural disasters as global warming accelerates, with unchecked population growth putting people at risk. We have only ourselves to blame for exacerbating the problem.          
	The increase in pollution and in the emission of greenhouse gases will create extreme weather conditions. Coastal areas will become more and more susceptible to damages caused by storms as mangroves are destroyed. The 2004 Tsunami or the May 2009 Aila are vivid reminders of the fact that the frequency of recorded natural disasters is rising rapidly. A national research body should be set up as soon as possible to chalk out policies to tackle the crisis.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Subhayu Saha, Khagra, Murshidabad 

                
	Travel woes          
	Sir  On February 22, I travelled from Secunderabad to Kharagpur in the weekly Guwahati express in the sleeper class with my daughter. The travel ticket examiners in the train were very courteous and verified my identity with Visa card, along with the photo credit card that I had used to purchase the online ticket. I also had my voter ID card somewhere in my bag with me.           
	On reaching Kharagpur station, we took the overbridge. The local TTE at the overbridge was shown the online ticket but he demanded to see the ID proof. I could not locate the voter ID card, and so showed him the Visa card and the photo credit card. At this, he started insulting and abusing us, and a crowd gathered around us soon. The men were evidently enjoying the spectacle, and behaving as if they were glad to have caught two ticketless travellers. The TTE forced us to meet a senior officer. The latter, however, understood the situation, and allowed us to go, saying that the credit card used for purchasing the ticket was valid and that the other TTE was ignorant of this. Can a local ticket checker at a station demand ID proof for an online ticket after the journey has been completed? What right does he have to behave rudely with passengers?                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I was travelling by the Neelachal Express from New Delhi to Tatanagar on April 9, and was sorry to see that there were no charging points for mobile phones or laptops in the sleeper class. The chargers installed in the AC three-tier coaches were not working.          
	The upper berths on the aisle in the sleeper class had been raised during Lalu Prasads regime to accommodate one extra berth in the middle. These middle berths were removed later when Mamata Banerjee became the railway minister. But the upper berths have not been lowered to their earlier position, and this is causing immense discomfort to passengers.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I have finally figured out why the Indian Railways is doing so well financially, performing beyond the expectations of most. It is because all trains are running to full capacity. At least, the 2423 Rajdhani Express from Guwahati to New Delhi on April 10 must have been full. Otherwise, why did I, on the very top of the Reservation Against Cancellation list, not get a proper seat during the journey?          
	On April 10, I boarded the 2423 Rajdhani at Guwahati. The reservation chart showed my status as RAC -1, with seat 71 in coach B-8 allotted to me. But the list showed two PNR numbers against that particular seat, of which one belonged to me, and the other to someone called Shiluk Ram.          
	This RAC-1 status continued till we reached New Delhi. The two of us had to take turns sleeping at night, and were really cramped for space during the day. Whenever we asked the TTE about the allotment of the second seat, he replied that there has not been a single cancellation. That is funny, since I remember seeing a lot of people passing through my coach with their luggage in between stations. I am sure those people were only practising for an alternative career as travel attendants. I do not suspect they had been successful in bribing their way to seats ahead of me. Given the situation, I think that passengers on RAC lists should never travel in the hope of having their tickets confirmed.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Lights off          
	Sir  The power situation in Burdwan seems to be worse than that in Calcutta. Seven to eight hours of power cut is a routine here. It is unfortunate that because of the inefficient state administration, consumers have to suffer hours of loadshedding everyday. To combat the deficit of power, the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited has requested its consumers to switch off the air conditioners in the evening. Farmers are also to keep their shallow pumps idle for four hours. I cannot understand why customers have to make sacrifices for the WBSEDCL when it does not supply them with power at a subsidized rate. And how can our politicians promise electricity for all villages by 2012 when the state suffers from a power deficit?          
	Had the existing power stations been managed properly, the total power output of the state could easily have been increased. We are told that the state suffers from a shortage of coal and water. Then why public sector units are being allowed to set up thermal power stations at Andal and Raghunathpur, which are in the same coal-starved zone as the existing ones?                    
	Yours faithfully,         Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat, Burdwan

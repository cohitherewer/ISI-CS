The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Brief flashes in a void
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BRIEF FLASHES IN A VOID                          - Haiku in both poetry and the novel        Postscript - Githa Hariharan                          From the film, Sound of the Mountain                                              
	There is something irresistible about the small and the powerful. In literature, perhaps the best example of this potent combination is the Japanese haiku. The haiku uses a few pithy words and lines to hint at a large and mysterious universe. I still recall the sharp intake of breath that accompanied my first reading of Bashos haiku. To be able to get across meaning and emotion vividly in just 17 syllables! Consider, for instance, the famous one about the old pond, as translated by R.H. Blyth: The old pond/ A frog jumps in/ the sound of water. Or the one translated by Lucien Stryk: Summer grasses/ all that remains/ of soldiers dreams.        
	What haiku such as these manage to do, through arrangement of word and image, is design poems that are compact yet convey great depth of feeling. Its power of suggestion is the haikus great weapon. And much of this suggestion has to do with the way it uses images of what is around us  in nature, for example. The images mate the incongruous or unlikely pair: the classical haiku typically fuses motion and stillness. And the haiku makes original use of images from nature, but this relationship with nature only adds to the haikus mission  which is, first and foremost, to comment on human experience.                    
	I too discovered the haiku in my teens, and like many young people wanting to express themselves, I tried to describe the world around me and within me in telegraphic form. Not long after I discovered the haiku (and perpetrated many of my attempts on the world), I discovered a writer who showed me that haiku need not remain confined to poetry.        
	I was in college in what was then Bombay. Though we did not use the word, postcolonial, like a tic in the Seventies, I suppose thats what we were, really, because the universitys literary canon consisted entirely of white males from England. Women in general, and Americans and Russians, were reduced to a few tantalizing footnotes. It was on one of my forays down the hill from Sophia College that I found, in a hole in the wall that should be given deemed university status, a copy of Yasunari Kawabatas Snow Country. I learnt then that Bashos haiku style could stretch over a whole novel.        
	In his Introduction to his translation of Snow Country, Edward G. Seidensticker says, The haiku manner presents a great challenge to the novelist. The manner is notable for its terseness and austerity, so (the) novel must be like a series of brief flashes in a void. This is Kawabatas style: mingling the experiences of all the senses, hinting at the meanings these experiences may lead us toward. The silence of a winter night, for example, may roar in Kawabatas world. The sound of running water may appear round and feel soft. Or, in a quiet and dexterous leap, a bell sounds within the song of the tea kettle, then turns into a womans feet. Seidensticker points out that Kawabatas literary lineage should rightly be traced back to the 17th-century haiku masters.        
	Simplicity, openness, depth and lightness: is it possible to use these haiku traits effectively in more spacious forms? The Sound of the Mountain, a novel by Kawabata that was made into a Toho film by Mikio Naruse, may hold an answer to this question. Considered by some critics to be Kawabatas best work, The Sound of the Mountain uses a series of linked episodes to depict a crisis, or a web of crises, in the Ogata family in Kamakura. The family patriarch, Shingo, is a Tokyo businessman. He is only 62, but he is close to retirement. Perhaps this is one reason he is beginning to suffer brief memory lapses. Or being afflicted with either sleeplessness or strange and disturbing dreams. Or hearing sounds no one else does  such as the sound of the novels title that wakes him from sleep one night, like wind, far away, but with a depth like a rumbling of the earth. Most of all, he is suddenly looking at his family with new eyes  his philandering son, his unhappily married daughter, his unimaginative wife, and most of all, his beautiful and heartbreakingly brave daughter-in-law. He is actually seeing them, an experience that not only changes them in his eyes, but changes his understanding of his own life. Indeed, his perception of human relationships shifts subtly but irrevocably.        
	The scenes of daily family life are interwoven with dreams and memories, but also with images from the natural world. The mountain, the cherry tree in the yard, the birds and insects of a summer evening, two pine trees Shingo sees from the commuter train he takes every day: all these seem to speak to him in a new way on matters of love, desire and aging.              
	As is characteristic of Kawabatas work, The Sound of the Mountain is written in spare prose akin to poetry. The film directed by Naruse is faithful to the novel in the attention it pays to texture and perspective. As for using the delicate language of hints, there is the final sequence of the film, set in an extending walkway in a park. Kikuko, the daughter-in-law who has moved Shingo so deeply, and made him feel afresh, has a rare emotional outburst as she confesses to having had an abortion. And strangely, both receive a kind of unspoken solace from each other. Its the kind of revelatory moment in a relationship that makes up one of the arresting haiku images of the film.        
	But the best haiku bridge between forms was, perhaps, identified by Kawabata himself. Though known for his many brilliant novels, Kawabata also wrote more than a hundred two- or three-page stories which he thought expressed the essence of his art. He called these tanagokoro no shosetsu or palm-of-the-hand stories, and they are fine examples of the dictum that what is unsaid is as important, if not more important, than what is actually said. Kawabata said: Many writers, in their youth, write poetry: I, instead of poetry, write the palm-of-the-hand stories. Even more telling, just three months before his death, Kawabata wrote one of his last works. It was called Gleanings from Snow Country. This work was actually a miniaturization of Snow Country, the novel which brought the writer such acclaim. The bare bones to which Kawabata reduced the novel speak of his lifelong commitment to the haiku, the mode of expression that views the world through intense suggestion.

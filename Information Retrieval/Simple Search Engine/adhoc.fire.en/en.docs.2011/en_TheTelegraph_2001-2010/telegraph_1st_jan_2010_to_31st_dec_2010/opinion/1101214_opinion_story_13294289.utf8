	Books and business, reading and rent, culture and commerce? The chief minister of West Bengal may cringe at such couplings, but his squeamishness will not do the state much good. Nor will it strengthen the first term in each of these pairs, which form quite naturally if one takes a realistic view of the world. So, the alarm and indignation at the thought of having to pay rent for using the Milan Mela ground for the Calcutta book fair speak of the organizers unthinking habit of taking certain things for granted. The first of these things is that selling books is a special activity that is somehow higher than mere business or commerce. And the second is that the state government will invariably fall in with this sentimental elevation of the book fair above the vulgarity of money-driven activities. As a result, the Publishers and Booksellers Guild finds it difficult to shed the idea of a tariff subsidy, and all the other ways of thinking and being that come with it. But what is most interesting, and perhaps larger than the guilds knee-jerk response, is the schism within the government between doing business and doing culture  the industry ministers point of view versus the chief ministers.        
	There is nothing particularly uncultured or anti-intellectual in admitting that the book fair is a commercial venture, in which books are bought, sold and advertised, like all the other fairs that take place on those grounds. This is not to belittle the other, more intangible, associations that have gathered around the Calcutta book fair over the years. Yes, it is also natural to go to the fair for a love of books, company and other forms of nourishment, cultural or culinary. But how does that make the fair any less of a commercial event, or any more ignobly so? With the recognition of its commercial nature, and, more specifically, with having to pay a proper rent for the premises, comes a different kind of quality and accountability. And this can only be good for books, and for all the other activities linked with them. So, a move like doing away with entry charges because this happens to be Rabindranath Tagores 150th year is a rather pointless gesture, especially in the name of a writer who spent a great deal of energy trying to organize funds for his various intellectual projects. The chief minister must stop drawing artificial boundaries between the business of culture and the culture of business.

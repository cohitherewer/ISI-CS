	Even the worst dictators love to put up democracy shows. Aung San Suu Kyi would have been the last person in Myanmar to be misled by the juntas seven-point roadmap to democracy. Few would, therefore, be surprised by her decision to boycott the elections that the countrys military regime is planning to hold later this year. The new constitution of the country and the election laws, both fabricated to suit the juntas agenda, made it impossible for Ms Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy to decide otherwise. The constitution, born of a fraudulent referendum in 2008, is clearly a tool for legitimizing the armys rule. It reserves 25 per cent of the seats in parliament for the army and makes the army chief the real power even in an elected government. The laws practically exclude all critics of the regime from the poll process. They bar anyone serving a prison term or with a criminal conviction from contesting the polls. That keeps Ms Suu Kyi, and thousands of political activists languishing in the prisons, out of the process. Also, the ban on members of religious orders is aimed at keeping out the Buddhist monks who have been among the most vocal critics as well as the worst victims of the regime. The laws thus rob the polls of any legitimacy even before they are held.        
	However, some pro-democracy activists and even a small section within the NLD wonder if the partys decision is a bad move. The NLD will cease to exist as a political party because of its decision to not register with the election commission. Those who resent the NLDs decision also argue that it should not have missed this opportunity to play its part in the long-delayed rebirth of democracy in Myanmar. After all, these will be the first elections in the country since 1990. The last time Myanmar had a parliament session was in 1962. Some form of democracy, these sections argue, would have been better than none at all. This wishful thinking is clearly born of a desperation to see the end of a long, brutal regime. But, if the NLD had decided to take part in the polls, it would have meant surrendering to the regime and accepting its annulment of the 1990 elections, which the NLD won by a landslide. Worst of all, it would have meant accepting the juntas terms of keeping Ms Suu Kyi out of the elections. The free world too must call the juntas bluff and see the planned polls for what they really are.

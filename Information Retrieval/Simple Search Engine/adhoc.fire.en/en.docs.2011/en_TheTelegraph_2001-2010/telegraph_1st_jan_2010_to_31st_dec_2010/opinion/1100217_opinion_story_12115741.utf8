                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DELIVERING JUSTICE ONLINE                                  Despite the success of an e-court pilot   project,   paperless courts may not   be viable   everywhere as   so few people have access to the Internet   in our   country, says   Shabina Akhtar                                                                                                            
	Picture this: Ajmal Kasab needs to be produced in court for a hearing. The judge is seated and is waiting for the session to begin. The usher calls upon Kasab. And the man appears  not in person, but on the judges laptop and on the LCD screen on the courtroom wall.        
	Or imagine getting a court summons via email or an sms. With e-courts being set up in India on an experimental basis, all this and more may soon become a reality.        
	The first e-court pilot project was launched in the Delhi High Court in December, 2009. The project aims to convert all the courts under the Delhi High Court into e-courts. It will soon be extended to the district courts of Karkardooma in east Delhi and they too will be converted into e-courts, says Girish Sharma, registrar, Delhi High Court.        
	An e-court is basically a paperless court where most court procedures  right from documentation to filing petitions to archiving verdicts  is done in a digital format. The evidence need not be presented physically  an audio-visual capsule of it would suffice. Lawyers too need not carry their heavy legal books to read out precedents and judgements. In an e-court, they can have the verdict out on their laptop screens. This can then be emailed to the judge instead of the court master having to pass on the heavy books for his or her perusal.        
	Moreover, the judges can access their judgements via the local area network (LAN) and make corrections if required. They can then add their digital signatures to the judgement. This dispenses with the long drawn out procedure of the court typist typing out the judgement, giving it to the judge for his corrections, and then preparing the corrected judgement once again. Under normal circumstances, it takes at least a week for the verdict to be obtained after correction, says Supreme Court advocate Arvind Gupta.        
	In fact, the entire process of disposing of cases becomes much quicker in an e-court. Which is perhaps why Justice S. Ravindra Bhat was able to deal with 18 cases out of the listed 33 in just a few hours in the Delhi e-court recently.        
	Lauding this mammoth step towards digitisation, Delhi-based cyber law expert Pavan Duggal says, I believe that the concept of e-courts is a revolutionary step towards the administration of justice. With the advent of e-courts, people will be able to file petitions and lawsuits electronically, which is much faster than filing a suit on paper.        
	In fact, one of the salient features of an e-court is the e-filing of suits and petitions. Under this system, people can file them on the courts website sitting at home, or a cyber caf or at one of the e-kiosks on the court premises.        
	However, experts point out that e-filing is actually a complicated procedure and will not find too many takers. For starters, it requires biometric authentication of digital signatures  the digital scan of a thumb impression, for instance. The e-filing format is also quite cumbersome. This is one of the reasons the Supreme Courts e-filing option, introduced in 2006, is yet to take off in real earnest. Of course, this could be because in the Supreme Court only the filing of petitions is done via emails. The rest of the procedures are conducted on paper, says Sharma.        
	Moreover, not all evidence can be produced in the digitised format. Many fear that hacking could also pose a threat to the e-court system. However, proponents of e-courts point out that new cyber laws could be framed to tackle the problem of hacking.        
	Many other countries have successfully implemented the e-court system. For example, in Singapore it is not unusual for lawyers to fight cases via video conferencing. New York and Queensland in Australia are other places that have e-courts.              
	But the question being asked in legal circles is whether or not e-courts will be viable at all  given that Internet penetration is so low in the country and so few people are tech savvy enough to attempt to file petitions online. Besides, the process of digitising documentation and archiving court papers and judgements is hugely expensive, point out experts. Says Calcutta High Court criminal lawyer Jay Sengupta, The cost could dampen the e-court project. To convert all papers into the digitised format would definitely cost a bomb. Besides, all evidence cannot be presented in the digitised format. For instance, we often have to produce the police general diary entry book as evidence. Now that can be produced in a digitised format only if the police maintain a digital record of the diary.        
	Adds Rotnanko Banerjee, a barrister at Calcutta High Court, Its fine as a pilot project. But keeping in mind the fact that we lack the necessary infrastructure, extending the system to courts all over the country may not be a practical proposition.        
	Besides, its not only the general public who, unused to Internet operations, may be put off by the prospect of filing petitions online. Many lawyers are also notoriously non-tech savvy and it could be a challenge to get them to welcome the e-court system. To make this project a success a lot of lawyers and judges would need to be trained, says Banerjee.        
	However, despite the challenges the pilot project leaders are optimistic. Says Sharma, We will set up e-kiosks in every e-court that would take care of converting non-digital evidence into the digital format. The paper evidence can easily be scanned and put into pdf format.        
	Supreme Court advocate Arvind Gupta too feels that the initial hiccups will not prove to be a serious hurdle. One has to have the will to support this change. And saying that e-courts would put justice out of the reach of the poor would be wrong, for their lawyer would guide them on how to save their evidence in compact discs or USB drives.        
	Its a tall order, no doubt. But if and when they do come into effect, e-courts will definitely go a long way towards administering justice in a swift and efficient manner.

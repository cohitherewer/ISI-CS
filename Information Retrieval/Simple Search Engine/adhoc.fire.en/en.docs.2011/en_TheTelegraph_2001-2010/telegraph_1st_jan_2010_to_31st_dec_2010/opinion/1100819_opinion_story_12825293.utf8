	Land is finite and so are the economic returns from it. Economic progress everywhere is thus directly related to the question of how to make the best use of land. The transition from a land-based economy to a more complex and technology-driven industrial one, however, has not been a smooth affair anywhere. In the past and even in modern times, the transition has caused major social and political upheavals. The controversy and the anxieties surrounding the Centres proposed land acquisition and rehabilitation bill actually reflect Indias attempts to manage that transition. There are two broad aspects of the legislation  it reflects the need to move on from the traditional agrarian economy and also the anxiety over the fate of farming and farmers in the course of the transition. Most developing countries, including India and China, have been facing increasing social turmoil over governments attempts to acquire land for industrial and other commercial uses. Trouble over land acquisition in different parts of India in the past few years, however, has left an inescapable lesson: the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 is wholly inadequate to meet todays challenges. The sooner a new law takes its place, the better for the countrys economy and for the farmers.        
	It is only natural that such a major issue will throw up controversies and contesting opinions. The debate in Parliament over the police firing on farmers agitating for better compensation for their lost land should make both the government and the Opposition examine the issues in greater depth. Of course, political parties would sometimes tend to reduce the issues to a matter of their own partisan benefits vis--vis their opponents. But a party that is in the Opposition today may be a ruler tomorrow in a state or even at the Centre. It would be futile, therefore, for the parties and their leaders to run away from the real issues. It is important that a political consensus evolves over the terms of land acquisition and compensation to the landlosers. If such a consensus emerges and is reflected in the proposed legislation, there would be no question of forcible acquisition of land. The use of force in land acquisition is bad in law and even worse in practice, as recent incidents in West Bengal and Orissa showed. But politicians who do not see the larger economic picture could end up doing incalculable damage to the promise of an India free from hunger, disease and deprivation.

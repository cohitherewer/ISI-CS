	Lesser mortals                  
	Sir  No congratulation is enough for Ashok Guha, who highlighted the woes of the three gifted Banerjees, all of whom excelled in their debut Test series, which also turned out to be their last Test (A debut that led nowhere, June 2). While Montu and Shute Banerjee garnered as many as five wickets each in their only Test, Subroto Tara Banerjee captured the three crucial wickets of Taylor, Marsh and Mark Waugh in the very first innings of his Test debut. But he was not given the opportunity to bowl in the second innings. In the triangular series in Australia (1991-92), S.T. Banerjee made a sensational one-day international debut against West Indies. But a single failure in South Africa (1992-93) was enough to put a permanent seal on his ODI career. The tragic tales of the Banerjees are neither stray cases nor the results of a jinx  they make up a cold-blooded conspiracy against Bengali cricketers.          
	In an unofficial tour of Sri Lanka in the early 1970s, apart from Sunil Gavaskar, the only other player to score a century was Gopal Bose. But people like Ramnath Parkar, Kenia Jayantilal and M.L. Jaisimha went on to open the innings for India, while Bose was constantly ignored. In recent cricket, take the example of the differential treatment accorded to Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. Failure to perform well in his debut ODI (1991-92) saw Gangulys exclusion from the team for four years. But Dravid was retained even though he scored very few runs initially.          
	Ranadeb Bose was not only one of the leading bowlers in the Ranji Trophy matches of 2006-07, but he also fared much better than Ishant Sharma. During the England tour of 2007, Bose took five wickets against Sri Lanka-A while Sharma did not do as well. But the latter was provided with immense opportunities to cement his place in the Indian team as Bose was left out in the cold. Even Saradindu Mukherjee excelled in the 1991 Asia Cup where he took the crucial wicket of Aravinda de Silva in the finals at Eden Gardens. But he did not get another chance to play. Pranab Roy, Deep Dasgupta, Shib Shankar Paul and Utpal Chatterjee could all have had successful cricketing careers had they received the patronage enjoyed by some of their contemporaries.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

                
	Sir  While feeling sorry about the forgotten Banerjees of Indian cricket, one cannot but wonder about the truth value of Ashok Guhas parochial defence of Sourav Ganguly. There are reasons to believe that Ganguly was not considered initially for a Test berth because of his attitude  it is said that even as the 12th man, he refused to carry the drinks during the 1992 Australia tour. Hence, the nickname, Maharajah. Nobody  no matter how talented he is  is bigger than the game. In spite of his arrogance and his record of being the worst fielder in the side, Ganguly was given a chance to play for India. For revealing his true colours, Ganguly should be grateful to Greg Chappell, who had the courage to call a spade a spade. It is Chappell who highlighted the sycophantic cronyism prevalent in Indian cricket, which thrives on, and exults in, hero-worship. That is possibly why we have more stars than performers.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Ashoke P. Mahtani, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Perhaps most of those Indian cricketers who are given the chance to play consistently in the international arena have the strong backing of an important personality either in the dressing room or in the boardroom. If it werent for the support of the then skipper, Sourav Ganguly, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was out for a duck in his debut innings, might not have been given the opportunity to realize his potential. To the list of the jinxed Bengali players provided by Ashok Guha in his article, one must add Ranadeb Bose. One of the most consistent and effective bowlers in various domestic tournaments for more than a year, this pacer was repeatedly ignored by the selectors.          
	In India, cricket enjoys more media attention than any other sport does. Every decision of the Board of Control for Cricket in India is subject to intense media scrutiny. But the fact that Baichung Bhutia played alongside renowned footballers such as Zinedine Zidane, Didier Drogba and Kak in a charity football match received just a passing mention in the media. True, the nation has seen the emergence of sporting stars such as Vijender Kumar, Saina Nehwal or Sania Mirza. But the sports they play lag far behind cricket so far as the media are concerned.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Anirvan Sengupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  As an ardent lover of sports, especially cricket, I could relate to every fact stated by Ashok Guha in his article. The episode concerning S.T. Banerjee, on which Guha dwelled at length, brought to the fore some details hitherto unknown to many lovers of the game  especially to those belonging to the younger generation. The injustice suffered by Banerjee, a pace bowler, is a testimony of the disregard that has been the fate of players from Bengal since the mid-1930s. The less said about Sourav Gangulys misfortune, the better. He had to wait till 1996 to come back to the Indian squad, after which he went on to become one of the best captains India has ever produced. Guha has done a great service by talking about the problems that ail not only cricket but also sports in general in India  regionalism, power-mongering among the high-ups, and the sports ministrys casual approach towards hardworking sportspersons.          
	Yours faithfully, P.B. Saha, Calcutta

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	The unkindest cut                  
	Sir  It is shameful that some self-styled moralists, purportedly belonging to a womens association affiliated with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), should find it necessary to destroy art to advance their cause of feminism (Burp, morality goes grazing! Nov 26). On a similar pretext, the Taliban had destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas. If such morality is allowed in the world of art, neither Greek sculptures nor the works of Picasso would have had the chance to survive. Such misguided puritanism should be stopped at once.           
	Yours faithfully,         Keron Bhattacharya, Nottingham, UK 
        
	Clean the stables          
	Sir  While defending himself in the land scam, the Karnataka chief minister, B.S. Yeddyurappa, had said that his son was allotted a plot because he was entitled to it in his capacity as a member of parliament (Come clean, Nov 19). This brings to mind the recent clamour by a few members of Delhis legislative assembly who reportedly demanded Commonwealth Games flats at a subsidized rate.           
	Even earlier, the Haryana government had proposed that MPs and MLAs from the state be given plots in Chandigarh and flats in Gurgaon. Evidently, neither the ruling party at the Centre nor members of the Opposition object to such looting of public resources. In fact, the spoils are shared by politicians of all parties. A legislation covering all states should be passed that would ban the granting of public property in a preferential manner. Yeddyurappa should spell out the specific provisions of the law that were used to denotify land for his relatives. Such provisions should be deleted from all rule books so that politicians cannot take recourse to them.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  The chief minister of Karnataka has cited the misdeeds of his predecessors to defend his nepotism. This is most disappointing. The Bharatiya Janata Party was considered to be a party with a difference that swore by service, sacrifice and patriotism.           
	B.S. Yeddyurappa should have pointed out the unethical practices of others and sworn never to indulge in these himself. He has given the BJP a bad name.          
	Yours faithfully,       
B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore 

                
	Sir  India can prosper only when its politicians stop clinging to power. The early communists and saffronites showed such selflessness. But things are different today. The main aim of our politicians is to amass wealth. Ashok Chavan, A. Raja and B.S. Yeddyurappa have all tried to do this. Once an allegation is made against a leader, he should step down and not return to office till his name is cleared. Voters should ensure that their representatives are honest by electing only those who are clean.           
	Yours faithfully,       
M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh 

                          
	Out of sight           
	Sir  The information and broadcasting ministry has correctly decided to give the reality show, Bigg Boss, a late-night slot (Censor thyself, Nov 19). Most viewers of such programmes are adolescents who cannot distinguish between right and wrong. Protection from the vulgarity on display in reality shows is necessary for these children. But parents, rather than the government, should do the monitoring. They should refrain from watching indecent programmes before children go to bed.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta

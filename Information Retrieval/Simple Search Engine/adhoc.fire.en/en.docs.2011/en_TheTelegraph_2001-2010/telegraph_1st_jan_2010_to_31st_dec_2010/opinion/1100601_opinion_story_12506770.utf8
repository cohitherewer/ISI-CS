                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FLUID STATE                                                    
	Political coalitions in India have more to do with numbers than with principles or programmes. Shibu Soren had no choice but to quit as Jharkhands chief minister because he had no hope of mustering the numbers to win the confidence vote in the state legislature. His exit may suit the Bharatiya Janata Partys immediate plans, but it is by no means an end to the troubled relations between the BJP and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha. The next round of political intrigue in Jharkhand is likely to be a tussle between the two parties over Mr Sorens successor. The BJP may have been successful in forcing his exit, but it cannot hope to be in power in Jharkhand without the JMMs help. But Mr Soren may prove to be a bigger problem as an enemy than he had been as an ally. This is for the simple reason that he will continue to call the shots in the JMM. Even if the BJP-JMM alliance manages to agree on the next chief minister, the coalition will continue to be under the shadow of another break-up. The manner in which the two parties first agreed and then disagreed on having their own chief ministers by rotation showed the extent of mutual distrust between them.        
	However, the governor, M.O.H Farook, has little option but to give the parties in Jharkhand enough time and opportunity to form a government. Mr Sorens government lasted barely five months. No party seems to favour another election or another spell of presidents rule at this stage. Since its founding as a new state 10 years ago, Jharkhand has had six chief ministers and several short-lived governments. Politicians of the state have done all they could to frustrate the aspirations of the tribal people for whom the new state promised a new beginning. Unstable governments and unscrupulous politicians have together created an administrative void that has proved to be disastrous for a state facing a huge Maoist threat. Mr Farooks choices are not easy because it is difficult to know which way the politicians would turn in order to garner the numbers for a legislative majority. But he should consider presidents rule only as a last resort. The idea behind this is not to give the politicians time to play games, but to give the people a government, however unwieldy, and some semblance of an administration. The alternative is to allow the political and administrative vacuum to get worse.

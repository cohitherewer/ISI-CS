	According to the National Crime Records Bureau, West Bengal was the state with the highest number of suicides in 2005. In 2007, the NCRB confirmed that the state also accounted for the highest percentage of teen suicides in India. West Bengal, as cynics may gleefully exclaim, can always be trusted to hold on to its pride of place among the biggest losers in the country. But cynicism is hardly an honourable response when children as young as 14 or less are impelled to kill themselves with shocking readiness. The commonly attributed causes  family feuds, thwarted romance, the pressure to excel academically  are more confusing than convincing. Dysfunctional family, unrequited love and blind ambition were facts of life even a decade ago. Yet the young back then did not give up with such alacrity. The burden of education, and its related frustration, has undoubtedly increased over the years. Families have disintegrated bit by bit, friendship has moved on from the real to the virtual plane. But there appears to be something beyond loneliness, despair or shame that keeps eluding even psychiatrists, who can expertly rationalize why someone chose to stop living. So it is telling that in 2008, around 16 per cent children up to 14 killed themselves for unspecified reasons.        
	The 2005 NCRB figures showed that an overwhelming 99 per cent suicides occurred in rural Bengal. Even teen suicides tend to be higher in the districts. It would be unthinking to juxtapose the trials of city children on those faced by their counterparts in the villages. Poverty, unemployed parents, being forced to drop out of school, early marriage, child labour, domestic abuse, and myriad other truths deadlier than jilted love or broken families lead boys and girls in the suburbs to self-destruction. In 2007, a girl killed herself just because her siblings had eaten up the little rice that the family had got after weeks while she was taking a bath. In standard medical jargon, the cause of her death would probably be unknown. That would help the State disown all responsibility and make a scapegoat of flawed parenting.

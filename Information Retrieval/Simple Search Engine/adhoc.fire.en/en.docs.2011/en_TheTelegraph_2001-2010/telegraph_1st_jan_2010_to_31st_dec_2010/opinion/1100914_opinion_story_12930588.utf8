	There seems to be a tremendous eagerness all round to do complicated sums. The Union cabinet has decided to clear the clouds of dust raised by the suggestion to include caste on the list of questions in census enumeration. It has stated that caste enumeration will be a separate exercise, starting June 2011, after the main census enumeration is over. This would entail not only an expenditure of Rs 2,000 crore over and above the reported cost of Rs 2,240 crore of the main enumeration, but it would also require meticulous dovetailing of data by the office of the registrar general of India. The only possible argument in favour of caste enumeration in a nation professedly aspiring to a casteless society would be the better targeting of social justice policies. This can only be done by matching caste with the socio-economic, demographic and educational data recorded in the main census. By breaking the exercise up into two, the government is doubling the gigantic task, multiplying the difficulties and enlarging the possibility of grave mistakes. What happens if the numbers do not tally at all? And even if they do  here much is being expected of the fresh records of the national population register  why take on the vast task of matching households?        
	The dust has cleared; there is now only impenetrable smog. Apparently, the decision for a separate caste census was taken, at least in part, in response to fears of inflation of numbers during the main census if caste had been added. Common sense suggests that such fears were rather fantastical, since the census digs into too many details about each member of the family for the creation of non-existent members. And such distortion has not occurred in the data on scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. But a separate caste census is really tempting the imagination of plenty. That links up easily to reports that the other backward classes lobbies pushed for the separate caste census. Their politics depends quite noticeably on numbers. So the governments decision may have, appropriately, caste behind it as before it. It would rather condemn its officials to impossible sums than ignore the OBC lobby. But to go ahead, the government will have to consider another sum. The vast army of teachers and other workers needed for a census is likely to go back to work after completing the first exercise. Where will an equivalent army come from?

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        WANING BLOOM                                                                  
	North Calcutta still has a few, and so do the older parts of Bhowanipore. The roak, that hospitable platform  the deck in American  ensconcing the few steps up to the entrance of a house, recalling the daoa in rural homes, that was transformed into one of the indispensable ingredients of the daily urban adda. Imagine that immortal Pataldanga icon, Tenida, with no roak beneath his fictional back. The dismantling of the roak has meant the disappearance of a certain pace of life, a form of leisure and a way of talking, arguing and relating to others. Of course, other forms of adda have emerged. But the image of the regulars at the adda in each para or locality or even lane, of different ages, voluble and male and eternally in the same place, has vanished.        
	Not that women did not have a wonderful time inside the house, reclining on a big bed, perhaps, or sitting around making paan. That too was architecture-specific, and needed more women in the household than a nuclear family could have provided. The disappearance of the roak  or of the vestiges of the andarmahal  is merely symbolic of numerous and rapid changes: in politics, economics, demography, family structure, types of job, in the breath and shape of Calcutta life itself.        
	The old adda was somehow distinctly male, both loud and visible; women merely gossiped. Only the most gifted male writer could capture the differences in register, vocabulary and quality of humour between the adda outside and inside the house. It was as if the language bloomed and flourished. The new adda is no longer gendered, and young people converse as agitatedly and excitedly as their forbears did in both old and new spaces, taking their passions from the street corner to new, glass-fronted coffee shops, right into chatrooms in the virtual universe. And no one language can suffice. At least three languages, mixed in, mixed up, fertilizing one another and giving birth to ever new coinages and gestures  almost unintelligible to one looking back at roaks  flow uninhibitedly. The adda keeps reinventing itself. But the language of that old Bengali adda, chaste or abusive, slyly creative, incisive, poetic, flamboyant, or foaming at the mouth, has lost itself in shrugs and grimaces, in literal translations from English or Hindi, in fearsome notions of spellings and pronunciations, and an indescribably painful fall-rise pattern that can erase it from memory forever.                    BHASWATI CHAKRAVORTY

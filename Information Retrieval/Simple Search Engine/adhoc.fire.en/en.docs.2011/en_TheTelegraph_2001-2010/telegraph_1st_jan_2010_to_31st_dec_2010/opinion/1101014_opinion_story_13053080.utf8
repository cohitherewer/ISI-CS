                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SILENT GREETING                                  Neha Sahay                              
	The world may be excited about a Chinese dissident getting the Nobel Peace Prize but here, Liu Xiaobos name barely crops up. The only people talking about Xiaobo to foreigners are other expats, many of whom feel that the choice is a political one designed to embarrass China.        
	But as usual, the Chinese Communist Party has overreacted. All references in print and on the internet to Xiaobo or the prize itself have been censored in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Central Propaganda Department. This has happened before, but this time, even SMSes were censored. One man tweeted that the SIM card on his iPhone got deactivated after he texted his father the news of the Nobel. Tweets are the only medium that cannot be censored. And it is through tweets that the individuals actually carrying out the censorship are passing out information. One of them tweeted, Ive deleted so much my hands are sore.        
	But the real hard work was done by the police, who went around preventing celebrations by small groups that were organized through tweets and blogs. People were detained at different police stations, or placed under house arrest and their internet connections disabled. Some potential celebration venues were shut down for the day. According to one tweet, Xiaobos alma mater, Jilin University, has been ordered not to give any interviews on its world-famous alumnus.        
	There was really no need for all this. Given his activities, Xiaobo is not the kind of man who would be famous among ordinary people. Unlike many other dissidents, he has not got into confrontations with local governments over local issues. He was a prominent figure during the Tiananmen Square movement, but an entire generation has grown up after it, and even those who have graduated from university never mention it even in serious discussions.                 
	Cold fury        
	Nor did Charter 08  the document demanding the constitution be amended to guarantee freedom, human rights and democracy, which Xiaobo co-authored in 2008, and for which he was convicted in 2009  get much publicity, even though around 10,000 people ended up signing it. Some of them even signed a letter to the Nobel Peace Prize committee, urging it to award the prize to Xiaobo.         
	Hence Chinas heavy-handed panic. Ironically, the official newspaper, China Daily, itself mentioned Xiaobo getting the peace prize twice in the space of four days. First, it carried a reaction by the foreign ministry spokesman, and then an opinion piece by a staffer. Both pieces described Xiaobo as a criminal. Readers responded likewise on the papers online forum: one reader vowed to give up Norwegian salmon (served in high-end, Western- style cafes); another promised to boycott Norwegian prostitutes in Macaus casinos.         
	Obviously, the English-knowing elite here now knows all about Xiaobo. And since Chinas censorship does not extend to Hong Kong and to Macau, the thousands travelling to and from the mainland everyday to these two specially administered regions would know that one of their dissidents has been honoured internationally.         
	Incidentally, China sees this as the second time the Nobel Peace Prize has gone to someone it disapproves of; the first occasion being the Dalai Lama winning the prize in 1989. It concludes, therefore, that the prize is nothing but a means to interfere in its domestic affairs. Peace, in Beijings lexicon, stands for a good rapport among nations, at the heart of which lies mutual respect and non-interference in each others domestic affairs, said the opinion piece in China Daily. And, perhaps to some peoples disbelief, this Nobel Peace Prize, as was true 21 years back, angered not just the government. Most Chinese would prefer to handle their own affairs without outside interference.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Dam right, they need to be safe
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        DAM RIGHT, THEY NEED TO BE SAFE                                  The government introduced the Dam Safety Bill recently to streamline the system of safety and maintenance of dams. But the bill may have some critical flaws, says   Abimanyu Nagarajan                          Life line: The Amaravathi Dam at Amaravathinagar in Tamil Nadu                                        
	When it comes to dams, what usually springs to mind is the decades-old debate on whether or not building them justifies the displacement of thousands of local people. The issue of dam safety is rarely dwelt upon. Yet maintaining proper safety procedures is critical to dams. To address this, the government recently introduced the Dam Safety Bill in Parliament, so that the whole system of dam maintenance and safety can be toned up and streamlined. The bill has now been referred to the parliamentary standing committee on water resources for review.         
	India is home to around 5,100 large dams. All dams in a state fall under the purview of that particular state. In other words, the latter is responsible for its day-to-day running, maintenance, and safety. There is, however, a central Dam Safety Organisation (DSO), based in Delhi, but this body can only give recommendations to the states. Unless a state approaches it for advice, the DSO cannot take steps to correct any flaws or damages in dams.         
	Says a senior official with the DSO (who does not wish to be named), People are not aware of the problems with dams. All the attention is given to dam construction. Once built, everyone assumes they will always work. But they are huge assets and need to be protected properly.         
	Dam safety refers, firstly, to the physical and technical maintenance of the dam itself. Failure to do so could lead to leaks or breaks in the dam. And this could have catastrophic consequences  a major breach in a dam could cause the river to flood downstream and endanger the lives of many people.         
	The water level in the reservoir also needs to be carefully monitored. Unpredictable fluctuations in the water level could leave people with either too little water or give rise to flooding.         
	Experts agree that given the average age of dams in India, many of them are not in peak condition. Around 75 per cent of all our large dams are over 25 years old. Nearly 200  such as the Jaswant Sagar dam in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, or the Mullaperiyar dam on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border  are over a 100 years old.         
	As dams age, not only do their machinery suffer wear and tear, but the natural conditions under which they were built may also change. Hence, that too needs to be addressed. For example, one 25-year-old dam we inspected has a water storage capacity set to suit the conditions of the area at that time, says the DSO official. But we found that its water storage capacity needed to go up by at least twice its current level.         
	This is where the Dam Safety Bill comes into play. The bill seeks to give more powers to the DSO and allow it to set up smaller bodies to build a sort of a chain of command. At the lowest tier, a chief engineer will be a dams DSO officer, above which would be a state level body, and finally a national body  the Central Dam Safety Organisation  which will oversee the day-to-day operations of dams all over the country. The central body is supposed to ask the local dam officials to submit mandatory status reports, conduct periodic inspections, and set up a disaster management plan and an emergency action plan.               
	However, experts point out that the law, though a laudable initiative, will be hamstrung by the fact that it will not automatically extend to all dams. States will need to pass a resolution to adopt the guidelines set by the law. And if they choose not to, then nothing changes. So far, only Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal have passed a resolution to adopt the bill.         
	The other problem is that there is no provision to penalise those who fail to maintain the safety standards. Says Himanshu Thakkar, a co-ordinator with the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, a non governmental organisation, We are not just talking about the safety of the dam itself, but also that of the people who live downstream and in the surrounding areas. So action must be taken against those who violate safety norms.         
	Latha Anantha, head of research at the River Research Centre, a public interest trust based in Thrissur, Kerala, agrees. The entire focus of the bill is on day-to-day maintenance. But dam safety is not only about maintenance. It needs to be more comprehensive. There has to be safety provisions for both dam construction and provisions to deal with officials who fail to keep the dam running properly, she says.         
	However, those who were involved in the process of drafting the bill say that there were reasons for omitting the penalty provision. First, not all dams have the same size and scope. The fallout caused by one dam breach may be very different from that in another dam. So it would be difficult to have the same set of penalties for every kind of negligence. Also, says the DSO official, there was the apprehension that dam officials would not report damage for fear of being penalised.         
	But Thakkar dismisses these arguments. If a disaster happens, then the people in charge will have to take responsibility. There will be repercussions anyway. Why not include a system of punishment before something goes wrong?        
	Others point out that the government needs to bring in more transparency in the entire process of dam safety and maintenance. Says Sripad Dharmadhikari, a Pune-based activist on dams and water issues, The public has no access to a dams disaster management plan.         
	The problem, says Dharmadhikari, is further compounded by the lack of independent monitoring of dams. All the people involved with the process are part of the same system. Dams need to be monitored by people not affiliated to government bodies or groups.         
	It is, of course, too early to judge the bill, which is with the parliamentary review committee. But one hopes that the government will take into account the concerns of experts and come up with a law that will ensure that Indias dams remain safe and sound.

	Justice is not easy to achieve; neither does it allow for shortcuts. The government of Orissa has decided to impose conditions of employment on companies entering the state. These companies would have to reserve 90 per cent of the jobs in the unskilled and semi-skilled categories for local people, 60 per cent in the skilled group and 30 per cent in the supervisory and managerial segment. The industries minister of the state has elucidated that the local people would first be from among those displaced by the project, and second, from among people domiciled in the state. The companies would be free to look around only for their senior executives. This policy has obviously been evolved to quieten heightening discontent over the employment of large numbers of non-Oriyas in the new private sector projects. Although the state has brought in investments worth Rs 6 lakh crore recently, it would seem that the promise of prosperity is being snatched away from the people who live closest to the projects.        
	But that is thinking for the short term  and the short view. Only the free movement of labour allows industry the choice of the most suitable workforce, and that alone is the best route to the development of any region. It is not enough to claim that the companies will find all the talent and skill they need locally since industrial training institutes are coming up in every block in Orissa. Providing immediate relief to local populations through fixed conditions of employment may seem to be a priority, but that point of view is political rather than economic. Apart from the possibility of affecting the quality of the product, protectionist policies of this kind will inevitably lead to competitive regionalism, preventing the talents, skills, and aspirations of one region from their application and fulfilment in another. The mirroring of the proposed Orissa model in industry would promote precisely the wrong kind of competition, focusing on a corner rather than on the whole of the talent pool. The disruption of lives and livelihoods of people must be compensated for through a deeper understanding of their needs. Training in skills may certainly be one of those. But if the government decides to facilitate the entry of industry, it must also arrange for the proper rehabilitation of displaced populations in all good faith, whatever money, energy, planning and sympathy that may require.

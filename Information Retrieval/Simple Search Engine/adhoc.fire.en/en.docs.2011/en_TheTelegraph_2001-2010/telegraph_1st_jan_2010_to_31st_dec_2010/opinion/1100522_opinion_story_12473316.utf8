The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Two women, one story
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TWO WOMEN, ONE STORY                                  THEATRE: Ananda Lal                                                  
	Calcuttans wishing to learn about the strange yet true history of performing artists in this city, especially the trials of the trailblazing women among them over a 100 years ago, must see the Bengali biodramas on Binodini Dasi and Gauhar Jan. Although they worked in separate forms  Bengali theatre and Hindustani music, respectively  their lives traced similar trajectories of socially disreputable background, ascent to dizzying fame, their largesse and humility, male exploitation of their genius, and still-inadequately-researched disappearance into obscurity or penury in their later years.        
	In Natyarangas Binodini Katha, the author, Surajit Bandyopadhyay, uses Binodinis story in a closely Pirandellian structure, as a group rehearses Nati Binodini in the course of which the characters break out into unscripted scenes and speeches, contesting the directors presentation. Interestingly, the actors refer to contemporary activity too, observing that women in performance face discrimination even today, and asking why the government cannot correct the historical insult to Binodini by renaming Star Theatre after her, the promise her colleagues had broken. Unfortunately, Anindita Bandyopadhyay (picture) does not do justice to the roles multiplicity, which demands that she not only enact herself plus Binodini, but also Binodinis very famous portrayals of several parts. Instead, she affects one theatrical stance throughout which would not have made Binodini a star. Chayanika Saha is much more natural as fellow actress Kshetramani. Surajit Bandyopadhyay depicts a nuanced Girish Chandra Ghosh, a guru who betrays his protge. Chandan Bag adopts a good Hindi accent as Gurmukh Rai, Binodinis besotted admirer. Director Swapan Sengupta evokes some humour when the actor playing the owner, Pratap Johuri, keeps forgetting his lines, but he should make the directors on stage react more when their rehearsal threatens to disintegrate.         
	Akhors fascinating Jan-e-Kalkatta derives its main impact from the lead, featuring Anandee Basus superlative singing as Gauhar Jan, the Armenian girl who became the Nightingale of Bengal and one of our pioneer recording artists. Basu emulates Gauhar by delivering not just classical songs but novelties in Bengali, Punjabi, Marwari and English as well. Once again, the legendary personality poses a huge challenge, and Basu could improve her characterization with greater attention to Gauhars national celebrity status and dancing prowess. Dramatist-director Bhadra Basu incorporates a large dramatis personae of 30 named cameos, conveying the wide range of people with whom Gauhar came into contact. Krishna Sinha gives her mother, Malkajan, solid stage presence. Gaps always remain in a two-hour biography, but Gauhars final career in Mysore, where she apparently died of a broken heart, surely merited treatment.

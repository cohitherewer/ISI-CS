                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO DUAL ROLE                                                    
	In India, cricket and politics have unfortunately come together. Even senior and powerful politicians, who hold portfolios in the Union cabinet, fight hard to control the Board of Control for Cricket in India and, beyond that, to become the president of the International Cricket Council. Sharad Pawar, the supremo of the Nationalist Congress Party and the minister of agriculture, food and civil supplies, is the obvious case in point. Mr Pawar has just discovered, however, that in terms of work it is not possible to be responsible to his ministerial duties and to the obligations he has brought upon himself by becoming the president of the ICC. Cricket and politics are both making demands on his time. To resolve this, he has taken the somewhat unique step of requesting the prime minister to reduce his workload. This means Mr Pawar wants to spend less time working as a cabinet minister so that he can devote more time to his new job of managing international cricket. This is an untenable position. A cabinet ministers job is a full-time one paid for by the Indian taxpayer. Mr Pawar is expected to devote all his time and energies to that job as a public servant. He has to choose between being a minister and being the president of the ICC. If he is that keen to be a cricket administrator, he should resign as a minister.        
	The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, should firmly turn down Mr Pawars request and explain to him his duties and responsibilities as a cabinet minister. The portfolios that Mr Pawar holds are critical at a time when the shadow of inflation is looming over the Indian economy. The management of agriculture and food supplies demands more attention than usual. This means that Mr Pawar has to spend more, not less, time in his ministries. He cannot run away from his responsibilities to Dubai even during the weekends. If Mr Pawars conscience does not permit him to choose between the ICC and being a cabinet minister, the prime minister should force him to make a choice. The prime minister should tell his cabinet colleague in no uncertain terms that he cannot continue to do two demanding jobs because that degrades his position as a cabinet minister and also betrays the trust that the prime minister, on behalf of taxpayers, has bestowed on him. Mr Pawar has made a career in politics, he should not allow cricket to clean bowl him.

	What makes a best-seller in India? That is, quite literally, the big question that has long occupied the minds of writers, agents and publishers. There are many who claim to have the answer, but with the rapid advances in print and communications technology leading to a vast expansion and diversification of media and entertainment outlets, the old criterion of the number of copies sold is not sufficient to define a best-seller.         
	Should rights like translations, television/film rights and digitalization of editions also be included in a proper definition of a best-seller today? Should the totality of the market and its various segments be included in the final reckoning to optimize the sales potential of a book because publishers are no longer interested only in the print editions?         
	But first, the traditional definition of a best-seller. A best-seller is a book which sells more copies than other books. That difference, although an obvious one, is the single most important point to bear in mind. It is the yardstick by which wholesalers or the big book-sellers define a best-seller. People must want to buy it; not just a few but lots of people, which means that the book must have broad appeal. For instance, a book on the mating habits of jungle fowls may be well-written and researched but it will appeal only to a limited market. What this means is that most best-sellers fall in the fiction category. How can we tell a book has what it takes? Does it have all the qualities that are common to most best-selling novels, which make us want to buy them and thereafter spread the word around?         
	These qualities, which have been spelled out in any number of How to Write books, are as follows:        
	Plot: A good story is one that is interesting, possibly exciting, and, above all, pleasurable from beginning to end. There should be an element of uncertainty or unanswered questions built into the text that would keep the reader turning the pages to find the answers.        
	Believability: One-dimensional characters who do not come to life on the page will not make a best-seller; we all have multiple identities and this must be reflected in the story. There must be characters the reader comes to know and either love, hate, laugh or empathize with.        
	Accessibility: A book that will be read by a large number of people must be written in a language that is easily understood. For the Indian market, this is perhaps the most important factor because of the falling standards of language.         
	Ease of reading: A book, it is now said, is just a subdivision of the entertainment industry. Simplicity, clarity, purity of style are the guiding principles and they come from being true to your natural style.        
	Description and subtlety: Describe events and emotions rather than stating bald facts that can become tedious after a bit. It is more important to show readers what is happening than to tell them the obvious.         
	Title: An eye-catching, imaginative title is helpful in attracting the initial interest of an agent or publisher. On publication, the title is important in making the browser pick up the book.        
	But the six-point formula may not be quite enough. You would still need that little spark to make it tick. Some call it luck, some, having the right book in the market at the right time and some, having all the four Ps: practice, perseverance, passion and patience. Selling the print edition is just one half of the battle; the more important part is selling the various rights that are rapidly becoming more lucrative than the traditional book. But this is a complicated world that has to be negotiated by literary agents and other professionals  authors and publishers can seldom do it on their own.

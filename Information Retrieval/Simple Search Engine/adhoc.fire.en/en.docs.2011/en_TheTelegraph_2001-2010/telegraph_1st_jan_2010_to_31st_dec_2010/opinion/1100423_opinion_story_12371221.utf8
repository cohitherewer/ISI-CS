                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AMOUR PROPRE                                                    
	A kerfuffle has the propensity to deflect attention from major issues. Thus, of the many issues raised by the Indian Premier League and its shenanigans the ones that have grabbed attention are the personality of Lalit Modi and corruption. To an extent this is inevitable, since the IPL is Mr Modis brainchild and whatever his alleged misdeeds he must be given credit for conceiving and executing an immensely popular form of mass entertainment. Short of Bollywood films, it is difficult to think of any other branch of entertainment that has captured the Indian masses in the manner that the IPL has. Thus, whatever happens to Mr Modi will grab attention. The other aspect is corruption, a theme that never fails to excite interest in India, despite  or perhaps  because of its all-pervasive presence in India. Without in any way diminishing the moral aspects of corruption, it needs to be noted that within the IPL controversy are issues that are perhaps more profound than the achievements or otherwise of one individual and the alleged presence of corruption in the operations of the IPL.        
	One such issue is impropriety and its obverse. Participation in public life demands a following of a strict code of proper behaviour. The word code is used advisedly, since all forms of proper behaviour cannot be defined by law or in legal terms. Convention and example decide forms of propriety and impropriety. There is nothing in law that says a minister should offer to stand down after a major scandal or disaster but convention demands such a gesture as a point of honour. Nothing in law forbids a member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India from bidding for a team, but the moot question is, should it be done? It took Shashi Tharoor some time to comprehend that he had been guilty of a gross impropriety by acting as a mentor for a consortium that included a close associate. The IPL controversy, perhaps for the first time, has brought issues relating to improper behaviour into the public discourse and to public attention. Its fallout will make people in public life  in government and in business  reflect seriously on not just the legality of their actions but on their propriety as well. This could well be the only silver lining to the IPL cloud. It is a result that no one quite intended but it is a consummation devoutly to be wished for.

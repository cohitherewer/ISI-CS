	Stock market valuations of Indian banks are distorted. Most of them are owned by the government. That gives them a veneer of solidity; the quality of their assets has little impact on market value. The government does not sell or buy; so market transactions are only between private shareholders, who hold a small share of the equity. The big private investors are institutions; many of them follow mechanical rules for asset allocation. So a certain proportion of private capital goes into bank shares regardless, and share prices reflect its inflows.         
	This, however, is an exceptional situation if we look around the world. Whilst many governments run development finance institutions  institutions that give long-term capital to companies the governments approve of or want to promote  government ownership of banks is not common; it was even less common before the upheavals of past two years. Private investors dominate, and their risk perception and performance expectations are reflected in the market valuation of banks. The changes in valuation give us telling evidence of where investors think global banking is headed. Just over a year ago, the Royal Bank of Scotland was the worlds most valued bank, with a market value of $3.8 trillion; it has shrunk to $20 billion. The Deutsche Bank was next, with a market value of $3 trillion, now reduced to $26 billion. The third most valuable bank was BNP Paribas at $2.5 trillion, which has come down to $43 billion. The fourth bank was Citigroup worth $2.1 trillion, now down to $21 billion; the fifth was the Union Bank of Switzerland worth $2 trillion, now valued at $34 billion.         
	As can be seen from the recent valuations, the relative value of banks has changed considerably. Now, the three most valuable banks of the world are Chinese  the ICBC at $178 billion, the China Construction Bank Corporation at $134 billion, and the Bank of China at $112 billion. It shows what a difference Chinas export-led, government-driven growth has made. It is not just the way banks are managed and funded that makes a difference to market valuation; it is mostly the banks prospects, which are obviously better for Chinese banks. None of the Indian banks compares with the big Chinese banks, but a number of them now do with global banks. The ICICI Bank is currently the most valuable at $20 billion, but the HDFC, the HDFC Bank and the State Bank of India are not far behind at $12-16 billion. The way the Indian government has managed the economy is no doubt a factor in their advance. But the way it has controlled the banking industry is a factor in their not having advanced to the peaks as Chinese banks have done. Two of the controls are on the opening of new bank branches and extending business abroad. Whilst controls on forays abroad make sense, it is time the government decontrolled branch opening and new bank entry.

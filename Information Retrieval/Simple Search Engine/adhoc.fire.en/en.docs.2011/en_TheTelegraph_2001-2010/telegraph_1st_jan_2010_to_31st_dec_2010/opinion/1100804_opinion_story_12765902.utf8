	If India was hoping to prove something to the world by winning its bid for the Commonwealth Games, then the run-up to the games is showing up their organizers in a shockingly perverse light. The organizing committee, especially its chairman, seems to be hell-bent on putting out to the world a rather shameful mix of corruption, brazenness and inefficiency as the characteristic Indian way of meeting a happy challenge. A concerted effort at appearing disgraceful seems to be the only form of concerted effort the games have inspired in the organizers. First, the corruption  and in the highest places. It looks as if the people working most hard in the last couple of months before the games are going to be the Central Vigilance Commission, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate. After all, Indias rank in the international corruption-perception index is 84, an honour it shares with El Salvador, Panama, Guatemala and Thailand. Interestingly, this is a perception index, and the Commonwealth Games are unlikely to make the world perceive India in a kinder light. The commercial stakes, in this case, are huge and global. Then, the inefficiency. Every realistic inspection of the state of the art in Delhi has resulted in public expressions of deep alarm at the spectacular unreadiness evident everywhere. Unmet deadlines, leaks, overflows, collapse, casualties, lack of coordination, compromised standards: the list is endless, but not unfamiliar.        
	Finally, the callousness. To spruce the city up for the worlds gaze, offending human elements  beggars, slum or pavement dwellers, hawkers, rickshaw-pullers  are hastily being moved out of sight without proper rehabilitation schemes in place for them. To enable desperate last-minute construction (the inevitable result of sloth and bad planning higher up), labourers are being hired without proper wages and protection. There has been a significant number of accidents, many of them fatal, among the poorest of these workers, now working round the clock to make up for their employers lack of organization, discipline and scruple. A senior sports official has invoked the typical Indian wedding to explain his optimism about the games in the face of all this: there will be confusion till the last minute, but everything will go off smoothly at the end. The world is not amused so far, neither is the Indian taxpayer.

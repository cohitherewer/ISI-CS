	Hanging on like death                
	Excess: The Tehelka Book of Stories (Hachette, Rs 250) edited by Jai Arjun Singh and Nisha Susan is simply a gem. Everything about this neatly designed book  from the beautiful cover to the stories inside  is a treat. In the preface, Much of a muchness, one of the editors, Nisha Susan, justifies the title and the collections theme. This is a country of too much. Rivers of ghee, garlands of crores, coconuts flung as acts of violence, deaths in the thousands, mass marriages and as journalist P. Sainath once said, a hunger surplus. So children, adults and animals happily go overboard in their love, loathing, cynicism and expectations. The contributors include Manjula Padmanabhan, Mridula Koshy, Tishani Joshi, Kalpana Swaminathan and Anjum Hasan, among others. Rosie by Vivek Narayanan and Sweetlove (Recovered) by Sunetra Gupta are some of the best pieces. But Hanging on Like Death by Hasan stands out. In this story, Neel, a young boy from a dysfunctional family, encounters death in all its absoluteness as his drunkard father dies in an accident. The words he had been rehearsing for his school play are realized in reality: What remains tomorrow could have gone yesterday. The combination of intensity with aloofness makes the story haunting.                        
	A Home for Gori (Roli, Rs 150) by Habib Rehman is described as one mans moving tribute to his dog. It begins on a wet day in July 2005 when the author is about to bury his beloved companion of ten years, Gori, in the shadow of the ruins of Allauddin Khiljis Siri Fort. After the dog has been laid to rest, the narrator looks up from the grave at N Block, Panchsheel Park, and arrives at a decision. However difficult it might be, I would pull down that corner house and rebuild it from scratch, a memorial to a dog who had blessed me with ten years of her life. The book is that corner house, as it were, in which the memory of Gory lives forever. Passionate and loving, this a love story with a difference.                        
	Nearly Departed: Welcome to Weirdsville (HarperCollins, Rs 299) by Rook Hastings is as interesting as the title. Gawky teenagers find some ghosts to keep themselves off studies. Ruthless gangsters are brought in to give chase to the girls, who play their part by getting scared and screaming at full volume. After quite a bit of running around, the children emerge stronger and braver, with one discovering his destiny as a fifteenth generation ghost-hunter and the other coming to know that she is actually a warrior. The spookiest thing about the book is the threat at the end  To be continued.                                  
	The Indian Film Theory: Flames of Sholay, Notes and Beyond (Sampark, Rs 200) by Gaston Roberge discusses the Indian theory of movies, not necessarily the theory of Indian movies, that is, the movies made in India. Not a few of those movies are informed by theories that are not Indian, in the sense that they do not originate from the traditional culture of the Indian performing arts. Roberge seeks to obliterate the difference between commercial movies and art films by taking as his example the Seventies classic, Sholay. The scene to scene analysis of Sholay would delight students of film theory. The book should have been edited more carefully. Incorrect punctuation and a shoddy composition spoil the reading pleasure considerably.                        
	The Chosen One (Harper, Rs 250) by Sam Bourne is claimed to be the biggest challenger to Dan Browns crown. This should give readers a fair idea of what this book is all about, and help them avoid wasting time and money on it.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        BEAUTIFUL ILLUSION                              Sharmila Basu Thakur      Dance                                                
	It was hard to recognize the Art College campus. One was enveloped in the recreated ambience of the courtyard of Puris Jagannath temple, complete with the garland decorations, chanting of mantras, sound of gongs and conch shells, and the diya-lit entrance. Anantara, a new organization, tries to take the performing arts out of the conventional proscenium stage and present them in an ambience where the art form can speak its own story. Orissa Evening was one such attempt by Anantara, presented at the Government College of Art and Craft on March 21.        
	Choreographed by Sharmila Biswas and performed by Biswas and her troupe, chaturanga, an innovative choreographic production, explored nritya, swara, sahitya and tala, the four important elements of a repertoire. Inspired by the principles of Natyashastra, the programme began with mangalyam, an invocatory number. This long and dry ritualistic number was followed by swara-bilas, a metaphor of Raga Charukeshi. Generally a pure dance item, pallavi, based on a particular raga, is a fast-paced number of the Odissi repertoire. Swara-bilas, on the other hand, tried to respond to the swaras or musical notes spontaneously in a slow pace  rhythm was there only to support the melody. Slow, graceful movements and beautiful choreographic patterns brought out the essence of the raga. It was like an alaap, slowly building on rhythm while savouring the flavour of the music.        
	Also, the effect created by the jute mesh in the backdrop, with the hide-and-seek of light and shadow, resulted in a beautiful illusion, which added an extra zest of creativity to the performance. Music was composed by Debasish Sarkar and Ramesh Chandra Das.         
	The next performance, Katha Surpanakha, depicted the story of the Ramayan, but had Surpanakha, the princess of Lanka, as the narrator. The choreography did not show her as evil, but created her as an image of sri. Brilliant accompaniment brought out the dramatic aspect of this number.         
	The concluding number of chaturanga was murchhana, accentuating the special features of the mridanga, the most important instrument of Odissi dance recitals. Melodious music, lyrical movements and crisp mridanga-playing were mingled to capture the joy of rhythm. Dhanurdhar Reddy, a renowned mridanga player, along with Akshaya Guru, Bhima Nayek, Santa Reddy and Bankanidhi Gauda, mesmerized the audience with their performance. The dancers whose excellent understanding of the art form really added a special dimension were Saswati Garai Ghosh, Ayona Bhaduri, Piyali Bhattacharya, Priyanki RoySengupta, Sohini Majumdar and Taniya Mukherjee. The venue design was done by Neeloy Sengupta.

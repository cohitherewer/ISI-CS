	In 1991, at the end of official apartheid in South Africa, when the economic, sports and cultural boycott was lifted, I was part of the first group of artists, intellectuals and political activists who were invited to a festival of Indian arts and culture. We were the first ones to be invited to what was still in the process of becoming a free South Africa because India had been the first country to protest against apartheid when it was imposed and it was the only country to have maintained a consistent boycott of the racist Republic across four decades.        
	In the middle of my trip, I found myself wearing a suit and a tie and rubbing shoulders with officials of the SA cricket board in the club at the Newlands cricket ground. A prominent Jewish politician called Janni Momberg buttonholed me in the bar. India, hey? Great country, but your Mr Nehru made it clear we werent welcome there! In the Fifties, I had a stopover at Delhi airport and I saw a sign, Dogs and South Africans not welcome, and it made me very angry at the time. But now I understand that Mr Nehru was probably right! I forbore to point out to Meneer Momberg that just outside the Newlands club bar there was still, in October 1991, a sign that said, Dogs and Women not allowed. I also silently thanked the wisdom and courage of Mr Nehru and succeeding Indian governments in keeping up the boycott despite huge pressure from the West.        
	When two of us whod stayed on after the festival left after a visit of eight weeks, people seeing us off fought back tears. These were people like us, except, unlike us, as intellectuals they had been living in a zone of crippling deprivation. I know things have changed, one of them told me, but its still so hard to believe. I just dont know if Ill ever see you guys again. Standing there at Cape Town railway station and Joburg airport, I couldnt help thinking this was how people said goodbye in small villages in India, people who couldnt imagine when someone like you would visit them again from the cities of the world outside.        
	I also remember the conversations we had. Many of the people I met, writer, activist, ecologist, musician, priest, film-maker, trouble-maker or cricketer, were all agreed about one thing  Ach, those boycotts bloody worked, they did the job.        
	Which boycotts? India may have been quixotically blockading RSA for 40 years, other, far more important countries were not. The international sports boycott did come early, in bits and pieces from the 1960s and, barring the odd rebel cricket tour, was firmly in place by the mid-1970s. But it was only in the early 1980s, when the disinvestment and the cultural boycotts kicked in from Europe and America, that the isolation began to bite. Despite two huge cheerleaders in Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, by the end of the 1980s the apartheid game was suddenly well and truly up.        
	The boycotts forced the white regime in South Africa to finally recognize the real world and let go of the unreal one they had tried to hang on to for so long. It wasnt that South Africa suddenly lost its racism but people were forced to acknowledge the only reality on offer. I still remember the pin-drop silence when a desi South African friend and I walked into a restaurant with his little daughters in Warmbad, in northern Transvaal. Warmbad was a Boer stronghold, the customers were all white and still not used to coolies and kafirs coming in like they owned the place. I also remember the attitude of the Afrikaner waiters in the first class on the train from Joburg to Cape Town. The only way these men could express their seething racism towards brown-skinned passengers was by an extreme and absurd patronizing unctuousness. It wasnt pretty then and it isnt pretty even now, but its massively different, thanks in no small part to the international boycott campaign of the 1980s.              
	**************        
	I wrote in this paper in 2002 about listening to Amos Oz at that years Edinburgh festival. Oz is one of Israels great contemporary writers and he was very clear about the future that people are so reluctant to accept in Israel/Palestine: there would one day be the Palestinian embassy to the State of Israel and the Israeli embassy to the new State of Palestine, a few kilometres from each other in the shared capital, Jerusalem; both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs had, really, literally, nowhere else to go.        
	Since that talk by Oz, things have become much worse in Israel/Palestine  just as they did across the late 1970s and 1980s in South Africa. The memory of Israel and racist South Africas unflinching support for each other has kicked in again and, despite the many differences, the comparisons have now begun to prevail: all the garlic and crosses of peace talks notwithstanding, the coffin of Count Apartheid is now open again and he is now sitting up and baring his fangs: vastly discriminatory laws, denial of a right to earn a living, denial of access to your farming lands, attacks at will by the army against a largely civilian population, a cutting off of medical supplies, a chopping off of educational basics such as paper, pencils and books, the squeezing out of Palestinians from Jerusalem, all these are actions that remind us most clearly of South African apartheid. The denial of entry to Noam Chomsky is only the most recent of examples of the naked police state being run around Israels supposed democracy; clearly the commissars in the back-office do not like what one of the greatest Jewish intellectuals of our times has to say about their Jewish state.        
	The incident reflects most sharply on Margaret Atwoods defence of her acceptance of the Dan David Prize with Amitav Ghosh, where she says she doesnt believe in cultural boycotts or any kind of blockage to free speech and the exchange of ideas. Israeli authorities are clearly imposing an internal blockade on the Palestinians, where the passage is being squeezed not only of basic necessities but also of intellectual freedom. Nevertheless, a retaliatory boycott of Israel is a far-fetched option. Massive monetary disinvestment would surely hurt, but it would be impossible to organize. A sporting ban will affect Israelis far less than it did the games-obsessed white South Africans, though banning young Israelis from hanging about and getting stoned in Goa might be quite painful for them. The one deprivation that might have had some effect is an academic and cultural one but that, too, is impossible to make effective in these days of the internet.        
	So what can one do? The answer reads more weakly than the actions might play out in reality: you keep questioning Israeli actions, you keep raising hell, you dont worry about being called an anti-Semite or a self-hating Jew, you protest not for efficacy but from a moral standpoint and you dont worry if a much-admired Indian writer like Amitav Ghosh clumps you as being part of a culture of admonition nor if a great writer like Margaret Atwood chooses to boycott a festival in Dubai to protest against censorship but cant find any trace of an attack on freedom of expression in Israel; you remind yourself you didnt stop reading V.S. Naipaul even after hed received honours from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and lapped up their admiration, and you tell yourself that these two are certainly better human beings than the ghastly Lord Vidiamort, so what if their judgment was badly off for once?              
	You also tell yourself that perhaps it doesnt really matter in the current climate if a couple of novelists choose to go and receive honours at Tel Aviv University or if an ageing theorist is denied entry at an Israeli border post; you hope that the really important event of the last few weeks, perhaps a portent of things to come, is a modern rock icon like Elvis Costello cancelling his concert tour of Israel.

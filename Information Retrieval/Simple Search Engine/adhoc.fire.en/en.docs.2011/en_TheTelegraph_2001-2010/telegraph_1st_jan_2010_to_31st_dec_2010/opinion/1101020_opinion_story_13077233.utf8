	Q: I have an apartment in a joint sector complex in New Town, Calcutta. We have not yet received the occupation certificate. The complex does not have an electricity connection. But the promoters got the owners to register the flats. They have provided a generator to the families that have moved in. The cost of diesel is being charged to all flat owners as part of the maintenance charges. Is this fair? Am I bound to pay this?        
	Gaurav M. Patel, via email                
	A: Your promoter has acted negligently by handing over possession and completing registration before receiving an occupancy certificate or partial occupancy certificate from the municipal commissioner of the Rajarhat municipality. Under the circumstances, the promoter is not justified in getting the flat owners to pay for the cost of diesel since he has himself violated the municipal laws.              
	Q:My wife and I jointly own a flat under a registered society. But we have no registered deed. The building was constructed after the formation of the registered society and allotment of flats. We purchased a second flat from the Life Insurance Corporation through a registered deed. We have one son. What steps should we take so as to ensure that our son is able to acquire the properties smoothly after our death?        
	Subrata Mukhopadhyay, Calcutta                
	A: It is extremely important that you complete the registration of your flat. Only then will your son be able to inherit the rights, title and interest in your properties. Without registration you have no title to the flat said to be owned by you.               
	Q:My father expired in January 2008. Our two-storey house is in his name. He did not make a will. My sister and I have agreed to make a partition deed, whereby she will be the owner of the ground floor and I of the first floor. Both of us want to keep the original partition deed. Can we get two original partition deeds?        
	Somnath Bhattacharyya, via email                
	A: Assuming that your mother too has passed away and you two are the only heirs to your fathers property, you can divide the property by executing a registered partition deed. However, there can be only one original partition deed. Of course, a certified copy of the same deed can also be obtained from the registry office.

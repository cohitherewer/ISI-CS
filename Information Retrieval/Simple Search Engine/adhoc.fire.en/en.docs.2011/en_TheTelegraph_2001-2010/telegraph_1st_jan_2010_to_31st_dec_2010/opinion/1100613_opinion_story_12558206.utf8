The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Martyr in the house
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        Martyr in the house                                                          
	Everyone likes a bit of sympathy. Men just like more of it. A sneeze or a sniffle, or, Adam forbid, an actual headache, is enough to send a man into a frenzy of self-pity if he has a ministering female close by. A recent study conducted on 3,000 people by Engage Mutual Assurance shows that half the men questioned exaggerated their symptoms, describing a common cold as flu and an ordinary headache as a migraine. They want sympathy, says the report, and although men have fewer bouts of genuine sickness in a year (if that is in comparison to women, then it is no surprise), when they do get a sniffle or two they make sure they have their partners attention.        
	For that is the point. Without a partner dropping everything and rushing to the mans bedside with soothing words and fluffed-up pillows, a cool hand on the brow and an anxious phone-call to the doctor, the whole point of feeling luxuriously ill is lost. Many women, it seems, offer sympathy and make their men comfortable even when they do not quite believe in the acuteness of the symptoms. Perhaps that is less kindness than a desire to prevent more moans. Yet the whining men, the study has found, do not take time off from work for too long to rest at home. The underlying assumption is both fascinating and revealing. The study seems to be looking for ways to retrieve some heroism for the male, suggesting he has a stiff upper lip at the workplace. It also lets slip that staying at home means rest for him. But in the bubble-world of middle- to high-income heterosexual couples  with two children and a dog and, maybe, a cat  that the researchers have investigated, women play as good a game as the men. Home is no rest for them; being working mothers makes no difference. Whether they groan with minor illnesses or not is beside the point  they are always rushed off their feet. No one fluffs up their pillows or makes them comfortable. Now this is a point they make frequently and disdainfully. So in the game of martyrdom, as in almost everything else, the women are more efficient than the men.        
	But Engage Mutual Assurance being a friendly society that offers savings, investment and life insurance products (its sample segment for the study gives an idea of its clientele), the research concludes that minor ailments apart, it is important for men to recognize and act on any genuine health concerns. This is even more revealing. Serious illnesses actually signal their arrival, but the man who would take to bed with a sniffle quickly shuts down all signalling routes. When there is real illness in the offing, he does not want to know. Neither does the woman, although the report is curiously reticent about giving her advice. But in this they are evenly matched; it is only the minor ailments that elicit those familiar, hair-raising moans.

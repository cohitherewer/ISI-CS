	A resolution to create an Upper House was passed unanimously in the Assam legislative assembly. This move can only be viewed with amazement and derision. Anyone familiar with the debates surrounding bicameralism, in India and elsewhere, is aware of the theoretical fragility that informs the origin and the existence of an upper chamber, however constituted. The provenance of bicameralism is rooted in the peculiarities of the British political system. There the House of Lords exists to represent the separate interest of the Crown, and the House of Commons is elected through the popular vote. The hereditary and aristocratic character of the House of Lords has been diminished ever since elevation to the peerage became a source of patronage by the ruling government. In the United States of America, the Upper House was created to represent the interests of the various states with every state sending an equal number of representatives irrespective of the size of the state. The makers of the Indian Constitution derived the Rajya Sabha from the US model, but the number of members coming from each state was made a function of the size of the electorate. One consequence of this was the fact that the bigger states like Uttar Pradesh sent more members to the Rajya Sabha than a smaller one. An element of imbalance is thus inherent in the way the Upper House in India is formed. This has made many commentators raise serious intellectual and theoretical arguments against bicameralism.        
	There are practical considerations as well. One of the reasons why most states did away with the legislative councils that served as the Upper House at the provincial level was that they were found to be useless bodies, which were a mere drain on the exchequer. Moreover, as is clear in the case of the Rajya Sabha, political parties and the State use nominations to the upper chamber as instruments of extending their patronage. Many unworthy elements make their way to the Upper House through this route. It is also noteworthy that individuals who cannot get themselves elected by popular vote seek election to the Rajya Sabha. This is, in fact, a violation of the norms of democracy. Keeping in mind these considerations and those placed in the previous paragraph, the decision of the Assam legislature is quite incredible.

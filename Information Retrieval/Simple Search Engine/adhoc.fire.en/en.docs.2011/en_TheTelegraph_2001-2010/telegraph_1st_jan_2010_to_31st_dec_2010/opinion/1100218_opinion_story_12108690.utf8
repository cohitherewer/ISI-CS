The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Caught in a time warp
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        CAUGHT IN A TIME WARP                                  A fair-sized Marwari community has found economic rootedness in Dubrajpur, writes Insiya Poonawala                          The well that appears in Abhijan, now lying in ruins                                  
	In a small room in the bazar area of Dubrajpur, some men gather every evening for a chat over tea. Their discussions range from the dismal state of business in their town, which is located in Birbhum district of West Bengal, to greater, if futile, debates over whether the Maoists really need to be sympathized with or not. Like all addas, this one too remains incomplete without some light fun being poked at various members of the group. Some of the favourite quips of these men are directed towards the gentlemen from the prosperous Marwari community in Dubrajpur who take part in this daily adda.         
	Look how successful their businesses are; and have you seen the size of their mansions?  tease their companions. But look at how we have integrated ourselves with the local community, celebrating both Durga Puja and karva chauth with gusto, the Marwaris retort. We also speak Bengali perfectly, having at our command wide literary and linguistic references, they add. When it is pointed out that the Bengali they speak does indeed have a slight accent, they seem offended. It is outsiders preconceived notion about Marwaris that provokes such conclusions, they argue.        
	The fact that the attitudes of the Marwaris towards other local communities have changed over time  and for good  is something that one of these gentlemen, a businessman who, according to his wife, cannot live without the daily dose of adda with his friends, chooses to describe with an anecdote. When, in 1961, Satyajit Ray was filming Abhijan, it was his household that Ray chose as a set for one of the scenes in the movie. Actress Waheeda Rehman was to stand by a window in the kitchen, while Soumitra Chatterjee looked at her from beside the well in the courtyard. The gentleman recalls his mothers disbelief at a mussalman entering her kitchen and tainting their otherwise pure family interiors. As he narrates this incident before his wife and daughter, all three dissolve in laughter. And the daughter, as if to emphasize the absurdity of her grandmothers reaction, asks the rhetorical question: had Shah Rukh Khan wanted to pay us a visit now, would we have refused him entry?        
	It was in search of a better economic life that groups of people left their homes in Rajasthan and moved to West Bengal some four generations ago. While some were attracted to Calcutta, where the business classes were steadily flourishing, others settled for places in the districts. What brought the 100-odd Marwari families to Dubrajpur was the price of the land in the region. The land was bought at low rates from the erstwhile zamindar who occupied the Hetampur rajbari. It is on some of these lands that the sprawling mansions of the Marwaris stand today.        
	Narratives about the lives their ancestors led in Rajasthan are rare. For one, most of the Marwaris in Dubrajpur have been born and brought up in this town, receiving education in Bengali-medium schools. Another reason for such a disconnect from the land of their origin is that they have no surviving relatives in Rajasthan, and hence no pretext to go visit. The only time some of these men have been to their hometown is for the jarula or the hair-cutting ceremony, during which the priest performing the ritual shows them the haveli that was once occupied by their forefathers. It is only through such a symbolic gesture  of gazing on the piece of earth owned by their ancestors  that their relationship with their home state is established.        
	Yearning for this other state seems to be a result mainly of news heard about the heights Rajasthan has attained in the intervening years since the members of this community first started moving out. The Marwaris in Dubrajpur appear to be a community caught in the midst of the strange reversal of fortunes that West Bengal has suffered. It could be argued that it is their business acumen which has allowed them to prosper in a region chock-full of sick factories, and characterized by a dead tourism industry, poor working conditions and inadequate infrastructure. Nonetheless, they feel they would have fared better, economically, had their forefathers not moved to West Bengal with their lota-kambal  a stereotype that Pawan Kumar Modi, a dealer in items of grocery, acknowledged.        
	It is only their extremely prosperous and settled businesses that have kept these families back in Dubrajpur, which is an industrial failure like most other parts of this state. However, they cannot help betray a sense of resentment when they hear how well Rajasthan and Gujarat are doing under their present governments, and feel that had their forefathers stayed on, the families that are part of the current generation would have been wealthier. This feeling of the loss of what could have been is best summed up in the words of Modi: We left Rajasthan long ago, but now Rajasthan has left us far behind.        
	It is eventually the women on whom the onus of maintaining the bond with the mother state falls  through the food they cook, the clothes they wear and the puja they earnestly perform every single day. When the men talk of integration, it seems that they talk only of themselves. It is they who freely and effortlessly shuttle between the grimy and noisy setting of the Dubrajpur town, and the jealously-guarded interiors of their homes. The men have access to gatherings (like the chat sessions) where they come across people (specifically, influential men) from the other local communities. After all, success in business will hinge on the bonds they can forge with those who matter.               
	Among themselves, the Marwari men speak in Bengali, the language in which they also do business. Marwari and Hindi are reserved for communication with the womenfolk. Their foremothers were the ones who carried most of the baggage of culture through migration, with all the inhibitions they once felt towards Waheeda Rehman. It may be some time before the full weight of that load is truly shed.

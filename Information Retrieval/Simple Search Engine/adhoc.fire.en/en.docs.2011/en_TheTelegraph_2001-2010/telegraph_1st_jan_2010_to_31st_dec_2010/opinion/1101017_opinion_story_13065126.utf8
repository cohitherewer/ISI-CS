	To an outsider visiting Calcutta during its annual autumnal madness, the city conjures up unforgettable visions. A metropolis, which, even during a normal day, strains every muscle to prevent itself from bursting at its seams, then witnesses some six to eight million people on its streets, jostling to snatch glimpses of as many of the one-and-a-half thousand Durga images as they possibly can. Pandal-hopping is a skill that requires considerable energy and practice  and the common citizen of Calcutta possesses an unusual expertise in this. Almost every site has a different theme: for craftsmen have toiled and sweated so that millions may see, appreciate and tell the world about their creations.        
	The West would find the figures of these festival crowds mind-boggling, for its largest gatherings hardly ever cross thousands  or at the most, a few tens of thousands. Even the gatherings at the World Cup soccer matches, open-air music concerts or peace rallies rarely cross over to hundreds of thousands. Besides, most of these events are not regular annual occurrences. The only other comparable assembly of millions is, perhaps, the annual Haj at Mecca  but while it remains primarily (and secondarily) a deeply-religious occasion, the Durga Pujas have a secular side as well.        
	Although Calcutta was founded in 1690, it acquired its recognition as the second city of the Empire much later. But by the time Calcutta scored its first century, the sahibs, led by the governor general, were already gracing the ostentatious Durga Pujas celebrated at the palaces of the Companys nouveau riche Indian intermediaries. For the next 120 years or so, this would be the fashion. Durga Pujas became enormously expensive and exclusive pageants, organized only by the prosperous Bengali babu at his own residence. There are a few reports of some isolated attempts by commoners to establish their own Durga Pujas, financed through voluntary collections. But in 18th- and 19th-century Calcutta, Durga Pujas were synonymous with wealth and elitism.        
	For the masses, there were other avenues of entertainment and expression, especially during the festive season: the kabigans and tarjas (extempore poetic contests), the panchali songs, the jatra or open theatrical performances, the jhumur and khemta street dances  as well as the lampoons of the high and mighty through the shong pantomimes by witty subalterns. These assertions of Calcuttas urban folk culture also required patronage. The richer babus stepped in with support for the tarja and the jatra, though their own foppish tastes and pretentious lifestyles often formed the subject of a folk song or a comic street-show.        
	Then, with the migration of the patua scroll-painters from rural areas to Calcutta and their subsequent settlement near the Kalighat temple, there evolved another urban folk art-form in the city  the Kalighat pata paintings. Close on their heels followed the Battala woodcut engravers of north Calcutta. The lithograph, chromolithographs, oleographs and their prints, like the colourful Chorebagan prints, have evoked continuing admiration for their fidelity, imagination and simplicity.        
	Except the clay-modellers of the citys Kumartuli and Patuapara localities, who are still in demand, folk art seems to be dead in Calcutta. The factory and its mass-produced goods seem to have killed the artisans creations. But this is perhaps not wholly true. The more relevant issue here is, where does one find the folk arts in Calcutta now? Among possible answers, one is obvious: in the Durga Puja celebrations, if one chooses to look at them from this angle.        
	Going on from the elitist Puja, although several claims are made about the first community (barowari or sarvajanin) Durga Puja in north Calcutta, we may safely date the earliest efforts in this direction to somewhere in the first decade of the 20th century. Politics had an important role in this regard: the extremist and revolutionary leaders had stirred the imagination of the people of Bengal, while the abortive British attempt to partition this province had brought the common man out into the streets. The Calcutta session of the Congress in 1910 and the barowari Durga Puja of Balaram Basu Ghat Road of the same year were connected  in a common nationalist sentiment and fervour.        
	The decades that followed witnessed the steady growth of community Pujas. The increasing economic prospects available in the metropolis led to the rise and proliferation of the middle class and to the expansion of the city. The Durga Puja and the Bengali identity (at least of the middle class Hindu) were, from certain angles, almost indistinguishable. A popular festival had finally emerged in which the entire para could participate. The para in Calcutta had all along been much more than just a geographical entity  it was a village within the city, where social interaction, roles between non-related inhabitants were structured at levels very like kinship. The persistence of such non-urban values is traceable even now. This set-up found its symbolic unity in the joint organization of the para Durga Puja. The prestige of the entire para was involved. This is where innovations came in  to outshine the next para  and these would lead to the nurturing of a unique form of urban folk culture.        
	The craftsmanship that developed to cater to the Pujas related mainly to the designing and execution of the massive temporary temples of bamboo, tarpaulin and cloth called pandals: their exquisite interior frills and decoration; the imaginative sculpting of the goddess and her retinue and the special lighting as well as the many special effects that mesmerized crowds at each major site. Along with these crafts came a whole repertoire of other arts, like the seasonal songs and music created each year; the new literature that was churned for the numerous Puja magazines and post-Puja celebrations that included musical soirees and dramatic performances. Traditional agomoni songs, or dhunuchi-dances while the dhakis beat furiously on their drums appear to be getting far less importance at present.         
	Hence, we may focus our attention on the more vibrant living cultural traditions of Calcutta. Image-making is surely the oldest of these, and the idols speak of superb craftsmanship that is the culmination of generations of hereditary skills. Stylistically, this area has developed its own iconographical genre. The standard images, consisting of five separate chalas (platforms/panels), have broken free from the original, single-platform (ekchala) tradition  though the latter style is still maintained by some of the older barowari Pujas and all the ancient family images. The Mahishashurmardini is a well-known motif in Hindu iconography, but the skill of the local patua lies in combining, through Durgas facial expressions and other mudras, a pulsating sense of controlled fury with a clearly visible womanly elegance.        
	More interesting to art lovers may be the innumerable styles of imagery that vary sharply from the standard, not only in artistic representation but also in the use of media. From film stars to national heroes, from the politician to the profiteer  the folk clay-modellers use all possible models, as Durga, Mahishasur, Kartik, Saraswati et al. Even the religious mandates relating to the Dasabhuja goddesss 10 arms (each with its assigned weapon) are subject to the artisans caprice. The clothes adorning the idols range from the usual silk or cotton to velvet, crpes, jute, paper, matchsticks, broken glass  in fact, any substance that could give the impression of novelty. Gone are the days when idols wore only the uniform daker saaj of pith, with bits of glistening foil. Experimentation spreads to every sector where there is opportunity for any outburst of originality.              
	But it is actually in the range of the artists medium that one comes across examples of the imagination running riot. Although good old Gangetic clay remains the patuas favourite, everything from papier mch and bamboo splints to seeds and razor blades are reported to have been tried out. It is not an uncommon practice to arrange for a small regular image for devotional purposes, while simultaneously displaying the much larger art idols. The Durga Puja of Calcutta is, thus, not just an annual festival or the carnival of the city; nor even the most vivid symbol of Bengali culture  it is the best exhibition of the creativity of popular arts and crafts.        
	Calcutta, during the Puja season is, therefore, transformed from a city that struggles each day for its very existence to one of the largest open-air and never-ending emporia of folk arts and popular creativity anywhere in the world. After all, folk culture is genetically programmed to survive in changing habitats and different social eco-systems: to adapt, to improvise, to thrive and to better itself  never to say die.

	Evergreen melodies                  
	Sir  July 31 marked the thirtieth death anniversary of the legendary playback singer, Mohammed Rafi. Yet, the ministry of information and broadcasting has not commemorated him in any way. Rafis gifted, unique voice, coupled with his classical training, gave us versatile gems like the bhajans in Baiju bawra, the foot-tapping Junglee and the soulful Nafrat ki duniya ko chhod ke. Three decades later, Rafi is still firmly ensconced in the hearts of his followers for his evergreen melodies and his smiling face.          
	Yours faithfully,        R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam
        
	Think local          
	Sir  In Politics in command (July 2), Ashok Mitra rightly says, Economists who enter government with grand notions of remoulding official economic policy in their own image will soon know their bearings. All economists know that the rising rate of inflation is severely damaging. However, they seem to remain hapless spectators because they are not politically empowered.          
	In a recent report, the Reserve Bank of India pointed out that to ensure financial stability, macro-economic and supervisory policies needed to be redesigned with a focus on mitigating the risks (RBI antidotes to risks, July 2). Financial experts at the RBI, in spite of being the best economists in the country, end up being mere implementers of government policies. They address the economy only in terms of risk management instead of making radical changes to target inflation.          
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, a reputed economist himself, owes the nation a radical makeover at the policy level. But he, too, seems helpless in the face of global politics in command, which gives priority to market forces. Economists may think globally, but it is necessary that they act locally.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
R. Subhranshu, Chandernagore, Hooghly

      
	Sir  A sizeable section of Indian society consists of non-pensioners who have retired from the public sector and are hard hit by inflation. Their meagre salaries ensured negligible savings, and the income from these savings has steadily dwindled after the government pruned interest rates to contain the fiscal deficit. Interest rates for the senior citizens savings scheme are lower than the current rate of inflation. In addition, the postal department is insisting on a copy of the PAN card from account holders who have an average monthly balance of Rs 50,000 and above. However, non-pensioners do not possess PAN cards, for they have no taxable income to show to the government. The government should not insist on the submission of PAN cards for people who are already suffering.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
K.C. Mohanti, Bhubaneswar

                          
	Long delay          
	Sir  As per the latest communiqu issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the decision on the mercy petition for Afzal Guru will be taken after all other pending cases submitted before his get cleared. In other words, the mastermind behind the December 2001 Parliament attack can be assured of an extension to his life for about half a decade or more.           
	It goes without saying that he will be well looked after at the expense of the national exchequer. I believe that the legal brains behind Ajmal Kasabs defence must have taken note of this and are already wondering how they can continue to milk the taxpayer of approximately Rs 31 crore per year, which is being spent currently on safeguarding the Pakistani prisoner.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

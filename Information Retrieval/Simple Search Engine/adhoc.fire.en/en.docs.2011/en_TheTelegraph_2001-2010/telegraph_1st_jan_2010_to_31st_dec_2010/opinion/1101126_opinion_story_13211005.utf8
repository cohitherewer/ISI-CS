	Holy communion                  
	Sir  S.R. Sankarans photograph drew my attention as I turned the pages of The Telegraph on November 19. Then I saw Ashok Mitras byline and prepared myself for an interesting story. I was not disappointed. A troublemaker passes is as interesting as a story can be. Yes, everyone knows that Sankaran was picked by the chief minister of Tripura, Nripen Chakraborty, from the Andhra cadre (Andhra Pradesh seemed to be always ready to spare his services), but few know how. Mitra hints of personal knowledge but is circumspect enough not to share it. People guessed that since Chakraborty was a communist, he brought in another communist. Being of the same religion they could trust each other, so went the belief. And both of them did indeed live out of a battered suitcase. Both were bachelors, and frugal in their food habits. In the meetings I have attended with Sankaran, I have never seen him sipping the customary cup of tea. I thought he preferred coffee.          
	Chakraborty liked his morning tea in his favourite cup with blue borders, with 3-4 spoonfuls of sugar, I was told. He drank it bottoms up, lapping up the sugary syrup with puffed rice. Chakraborty supposedly kept only Rs 248 out of the salary he received as chief minister and donated the rest to the party fund. Sankaran reportedly sponsored the higher education of many and also donated to charity. Mitra tells us a fable about Chakraborty and Sankaran that he would perhaps like to believe himself. He says, They trudged through Tripuras countryside for days on end, communing with the tribal people, sharing their food, spending the night in their ramshackle huts, listening, all the while, to their woes. And the duo took measures, concrete measures, that could heal at least some of these woes. That there is currently little or no tribal insurgency in Tripura might well be the enduring sequel of the magic healing touch applied by that strange combination of a most unusual chief minister and his equally unusual chief secretary. Very poetic  the chief minister and the chief secretary of state roaming the hills and dales without accompanying security. But nothing could be further from the truth. And for heavens sake, do not take the winds out of the sails of the present chief minister of Tripura, the unassuming Manik Sarkar, who has tried to clean the mess left behind by Chakraborty, among others, in the most admirable way.           
	Chakraborty did roam the hills of Tripura, but as a fugitive in his early revolutionary days. He was the sidekick to Dasarath Deb, the true crusader, during the Emergency and also when the Congress was in power. Chakraborty found a safe haven in the huts of tribal people. He could speak Kokborok and could truly be in communion. Sankaran occasionally used to trudge the hills with a large retinue of officials (most of whom could hardly keep pace with the little man who was surprisingly agile in the hills), government vehicles and tidbits like biscuits and lozenges to keep the village children chirping. As to his magic healing touch, the less said the better. It is during Sankarans time that the greatest carnage in the recent history of Tripura took place. Tribals and non-tribals, who had lived in harmony for ages, were polarized hopelessly forever. Everyone knew that in June 1980, a carnage was imminent. But the government headed by Nripen Chakraborty, assisted by his chief secretary, seemed to have been caught unawares. Thousands of lives were lost. There was no government in Tripura in mid-June 1980 for about 10 days till the people decided to bring back order for the sake of their own survival. Sankaran left after that, with glowing tributes being paid to him by Chakraborty.          
	Tripura was my second home, and I felt that it would be unfair to let Mitras article pass without comment.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Dipak Datta Roy, Bagdogra

                
	Sir  In the article, A troublemaker passes, Ashok Mitra says that involvement in the delivery of basic amenities to disadvantaged people was part of the original intention of the leaders of the Indian freedom movement. At the behest of post-Independence politicians, however, enforcement of law and order became the primary role of the officers of the Indian Administrative Service. How far the IAS officers succeed in their role is a debatable issue. Contrary to Mitras opinion, some IAS officers are involved in the implementation of public development schemes of the government. Unfortunately, however, they seem to lay more stress on the mere achievement of targets than on ensuring that the benefits reach the poor.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Sanjit Ghatak, Narendrapur

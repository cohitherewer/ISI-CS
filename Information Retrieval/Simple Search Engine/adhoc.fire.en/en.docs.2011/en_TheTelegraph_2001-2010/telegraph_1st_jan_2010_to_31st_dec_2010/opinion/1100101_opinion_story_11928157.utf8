	One of the subjects, Vir Sanghvi, in this book of colour portraits, INDIA BY SNOWDON (The Nand amp; Jeet Khemka Foundation, Rs 5,000), puts his portraitist, the Earl of Snowdon, in a list of things that were regarded as overwhelmingly British by Sanghvis generation. Enid Blyton, Marmite, Cliff Richard, Cadbury chocolates and Britannia biscuits. Born in 1930, Snowdon, in his professional career and personal life, ranges across the entire British social spectrum from Pimlico arty-bohemian to Kensington glitz to stuffy Windsor. He was wildly swinging (in every sense) in the Sixties, had become picture editor of the Sunday Times, co-designed the aviary of the London zoo, married Princess Margaret (they divorced in the late Seventies) and become a baron. So, the photographic work he is famous for spans formal portraits of the royal family and idiosyncratic character pieces of the eminent and the iconic, usually British: Maggie Smith, Germaine Greer, Tom Stoppard, Barbara Cartland, Iris Murdoch. Much of this work is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London. There are also many books of pictures made in different places  Venice, Malta, Tasmania, Hong Kong, Israel, Russia.        
	In his mid-seventies and wheelchair-bound when he came to shoot in India in 2004-05, Lord Snowdon seems to have lost the verve that made his earlier work both distinctive and popular. And, as Sanghvi remarks in his piece on sitting for Snowdon, he had no real experience of India and seemed to know so little about us. The result is a rather disappointingly anodyne and somewhat dated body of work that presents a strange selection of Indians, many of whom would leave the viewer wondering about the meaning of greatness  a criterion far too liberally invoked in the publishers foreword. Alka Pande, Ajay Bijli, Ritu Kumar, Ravi Shankar (Art of Living, not musician), Priya Paul  great? There are far too many journalists and middle-order corporate bosses, and many of the politicians are already yesterdays faces. The rest look peculiarly antiseptic  India without the grime and bustle, all gleaming surfaces or ethnic minimalism. It might work for the fine cover photograph of Charles Correa. But Rekha or Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are standard Stardust fare, and the others, at best, clichd Fortune magazine stuff. Only a few, like Jyoti Basu with his double, manage to revive that old Snowdon spark.        
	The real and the truly eminent India becomes, therefore, by an ironic turn, the pantheon that is not in India by Snowdon: Sonia Gandhi or any of her family, Amitabh Bachchan, SRK, Hussain, Pandit Ravi Shankar, the Ambanis, the Birlas, Arundhati Roy, Vikram Seth. In the same way, the collectable pieces of writing by Romila Thapar, Sunil Khilnani and Rudrangshu Mukherjee, among others, belong to that other book of important Indians, distinguished by their absence in this one.       AVEEK SEN

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Restricted flow                  
	Sir  As the editorial, Small pool (July 13), points out, reservations are barriers to business and free trade. There is no dearth of destructive populism in India. Recently, there was an effort in Uttar Pradesh, under the Mayavati government, to have a quota for Dalit contractors in government projects. But what would happen if no Dalit contractors were vying for these projects? Similarly, the move to reserve jobs in the private sector for local people in Orissa is likely to turn out to be counterproductive. It may encourage other states to follow suit.          
	Contrary to received notions, labour migration is good for the economy and leads to wealth generation. Sadly, politicians tend to project it as a capitalist conspiracy intended to deprive labourers of their livelihood. A sizeable population of Oriya labourers are involved in various projects in Tamil Nadu. Oriya people also work in Mumbai, Surat, and in the Northeast.          
	We are witnessing virulent xenophobia in Mumbai, thanks to Raj Thackeray, and in some northeastern states like Assam, where people dread going to work for fear of Naxalites. The move by the Orissa government is likely to provide fodder for xenophobic elements across the nation.           
	Investors become wary of restrictive policies as well. Just because Orissa has huge reserves of iron ore, the government must not think that it can dictate its own terms to industries. Free movement of labour is needed instead of policies confining labourers to a place that can offer them only the protection of obscurantist policies. Orissa is setting a wrong precedent. Raghunath Mohanty should withdraw his myopic policy in the interest of Orissa and the entire nation.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Raghu Seshadri, Chennai

      
	Sir The decision of the Orissa government to impose conditions of employment on companies entering the state is a sign of its desperation to generate employment. Corporate bodies are expected to fulfil their social obligations by generating employment for local people in tandem with the initiatives of the state government. It is a kind of two-way traffic. However, the government should appreciate the fact that companies need to employ people in the best possible way in order to achieve optimum output. The companies, of course, could provide a hand in the training of the local population so that it becomes employable. Unless there is a give and take between the state and the company, both stand to lose in the long run.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Debasish Banerjee, Calcutta

                
	Stem the rot          
	Sir  The Uttar Pradesh government, in a bid to fight the menace of touts in government offices, is said to be putting up posters of middlemen near all such offices (Touts? Maya wants them out, July 10). The move is intended to protect the poor from exploitation. Although some have welcomed this decision, others claim that they will not be surprised if touts now start claiming that they are accredited as the government has printed their photographs: the posters may serve as their identity cards.          
	Given the high illiteracy rate in this country, how many will be able to read the posters? Had the government been really keen to protect people from exploitation, it would have published a Citizens Charter for its employees. Copies of this should have been hung up prominently in all government offices.          
	People pay touts for the services they render, and that too effectively. Time is precious. It takes money  in the form of bus fares and lost wages  to visit government offices. If a tout can cut short three visits, no one objects to paying them. Touts act as the peoples interface with the government as the latter does not deliver on its own.          
	At government offices, even peons think it is beneath their dignity to carry registers. The government should bring to book employees who are responsible for red tape instead of going after touts. Mayavati will do a great service to the nation if she streamlines government offices and sets specific time limits within which an application has to be dealt with.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

                
	Sir The attempt to eradicate touts in government offices is commendable on the part of the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. However, the nexus between touts and government agencies is too deep-rooted to be removed in a hurry. Mayavati should know that government employees take speed money from touts. Should she not punish such employees as well? However, if she succeeds in her mission, other states could start following her example.          
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Right step          
	Sir  I commend Rita Bhimanis courage in broaching the topic of euthanasia (A different ending, July 15). In Belgium, and now in France, where I lived for 40 years, it is more aptly called DMD (Right to Die With Dignity). I signed this DMD with the Town Hall of my locality in Belgium. When I came back to India, I tried to make a legal document here which would permit me, if necessary, to take this important decision, but my lawyer told me that it was impossible in India.           
	In a country where millions do not eat meat, or even eggs, to spare the suffering of animals, do we humans not have equal rights? If Belgium, with 10 million people, could pass this law, perhaps it is time that the worlds largest democracy gave its citizens the legal choice between survival in hopeless suffering or death with dignity.          
	Yours faithfully,

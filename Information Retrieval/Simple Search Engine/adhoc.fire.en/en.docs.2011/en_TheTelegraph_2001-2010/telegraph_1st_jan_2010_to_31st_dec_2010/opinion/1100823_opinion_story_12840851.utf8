                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HAND TO MOUTH                                                    
	On August 13, the Indian foreign minister, S.M. Krishna, rang up the foreign minister of Pakistan, S.M. Qureshi, and offered him $5 million for flood relief. The same afternoon, Indias foreign ministry announced in its typical prose that India had offered the assistance for provision of relief material from India for the affectees of the massive floods. The government of Pakistan did not respond. Six days later, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, rang up Pakistans prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, and, after routine condolences, reiterated the offer. Finally a minion of Pakistans foreign ministry rejected the offer. But he had not reckoned with the Big Brother. His counterpart in the American state department frowned; that very afternoon, Pakistan accepted the present.         
	The gift is trivial, whether it is compared to the resources of India, a trillion-dollar economy, or the extent of the catastrophe. Perhaps it was meant to be so; the government of India wanted to make it easier for Pakistan to say no. Perhaps there was scepticism behind it about aid reaching those who needed it. It would be a common opinion in this country that the government of Pakistan is run by its army, which puts all its energy into hurting India; this $5 million would only go to its terrorist training camps. But India is not the only Scrooge; other countries were no more forthcoming at the outset. They then felt bad and raised their offers. By now, the United States of America has pledged $150 million, the European Union $135 million. Saudi Arabia has promised $105 million, of which only $5 million will be in cash. The governments remember the money they had given for relief after the 2005 earthquake; the government of Pakistan diverted more than $500 million of it to its own needs. For a government that lives from hand to mouth, in a country where paying taxes is considered idiotic, it is impossible to keep its hand out of the till.         
	Given its poor absorptive capacity, Pakistan has already been promised more aid than it can use immediately; what it needs is the goods and services the aid can buy. Pakistan is short of everything. Immediately it needs food and water. But however hard it tries, it cannot prevent the sickness that will follow the floods. Diarrhoea and cholera will rage; other water-borne diseases may follow. So it is going to need drugs and doctors. The government should forget about giving more aid to Pakistan; it will be received as gracelessly as the $5 million. Instead, it should tell Pakistans major aid givers  the United Nations, the US, and the EU  that while India cannot guarantee that aid to Pakistan will go to the deserving, it can guarantee that the aid can be turned into the right goods and services. It should offer to supply immediately usable packages of food and drugs at its border; let donors buy them and take them across the border.

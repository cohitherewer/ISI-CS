                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO TIME TO LOOK BEHIND                                  Malvika Singh                              
	Pranab Mukherjee, the seasoned and headstrong Congressman and finance minister of India, has announced that we, as citizens of a federal democratic republic that does not make any distinction based on caste, creed and faith, will have to state our caste when we fill our census forms. This is unacceptable to those of us who have vehemently shunned such divisions that corrupt civil society.        
	I, for one, do not know my caste and was brought up as an Indian. I do not know my gotra either. Why must I be compelled to regress and go back to what the Constitution has steered away from? Why is the Congress Party of Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru forcing the establishment of the caste of an individual as a necessity when filling a census form? Is it important to announce which traditional strata you were born into to be counted as an Indian citizen? The mind boggles at the absurdity of this demand circa 2010. Why are we moving away from liberty, equality, fraternity to being segregated by caste?        
	One can only hope for a radical change in leadership that will cease to be divisive and aim for the stability and growth of India. This backward movement is alarming because it carries frightening portents for the future of our plural nation-state.        
	Diversity is the mainstay of India. Its cultural patterns need to be protected, its varied practices respected, its people across all strata need to feel that they are part of the composite whole and their lives must have a dignity of purpose and integrity of action. Unfortunately, the reality is that governance is corrupted and lawlessness rules. Whether in government decision-making or in bureaucratic action, propriety has gone out of the window.                
	Clean it up        
	Corporate honchos, operating through lobbyists who have access to those who influence our top leadership, are advising the government, and those who hold our natural and human resources in trust, to break existing laws in the name of development that they claim will alleviate poverty. Most such decisions, particularly in the realm where business interests clash with statutory environment protection laws, do huge irreparable damage and only help to line the pockets of a few. The Narmada hydel project near Maheshwar is one where high powered interventions have reversed, in part, the decision noted in good faith and within the laws by the ministry of environment.        
	It is this kind of intrusion from the top that sends a signal to the corporate community that political and bureaucratic lobbying is the only way to change decisions and beat the law. These interventions, made despite contrary notings on official files in the concerned ministry, carry huge monies that are doled out in sheer gratitude for a deviation well done. Lobbyists seem to have found their way into the prime ministers office from where top-secret decisions filter out and are discussed on telephones that are tapped by government agencies looking for information. In the recent exposure of a lobbyist hired by two of Indias largest conglomerates, information about cabinet formation was given out well in advance of the announcement of portfolio allocation. Surely, phone-tapping can identify the mole in the PMO and the cabinet secretary could ensure the departure or suspension of the individual. Or will life carry on as if nothing happened?        
	Those who lobby with government departments and ministries have been kept out of the media glare so far. Will this unravelling that has begun implicate the old war horses sooner rather than later? Will the mediapersons who operate as interventionists with political parties and corporate houses be exposed? Or will they close ranks and continue unabated?

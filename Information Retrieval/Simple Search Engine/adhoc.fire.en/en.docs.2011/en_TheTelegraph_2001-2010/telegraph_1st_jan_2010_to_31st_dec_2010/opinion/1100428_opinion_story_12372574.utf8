	Think anew                  
	Sir  One of the central arguments of Andr Bteilles article, Viable universities (April 22), is that the driving force behind the setting up of universities in India is not the advancement of learning, but the social, political, and perhaps even regional aspirations of the people. It is surprising that the recommendations of some of the very important education policy reports  such as the Radhakrishnan report (1948) or the Kothari commission report (1966)  have not yet been fully implemented. It was only when the Yash Pal committee released its report in 2009 that the government felt the need to make changes in the present system of education in order to put India on the global map.          
	But the quality of education gets enhanced only through a continuous process  building infrastructure, improving the quality of teachers or evolving a better curriculum  and not by enacting hasty measures overnight. Efforts must be put into developing the universities that already exist rather than inviting foreign universities to set up centres in India or increasing the number of Indian institutes of technology.          
	Indian universities have mostly dealt with arts or science education. Institutes of technical learning such as the IITs were started only in 1951. Imparting sound technical education is instrumental to the growth of the country. An analysis of the flaws of the existing models of technical training can help build better centres of learning in India.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The education reforms suggested by several advisory bodies were studied in yet another enlightening article by Andr Bteille. That the members of the said advisory bodies are unaware of the effectiveness of their suggestions is surprising. An in-depth examination of these proposals is required.          
	Bteille has clearly explained how universities were initially established for conducting examinations and awarding degrees, and not for undertaking research or teaching  the latter functions were left to the colleges. But even the gradual transformation of universities into communities of scientists and scholars has failed to facilitate the link between teaching and research.          
	Universities are not factories. If the University Grants Commission has its way, varsity professors will be asked to work for 40 hours a week, which would require them to be physically present on campuses most of the time. This specification of the UGC betrays the bureaucratic mindset of the Indian administrators. The productivity of teachers cannot be measured by the number of hours they spend on campus; a lot more goes into the making of a good teacher. To assess them, it is necessary to factor in the quality of their research and the feedback from their students. Flexible working hours give academics the freedom to visit libraries or to attend seminars.           
	Bteille quite rightly asks whether universities that cover a wide range of subjects can meaningfully combine teaching and research. A university can generate quality output only if it limits itself to specific areas of teaching and research  the two functions need to go hand-in-hand, now that India is fast being recognized as an advanced nation.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Heres to the hero          
	Sir  Having watched Star Trek since my school days, I was sad to find out that the veteran actor, Leonard Nimoy, has announced his decision to step down from the role of Spock, the Vulcan, after more than 40 years in Star Trek. While the other actors in the series kept changing over the years, Nimoy, with the pointy ears and stoic face that have come to characterize Spock, remained steadfast in his role. The fans of Nimoy will miss him. But it is good to know that the legendary actors decision has paved the way for the young Zachary Quinto to take over. Nimoy will always be remembered as Spock by his fans.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Wasted energy          
	Sir  The usefulness of the email is unquestionable. But some people send absurd, unwanted emails which comprise forwards, advertisements and viruses among other things. Similarly, one is bombarded with text messages and telemarketing calls every day. On a daily average, an individual spends a few hours downloading, reading, deleting or responding to such calls and messages. I wonder why no one seems to have noticed how such activities lead to decreased national productivity.          
	Yours faithfully,

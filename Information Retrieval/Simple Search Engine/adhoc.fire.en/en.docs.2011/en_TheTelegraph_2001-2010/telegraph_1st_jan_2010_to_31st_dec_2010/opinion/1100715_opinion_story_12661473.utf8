                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	New role                  
	Sir  In the editorial, No dual role (July 7), it has been mentioned that Sharad Pawar cannot continue to remain the Union agricultural minister as well as the president of the International Cricket Council. But Pawar has already performed a dual role successfully. He was the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India from 2005 to 2008. During his tenure, the BCCI tasted tremendous financial success. Before his appointment as the president of the ICC, he had been its vice-president since 2008, and he had held his ministerial portfolio during the time. Moreover, Pawars case is not unique. Some years ago, Prasun Mukherjee had also held the top post in the Cricket Association of Bengal besides being the commissioner of Calcutta Police.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sanjit Ghatak, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Sharad Pawar, leader of the Nationalist Congress Party and Union minister of agriculture, food and civil supplies, now finds himself neck deep in cricket, having been made the president of the ICC. Instead of asking the prime minister to reduce his workload, he should quit his ministerial post. He should devote his entire time to cricket, which seems to be his first love. His job as a cabinet minister requires full-time engagement. The government plans to bring in a national food security law and the public distribution system needs an effective overhaul. To implement these ambitious plans, the cabinet requires a minister who is fully committed to his responsibilities. Further, Pawars controversial involvement in the Indian Premier League has muddied his reputation. Regardless of his daughters clarifications, the mud is unlikely to go away easily.          
	Yours faithfully,      
J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

                
	Sir  Sharad Pawar has not been able to do justice to his job as the agriculture minister. He has failed to check the spiralling food prices and provide food security to Indians. Instead, Pawar has invested his time in shaping the business policies of the BCCI. Now, he has been made the president of the ICC. His involvement in cricket is eating into his job as a Union minister. Manmohan Singh should ask Pawar to resign, as he has not been able to deliver the goods.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Road menace          
	Sir  The condition of traffic and road safety in Calcutta are getting worse by the day. Those who drive auto rickshaws and bikes do so without a care. The auto rickshaws stop wherever they feel like to pick up or drop passengers. On account of rash driving, they pose a threat to other vehicles. Ideally, auto rickshaws should stick to the left side of the street, but they hardly do so. More often than not, they come in the way of four-wheelers. Moreover, some auto rickshaws plying on roads do not even have the required licence or registration.          
	Two-wheelers create a similar turmoil. Often, they are driven by reckless teenagers at high speed. Consequently, mishaps occur on a number of occasions. Cars and taxis are also driven at break-neck speed on busy stretches. Moreover, the drivers play music loudly, much to the annoyance of others. Restrictions should also be imposed on trucks, lorries and other heavy vehicles that block the path of smaller vehicles and cause traffic jams during rush hour.          
	Traffic regulation standards in Calcutta have waned considerably. To improve the situation, hoardings and banners carrying speed limits and other road-safety instructions should be put in place across major crossings. Those who break the rules should be meted out strict punishment. The traffic police of the city should also be more diligent in performing their duties.          
	Yours faithfully,      
D. Devesh, Bhubaneswar 

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  To be fair to France, this European country has always stood against the display of religious symbols in public (Veiled threat, July 12). However, in this age of globalization, migration and changing national identities, France should amend its secular credentials to suit the multicultural strands that are present in French society. It must do so to preserve the principles of democracy, which aims at protecting the choices of all kinds of people. There is no reason why the State should prevent women who believe in the veil from wearing it.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

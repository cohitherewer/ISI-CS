                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FORESTS OF THE NIGHT                                                                  
	A noisy railway station was not the right place to interview Anil Krishna Mistry. A former poacher, and now the principal field officer of the Wildlife Protection Society of India, Mistry is more at ease in the silence of the Sunderbans. Stealth and quiet were his weapons in the days he roamed the eerie, moon-lit forest. The money he made by selling deer meat illegally was paltry. There was fear too  on some nights, he thought he saw the devil roam in his luminous, striped coat. But there was also pride in conquering that fear.        
	Yet one night, as Mistry watched life ebb away from a pregnant doe, he was gripped by a strange fear. He knew that the day was not far when the forest would be emptied of the tiger, deer, boar and birds. He gave up poaching, and coaxed others in Bali Island to take up the gun to save animals. In 2001, the WPSI appointed him a field officer. Mistry is a skilled raconteur. And his knowledge of the accomplishments of and the challenges facing Indias conservation programme is as impressive. In the Sunderbans, the forest department, along with NGOs, is promoting programmes to support afforestation, alternative livelihoods and eco tourism. Poaching has decreased, except in the southern divisions.        
	But a lot remains unachieved by Mistrys own admission. The States provision of manpower towards conservation is minimal: 2,585 square kilometres of the tiger reserve are manned by a staff of 200 men. The existence of multiple agencies  State-owned and privately run  makes it difficult to coordinate the various conservation activities. There is also a lack of political will to perceive the protection of ecology and environment as a fundamental duty. Conversely, the institutional nexus with agents of the lucrative trade in animal skins and timber has resulted in a kind of political interference that is best avoided. The obsession with the preservation of primary species such as the tiger in the conservation dialogue is also problematic. Deer and boar  vital to the tigers preybase  must also be protected to reduce the fatal exchanges between man and animal. A new piece of legislation is in place, a law that has been criticized for apparently putting the onus of protecting forests on unlettered tribal people. But Indias forest- dwellers had coexisted with animals till the civilized marauders appeared. What must be ensured is that the State does not use the law to renege on its regulatory role to conserve what little is left.        
	A shrill whistle from a passing train stops the conversation. Mistry was willing to say more, but it was time to return. A lot a remains to be done for the islands and its forests that he calls his own.

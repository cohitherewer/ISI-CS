                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FACE OF FREEDOM                                                    
	There is something strange about governments, parliaments or courts having to decide what women can or cannot wear. It should be a relief to women in Bangladesh that the Dhaka high court has left the decision to them. The court has ruled that no woman in that country can be forced to wear a burqa against her wishes. Bangladesh is not the only country to witness a new battle over the burqa. Last month, the French parliament approved a ban on the dress. A demand for a similar ban by a right-wing party is currently causing a lot of political and social tension in the Netherlands. But the Dhaka courts verdict offers a completely different view of the issue. Instead of banning any particular dress, including the burqa, it actually upholds womens freedom to choose their own dress code. If more and more women in Bangladesh now wear the veil, that too reflects their freedom of choice. But the fact that the issue reached the court points to a disturbing trend in Bangladeshi society. Religious orthodoxy has recently been abused in order to restrict the peoples  and especially womens  freedoms. Sectarian groups have sought to impose their diktat on what women wear, study or do in general.         
	The timing of the Dhaka courts verdict gives it an added significance. Bangladesh is currently waging a battle against certain social and political elements that want to take it away from its moderate Islamic roots. Two recent decisions by Sheikh Hasina Wajeds government reflect this struggle. On her return to power, Ms Wajed set in motion the process for the annulment of the fifth amendment to the constitution which struck at the secular ambitions of the new republic. The countrys supreme court subsequently upheld the governments move. The second  and more recent  initiative by the government relates to its attempts to bring the war criminals of 1971 to justice. The Dhaka courts judgment against forcing women to wear the burqa is thus best seen as part of an overall attempt to restore the rule of law. The judgment is, therefore, less about secularism than about the peoples right to the rule of law. Those who force their will on women or men about a dress code or anything else actually challenge the rule of law. The verdict is a message of hope for all freedom-loving Bangladeshis.

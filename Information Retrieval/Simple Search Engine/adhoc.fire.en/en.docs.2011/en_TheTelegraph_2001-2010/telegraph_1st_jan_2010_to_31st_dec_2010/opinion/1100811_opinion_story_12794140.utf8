                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        JUST GO                                                    
	In a country of more than a billion people, there are bound to be some who cannot be classified as anything other than terribly inconvenient. Take beggars, for instance. Like a respectable household not being able to decide where to put the poor relations when entertaining superior guests, a city from the developing world hosting an internationally exposed event is usually in a quandary about its less savoury human elements. Large hoardings can hide fixed structures, like slums, that offend the eye. But human beings move about and are more resistant to being rendered invisible. Most Indians are optically immune to urban poverty, but the rest of the world cannot be expected to summon up similar reserves of indifference. So, Delhi has worked out a solution. Beggars are to be rounded up, classified according to their states of origin, and deported to these states. Bengal could expect to have to welcome around 3,000 beggars, and its administration is making unhelpful noises about overcrowded vagrants homes and the impossibility of rehabilitating the irredeemable.        
	It would require the will and efficiency of the Third Reich to identify, classify and deport Delhis 60,000 to 100,000 beggars to their proper states of origin. Even if the authorities were to succeed in doing so, the light in which the rest of the world would regard such dubious efficiency is not likely to be particularly flattering. Indias anti-begging law, which criminalizes destitution and poverty, defines a beggar to include everybody on the streets, from singers, dancers and fortune-tellers to the incurably helpless. So, the law does not make matters easier. (The 2001 census had lumped beggars together with prisoners, housewives and prostitutes.) China, Moscow and Athens faced the same problem before hosting the Olympic games. Moscow reportedly moved out 1.5 million people, anybody looking not quite right; Athens evicted 2,700 Roma people. China went into a frenzy, teaching its citizens not to spit in public or push in queues, and maintaining a civic index to monitor general improvement in manners. The Commonwealth Games is a time of desperate cosmetic measures. Begging is too complex a phenomenon, requiring too radical a look at economics, law and society, to deserve anything more than the briskly unthinking attention it seems to have got from the State.

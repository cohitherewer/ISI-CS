	Up in arms                  
	Sir  In his article, Arms and the nation (Aug 18), K. P. Nayar examines a bill recently introduced in Parliament which proposes certain amendments to the Indian Arms Act. Most of his arguments, however, are based on comparisons with the United States of America. He does not seem to take into account certain factors that shape the reality in India.           
	The existing provisions of the Arms Act are already very stringent. Any further tightening of these provisions will make it virtually impossible for any citizen to obtain an arms licence in India. According to the proposed amendment, the applicant would have to prove grave and imminent threat in order to acquire a licence. It may be impossible to prove this to the satisfaction of the Indian bureaucracy that is demanding at the best of times. Moreover, illegal arms are used in most of the crimes that are committed. Tightening the provisions of the Arms Act will not help curb this trend.           
	It should be kept in mind that self-defence is the inalienable right of every citizen in a democracy. Indians cannot be denied this right just because it might be misused by some.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Pramod Pathak, Dhanbad 

                
	Sir  K.P. Nayar has raised certain vital points in favour of the proposed amendments to the Indian Arms Act. The import of the gun culture that prevails in the US will have disastrous consequences for a country like India. The lenient gun laws in the US have led to frequent bouts of violence in that country. There have been numerous shoot-outs in schools and colleges. Students armed with guns have opened fire on classmates and on teachers. The ease with which guns can be acquired has clearly played a role in such incidents.          
	It is baffling that despite reports of such tragedies, several Indian politicians are lobbying against the amendments to the Arms Act. India already faces serious security problems. Crime is on the rise, and the police seem to have been reduced to mere spectators. If everyone has easy access to arms, the law and order situation will deteriorate further. The Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, should not be deterred by opposition. He must ensure that the laws surrounding the acquisition of firearms are made more strict.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Old battle          
	Sir  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently asserted, Kashmir is an integral part of India. Some would say that the truth of this statement is debatable. The chaotic history of the region, for one, tells a different story.          
	Shortly after Independence, the dispute over Kashmir had led to a major conflict between India and Pakistan. The United Nations intervened and in April 1948, the UN security council adopted a resolution which held that the future of Kashmir would be decided on the basis of self-determination. Although the UN changed its position later, the principle, according to one school of thought, should still hold. Critics seem to be suggesting that by declaring Kashmir to be an integral part of India, the prime minister has demonstrated that he is indifferent to the aspirations of the people there.          
	According to the results of a recent opinion poll, a large section of the people in Kashmir, on both sides of the line of control, want azadi. Any settlement on the future of the region must take this into account. An impartial decision must be taken, without fear of intimidation. Only then will the long and tragic conflict in Kashmir come to an end.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Pay the price          
	Sir  The recent hike in US visa fees shows that the priority of the Obama administration is to create more jobs for Americans (Quick fix, Aug 12). Barack Obama has been hailed as a messiah of equality. But he seems to have abandoned this image while drafting policies for the economic revival of his country. Obama has always had an eye on the jobs that go to people from Asian countries. Post globalization, such people have made major inroads into the US job market. A hike in visa fees may reduce the flow of immigrant workers into the US. But as pointed out by the editorial, the new policy will entail a loss in revenue for the US. The quality of work done by Indian companies, especially those specializing in information technology, might suffer. On-shore services cant be fully replaced by Skype and video- conferencing.           
	Yours faithfully,

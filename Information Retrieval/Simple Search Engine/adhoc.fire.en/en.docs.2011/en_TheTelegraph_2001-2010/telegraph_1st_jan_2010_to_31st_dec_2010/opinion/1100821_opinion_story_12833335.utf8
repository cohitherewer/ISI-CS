                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        INFERNO ON EARTH                                  VISUAL ARTS: Somak Ghoshal                                                  
	To look at Veer Munshis archive of digital prints, of gutted, ruined and derelict buildings strewn across the valley of Kashmir, is to be confronted with a chilling version of the history of the present (Shrapnel, Birla Academy of Art amp; Culture, till August 25). Belonging once to the Pandit community, which was hounded out of the valley in the 1990s, these houses have a haunted, even a hunted, look about them. Now reclaimed by neighbours or requisitioned by the army, the ghostly mansions stand not only as memorials to a tragic past but also bear an unmistakable mark of the violence that continues to blight the valley.        
	Given the specific, and explicitly stated, politics of Munshis project, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to look at the images without ever forgetting the stories they seek to tell. Left to themselves, outside the frame of ethnic ferment, the photographs might have conveyed a very different sense of the sublime  perhaps something of the grandeur that one finds in Robert Polidoris chronicles of devastation left by war and natural disaster or in Petra Wunderlichs photographs of ravaged houses and stone quarries that become meditations on transience and mortality.        
	But Munshi is more obviously interested in documenting. His work has a specific agenda, though that itself does not undermine its aesthetic value. On the contrary, one is positively struck by the spectral contours of these relics, by the possibility of something menacing lurking inside their gloomy interiors. Yet, recalling Munshis design, one cannot quite let the mind run on in its own free imaginings. The initial template imposes itself on every fiction that the eye is tempted to conjure up. One is also a bit bothered by a persistent trace of unease: while mirroring the trials of one oppressed community, Munshis archive does leave out the story of the oppressors, who have suffered, in their own ways, no less grievously.        
	While watching the two-channel video installation, Leaves like Hands of Flame, another kind of disquiet grips the viewer. On one screen, a house gets steadily burnt to cinders; on another, a man trudges through the tormented land. His face unseen, the traveller is closely trailed, as though by a stalker, creeping up on him from behind. Each time the woodwork in the house on fire collapses with a terrible clatter, like a gunshot, one also expects the man to fall face down  which, mercifully, does not happen, though one invariably feels a chill down the spine even with repeated viewings.        
	Compared to the cold intensity of this work, The Chamber looks relatively sedate. The walls of this simulated room, enclosed by wooden panels, are covered with dense graffiti  of faces contorted in pain and anger, of hands flourishing guns and grenades. This sudden profusion of stock images tends to flatten the heightened register of the rest of the work.

	ATIYAS JOURNEYS: A MUSLIM WOMAN FROM COLONIAL BOMBAY TO EDWARDIAN BRITAIN By Siobhan Lambert-Hurley and Sunil Sharma, Oxford, Rs 599              
	On September 1, 1906, a young unveiled Muslim woman in Bombay boarded the P amp;O steamboat Moldavia headed for Britain. Her name was Atiya Fyzee.        
	Siobhan Lambert-Hurley and Sunil Sharmas book on the life and times of this fascinating woman is an imaginative, engrossing work. It includes an English translation of Zamana-i-tahsil, a first-hand account of Atiyas experiences. Lambert-Hurley and Sharma say that this is arguably the first graphically detailed account by a South Asian Muslim woman of her observations about the West, specifically Edwardian Britain.         
	Atiya Fyzee (1877-1967) was instrumental in setting up a school for girls in Aligarh. Her sister Zehra and she were at the forefront of movements for the education of Muslim women in India.It was with this objective in mind that Atiya journeyed to Britain. Though she could not become a teacher, she quickly got absorbed into the English upper class culture. There are vivid accounts of her visits to the opera. Her sophisticated clothes, manner and her sense of aesthetics astonished the British, as only a handful of upper or middle class Indians moved with ease in the imperial centre. Most of the others who came to fill the labour market were mainly ayahs, lascars and nursemaids.        
	Atiya belonged to Indias influential, progressive Bohra Muslim community. Her association with Muhammad Iqbal was significant. Better known as a poet, writer, philosopher and politician, Iqbal was perhaps the most prominent Muslim intellectual of his time. Educated in England and Germany, he set up a law practice in Lahore between 1905 and 1908. Though he is scarcely mentioned in her travelogue, Atiya did establish a longstanding independent relationship with him. Their close friendship during her stay in London in 1906-07 attracted gossip. Her allusion to Iqbal as a very learned scholar and also philosopher and poet was seen as overtly formal and her physical infirmity at the time was attributed to a more romantic liaison. Atiya also attracted comments from the Pakistani press about her inexplicable relationship with another distinguished Muslim scholar  Maulana Shibli Numani. With a traditional education in the Quran, Islamic jurisprudence, and in Arabic and Persian literature, Shibli taught Persian at Aligarhs Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College for years.         
	Atiya married outside her community at the age of 35, at a time when women in her country were wed at the age of 13. Her marriage to the artist Samuel Rahamin in 1912 earned the couple much international attention among persons in the fields of literature and the arts. Atiyas marriage did not affect the closeness between the three Fyzee sisters.        
	Atiya was closely related to Badruddin Tyabji, one of the founders and the third president of the Indian National Congress. A Gandhian nationalist, Atiya Fyzee glorified women in Hindu mythology and history like Sita and Padmini, as well as Razia Begum and others. It is, therefore, somewhat difficult to reconcile with the fact that she and her husband decided to leave their home in Bombay and go to Karachi after the Partition. It might have been due to the greater public prominence promised by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Lambert-Hurley and Sharma suggest that it may have been due to discord in the larger family rather than any community concerns or political idealism. The couple lived their last days in vastly reduced circumstances in unfamiliar Karachi.         
	At her sister Nazlis insistence, Atiyas letters and diaries were published in an Urdu journal  another example of her freedom to express herself. The English translation of Zamana-i-tahsil is well-produced and contains annotations and rare photographs. The book provides an interesting perspective of Indias imperial and colonial past.        
	The diminutive Atiya was an intellectual with a forceful personality. It is therefore strange that her name is somewhat lost to historical memory.

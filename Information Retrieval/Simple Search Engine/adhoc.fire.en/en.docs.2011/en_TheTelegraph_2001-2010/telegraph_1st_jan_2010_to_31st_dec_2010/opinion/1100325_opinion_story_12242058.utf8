	Teach with care                  
	Sir  The article by Devi Kar prompted me to make certain observations (Home is where the hurt is, March 18). As a parent and a teacher, it is disheartening to know that young lives are lost because of the pressure of coping with the education system. But it is also alarming when schools and the teaching community come under the scanner for student suicides. It is time we took a closer look at the issue. The education system, parents and teachers form the three vertices of a triangle, at the centre of which is the child. Parents need to have faith in teachers, who play an important role in childrens lives during their formative years. Values taught at school need to be reinforced at home. A contradiction in the imparted values can confuse the child and mislead him or her.          
	Moreover, a change in perspective and attitude is also required. Schools are not just about passing examinations. They are citadels of knowledge, where students exchange ideas and acquire life skills. Parents must also help children differentiate between right and wrong. If we believe something to be right, we must convince our children that it is also right for them. Moreover, a child must be made to understand the positive aspects of discipline. However, if we dither and falter in implementing discipline, the child begins to regard discipline as a way of punishing him or her. The very essence of parenting is lost as we fail to show the child that we care.          
	Sadly, parents often go into self-denial mode when a disturbing facet of a childs character surfaces. Every child is different and we need to respect that. Accepting and understanding our childrens strengths and weaknesses can help them build their self-esteem. A student-friendly education system can also do away with textbooks till the eighth standard, and give teachers the freedom to explore childrens minds. This will help reduce pressure on the students as well. As teachers, we need to realize that respect has to be earned and that it cannot be demanded. Today, children are smart enough to question our decisions. We should be comfortable about dealing with such situations. Patience, a sense of humour and openness, combined with a no-nonsense attitude, can convey our cool quotient and help instil a sense of self-discipline in children.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Unfair trial          
	Sir  David Headleys guilty-plea bargain in the United States of America, after he confessed to plotting the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, may get him off the hook (Headleys right to silence in terror trial, March 22). It is now doubtful whether India will get direct access to Headley for interrogation. The US government has asserted that Headley will not be extradited to India. Indias problem is that it takes other countries to be more friendly than they actually are. After 26/11, the Federal Bureau of Investigation scrutinized the terror attack sites in Mumbai and even got access to Ajmal Kasab. But at a time when India has sought access to Headley for the same attack that killed over 160 people, a friendly US is hesitant to grant permission.          
	India lacks the spine to enforce its laws. The FBI should have never been allowed to get involved in the 26/11 investigations. And, more importantly, it should not have been given access to Kasab. If India had used its laws to achieve this, it would have had something to bargain with to gain access to Headley. Indias lack of will to enforce its laws, especially with foreign governments, had been displayed earlier when an American chartered plane, containing US Marines, entered Indian airspace without permission and was forced to land in the Mumbai airport. While the plane was grounded, the crew and passengers were allowed to check into a five-star hotel in Mumbai. They should ideally have been kept in lock-up till the issue was sorted out. In another country, such an incident would have been taken far more seriously. But in India, it did not create a flutter.           
	On the other hand, the Indian government kept quiet when a non-resident Indian, Vikram Buddhi, was sentenced to 57 months in prison in the US for the minor charge of posting hate messages on the internet to the then US president, George W. Bush. Why did the Indian government not intervene in this matter? It is time the government showed some spirit and stood up for its laws and for the rights of its citizens. It should not succumb to pressure from foreign governments.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa 

                
	Sir  As an Indian, it is painful to learn that death penalty and extradition to India have been ruled out for David Headley because he pleaded guilty to all the 12 counts that he has been charged with before a US court. Headley has also pledged to cooperate with the US governments investigations. I am against death penalty, and I also believe that Headley is more useful alive than dead. He may cooperate and give information about other conspiracies against India and Denmark. The US attorney-general, Eric Holder, said that the guilty plea is a crucial step towards achieving justice for the people who lost their lives in the Mumbai attack.          
	Now that it is no longer possible for India to extradite Headley, it needs to work with the FBI to obtain more information about him. The Indian authorities should also interrogate Headley through video conferencing. People here are eager to know how Headley was issued a visa to India, the monetary transactions that may have taken place, as well as about his possible connections with members of the Indian elite.           
	Finally, it is amazing that Headley, who was arrested by the FBI as recently as October last year, was brought before a US court, investigated for his crimes and had charges filed against him in a matter of five months. This has hardly been the case as far as Ajmal Kasab is concerned. Kasab was arrested more than a year ago, but his trial seems to be moving at snails pace. The Indian judiciary has not yet been able to decide on his punishment. Swift judgements are required in Indian courts to curb corruption and crime. The Indian judiciary perhaps can learn a lesson from the US judicial system.                    
	Yours faithfully,

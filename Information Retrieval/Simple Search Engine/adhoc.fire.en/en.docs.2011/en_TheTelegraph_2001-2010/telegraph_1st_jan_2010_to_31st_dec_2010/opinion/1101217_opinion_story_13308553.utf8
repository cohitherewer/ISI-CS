The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | A journey through a memorable life
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        A JOURNEY THROUGH A MEMORABLE LIFE                                                      The 46664 Concert: In Celebration of Nelson Mandelas Life, London, 2008                      
	Nelson Mandela: Conversations with Myself Macmillan, 25              
	Prisoner 466/64 is better known to the world as Nelson Mandela. Born in a small village of Transkei in South Africa in 1918, the infant named Rolihlahla grew up to become one of the worlds great iconic figures. The birth-name given to the Xhosa boy by his father translates as pulling the branch of a tree, but its colloquial meaning is troublemaker. Somewhat prophetic, given that he grew up to create and weather many storms.        
	While there is no dearth of literature on Mandela, in some sense very little is known about the man himself. Nelson Mandela: Conversations with Myself aims to fill that void by providing further insight into his life and personality. Though this book will have a special appeal for archivists, historians and, particularly, persons with prior knowledge of Mandela and his work and struggle, it is nevertheless engrossing even for the ordinary reader. Its meticulous documentation of Mandelas letters, journals and interviews during his incarceration not only provides a timeline of South Africas struggle against apartheid, but also reveals how focussed Mandelas agenda was during and after his internment.        
	Conversations with Myself was not composed by Mandela himself, but is the product of a team of dedicated researchers and archivists who, in their attempt to document the scattered and fragmented Mandela Archive, discovered the makings of a very interesting book. While scouring through masses of material, the editors decided to divide the book into four sections  the first comprises the prison letters found in two hardcover exercise books of carefully drafted and very poignant writings dating from 1969 to 1971 that Mandela sent to the prison censors at Robben Island. Stolen from his cell in 1971, they were subsequently handed over to him by a former security policeman in 2004, long after his release. All through his jail term, Mandela was never sure whether his letters would reach their destination due to the actions of what he called those remorseless fates, implying the censors.        
	The second section comprises taped conversations, or what was spoken rather than written by Mandela. These conversations drifted from being informal and intimate to reverie, with Mandela sometimes even entering into a dialogue with himself. The first set is about 50 hours of conversation with Richard Stengel, the editor of the Time magazine, made when the two men were working together on Mandelas autobiography  Long Walk to Freedom. The second set, 20 hours long, is with the anti-apartheid activist, politician and member of the African National Congress, Ahmed Kathrada, when the latter was asked to assist Mandela in reviewing the drafts of Long Walk to Freedom. Kathrada and Mandela, along with six others, were sentenced to life imprisonment on June 12, 1964.        
	It was a habit with Mandela to carry a notebook wherever he went. He had one with him when he travelled across Africa to learn about revolutionary strategies and to be trained in guerrilla warfare, and later during his travels in England. He had a notebook on him the day he was taken into custody in 1962, shortly after his return to South Africa; he resumed this practice after his release, when he was negotiating South Africas transition to democracy. The third section contains excerpts from his notebooks  notes to himself, aide-mmoires, records of meetings and drafts of letters. The last segment contains snippets from an unfinished sequel to Long Walk to Freedom which he was unable to complete.        
	Though Mandela himself declined to take responsibility for this project, he, along with several others, provided valuable material for the work. Not surprisingly, the final outcome is a carefully produced book that dispassionately portrays Mandelas unwavering resolve to end apartheid and convert South Africa into a democracy.        
	While Conversations with Myself brings the reader closer to getting to know Mandela, one is also made aware that he is indeed a very private man, as indicated in his conversations with Stengel and Kathrada. This becomes particularly evident when he repeatedly refuses to answer Stengels questions about his marital life.        
	The conversations between Mandela and Kathrada over an anonymous phone call implicating Kathrada of Mandelas arrest on August 5, 1962 may appear cryptic to the reader at the first glance, but in retrospect it paints a vivid picture of the uncertain times they were living in.        
	Mandela kept a series of desk calendars at Robben Island, at the Pollsmoor prison and later at the Victor Verster prison that ran from 1976 to 1989. Though entries were not made daily or even weekly, we learn that certain necessities, like milk for tea, taken for granted in the outside world, were seen as perks in the prison, while the word raid, jotted on July 21,1976, sounds ominous.        
	Despite being subjected to prison brutality and hard labour, compounded by inclement weather, in a conversation with Stengel, Mandela recalls never having had nightmares while at Robben Island (1964-82). He, however, admits to feeling anger and sorrow in a small cell in the infamous prison. The refusal of the permission to attend his mothers funeral and, later, the last rites of his eldest son, Thembi, is permanently etched in his mind. Mandela hardly has any unkind word to say of the prison officers at Robben Island. He instead blames the injustice of the system that prevented him from attending his mothers and his sons last rites.        
	Mandelas privileges extended, and also his leverage with the authorities, when he moved to the Pollsmoor prison (1982-88). In the Victor Verster prison (1988-90), he occupied a spacious bungalow and could see and communicate with anyone he chose. He was taken out of prison to see the sights and he even attended high-level meetings. He was already president-in-waiting.        
	Sometime after his release, to a question by Stengel about avoiding rabble-rousing speeches, Mandela emphatically replied that it was not pertinent to negotiating a settlement. While commenting on the ANC being a major political party to reckon with, he added that the police force, and not the political parties, should be the defenders of democracy. Stating that the apartheid regime had thrown law and order into disrepute, he asserted that in the new South Africa, even the president would be answerable to the law.        
	Conversations with Myself provides a gripping account of a man whose story is woven into South Africas journey, from colonialism through apartheid to democracy.

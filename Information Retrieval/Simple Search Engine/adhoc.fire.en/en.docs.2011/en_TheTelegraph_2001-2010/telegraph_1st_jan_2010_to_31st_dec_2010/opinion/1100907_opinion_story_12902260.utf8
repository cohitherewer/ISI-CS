	The world depression of 1929, which lingered on into the 1930s, is the last great depression of the sort that had been common in the 19th century. John Maynard Keynes devised a solution for depressions in his General Theory in 1936  an increase in the excess of government expenditure over revenue, which is euphemistically called the stimulus today. The world hurtled into the World War in 1939. After it ended, no great depressions occurred; it was commonly believed that countries had learnt to apply Keynesian policies and avoid depressions. The belief was tested in the 2008 downturn. Since then, the United States of America and the European Union have returned to positive if unstable growth, but both have high levels of unemployment; the two indicators give conflicting signals. Confidence in future growth has been shaken; and shaky confidence can lead to further instability. So while there is no depression, there is no longer an unshaken faith in its irrelevance.        
	What was the 1929 depression like? How did it look then? What were seen to be its causes? And what remedies were being proposed? These questions have come alive again. Sir Halley Stewart Trust, a British charity, put these questions to six eminent British men and asked them to give lectures on the subject in 1932. Their answers make interesting reading today. The series was started off by Sir Arthur Salter, who looked after shipping in the British government during World War I when supplies coming in from the US were at the risk of being torpedoed by German U-boats and the limited transport capacity had to be rationed, and who later worked in the League of Nations.              
	In his view, the Western economies had changed radically in the previous years. Mechanization had reduced the marginal cost of production of industrial products, so their production did not shrink when their prices fell; it had become less responsive to price changes. As people grew rich, a high proportion of demand had become discretionary. It moved capriciously from one product to another, causing surplus capacity and unemployment in industries from which consumers turned away. The rise of the Soviet Union, with its centrally planned economy, had introduced a disparate element in what had been a broadly competitive world market before. And mechanization of agriculture had reduced its cost of production, but the demand for its products  principally foodgrains  was inelastic; so agriculture did not grow when agricultural prices fell, and agricultural workers were thrown out of employment.        
	These factors would have caused disruption even if there had been no World War; the war made things worse in three ways. Germany and its allies, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria, lost the war and had to pay reparations. So they transferred 80 million to the US and France every year. The two countries did not buy anything in return. So they introduced a standing imbalance in world payments. Since they would not take goods or lend money, they had to be paid in gold. As they accumulated gold, its supply fell short of demand in the rest of the world, and its price rose. In other words, the prices of everything else fell. The deflation put debtors in trouble, especially the countries of Eastern Europe and Latin America, which borrowed heavily in the 1920s, and the producers of agricultural goods, whose prices fell by 50 per cent. The fall in prices set the stage for default by debtor countries.        
	Sir Henry Clay added another explanation of the post-war troubles. According to him, every war requires diversion of resources from peacetime to wartime activities; return of peace requires the reverse. Each diversion requires new investment in the industries to which demand has turned. But there is no way of reducing the capacity in industries from which demand has turned away. The resulting excess of capacity over demand was the basic cause of the depression. Countries with excess capacity obstructed imports of competing goods in an attempt to divert demand from imports to domestic industry. Such import substitution reduced the demand for goods in international trade, and worsened the balances of payments of exporting countries. They, in turn, took protective measures when their exports fell. There was thus cumulative shrinking of world trade.         
	Keynes feared that the cumulative downward spiral would end up in a financial crisis, in which countries and debtors would default, leading to a cycle of defaults. But he also saw cheering signs. Britain left the gold standard and let the pound float in 1931; Keynes thoroughly approved of the decision. For one thing, it stopped the decline of prices in the United Kingdom. For another, it led to a world exodus from the gold standard; first it was the British empire, and then other countries such as Japan, South America and Scandinavia.         
	India had started exporting gold. That was because farmers in distress were selling the jewellery of their wives, but Keynes, who thought hoarding gold was silly, thoroughly approved. He thought that Indias gold would satisfy the demand for gold from the US and France and end the deflationary pressure that their hunger for gold was exerting. The currencies of countries that had gone off gold had depreciated, and the franc and the dollar had appreciated. That would worsen Frances balance of payments; when reparation payments ended in a couple of years, France would be forced to go off gold. The US would follow with some delay. Once the gold transfers to the US and France ceased, gold shortage would ease, interest rates would come down, and cheap credit would become available for the next expansion.              
	Keyness optimism proved wrong; after the reparations ceased, the US went into a prolonged slump, and so did the rest of the world. He revised his optimistic views, and went on to preach that to get countries out of depression, governments had to spend more even if they could not raise the money out of taxes; in other words, they had to run fiscal deficits. Neither the US nor the UK took his advice; both continued to be in a coma until the World War rescued them. The only major country that took his advice and ran deficits was Germany.        
	It was not because Hitler read Keynes, but because he wanted to prepare an army big enough to vanquish Britain and France and overrun the whole of Europe. Germany had no unemployment; on the contrary, it had such a labour shortage that Hitler, who would have loved to kill all the Jews in his empire, instead enslaved them and put them to work in factories  at least at the outset.        
	After the War, industrial economies had little unemployment for half a century, and Keynes was shelved. It was only after the recent crisis that governments began to follow his advice and adopted stimulus packages. But they still have to read Schumpeter, who said that in the long run, growth is driven by innovation. The surge given by innovation of information technology has come to an end; the industrial countries still have to find the next surge of innovation.        
	What might it be? No one knows, but every scientist can dream that he will be its leader.

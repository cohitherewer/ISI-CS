	QUARANTINE By Rahul Mehta, Random House, Rs 399        
	It would perhaps be more accurate to describe Rahul Mehtas book as the draft of a first novel rather than as a collection of short stories. At least that is the feeling you are left with as you finish the book, which should not take you very long. Mehtas prose is so easy that it makes no demand on the reader. Although he is presumably inspired by brilliant and complex writers like Raymond Carver, John Cheever and Jhumpa Lahiri, Mehta seems quite happy to linger on the surface of things. You can quickly skip from one story to the next without having to pause and catch your breath, as you must in case of Carvers little gems or Lahiris long short stories.        
	Mehta almost courts banality by choosing a rather hackneyed theme  the trials of that special breed of humanity frivolously referred to as ABCDs or American Born Confused Desis. Still, he could have done something worthwhile with the clich had he not decided to follow every textbook theory to the last detail. So, having savoured the crisper, if not more entertaining, tales of Bharati Mukherjee, we now encounter the same stereotypes in Mehtas stories. Yet grumpy old grandparents, struggling immigrants and their spoilt brats would not have been such a bad deal either  most clichs, in reality, turn out to be quite true  had Mehta not laid on the ironies with a trowel. Closely documented, the tics of the Indian diaspora will amuse or irritate readers in the subcontinent, but in spite of flashes of accomplished writing, Mehta largely fails to cut through the film of familiarity and take us to a rich and strange terrain.        
	Rather, his limited canvas is damaged by the consistency with which typical characters recur in almost all the nine stories: long-suffering but eternally-forgiving mothers shedding silent tears or pining away for homeland; Mr Bennet-like fathers wilfully oblivious to the drama around them; their grown-up offspring behaving mostly like jerks. The first-person narrator or the protagonist (as the case may be) of every story happens to be an ABCD who is gay (ABCDG). Although he is given a different name in each story, and paired with a different boyfriend (mostly a white American) each time, his personality remains essentially the same. The couple grow so familiar along the way that you can almost start predicting what they will do or say to each other next  which kind of justifies the sense of going through chapters of a projected novel that never quite took off.         
	Mr ABCDG often offers himself as a study in meanness and meteoric shifts of temper, while his more placid partner is the voice of reason, and often endearingly cute in a clumsy way (Frank in The Better Person, for instance). In some of the stories, the twain travel to India and spend a nerve-racking time amidst dotty relatives and wily tricksters, exhausted by the heat and the dust, and waylaid by cunning natives at every opportunity. Imagine the choicest disasters warned in The Lonely Planet Guide to India taking place in a Gurinder Chadha slapstick. The result is a rollicking passage or two  in Ten Thousand Years, for instance which one would rather not give away, given the paucity of such moments of genuine comic relief.        
	Mehtas characters are usually a grim, even psychotic, lot (one of them habitually burns dollar bills). In Floating, the paranoid narrator is suspicious of everything, like a vintage Woody Allen character, and finds himself in situations that warrant the light but sure touch of someone like David Sedaris, the humorist best known for his columns for The New Yorker. Although he shows promise as a comic writer, Mehta never quite makes the mark. His narrator rarely laughs at himself, even after being shamefully let down by his gaydar in India, so the reader almost always laughs at him, never with him. Eventually, bored by the self-regarding tone, the reader may start sneering at him.         
	Mehta gives you so many reasons to sneer that after a while you might as well be snarling. You scowl at the pusillanimous hero of the title story when he defends his fathers unacceptable silence against his grandfathers shockingly rude behaviour towards his mother. There are several cringe-making mumbo-jumbos (You will see things that will haunt you for the rest of your life, the narrator of Ten Thousand Years tells his American boyfriend visiting India for the first time), mushy moments (the squabbling couple in the same story make up by feeding each other Cadbury squares under the night sky), and pseudo-profound musings (the writer-narrator in What We Mean actually says things like I cannot bear the things I must say, day after day, and the words I must use to say them, sounding like Virginia Woolf on a bad day).         
	But the presiding genius of Mehtas stories, with their angst-ridden, maladjusted, and chronically insecure dramatis personae, is really The Oprah Winfrey Show, Middle Americas favourite emotional dumping ground. But Oprah is nothing if not hugely entertaining. Mehta, sadly, is not. Or at least not yet.

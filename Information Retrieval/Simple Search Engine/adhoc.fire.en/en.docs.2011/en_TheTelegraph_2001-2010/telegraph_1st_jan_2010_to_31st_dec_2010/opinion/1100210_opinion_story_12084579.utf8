                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MAN HUNT                                                    
	On the 62nd Independence Day celebrations earlier this month, Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president of Sri Lanka, swore that reconciliation and trust-building were to be the cornerstones of his governance. The events that have followed his re-election suggest otherwise. Had it been any less obsessed with political vendetta than before, the newly-elected government of Mr Rajapaksa would have focused on the crying needs of the hour  economic and political reform, and resettlement of the displaced minorities. Instead, the government has got busy with engineering the biggest ever purge of the military in the history of the nation, following it up with the arrest of Sarath Fonseka, the former general and now the main face of the opposition. Mr Fonseka has been charged with conspiring to overthrow the government, but the details of the allegations have not been provided. Since running as a presidential candidate in a democratically held election cannot be construed as treason, it is to be surmised that the charges relate to Mr Fonsekas pre-election dispensation. The government, however, has raised suspicions about Mr Fonsekas activities both before and after the elections and indicated that he has been acting on behalf of foreign powers to destabilize the nation. The stoking of nationalist fervour, apart from taking the shine off the former generals heroism, suits the governments intention to block international investigation into its handling of the war against the Tamil rebels. Incidentally, Mr Fonseka was supposed to depose before an international court on war crimes in the next few days.        
	Notwithstanding its claims, the governments actions speak volumes about its feeling of insecurity. It is strange that despite the support of an overwhelming majority, the dispensation should be assailed by a siege mentality. In the grip of this fear psychosis, generated and propagated by those in power, the nation will neither be able to rid itself of its long-standing problems nor tackle vices like corruption and nepotism that have made a lot of people root for an alternative political leadership. The parliamentary elections in Sri Lanka are yet to come. Unless the Rajapaksa administration is careful, its hunt for the enemy could end up galvanizing the opposition, rallying international opinion against the government, and turning it into the biggest enemy to peace.

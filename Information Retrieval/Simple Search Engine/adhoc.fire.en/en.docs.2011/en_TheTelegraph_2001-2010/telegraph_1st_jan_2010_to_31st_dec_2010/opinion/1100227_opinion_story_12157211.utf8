The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Solving problems away from the limelight 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SOLVING PROBLEMS AWAY FROM THE LIMELIGHT                                   The finance minister used the budget speech to hint at what the government, as a collective, is thinking, writes Shubhashis Gangopadhyay                                            
	The finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, is a seasoned politician and, hence, very pragmatic. He is neither an idealist nor a fundamentalist; he is, however, a problem solver. This budget was being placed in Parliament at a time when there are no impending state elections except in Bihar, and when the United Progressive Alliance government has a mandate for another four years. One may have thought that, therefore, he will announce many big-ticket items regarding policy reforms like labour or relaxing caps on foreign direct investment. This would have certainly made him very popular among many analysts who keep coming up on television channels.         
	However, he is pragmatic enough to know that these are issues best tackled outside the budget, regardless of what some may feel about them. Moreover, many of the big-ticket items are outside the purview of the finance ministry, and it is irresponsible for a finance minister to make commitments on behalf of his colleagues. Nevertheless, over time, and because of the media spotlight, the budget speech has increasingly been seen as a policy document. The finance minister, therefore, used the speech to hint at what the government, as a collective, is thinking about.         
	This is evident in his declaration that the government will address the issue of opening up the retail trade in agriculture; raise revenues through disinvestments in public sector units; issue more licences to private sector banks with non-bank financial corporations being allowed to bid for them; rationalize fertilizer and petroleum subsidies, and strengthen transparency and accountability in the delivery of public services. All of these are political decisions where more than one ministry is involved, as well as the state governments in some of them. We know what he wants; we know what the government wants. What we need to wait and watch for is the distance that a coalition government will be able to go. The finance minister has shunned the temporary limelight that comes from a bold policy statement; instead, he has decided to float the areas of impending reforms in a way that encourages his colleagues to come forward and share the kudos from implementing major reforms in policy.               
	The most awaited part of this budget was the ministers plans regarding the fiscal deficit and the rollback of the fiscal stimulus. This being completely within the purview of his ministry, he has taken decisive steps to usher in fiscal consolidation as suggested by the report of the 13th Finance Commission. He could have easily gone in for fiscal consolidation without mentioning the Finance Commission. Instead, he takes that as a benchmark and a target to be achieved by 2014-15. Without second thoughts, he has agreed with the Finance Commissions suggestions to cap the public debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product; attempting such a cap is a first, and he should be applauded. After all, what is the reason for having an expert group if you are not going to accept its advice?        
	The finance minister has also made a clear commitment on the implementation of the direct tax code by April 1, 2011. This is something within his jurisdiction and he has sought no concession on its timing. The goods and services tax, on the other hand, requires the states and the Parliament to come on board  the latter for the necessary amendment to implement service tax collections envisaged under the GST. Here, he has honestly said that he will try his best to get it implemented by the 2011 fiscal year.        
	I have already talked about his intention of opening up the retail trade in agriculture. He says that this will improve the management of the supply chain and reduce the colossal wastage of produce that now happens in agriculture. For consistency, he has also allowed the Food Corporation of India to rent private storage capacities, giving a boost to agricultural warehouses in the private sector, especially in the food sector. He has specifically talked about extending the Green Revolution to the eastern parts of India. And, he has committed resources for water harvesting, improving soil fertility and for increasing dry land productivity.        
	I have a small disappointment, though. Throughout the years, we have been trying to increase the credit to the agricultural sector through increased subsidization of interest rates. However, for credit to work, it is imperative for the government to develop the market for risk-trading by the farmers. The continued focus on subsidized credit is becoming more like loan pushing without solving a major problem faced by credit-taking farmers. Does it really matter whether the loan that cannot be repaid had an interest subsidy? Access to credit is important, but so is the management of the default risk faced by the farmers. Unless we start doing something about it, we will continue to be caught up in the unsustainable web of subsidizing interest rates and insurance premiums.              
	The budget has continued with the UPA governments emphasis on the social sector. Connecting the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act with the health insurance plan for the poor through a common digital smart card is a master-stroke. This not only makes record-keeping more complete, it also allows cross-referencing that makes corruption that much more difficult. It is unfortunate that we are so caught up in tinkering with old non-working solutions that we have not appreciated the far-reaching consequences of this small step for direct service delivery.        
	One of the big problems facing the country is that of productive employment for its youth. The global crisis had a huge negative impact on export dependent sectors like textiles and gems and jewellery. An astute finance minister has focused on precisely these sectors for job creation through training of the youth. In addition, he has continued with the interest subvention of two per cent for one more year for exports of handicraft, carpets, handloom and those of small and medium enterprises.              
	This leaves us with two things more to cover. One, of course, is taxes and fiscal deficit. A critical review of the details in the tax proposals will be done by experts. However, I am unable to understand why it was necessary to reduce the income tax burden through a reorganization of the slab rates. Unless, of course, the minister felt that since excise taxes were being raised, people may buy less which could actually reduce the indirect tax collection. However, if they have more money in their pocket, they may actually continue with their levels of purchases so that the finance minister could collect back the amount through indirect taxes.        
	This brings me to the last thing that I have to say. I never thought that I will ever see the day when the Left and the Right will spontaneously come together or, Sushma Swaraj and Mulayam Singh Yadav will hold hands along with Lalu Prasad and Gurudas Dasgupta. I do not think that any Bollywood script-writer could have ever conjured up such a storyline. I do not know if this scene was scripted by the finance minister or the actual actors themselves. Whichever it was, it was fantastic and for this alone the 2010-11 budget speech in Parliament has become a historical one. Thank you, Mr Finance Minister.

	Waste not                  
	Sir  In his article, Heartlessness is king (Sept 24), Ashok Mitra argues convincingly. As Mitra points out, the Supreme Courts injunction to the Centre to distribute free foodgrain to the poor has indeed fuelled a fresh debate on the roles of the executive and the judiciary.          
	According to some lawyers, the courts directive is an encroachment on the executives responsibilities. Another group agrees that it is the courts prerogative to protect the peoples fundamental rights. Even if the right to food is not a fundamental right, every citizen has the right to life. The availability of sufficient food, Mitra argues, is essential to sustain life. While the two organs of State power grapple with the niceties of constitutional propriety, the country continues to suffer from a severe food shortage.           
	The public outcry over the organization of the Commonwealth Games has deflected attention from a more shocking truth. Even as people starve, several million tonnes of foodgrain procured by the government lie rotting in open godowns due to the lack of proper storage facilities. More grain is wasted in the godowns of the Food Corporation of India. It is extremely disturbing that despite a high rate of growth of Indias gross domestic product, thousands in this country still suffer from malnutrition and live on the brink of starvation.          
	Mitra correctly says that the moral and humanitarian aspects of the circumstance are being ignored. Laws, after all, are made for men, and not the other way round. The governments heartless pursuit of what Mitra has branded as neoclassical economics means that it will not interfere with the market forces of demand and supply in any way.           
	However, even this rationale is defied by the fact that the FCI has purchased one million tonnes of foodgrain at prices higher than those prevailing in the market. By doing so, Mitra asserts, the government has ensured that the incentive to produce remains unaffected. On the other hand, the starving poor, who have no purchasing power, are unable to influence the demand side of the market.           
	The governments flawed economic reasoning can only be called inhuman, if not utterly bogus. Perhaps it is time that the electorate expressed its dissatisfaction with such a government.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra is of the opinion that the government purchases foodgrain from farmers and traders in order to preserve the producers incentive. Since most of this produce goes to waste, the Supreme Court has instructed the government to distribute foodgrain for free to the poor. However, if the beneficiaries of this undertaking have zero purchasing power to begin with, and cannot participate in the market process, it is not clear how this scheme will bring down food prices in the market.          
	The government is inclined to ignore the apex courts advice. As Mitra argues, the State is willing to spend Rs 1,000 crore from the public exchequer to buy foodgrain. What is baffling is that it is willing to let the purchased grain go to waste instead of distributing it to the poor and the needy. A sympathetic judiciary seems powerless to remedy the situation.           
	If democracy means that the privileged few can afford to be callous to the sufferings of poor and starving people, perhaps there is no point in continuing with it.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra has criticized the government for letting foodgrain rot in storage instead of distributing it for free to those who are starving. With India anxious to integrate itself with the global market, the government has refused to interfere with the market forces of demand and supply. According to Mitra, the Indian government has closely followed the economic principles enumerated in the Washington Consensus.           
	However, in the context of a global economy, there are people, not just in India but across the world, who would benefit from the distribution of foodgrain. It is unfortunate that India has pursued globalization only to maximize profits. It has not assumed any of the humanitarian duties that come with globalization. Had it done so, millions of people might have been saved without the Indian economy getting hurt.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitra is absolutely right in endorsing the Supreme Courts directive to the government to distribute free foodgrain to the poor. It cannot be said that the apex court transgressed the boundaries between the executive and the judiciary in this matter. Even if the courts directive was not strictly in keeping with constitutional propriety, at least it stemmed from humanitarian concerns.           
	It is true that the government represents the will of the people. However, it is also the governments constitutional duty to look after the well being of those who have voted it to power. When it fails in this task, the Supreme Court may well act on behalf of the people and protect certain fundamental rights. It is extremely important to make sure that the peoples interests are safeguarded. It is not so important who does it.           
	The Constitution of India must, of course, provide the blueprint according to which the various institutions of our country function. It is advisable to follow the tenets of the Constitution as closely as possible. However, when humanitarian concerns are at stake, and people are suffering because of bad administration and faulty policies, constitutional barriers cannot be held supreme. The politics of heartlessness cannot be allowed to rule.           
	Yours faithfully,

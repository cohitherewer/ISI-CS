	In deaths other kingdom                
	Panna (Puffin, Rs 125) by Kamala Das is a childrens book which adults too will find enticing. It is the story of Panna, a lovely young girl, who lives with her fisherman brother, Moti, near the seashore. One day Moti goes to the high seas to catch fish and doesnt return. Tired of waiting for him, Panna falls asleep on the beach and wakes up to find herself in the kingdom of the Fish King. The apparent meaning of the story is constantly challenged by the language, which suggests more than it states. For instance, the descriptions of Pannas sleep and subsequent awakening in the pearl-studded lanes of sea land read like an account of the journey from life to deaths other kingdom. At night, the rising tide, like a hissing serpent touches Pannas feet  She did not wake up. The waves fell back. Then they came with more power, more sound and, this time, carried Panna into the depths of the sea. As Panna wanders about in the sea-world, she forgets all about her previous life, leaving Moti disconsolate. He runs along the shore calling his sisters name, and is metamorphosed into an eagle that to this day keeps looking for the girl who travelled to strange lands and never returned. Puja Ahujas Madhubani-style illustrations add to the books beauty.                                  
	A Great Ball in China and My Little Taizhou (Tranquebar, Rs 295) by Shankar Sharma is one in the series of travelogues being brought out by Tranquebar. This is travel-writing with a difference, and the difference lies chiefly in the quirky, personal style of the accounts. Sharma went to teach English for a year in a Chinese school whose most distinguished ex-pupil is the Chinese president, Hu Jintao. This formidable fact does not prevent Sharma from dividing his students into two categories  Ducks and Geese  and to see himself as St Francis leading the boisterous gang. In one year of joy and woe, Sharma gets to travel all over China, manages to lose his way, and fall in love with the little town of Taizhou, where he taught.

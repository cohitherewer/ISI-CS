                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SOUND PROOF                                                    
	In West Bengal, it is always interesting to guess who is related to whom. Even without kinship ties, bonds can be unbreakable, if mysterious. The mystery may lie in pure coincidence, of course. It may have been coincidence that the two teams from the pollution control board that went to raid warehouses storing illegal firecrackers in South and North 24 Parganas found the police unhelpful. Apparently, stricter monitoring in Calcutta has led to illegal firecrackers being offloaded in the fringes, from where they may be brought back to the city. Even without this re-routing, the whole operation points to the failure in preventing the manufacture of crackers that cause a din above the decibel level fixed by the courts. The last-minute rescue mission by the board officials was disgracefully aborted too. The dealers managed to cut off the power supply and surrounded the inspection team while allegedly yelling abuses in the dark. The police were there, apparently inert. They are now trying to identify the troublemakers and have promised action against them. This was in North 24 Parganas. The team that went south fared no better; here the police merely pleaded ignorance of which crackers were banned.        
	Relationships are truly fascinating. Given the fact that some small, if uncertain, progress had been made in the sphere of noise control during Diwali in the last few years with the help of citizen groups and the police, this very obvious slide down the road to barbarism is more than a pity. It is frightening, for it has about it the air of deliberateness. Is it coincidence again that the two main political parties in West Bengal, bitterly hostile to each other, have agreed to feel deep concern for the small industry of cracker manufacturers? And that, as punctually, the police have suddenly grown innocent of the knowledge of banned crackers and decibel levels, letting firecracker dealers threaten and bully inspectors from the pollution board while they count pies in the dark sky? The auguries are not good. Already a careless cracker or open flame set a 15-storey building in Calcutta on fire. Stupidity and greed are really not the best ingredients for enjoyment in the long run.

	Did Paul Kagame really stop the genocide in Rwanda 16 years ago, or did he just interrupt it for a while? That question frightens him so much that he will not risk everything on the outcome of a democratic election.        
	Kagame is running for re-election to the presidency next month. If economic success brought political success, he would be a shoo-in: Rwandas economy grew by 11 per cent last year. But, in fact, his resounding victory in 2003 was the result of ruthless manipulation, and this one will be the same. Recently, Opposition leaders have been charged with denying the genocide and arrested. An Opposition newspaper was banned and its co-editors attacked. Generals in the army have been arrested or have fled into exile. So is Kagame over-reacting? Maybe.        
	If you cut Kagame open, you would find engraved on his heart William Faulkners terrible truth: The past is never dead. Its not even past. One-tenth of Rwandas population  at least 800,000 people, Tutsis and those who tried to protect them  were murdered by their neighbours only 16 years ago. Not nearly enough time has passed yet for a generational turnover to take the edge off the grief and the hate.        
	Kagames life has been shaped by genocide. He grew up in Uganda, where his parents fled when a wave of violence killed about 100,000 Tutsis in Rwanda in the 1960s. He became the leader of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a mainly Tutsi exile organization dedicated to overthrowing Hutu extremists who ruled the country. He led the RPF army that stopped the genocide of 1994.        
	He knows, of course, that Tutsis and Hutus are not really separate ethnic groups. All of Rwandas 19 major clans include both Tutsis and Hutus. They speak the same language and live in the same villages. The term once distinguished cattle-herders from farmers, and later the wealthy from the poor. Rich Hutus could become Tutsis; but the Tutsis naturally always remained a minority.                
	Against all odds        
	He also knows that colonial authorities exploited those class differences and gave the Tutsis political authority over the Hutus in return for their loyalty. By the late 20th century, the Tutsis and Hutus had become ethnic groups for all practical purposes, with a constant undercurrent of resentment of the Hutus against the Tutsis. After independence in 1960, the killing got under way quickly.        
	This past will not leave Rwanda alone. The very words Tutsi and Hutu have now been banned in Rwanda, but a ministerial investigation in 2008 found anti-Tutsi graffiti and harassment of Tutsi students in most schools that were visited. The army is exclusively Tutsi and the government almost entirely so because Kagame does not believe that this generation of Hutus can be trusted. He has only one strategy to avoid a return to genocide: hang onto power and hope that economic growth and the passage of time will eventually blur the identities and blunt the reflexes that have made this generation of Rwandans so dangerous to one another.        
	The logic of this strategy obliges him to stay in power: his first duty is to the Tutsis. But he must provide prosperity to the Hutu majority, too, to reconcile them to Tutsi survival. His relatively corruption-free government has made impressive progress towards that goal. Nevertheless, in a free election today, most Rwandans would vote along ethnic lines. His RPF would be instantly replaced by a Hutu-led regime of unknowable character. He dare not risk it, so real democracy is not an option.        
	If Kagame is now killing dissidents, then he is making a dreadful mistake. But it may not be him. In the ruthlessly Machiavellian world of Rwandan politics, other possibilities also exist. Either way, he must know that the odds are long against him.

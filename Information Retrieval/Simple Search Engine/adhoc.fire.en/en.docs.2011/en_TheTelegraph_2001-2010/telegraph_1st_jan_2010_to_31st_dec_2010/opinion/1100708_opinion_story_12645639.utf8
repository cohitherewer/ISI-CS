	Resting on laurels                  
	Sir  In his article, Politics in command (July 2), Ashok Mitra writes, The output of foodgrains, alongside that of other crops, has therefore advanced at a rate less than that of the rate of population growth. Has the author noticed that despite the population explosion since Independence, India has had few major famines, unlike China? This would not have been possible if our government had not cared for the development of agriculture. Our agricultural statistics remain fuzzy, and so there are certain misconceptions about them. Also, contrary to Mitras contention, the price rise does not seem to be a result of the hoarding of essential goods. It appears to be triggered mainly by a shortage of seasonal rainfall. Moreover, in a developing economy, inflation is bound to take place once in a while.          
	Mitra laments the proposal that programmes such as the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee scheme be transferred to private contractors. But such schemes are often misused by village panchayats. So transferring them to private contractors might be a corrective step.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra seems to be unaware of the economic policies of the Indian government. He has suggested in his article that the rule of the free market is absolute in India, and that the government is taking a capitalistic route. He should note that the government has lowered the target for national growth in the medium term from nine per cent to 8.5 per cent in order to make the growth an all-inclusive one. This means that the tax sops needed to achieve the nine per cent growth will not be implemented. This also implies that more revenue will be generated for the growth of the underdeveloped areas.          
	Mitra should acknowledge that capitalistic policies can also be beneficial for the people. He has criticized the use of contractors in rural development programmes. He should survey the condition of the rural health centres, which are rarely attended by doctors. These health centres would run much more efficiently if private players took over their charge.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Sambuddha Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Ashok Mitra should be congratulated for his hard-hitting and forthright views on the workings of the Indian government. The Centres incompetence in providing basic necessities to the people is immensely disappointing. If the government cannot even ensure food for all, the right to food bill becomes meaningless.          
	Why did India rest on laurels of the Green Revolution when it could not use it as a platform for future growth in the agricultural sector? Price rise inevitably results in people opting for cheaper forms of food that translates into lower nutrition and poor mental and physical development. Hence the government is weakening an entire generation. That it has not undertaken any major irrigation project for quite a while now speaks volumes about its lack of concern for the common man. What is worse, it cannot even ensure proper food storage facilities. Food is an issue that affects the people directly and immediately. If the government chooses to be indifferent on this matter, it will have to pay for its apathy in the next elections.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Vicious circle          
	Sir  Ruchir Joshis Bursting the balloon (June 27) was an insightful piece on the feudal mindset prevalent in urban India. According to the author, only Calcuttans can afford to be so unkind and brutal towards the needy. But I believe that the phenomenon is not limited to one city. Of late, a section of Indians has become rich all of a sudden. The neo-rich are proud of their newfound status and prosperity, and love flaunting their wealth. But money has failed to teach them good manners, and to inculcate genuine values in them. Joshi writes how the rich father laughed after bursting the poor boys balloons and did not even pay attention to his daughters chidings. This shows how older people, with their unfeeling actions and gestures, often influence the young in a wrong way.          
	On the other hand, the poor balloon-seller boy will probably grow up with a deep-seated hatred in his heart for the rich. Someday, he might even break the law to settle scores with the system that has made him a victim of social injustice. If these dangerous tendencies are not checked, they may cause serious trouble to the nation and its people. All people should be educated about their rights and the law. The solution lies not in creating reservations, but in creating a system that gives equal rights to all irrespective of caste, economic status and religion. India can certainly do without more internal insurgencies arising from inequality.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Alokananda Bhattacharyya, Guwahati

                
	Sir  Ruchir Joshi has skilfully analysed an ordinary incident from a new perspective. Little children on the streets, sometimes called street urchins, are often seen near traffic lights on main roads, trying their best to sell their wares in order to earn two square meals a day. The elite class feels a vehement need to assert its power over these children. For the rich, this is a way of showing off their class.          
	However, the conclusions drawn by Joshi are based on social and cultural stereotypes. First, the incident described is not unique to a particular city. If Calcutta is encased in small-town feudalism, Mumbaikars or Delhites too make rigorous efforts to maintain the status quo. Second, the way the man behaved with the balloon seller was factored by circumstances and by his individual psychology even if his arrogance was rooted in his social and financial superiority.

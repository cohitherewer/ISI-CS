	The Union human resource development minister has had another big meeting with 33, out of the 42, school boards in the country. Everything that Kapil Sibal has to say about education sounds terribly modern and right. The enthusiasm with which he speaks is also infectious, and gets more and more so as one moves further away from the actual stuff of teaching and learning in real classrooms towards the high rhetoric of policymaking. This time, Mr Sibal has created the usual flutter of excitement by taking up the issue of critical thinking as opposed to rote learning. He wants to change the way students are examined so that they cannot get away with simply memorizing their lessons and spewing them out in their tests. Nobody in his right senses would disagree with this. But the thing to do for every teacher, student, guardian and administrator in the country is to watch closely how this edict is translated into the necessary diversity of pedagogic practice. Critical thinking is something intangible and unmeasurable taking place inside peoples heads, and it is impossible to wish it into existence in a top-down or centralized manner through lofty ministerial edicts. To initiate the process by changing nothing but the existing examination systems could end up being profoundly unjust to the examinees. It would amount to throwing them in at the deep end without first having taught them to swim  or without first finding out if there are at all any people who might be able to teach them to swim.        
	Students learn by rote and use mindless methods of study because they are forced by a system to do so, for their own survival and for the survival of those whose interests are served by the system. At the core of this situation is an impossible number of students being taught by an inadequate number of overworked, underpaid, under-qualified and disgruntled teachers working in conditions where matters more rudimentary than critical thinking have to be fought for every day. Teachers cannot teach their students to think critically if they cannot afford to do so themselves, or if they work in scenarios where critical thinking sounds like a luxury. Without first teaching the teachers, such a change  some would call it a revolution  would be impossible to bring about simply by playing with the examinations. But who knows, critical thinking might even end up thinking Mr Sibals office out of existence.

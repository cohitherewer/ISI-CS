                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOPELESS DREAM                                                    
	In spite of Barack Obamas perceived firmness in ending the Israel-Palestine conflict, the recent talks between the two countries ended inconclusively, if not with a renewal of mutual bitterness. Israel has literally refused to concede an inch of land. Rather, after a ten-month-long moratorium on building new settlements in East Jerusalem, Israel is unwilling to extend the freeze. No amount of persuasion, even coercion, by the United States of America appear to have its desired effect on the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. In fact, the impunity with which Israel defied the US affirmed Mr Obamas signal failure in handling the Middle East crisis with conviction. Mr Netanyahu must have had good reason to feel that he can get away with anything  which is why he could behave with such utter brazenness.        
	In dealing with Palestine, Mr Obama was no less jittery. He repeated the mistake of his predecessors of disregarding the popular mandate enjoyed by the Hamas, which runs the only legally-elected government in Gaza. Incidentally, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of Palestine approved by the US, is not recognized as such in this region. Wishing away the Hamas in order to pander to Israels wishes is not going to make it vanish. On the contrary, Mr Obamas Middle East policy would gain a new lease of life and direction as soon as he reckons with this fact in a mature way. He could, for a start, give the Palestinian people an opportunity to elect a government of their own choice that could then confer legitimacy on future agreements with Israel. By refusing to come down heavily on Israel and helping to perpetuate a weak Palestinian leadership, Mr Obama is not only not doing the Middle East any good but also damaging his own diplomatic credentials. The longer he dithers on these fundamental issues, the possibility of any two-state solution becomes more and more remote. And with it, Mr Obamas dream of peace merely becomes an audacity of hope.

	Mahinda Rajapaksa, by his own admission, has begun his second term as president of Sri Lanka with a lot more confidence than before. Domestic peace and political stability are not the only factors that have contributed to his sense of equilibrium. Sri Lankas resurgent diplomatic relations, particularly with respect to South Asia, have played an equal part. If military and financial support from Pakistan, China, Libya and a host of other nations helped Sri Lanka win the decades-old battle against insurgency, the countrys refurbished diplomatic ties in the region now give it the ability to stave off unwelcome attention from the West. At the crux of Sri Lankas transformation from a violence-prone pariah nation to a darling of South Asia lies its importance to the redrawn strategies of nations jostling to balance power in the Indian Ocean region. China is the Pied Piper among them, but even before interests reshaped themselves in the region, India had realized the futility of its intrusive politics with regard to Sri Lanka and begun a rethink since the 1990s. The recent visit of the Indian foreign minister, S.M. Krishna, to inaugurate the two Indian consulates in Sri Lanka, and its outcome are reflective of the changed contours of this relationship. Indias commitment to the islands development and post-war reconstruction, to which it has pledged in the joint declaration during Mr Rajapaksas India visit, was evident in the massive aid it has promised for railway and road connections, housing projects, building a power plant and exploration of oil and other natural resources. The hands-off policy in domestic matters was, however, equally evident in Indias unwillingness to wade too deep into the post-war politics. It has merely prodded the dispensation in Sri Lanka to look towards the promised devolution of powers, and suggested a structured dialogue mechanism to resolve the stalemate.        
	It is unlikely that India will push any harder now that the Rajapaksa government intends to seek what it calls a wider political consensus. A push could jeopardize Indias strategic interests in the region and make Sri Lanka inch closer towards China, whose aid to Sri Lanka already overtakes Indias. Devolution has clearly taken a backseat to the economic miracle that the government is planning for. However, even without playing big brother, India should find a way to keep its neighbour conscious about its humanitarian concerns.

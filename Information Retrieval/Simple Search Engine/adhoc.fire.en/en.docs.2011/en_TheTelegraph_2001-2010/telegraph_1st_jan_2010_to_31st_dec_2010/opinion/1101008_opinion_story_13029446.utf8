	Silence of chickoo trees      
	Single in the city (Om, Rs 195) by Sushmita Bose abounds in clich. The book is a collection of pieces that appeared under a column of the same name in Hindustan Times. It records the trials of being young, good-looking, carefree in a new city. Bose, who is originally from Calcutta, spent eight years as a journalist in Delhi. Inevitably, fussy Bengali parents, air-kissing Delhi socialites and wild-eyed North Indian men populate the pages of the book. The short, anecdotal accounts might have made for a lively column but appear slightly disjointed in a longer work. If one can get past the sloppy editing, however, there is an exuberance in the pieces, a sense of beloved familiarity. Most women working and living alone in that savage and beautiful city, Delhi, will know exactly what Bose is talking about.                           
	Dahanu Road (HarperCollins, Rs 299) by Anosh Irani traces the history of a landowning family in the sleepy town of Dahanu. It is a history of violence and passion, a history where the oppressed become oppressors, where ruptures, between individuals as well as between communities, run deep. In the 1920s, Shahpur Irani fled persecution by Muslims in Iran and came to India. Eighty years later, his grandson, Zairos, is to inherit the land and orchards owned by the Iranis in Dahanu. But this land is riven by conflicts as well. For the Warlis, the local tribal people who work on the land, share a troubled relationship with the Iranis. When the body of Ganpat, a Warli, is found hanging from a chickoo tree, such tensions surge to the surface and the past unravels. Anosh Iranis latest offering is a saga of unrelenting tragedy and a tale well told.

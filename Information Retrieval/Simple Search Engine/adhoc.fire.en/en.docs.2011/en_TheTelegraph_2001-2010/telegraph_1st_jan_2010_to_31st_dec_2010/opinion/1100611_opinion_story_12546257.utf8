	Major Pettigrews Last Stand By Helen Simonson, Bloomsbury, Rs 650        
	Helen Simonson could easily have begun this novel with Once upon a time in the early 21st century in a village in England lived a man called Major Pettigrew. She has written a cute if a trifle quirky novel. It is very English, but it is also romantic. Over and above everything else, it is beautifully crafted.        
	Major Pettigrew is an old world Englishman living in a village called Edgecombe St Mary in Sussex. He lived alone in his cottage after the death of his wife. His only son lived in London trying to make a career as an investment banker. The major is a pillar of village society, a member of the village club and on familiar terms with the local gentry. Among his prized possessions is Churchill hunting gun given to him by his father, who served in Lahore during Indias independence and partition. His father had actually owned a pair. The other gun went to the Majors only brother, Bertie, with the explicit instruction that when one of the brothers died, the other was to get his gun so that the pair always remained with the Pettigrews.        
	The novel opens on the morning the Major receives the news of his brothers sudden death. While he is trying to come to terms with his loss, the doorbell rings and on his doorstep is Mrs Ali from the village shop. She has come for the newspaper money as the paper boy is sick. Mrs Ali realizes something is wrong, puts the Major down on a chair and makes him a cup of tea. He is profusely apologetic as he tells Mrs Ali about his brothers death. That brief encounter produces a relationship that is at the heart of this novel.        
	Needless to add, that the widow Mrs Ali, with all manner of domestic problems, arouses the chivalrous gentleman in the Major. He is the gallant Sir Galahad, even though in the wrong side of sixty, he is no longer in any condition to ride a white charger. A romance blossoms much to the shock and glee of Roger, the Majors son, and the gossipers of the village.        
	Around the romance, Simonson builds up a narrative about a fast-changing England struggling to cope with multiculturalism, the fears of Islamic fundamentalism, of the beautiful countryside being threatened by commercial developers and land sharks, of a declining gentry striving to maintain their status and lifestyle, of family values being eroded by greed and selfishness and of an old charm losing out to the demands of a more raucous and graceless age. It is against all these that the Major chooses to make his last stand to uphold all that he considers to be valuable.        
	The major is no Colonel Blimp bemoaning the setting of the sun on his beloved empire, nor is he John Bull hurling racist abuse in the local pub. He is an ordinary decent human being who loves his son, cherishes the countryside, is attached to his fathers guns and is fortunate to find a woman after his own heart in his old age. There is, however, something heroic about the Major.        
	It takes Roger time and the overcoming of his own personal problems to understand his father and the values he represents. He gives up coveting the guns that he wants to sell to raise capital. He begins to appreciate why his father and Mrs Ali love one another.        
	Interspersed with the telling of the story and the building of the characters, there is some evocative writing. To take an example: He [the Major] had been many decades, as man and boy, in the village of Edgecombe St Mary, and yet the walk down the hill to the village never ceased to give him pleasure. The lane was steeply cambered to either side, as if the narrow tarmac were the curving roof of some buried chamber. The dense hedges of privet, hawthorn and beech swelled together as fat and complacent as medieval burghers. The air was scented with their spicy dry fragrance overlaid with the tang of animals in the fields behind the cottages. Garden gates and driveways gave glimpses of well-stocked gardens and thick lawns studded with clover clumps and dandelions. He liked the clover, evidence of the country always pressing in close, quietly sabotaging anyone who tried to manicure nature into suburban submission. As he rounded a curve, the hedges gave way to the plain wire fence of a sheep field and allowed a view of twenty miles of Sussex countryside spreading beyond the roofs of the village below. Behind him, above his own house, the hills swelled upward into the rabbit-cropped grass of the chalk downs. Below him the Weald of Sussex cradled fields full of late rye and the acid yellow of mustard. He liked to pause at the stile, one foot up on the step, and drink in the landscape.        
	This is a life-affirming novel written with a delightful sense of humour. It is a love story even though the two principal characters are highly unlikely ones to be the protagonists of a romance. But Helen Simonson pulls it off because she creates in Major (retired) Ernest Pettigrew an adorable and an admirable character.

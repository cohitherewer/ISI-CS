	Memory has a bizarre propensity to privilege the most recent. Thus what will be remembered as 2010 nears its end will be the turmoil in Indian political life caused by a scandal in the allocation of the 2G spectrum and the leaks of some telephone conversations that were covertly taped. The former led to the removal of a cabinet minister and to a complete deadlock in the working of the Parliament. During the winter session that began in November, it only met on the inaugural day, and then every day its proceedings were adjourned as the Opposition wanted a joint parliamentary committee on the 2G spectrum allocation and the Treasury benches refused to concede to this end. The year thus ended with both the Upper House and the Lok Sabha not working and causing an enormous drain on the exchequer. As a sideshow, there were the leaks, most of them concerning attempts to influence the government in various ways regarding the 2G allocation. These revealed a most unseemly side of Indian public life  especially in politics, business and media  even though the shenanigans were all assumed to be private and for private gains.        
	The spectre of these overshadowed some significant developments. One was the remarkable performance of the economy. It was clear by the second half of 2009 that the Indian economy was picking up. By the second half of this year, not even a pessimist would deny that the gross domestic product would be close to nine per cent. This good news has to be balanced by the rising prices of some edible items like onions, sugar, dal and edible oils. There was also growing concern about the widening gap between the rich, the real beneficiaries of economic growth, and the poor, whose living conditions remain unchanged, if not deteriorating. Consequently, the interests of the aam admi re-entered the political rhetoric of the country with a new urgency. There was some irony in this concern, for the plight of the poor is being articulated at a time when details of corruption in the corridors of power have become the stock-in-trade of public opinion.        
	There was a time when corruption and poverty were synonymous with the province of Bihar. The Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, who was voted back to power, may have achieved the impossible in the state by putting it on the path of economic growth and good governance. His victory was seen by many as a sign of hope, as were the visits of the heads of State/government of all the countries that are members of the United Nations security council. Did these visits herald something momentous? India waits, according to conventional wisdom, in the wings of the global stage and the world economy. The debut will be watched as everyone expects that India will not strut and fret her hour upon the stage.

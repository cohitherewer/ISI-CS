	Tales from the far shores      
	ANOTHER GULMOHAR TREE (Penguin, Rs 225) and Insomnia and other stories (Penguin, Rs 199) by Aamer Hussein are two short works by the London-based Pakistani writer. The first is a lovely little novella opening with an enigmatic section teeming with myths, fairy tales and legends. The influence of Rumi, Arabian Nights and Punjabi folktales is palpable as the prose alternates between brevity and flights of exquisite poetry. Only in the latter half does this cryptic preamble start making sense, as it puts the lives of Usman, a writer, and his British wife, Lydia, in a deeply melancholic perspective. In between one reads of their courtship in post-war London. The account is tinged with an aching nostalgia but never descends to melodrama. It is, however, with a hint of disappointment that one puts down the book, which ends impressionistically, almost abruptly.        
	Husseins other offering, Insomnia, is a collection of seven short stories, each a model of control and precision. There is again a trace of formlessness in these little vignettes, as in the first one, Nine postcards from Sanlucar de Barrameda. It is, as the title points out, a series of short dream-like messages from a traveller to an unspecified recipient. In The Crane Girl, a boy pines away for a Japanese belle in London. In another story, a translator gets increasingly enmeshed in the turbulent life of the poet he is translating. It would be unfair to classify Hussein as a subcontinental writer since myriad voices, from Manto to Faiz to Kafka to Borges, cohabit his luminous imagination.                                
	Chicken soup for the indian armed forces soul (Westland, Rs 295) edited by Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen and Raksha Bharadia compiles 101 Stories of Service, Selflessness and Personal Courage. Collected under usefully titled sections  In the line of duty, Teaching and leaning, On family, and so on  these are most often first-person testimonies of living a life riddled with obstacles. From packing ones bag to go on the frontline to love, marriage and even anger management, the themes are various, involving fortitude as well as fun. Although literary merit may not be the strength of this volume, the editors cannot be faulted for being unimaginative. The epigraphs, for one, are peculiar at times. On family begins with a quote by Sachin Tendulkar, while Pushing the envelope with the words of Sun Tzu.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LOSS OF FACE                                                    
	More than the fear of terror attacks, it is the intense tropical sun that seems to be playing havoc with the minds of those concerned with the security of Bhopal. It is anyones guess why the authorities have singled out women riding two-wheelers with their faces covered as being the most suspicious entities in the entire city. Apparently, they look like potential terrorists. Does this mean that men on two-wheelers who hide behind scarves are less dangerous, and therefore exempt from the ban? What about those faceless millions who drive on or roam around the streets, with or without veils, each of whom may well be involved in some form of activity that could shatter public safety? In fact, by trying to emulate a similar embargo, put by a police order in Pune after the German bakery blast last month, the administration in Bhopal has ignored any useful lesson it could have learnt from the episode. It seems far more eager instead to internalize the mistakes of the past and perpetuate them.        
	In a country teeming with a billion diverse souls, the possibilities of imagining up a dreaded enemy are infinite. The State is likely to go round the bend if it even begins to embark on such a Herculean job. Which is precisely why it is useless to come up with random rules and regulations that only disrupt the rights of the citizens. Instead of gaining the peoples trust, the State succeeds in deepening public resentment when it tries to wield its iron will too hard. In a democracy, such an idea, in any case, should not be encouraged. But then, the powers that be may not be as silly as they appear to be. A seemingly thoughtless act is often full of hidden possibilities. By marking out women, the State will no doubt find it a good deal easier to enforce gender segregation, prevent elopements and marriages against parental will. A draconian measure like this is likely to find favour in a highly conservative society, and will probably do much good to the drooping image of the Bharatiya Janata Party. But such a primitive mentality is unlikely to win the approval of the nation in the long run.

	Making a coalition government work is often as difficult as keeping it alive. Having led two such  and short-lived  governments in the past, Jharkhands chief minister, Arjun Munda, should know this well. While putting together his new cabinet, he seems to have been guided primarily by factors that may matter for his governments survival. That perhaps explains why he has two deputy chief ministers, one each from the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the All Jharkhand Students Union  the two principal allies of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition. He has been just as even-handed in the distribution of portfolios among the three major partners. Even so, Mr Munda cannot be too confident that his balancing act will eventually keep the BJPs partners happy and his government stable. Rumblings of protest have already been heard from a section of the JMM leadership. The JMM itself has been a divided house since Shibu Soren began losing his grip on the party. Disaffection in the JMM ranks may not be Mr Mundas fault, but it can be a serious problem for his governments stability.        
	For the people of Jharkhand, though, the trade-off among the coalition partners is the least important aspect of the new regime. Over the past 10 years, the newly-formed state witnessed the arrivals and departures of several unstable governments. The result has been an administrative vacuum that has all but ruined the economy and the rule of law in Jharkhand. The political instability has also spawned a culture of endemic corruption among the politicians. So much so that a former chief minister, Madhu Koda, who was in office for just over a year, now faces prosecution on charges of making hundreds of crores of rupees through corrupt deals. The corruption scandals involving Mr Soren too are a reflection of the state of Jharkhands politics. Such betrayals by the politicians are particularly sad for a state that is among the poorest in the country and which faces a grim Maoist challenge. Mr Munda cannot afford to waste time and resources on keeping his ministers in good humour. He has to get the states administration back on its feet and attend to the peoples basic needs. Unless his government works, it will not matter to the people how long it survives. Jharkhand desperately needs a government that puts the interests of the people above those of the politicians.

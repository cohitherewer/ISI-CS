                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RESCUE FANTASY                                                    
	The BBCs choice of celebrities for the filming of documentaries on serious subjects may leave one wondering. Beyond that, there is hardly any surprise about the way Lindsay Lohan has talked about her trip to India to film the miseries of child labour and trafficking. She broke a law by travelling on a tourist visa although she had come to the country on work. That is certainly an offence, although she did not use her trip to set up terrorist camps. And she may have fantasized a bit after the trip. She claimed to have rescued 40 trafficked children and went to town with her feelings of pious ecstasy. It appears that she had not arrived in the country when that rescue took place. But some celebrities have a tendency to mix up fact and fiction. They thrive on attention, and that was all she was looking for.        
	That the Indian government is considering putting her on an immigration blacklist is perhaps taking her a bit too seriously. The visa offence should be looked at, and vigilance heightened, because not all visa offenders are ignorant or innocent. But Ms Lohan has not, for example, subverted the Constitution, or incited hatred, or engaged in terrorist activity or even got in touch with terrorists. These are the actions that merit blacklisting. Closing a countrys doors to a visitor is an overt expression of disapproval, and should be accorded the full weight it deserves. By blacklisting Ms Lohan, India would run the danger of making the same mistake as its erstwhile visitor: trivializing something serious. Even Madhuri Dixit once embarrassingly said that Nepal had earlier been a part of India. It was forgiven after the initial hullabaloo. Ms Lohan has done a couple of silly things. An easy-to-follow, step-by-step lesson on the need to have the right visa should be enough. Telling the truth cannot be taught.

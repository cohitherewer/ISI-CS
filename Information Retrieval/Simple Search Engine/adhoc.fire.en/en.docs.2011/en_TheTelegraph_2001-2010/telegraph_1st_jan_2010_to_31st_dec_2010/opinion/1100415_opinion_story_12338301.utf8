	Watching American Idol with my daughter, I realized that the main difference between my generation (born in the late 1950s) and my childrens generation (born in the early 1990s) is that I and my cohorts accepted that modernity happened first in a Western elsewhere but my children expect it to be available to them as it happens, in real time.        
	The difference is easily illustrated. I can remember going to a cinema hall in the early 1970s to watch a film about the Mexico Olympics, three years after the Games happened. It was a feature-length documentary but the time lag between event and screening made no difference to us. Another example of this willingness to wait, of our patient acceptance of the fact that the contemporary world would trickle down to us slowly and partially, was the way Indians received the half-hour of cricket footage that they were shown by Doordarshan weeks after the epochal 1971 Test series victory in the West Indies. We werent outraged at the meagreness of the coverage; on the contrary, we were grateful for Doordarshans crumbs.        
	Contrast this with my daughters irritation that her favourite show, American Idol, is telecast in India the day after its shown live in the US. I once made the mistake of reading her an online newspaper report on the latest singer to be eliminated from that talent contest, and she didnt speak to me for days: the thought that tens of millions of people were privy to something that hadnt happened in her world yet made her experience of American Idol feel second class, ersatz, not just time-delayed. Her brothers proprietary keenness on English Premier League football is based on the simultaneity that she craves: my son has a sense of ownership about the EPL because he sees the matches live, at the same time as every other Arsenal fan, which makes him a citizen of the world. How do I explain to them the canned excitement of watching Bob Beamon soar to his world record years after the event?              
	Indian standard time flowed stickily in autarkic, non-aligned India. We missed the booms and busts of the connected world: as late as 1997 the Asian financial crisis stopped at our borders because we were still sufficiently detached from the global economy to be relatively immune to its fevers. Our triumphs and disasters were local: a win against Pakistan in 1971, a drubbing at the hands of China in 1962. Come to think of it, even before Nehru and non-alignment, the history of the subcontinent set it a little apart from the highways of 20th-century history. If the signature events of the last century were world wars and revolutions, India had no direct experience of either. Indians fought and died in large numbers in both world wars but India was spared the horror being a battleground. The country also managed to sidestep bloody revolution and the millenarian dreams and violence associated with such transformation.        
	When Raj Krishna minted the term the Hindu rate of growth to describe Indias feeble economic expansion between 1950 and 1980 as compared to the more rapid economic development of Taiwan or Korea, he wasnt so much proposing a number (3.5 per cent) as offering a metaphor that captured Indias laggardly nature.        
	For Indias middle class this meant that its life was lived in a time delay. So English-reading Indians of my generation kept poring over Enid Blyton years after their English counterparts had moved on. No Indian schoolchild of the Sixties had ever heard of Roald Dahl even though some of his best childrens fiction was written in the early Sixties: James and the Giant Peach was published in 1961 while the classic Charlie and the Chocolate Factory changed the rules of childrens fiction in 1964. Meanwhile, Indian schoolchildren in the Sixties and Seventies continued to read writers who had established themselves in the early decades of the century: Frank Richards (the Billy Bunter stories) and Richmal Crompton (the William books). My school library didnt have a single book by Dahl though it had the complete works of G.A. Henty, a writer who made Kipling seem liberal, who was born in 1832 and whose oeuvre of adventure stories for boys had been entirely written in the 19th century.        
	This was a world where the university syllabi for the history of Europe ended at 1939 (the Second World War was too dangerously recent to teach), where school anthologies of English verse closed with the Romantics or Dover Beach. I remember being envious when a friend doing the Indian School Certificate (or Senior Cambridge) exam, told me that To Kill a Mocking Bird, a novel published in 1960, was one of his prescribed texts. The board that my school subscribed to had a literature paper that ended with Thomas Hardy.        
	At a time without cable television or the internet or foreign exchange to travel with, anglophone Indians in the Sixties and Seventies inhabited a self-sufficient, slightly anachronistic world frozen in the mid-20th century. Our cars were time-warped in the 1950s (the Fiat was based on the 1100-103, first produced in 1953 and the Ambassador on the 1956 Morris Oxford III), our ideas about English were shaped by the old Empire broadcasting style of BBCs World Service, even our constellation of desirable imported things remained constant: Black Label whisky, Quality Street chocolates, 555 cigarettes, and a curious passion for Kraft cheese. Popular Western culture was hard to come by: music was only available via HMV and Polydor which produced warped long-playing records in ratty sleeves and English (that is, American) films either came late, or not at all.              
	So when I hear my daughter complain about American Idol not being telecast live, or read Indian tech columnists moan about the intolerable hardship of not being able to access Apples online iTunes store from India, I know this is a new world, not the one I grew up in. Im not nostalgic about that world and I wouldnt wish it on my children, but there is something about the newly au fait Indian that doesnt sound right. The tech guru on the cable news channel world-wearily telling you not to buy Apples iPad till it gets a camera added on might well be right, but his knowingness is a virtual knowingness.        
	The cosmopolitan modernity that he affects cant be sustained. Its impossible for Indians to be securely modern regardless of how much they consume or know because the premise of modernity is the promise of generalized well-being. Its a promise that has been largely made good in the countries that English-speaking desis admire; not so in India. A knowing hedonism is legitimate in places where you dont have to step over maimed street people in your Nike Air trainers. Thus Thais in Bangkok have earned the right to be hip because their city isnt stalked by wretchedness. In cities like Delhi and Calcutta, where the poor are a kind of landscape, the aspiration to consume the world live is not just unpersuasive, it is grotesque.       mukulkesavanhotmail.com

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Fox hunt
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FOX HUNT                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	A lot of excitement has been generated over the seizure of sophisticated arms and equipment from leading Maoists in West Bengal. The police claim that this proves the links of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) with organizations in the Northeast, particularly with the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak) of Manipur. Any major arrest will cause excitement and that is understandable. But the claims of links with other terrorist bodies seem to suggest that the police were not aware of this, and became so only after the seizures were made. This is surprising, as it should have been well-known from the beginning that the Northeast, particularly Manipur, offers a huge market for arms and equipment and the Maoists would naturally turn to the region when they went shopping. Yet, the authorities, while insisting on coordinated action to tackle the Maoists, had not made any move to block the pipeline.         
	Manipur has always been known for smuggling in arms from adjoining Myanmar. In the 1980s, the police of Imphal would always talk of the Kachin Independent Army in Myanmar that was the major supplier, and with which the Prepak, under Bisheshwar Singh, had close links. The KIA operated freely, as the rule of the Myanmar authorities did not extend beyond Yangon, and perhaps does not do so even today. The Prepak also had little problem with Imphal. Factionalism has not weakened the Prepak to any great extent, and it still remains a source of arms for similar bodies in the Northeast and elsewhere.         
	It is difficult to believe that intelligence agencies were not aware of this before the Calcutta seizures. Within Myanmar, the KIA is perhaps not as active today as it was before, but it is clear that others have taken its place.                
	Not enough        
	The Maoists are not the only shoppers in Manipur or in the Northeast. The rebels of Tripura also used to get their supplies from the region, as does the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation of North Bengal. As far as the intelligence agencies are concerned, this cannot be news. But even with such knowledge at their disposal, obviously not much has been done in Manipur, where the army enjoys unlimited power, thanks to the continuation of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act there. Why this is so is anybodys guess.        
	What are the supply points of the money that is needed to buy such arms? Those trading in illegal arms are hard-core elements who cannot be expected to give away anything for free, particularly as they themselves have to buy the merchandise. Where do the Maoists get the money from? The authorities speak of extortion from traders and donations from like-minded citizens, but those are poor explanations. Neither traders nor fellow travellers can cough up the millions needed to buy devices that even the security forces do not have.        
	So there has to be a major source of finance either within the country or abroad to which the Maoists and others have easy access. While such sources are yet to be identified (if they had been marked, they would have been nabbed), the intelligence agencies, by their own admission, are at a loss to explain how the Maoists acquire the expertise to handle such arms.         
	Unless these questions are answered, the battle against the Maoists will take the State nowhere. The joint operations that are now going on in several states can only bring limited success in the form of a few encounter-killings or arrests, but that will not stop the disease from spreading. In this day and age, neither the identification of the source nor the restraining of such activities should be a problem. It calls for a longterm strategy. The current fox hunt may not be enough to deal squarely with the enemies of the people.

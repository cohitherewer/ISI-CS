The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Reaping the whirlwind
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        REAPING THE WHIRLWIND                                  The crisis in Karnataka has taken a very different turn from what its planners had intended, writes Chirosree Basu                                            
	When I arrived in Bangalore on the rain-washed night of October 27, the political drama that had begun weeks back was drawing to a close. There was, of course, the crucial decision of the Karnataka High Court on the disqualification of the dissident legislators that was still pending. But those in the know had already caught the drift  the wind was blowing the chief ministers way. If it was a constitutional loophole that had seen B.S. Yeddyurappa through the first confidence motion, it was Operation Kamala, the Bharatiya Janata Partys much-reviled and much-feared MLA trade strategy, that had broken the back of the political challenge.        
	No one knew this better than the dissidents, who still refused to come out of the hole they had dug themselves into. But others knew it as well. Among them were members of the Janata Dal (Secular), the party that had provided the petard with which the BJP dissidents hoisted themselves. The two JD(S) MLAs, G.S. Puttegowda and C.S. Puttaraju  both remarkably better behaved in front of a journalist than they were in front of the cameras on the day of the first confidence motion  suddenly seemed reconciled to the idea of allowing the court to decide the outcome of their political adventure.        
	They spoke at length on how they had done their duty as the Opposition, and how they had focussed on corruption and not on bringing down the government. They praised their leader, H.D. Kumaraswamy, elaborated on his role as the messiah of the poor, and voiced the belief of their people that H.D. Deve Gowda would rise like the phoenix very soon. Oh! Their impatience! the Congress MLA from Ramdurg, Ashok M. Pattan, commented soon after when I met him at the legislators home. He had interacted with the ferocious JD(S) boys that very morning at the public committee meet and had before, on several occasions, experienced this peculiar behavioural trait of the legislators of the second major opposition party of Karnataka.        
	Pattan himself, conscious of his political legacy (both his parents apparently were freedom-fighters and Congress MLAs), was no less representative of the behavioural trait of his own partymen. The Congress had had a pretty lengthy brush with power in the state, and its members could, therefore, address their state of powerlessness with an equanimity that the JD(S) legislators lacked.        
	The Congress, its Pattans believed, was the natural inheritor of the political legacy that could fall back into its lap without the unseemly hurry displayed by members of the newly-arrived parties. They could, as Pattan did, afford to look composed, think about animal rights and allow the high command to worry about working out a strategy to take on political rivals. In any case, the state legislators had unanimously given Sonia Gandhi the right to choose what is right for them.        
	When it came to composure, however, Pattan was no match for the BJP legislator from South Bangalore, M. Krishnappa. Having dealt with the regular stream of visitors since early morning, Krishnappa, who had given his party one of the largest margins of victory in the assembly polls, was ready for more after a short puja and breakfast. Without any hesitation, Krishnappa admitted that the crisis had been caused by the partys internal problems, that the party had indeed lost a bit of its moral face and that a large part of the problem could be resolved by working on relationships with the people. He also made it plain that the Reddy brothers were here to stay, as was Operation Kamala. Two days later, after the high court had upheld the disqualification of the dissident MLAs, the top BJP leaders said the same thing as Krishnappa did, although they would be less candid on the intra-party tussle.        
	Evidently, the political crisis in Karnataka has taken a very different turn from what its planners  within the BJP or outside, the anti-Reddy mining lobby or pro-Reddy  had intended. Far from unsettling the saffron government, the crisis has forced upon it a timely review. It would use this rare opportunity for a mid-term self-assessment to its maximum advantage. Krishnappas pithy conclusions on the crisis and his willingness to work on them were proof of that.        
	For one, the crisis has freed the BJP of the baggage of troublesome independents as also some habitual party-changers. Some more of that lot has come in, of course, but a clever re-apportioning of ministries, chairs of corporations and of pelf could take care of that. Two major rebellions later, Yeddyurappa is expected to handle that more intelligently than before. But the biggest advantage is his stronger control over the Bellary brothers. It is a bit odd to think that he would clip the wings of his chief benefactor. But by refusing to allow the return of the dissidents  pushed for by the Reddys  Yeddyurappa has been able to show them who the boss is. This time the partys central command may agree with him.        
	An equally important gain has been the intense focus on refurbishing the image of the party, brought on by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs expression of displeasure. That would mean more attention to the greed factor. A few mock trials of the guilty could take care of the negative publicity from corruption cases, while welfare schemes like Bhagyalakshmi and the publicity Blitzkrieg  through giant hoardings and ads on public vehicles and in the media  could assuage the public before the crucial taluk and zilla panchayat elections at the end of this year.        
	I asked a senior Congressman if his party was thinking about claiming the moral high ground after staying away from the game of upstaging the government. He gave a wan smile. The Congress has fallen so far behind in the political race in Karnataka that nothing it does will be enough. In any case, it was the partys fear of burning its fingers again that had made it cautious. There were no high-sounding morals behind the way it had acted. There couldnt have been. The Congress veteran helped me make a connection that I had missed. Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys Congress regime in Andhra Pradesh had been instrumental in making the Reddy brothers and their money power the menace they are now. YSR not only extended their mining lease, but fought with the Central forest department to allow them to mine in forest areas. Since then, the CBI had been brought in, YSRs son had been sidelined, the Supreme Court had passed its rulings on mining and income-tax raids had been instituted. But it was too little too late.              
	What was worse for the Congress in Karnataka was that it had evolved no strategy to combat the changed economics and sociology of politics. Its party-workers were being bought over with money power. The SC/ST-minority formula of Devraj Urs had stopped paying dividends. The Bahujan Samaj Party was eating into the Congresss Dalit votebank and the JD(S) into its secular votebank. The grey-haired men at the helm were no longer inspiring figures and there were no new plans to shake off the damaging anti-Lingayat image or tap into the poorer sections of the Lingayat and Vokkaliga communities. The only crowd-puller, Siddaramaiah, the former JD(S) leader who heads the Congress legislature party, did not have sufficient backing from the high command, given its fear of projecting a Dalit as chief minister.        
	All this could only add to the impatience of the JD(S) boys. Without the Congress, they cannot hope to turn even a revolution in the saffron ranks to their favour. Unfortunately, Congressmen did not have the sanction to dirty their kurtas in the galata, the street-term for a fracas in that part of the world.

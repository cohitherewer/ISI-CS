	Man hunt                  
	Sir  I did not see the sense in naming the offensive against the Maoists Operation Green Hunt (Fault lines, Feb 12). This operation can only mean the destruction of forests that are the main, if not the only, source of livelihood for the adivasis. Incidentally, the offensive will leave the harmad bahini, the militia of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), unscathed.          
	Since the Centre is taking the initiative to apprehend the Maoists, the Central Reserve Police Force should have exclusive control over the operations. It should be instructed to capture all illegal arms and ammunition found in the areas covered, and to arrest those in possession of them. Only then can peace prevail. Would the home minister, P. Chidambaram, consider such a proposition?          
	Yours faithfully,       
Gauranga Bhattacharya, Kshudiramnagar, Midnapore                    
	Sir  It is unfortunate that the legislature, bureaucracy and judiciary of Indian states ignore the basic rights of poor farmers and tribals. When the latter protest against the invasion of the lands and forests they inhabit, and of the water bodies that are vital to their existence, they are branded Maoists and persecuted. The police simply pass on the responsibility of protecting the tribals to the government. On the other hand, they screen the malpractices of industrialists, who offer them hefty bribes.          
	A mining scam amounting to crores of rupees was unearthed in Orissa last year (Mining scam protests grow louder, Aug 14, 2009). Yet all those involved have eluded punishment so far, although several important government officials were named in the FIR. Because of corruption, thousands of people continue to live in poverty. With the people starving and frustrated, Naxalism and other movements grow in these areas. The government should take stringent measures against corruption.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Satyam Panda, Rourkela           Sir  Piyush Sethia was arrested by the police in Salem, Tamil Nadu, on charges of sedition, on January 26. He was distributing pamphlets condemning the State-sponsored violence against the tribals in Chhattisgarh. It is ironic that he was arrested on the day we celebrate our constitutional rights.  
	I was a member of the team of activists and citizens, including Medha Patkar and Sandeep Pandey, who formed the National Peace Mission, which visited Dantewada early in January 2010. Sethia was also related to this group. The main message of this group was that only peace and non-violence are sustainable. Violence, whether perpetrated by State forces, the Salwa Judum, or by the Maoists and Naxalites, will always be condemned. Rather than suppressing the truth about the situation in Dantewada and other areas by arresting Sethia on false charges of sedition, the Central and state governments should encourage such things to come to light. Suppression of the truth can only breed more violence.          
	Yours faithfully,         S.G. Vombatkere, Mysore
                
	Sir Despite repeated assurances that the adivasis displaced by the government offensive against Maoists would be compensated and rehabilitated, the tribals still fall prey to police harassment. Innumerable complaints have been made against the police but not one case is registered. The tribals are ignored as they are poor and largely illiterate. People like Himanshu Kumar, who have been fighting against injustice and the exploitation of tribals in the forests of Chhattisgarh for years, are branded as Naxal sympathizers. What stops the government from holding dialogue with the adivasis? A democratically elected government should take steps to find out what the people want.          
	The judiciary seems to have turned against the adivasis. The government has failed miserably in rooting out corruption and exploitation. It is only interested in making profits out of the minerals and forest wealth of the tribal areas. It is high time that the safety and interests of the tribals get attention.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Sital Mishra, Rourkela

      
	Sir  Given the shortage of food and acute poverty that prevail in India, it is not surprising that extremists and opportunists take advantage of the situation to create unrest. Maoists, reportedly rooted in 231 districts across 13 states in the country, will continue to thrive unless development work is taken up to wipe out the serious imbalance in incomes.  
	The Central Planning Commission should have conceptualized more elaborate poverty eradication programmes along with development plans for industry and agriculture in the initial stages of planning. But this did not happen. All the 11 five-year plans have failed to raise the living standards of the poorest of the poor. It is, however, never too late to take up new initiatives.          
	Yours faithfully,         Anil Kumar Choudhury, Kalyani                     
	Sir The article, An educative journey (Feb 9), by Ashok.V. Desai, was informative, besides being an eye-opener. It demonstrated how economic development in the country has been lopsided. On the one hand we have malls, gleaming new cars and restaurants, and on the other hand, abject poverty in the villages, disease and hunger in the areas infested by the Maoists and Naxalites. It is to be hoped that the government would take bold measures to ensure that the fruits of economic growth reach everyone and not just patches of the population.          
	 Yours faithfully,             A.S. Mehta, Calcutta                    
	Erratum          
	In the article, Spell of a different kind (Feb 11), by Tapas Majumdar, Piero Sraffa has been mistakenly referred to as Pierre Srafa. The error is regretted.          
	 The Editor

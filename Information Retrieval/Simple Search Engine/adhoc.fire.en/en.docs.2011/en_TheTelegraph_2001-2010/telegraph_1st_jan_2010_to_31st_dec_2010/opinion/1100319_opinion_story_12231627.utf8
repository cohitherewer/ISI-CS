	Israel seems to have underestimated the wrath of Barack Obama, mistaking the goodwill of his administration for unbridled licence to do as it wills. Scaling down his original demand for a total freeze on Israeli constructions in occupied Palestinian territory, Mr Obama recently conceded Israel the right to build 3,000 housing units. But that was clearly not enough for Israel. Days ago, in the wake of Joe Bidens visit, Israel announced plans to build another 1,600 houses in the Ramat Shlomo area of East Jerusalem. The idea was nothing less than a resounding slap in the face of the United States of America. The belligerence with which it was criticized by both Mr Obama and his secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, shows the extent to which it has irked the present US administrations self-image of being a long-standing ally of Israel. Although the latters ultra-nationalist prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, did clarify that the announcement was made by some over-eager politician of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, he did not deliver much more than a token apology. Mr Netanyahu only asked to be forgiven for the bad timing  which implies that he does not have any problem with construction plans if they are not made public during high-profile state visits. So the apology is really not for the slap in the face, but for choosing the wrong day to deliver it.        
	Last year alone, Israel took away the residency rights of 4,577 Palestinians in Jerusalem. The figure happens to be the highest between 1967, the end of the Six-Day War, and 2007. So clearly, something has been going terribly wrong in the US approach to the crisis in the Middle East. By expressing their disapproval in no uncertain terms, both Mr Obama and Ms Clinton have seized upon an opportunity to put Israel in its place. But the US reaction to Israel does not indicate any substantial change of heart; it only reflects a mature and progressive attitude towards the impasse in the Middle East. It has so far been a rule with US presidents to align themselves clearly on Israels side before each of the so-called peace talks. The Camp David summit in 2000 was an excellent example of how Bill Clintons pro-Israel tilt made the discussions a foregone conclusion. Now that, once again, there are talks about holding talks, one hopes that if and when they happen, Mr Obama would stick to the principle of fairness he has subtly tried to embody.

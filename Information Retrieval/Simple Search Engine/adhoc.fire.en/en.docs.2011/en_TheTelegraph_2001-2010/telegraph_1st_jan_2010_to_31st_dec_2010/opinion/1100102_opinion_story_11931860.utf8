                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AS THE EYE MOVES ALONG                                  VISUAL ARTS: Uddalak Mukherjee                                                  
	Prashant Panjiars photographic project, Pan India: A Shared Habitat (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, December 19-29), has two objectives. First, it seeks to observe the visual language of India at the cusp of change. Second, it also strives to reflect on the lives of people who are both the agents and the receptors of change.        
	It is important to distinguish between the two objectives to be able to identify the subtle differences in Panjiars style. In some of the photographs, Panjiar is simply an aloof, but alert, observer. In others, his camera becomes both the chronicler and the critic. Panjiar is alert to the possibility of change becoming all-consuming and complex. The photographs capture spaces, people and cultures that are interlinked, despite their seeming differences. The solitary woman inside her hut, the radiant, but abandoned, beach stalls in Gokarn, Karnataka, and the contours of the Mumbai skyline bathed in the early, dim light have all been touched and altered by change.        
	But change is also an unequal process full of ironies. The two men who look as old and as forlorn as the100-year-old Karim Talkies are its victims. But the smiling members of the affluent Khojeste family represent the other end in this dichotomy. Perhaps it is this inner disparity that foments resistance. The proud and stoic village elder and his family in Poonch or the two smiling daughters inside their ornate nagadakhana (drum-house) in Pune harbour the hope that despite the churning, some things will remain the same.        
	A changing India is also a potential site of conflict. Panjiar captures this beautifully in a image that shows a bike-rider and a cow headed towards each other in a narrow Ayodhya by-lane. The sleekness and speed of modernity are pitted against an older, sedate irresoluteness. The possibility of a collision is real and frightening. Not just the public but even the private is being transformed. The photograph of the five friends sharing a flat in Gurgaon raises an interesting possibility  that of the institution of family, the bedrock of Indias social fabric, being reimagined.        
	There is a certain degree of contemplativeness in Panjiars work. His technique is relaxed without being innovative. It is evident that some thought has gone into the mounting of the images. The photographs of the skeletal tree on a highway next to the similarly vertical DLF Tower suggest an imaginative juxtaposition. But this show, like many others before it, makes us wonder whether it is time for gifted photographers to conceive a new visual language in order to document change. Frankly, havent we seen enough of crumbling structures, swanky shopping malls and people alternately smiling and staring blankly to remind us that things may not be how they were?

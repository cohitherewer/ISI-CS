	Power is known to be a heady brew that can turn heads in odd ways. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has discovered that the long spell of power has turned many of his comrades into hotheads. That, in turn, has led to the alienation of his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), from the people. Better late than never, one could have reacted to the chief ministers realization. But it is impossible to not wonder why he took so long to discover something that was there to see for anyone who cared to see it. CPI(M) leaders, big or small, have long assumed that the party is the lord of all it surveys in the state. They took their electoral successes to mean a license to impose their will on the people. Power to the people was abused and subverted to mean power to the party and its leaders. The result was the building up of a party society in West Bengal that replaced laws, institutions and even social norms. Mr Bhattacharjee has been the chief minister for over a decade now. The question as to why he never spoke or acted against the arrogant leaders of his party before is unavoidable.        
	Clearly, his call to the hotheads to leave the CPI(M) is a fallout of the partys defeat in the elections in the state over the past two years. This context suggests that he would have had nothing against the arrogant leaders if only they could win elections for the party. This precisely has been at the root of much of the CPI(M)s current dilemma. For all its ideological claptrap, the party has always reduced all issues to questions of electoral strategy. Things were fine for the party and the leaders as long as it continued to win the polls. Now that it has faced successive defeats and could be staring at the ultimate one in next years assembly polls, Mr Bhattacharjees caution cannot but sound like a distress call. Ironically, the CPI(M) central committee has been formulating a rectification programme for its members over the past two years. Obviously, the drive has not done much to change the ways of the comrades. In fact, there is far too much evidence to suggest that the little lords of the party are too mired in mud to be able to come out clean. It is even doubtful if the chief minister himself has the power to clean up the party. What he needs to understand is that his arrogant comrades are a problem, not just for his party, but also for civilized life in West Bengal. It is never too late, though, to learn the virtues of humility.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FLIGHTS OF IMAGINATION                              Ananda Lal      Theatre                                                
	The success of Nandikars Children Ensemble has resulted in a praiseworthy formalization of Nandikars activities in childrens theatre, which they have conducted extensively for many years. The earlier production-by-production collaborations, usually involving only a few schools positively inclined toward theatre, can now expand into long-term curricular associations with more institutions (given the recent inclusion of drama as a subject in board syllabi), as well as embrace interested kids in after-hours training at Nandikar, hopefully even leading up to a childrens repertory. The sheer numbers that crowded the stage in the latest offerings suggest these future paths.        
	Juniors with no prior experience received their initiation into the world of performance through such easier forms requiring no physical movement as elocution and singing in Jai Ektibar, a collage of pieces by Tagore, compiled and directed by Jhulan Sarkar. The picture may have been relatively static, yet looked extremely colourful by way of costumes. At an intermediary level of theatrical awareness, more accomplished children participated in Hariye Jete Nei Mana, scripted by Debleena Tripathi and directed by Rimi Majumdar, with a simple storyline in which a little girl caught up in city life longs to escape into the countryside.         
	Both playlets manifested a childs flights of imagination into unknown realms that in these cases happened to be rivers and forests or seas and mountains, making me think that, indeed, the one thing that educated urban Indian kids lack is adequate connection to the cycles of nature  most cannot tell apart one bird or flower from another, let alone animals and trees. Maybe Nandikar can make nature a theme, to nurture the young minds natural curiosity about all forms of life.         
	The most seasoned performers got the scope to strut their stuff in Indian Idol (picture), a more structured play written and directed by Debsankar Halder, who parodies the popularity of television competitions and reality shows. The heroines parents join every possible such programme, all of them depicted ludicrously, and encourage her to do likewise, but she resists and receives advice from her dead grandfather, who steps down from his photo perch to guide her on ideal idols. They find that even corpses at a crematorium and mourning rituals have become matter for reality contests; Halder should edit this section because it continues too long and, after a while, the clowning deviates from his point. However, the children give their all most energetically.

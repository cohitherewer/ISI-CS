	Off the track                  
	Sir  It is some solace that Mumbais railway strike did not last much longer than a day (Rail strike, May 4). The railway workers on strike probably realized that although they had grievances only against the Railway Board, the ones who suffered as a result of the strike were the thousands of commuters who depend on railway service.          
	The chief minister of Maharashtra, Ashok Chavan, and the state home minister, R.R. Patil, had to give assurance that disciplinary proceedings against the motormen would be dropped, and that the workers demands would be sympathetically considered. At one point, the ministers even debated on invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act.          
	It is very strange that despite railways being a Union subject, the state ministers felt compelled to intervene. Perhaps it is to their advantage to take credit for ending the strike. The strike is over now, but that cannot undo the hardship that millions of citizens had to go through. There is something amiss with the whole system.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Ganesh Sovani, Thane, Maharashtra 

                
	Sir  As Mumbai was plunged into chaos because of the railway motormens strike that lasted for 30-odd hours, the Union railway minister, Mamata Banerjee, remained in Calcutta (Mumbai mauled, Mamata too, May 5). She reportedly tried to solve the situation over the phone. If directions on the phone are sufficient in such crises, then perhaps all ministers should work from home.          
	The recent strike caused one of the most acute transport problems seen in the last few years. The Railway Board had earlier constituted a fast-track committee to look into the demands of the motormen. This committee, however, has achieved little till date. Having lived in the financial capital for 20 years, I have observed that when the citys growth and development are at stake, all political parties are united. This time, too, parties representing all shades of political opinion, including even groups like the Shiv Sena, rallied behind the suffering commuters. The citys administration as well as the Bombay High Court played a part in restoring order and in having the strike called off. The absence of the Union railway minister from the scene proved to be immaterial.          
	Perhaps some lessons can be learnt from this incident. If West Bengal is to have economic growth, then political parties in the state must unite and keep emotions in check. They should not resort to gimmicks such as bandhs to prove a point. The state cannot progress otherwise.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Veiled threat          
	Sir  Close on the heels of Belgium banning the burqa in public places, and the French government debating on doing the same, a woman in northern Italy has been fined for wearing this garment (Italy fine for woman in burqa, May 5). It is high time that the champions of secularism and protectors of minority rights  our United Progressive Alliance government, for instance  launch an official protest against these nations. If need be, the governments could even consider raising the issue with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights or file a case against such countries in the International Court of Justice at the Hague.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Arun Malankar, Mumbai

                
	Sir  Belgium has acquired the distinction of becoming the first country to impose an official ban on wearing the burqa in public. Belgian citizens all over the world, especially those serving in the countrys embassies, must brace themselves for a backlash against this injunction. Those residing in Islamic countries must be particularly vigilant.          
	Yours faithfully,

	National treasure          
	Sir  Sukanta Chaudhuris article IPL and the rest of India (May 5) tells us how the gentlemans game of cricket has now brought together politics, business and entertainment in an unsavoury profit-sharing arrangement for the benefit of a handful of hyper-rich people. However, his contention that the Indian Premier League has created no national assets and that it benefits nobody beyond the snack-vendors in the stadium is unacceptable. There is no doubt that the IPL has been a global success. Lalit Modis money-spinner has given new talents the opportunity to play with the best and ensured greater stability of income for cricketers.          
	The IPL phenomenon reminds one of the 1980s, when people in all parts of the country stopped doing anything for a few minutes to watch Ramayan on television. The TRPs for the IPL have been tremendous, showing a considerable increase since last year. Millions of people watched the matches on television. This viewership figure also includes an increasing number of women and children. As a spectator sport, after a somewhat lacklustre second season, IPL 3 was a big hit.           
	The IPL has changed the parameters of cricket, making it even more entertaining. The lofty sixes and the swift innovation have added pace and excitement to the game. The tournament has created new stars. It has definitely improved the skills of Indian cricketers. Indian and foreign cricketers have played together as a team. Not only has this made them more comfortable with one another, but Indian cricketers have also learnt much from their foreign counterparts. According to some experts, the IPLs success is not dependent on quick profits but on the very idea of growth. The tournament has won over hearts and minds as well as pockets.          
	Yours faithfully,

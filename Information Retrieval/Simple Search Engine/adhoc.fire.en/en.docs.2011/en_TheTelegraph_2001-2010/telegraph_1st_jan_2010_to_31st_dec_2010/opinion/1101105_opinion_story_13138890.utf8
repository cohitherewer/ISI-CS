	THE FINKLER QUESTION, By Howard Jacobson, Bloomsbury, Rs 499        
	Julian Treslove, the protagonist of this years Booker-winning novel, is straight out of a Woody Allen film. To him, life feels like a disaster movie. Dissolving forever into the lacrimae rerum, Julian is literally afflicted with excessive  trs  love, although mostly for himself. Stricken with a Mimi Complex and an Ophelia Complex, this self-proclaimed patron saint of watery women gets turned on by women who pass out of his life in a perfected dream of tragic love  consumptive, wet-eyelashed, and as often as not singing [their] goodbyes to him in phrases borrowed from popular Italian opera. A fortune-teller in Barcelona had once prophesied that Hulian would meet a Huno someday. Into his fifties, Julian finally finds Juno, which turns out to be the nickname of his voluptuous Jewess lover, Hephzibah Weizenbaum.        
	An inadequately put-together man with a modular degree, Julian earns his living as a celebrity lookalike, because he looks like no one in particular and so can pretend to be anyone. Abandoned by a long line of lovers (including an arsonist), whom he had bored into hating him and despised by two sons he had never cared for, Julian is also a Finklerphile. This is not to say he is in love with his friend, Sam Finkler, a writer of self-help books that effortlessly bring together Descartes and dating, or Hegel and holiday plans, to cater to popular taste. Finkler is Julians private code for the archetypal Jew  mean, smart, mercenary, enterprising, successful, conjured out of every clich imaginable in the Gentiles textbook. But there can be no loathing without love, and Julian is secretly envious of the very qualities that he deplores in Sam. Recognizing his own Finklerish aspirations, Julian recoils in horror, but cant help feeling excited as well. Perversely, the loser that he is, Julian believes that becoming Finkler-like, maybe even a proper Finkler, will be his passport into the privileged world of Finklers: forever brandishing their historical martyrdom, strutting about with a sense of entitlement, and rushing into places where non-Finklers fear to tread.        
	Although exasperated by Julians delusion, his Finkler pals, Sam and Libor, both recently widowed, indulge his fantasy as a diversion from their own wife-sorrows. For the greater part of this excellent novel, we are kept entertained by the sparkling repartee bandied among the three men, as they dissect one anothers foibles. In this novel of ideas, laced with a wicked sense of humour that gets better as the plot thickens, personas multiply, positions interchange, saints become sinners.        
	The Jewish Question, from the Mosaic times to modern Israel, is all-pervasive. But we also glimpse the unfolding of an all-too-human drama around troubling claims on identity. Julian, the ambiguous anti-Semite, is profoundly unsettled when he is mugged near Regent Park by a woman, who, as he would have everyone (including himself) believe, mistook him for a Jew. The incident acts like a trigger for Julians fears and fantasies to tumble out of his unconscious. His sterile existence is suddenly salvaged by this moment of violence: it is as though without this final push, Julian, wallowing in his Anglo-Christian affectations, would have wept a pool of tears  and drowned himself in it.        
	However, as Jacobson shows, it is never easy, if not practically impossible, for Jew and non-Jew to cross over into each others place. Intellectually, they may begin to speak with one voice, but it would be sheer folly to imagine that the two can socially swap places. So a liberal Jew like Libor, who once dallied with Hollywood beauties, was left cold by Garbos German eyes. Julian and Juno go into raptures singing bel canto; but Wagner is strictly not allowed. As an Oxford-trained philosopher, Sam is aware of the self-defeating nature of the collective, ASHamed Jews, that he leads: If I dont particularly want to be with Jews, wheres the sense, he asked himself, in being with these Jews, solely because they dont particularly want to be with Jews either? But that does not stop him from believing that Only Jews could be Jewishly ashamed. Clearly, the line must be drawn somewhere.         
	But Jacobson begs to differ. All the arguments offered by his characters to justify, deny or upbraid Jewishness find their nemesis in the course of the novel. Every argument comes spiked with a self-cancelling clause. As the battle of ideas rages on, realities are never forgotten. Anti-Semitic incidents in London are juxtaposed against the Israeli oppression of Arabs. Jacobson deconstructs every monopoly on suffering. Even innocuous stereotypes  of the lusty Jewess or the wizened European Jew  are subverted as Julian among the Jews is made to feel like the Real McGoy or the cuckoo goy. If Tamara Krausz, one of the ASHamed Jews, conquers hysterical Zionists with the harlot allure of her vindictive intelligence, her fellow ASHamee, Aliv Poliakov, appears no less hysterical with his foreskin restoration mission.        
	In The Finkler Question, Jewish identity is re-imagined as an ever-changing constant  it is at once immanent and transcendent, something that can be dismissed, but never disavowed. So an essential spirit of Jewishness binds an ASHamed Jew like Sam to a Holocaust survivor like Libor, making them a part of a group whose solidarity remains inviolable. It is an affiliation based on what Freud had called Geistigkeit  an untranslatable word straddling both intellect and spirituality. After the death of the psychoanalyst, David Eder, Freud had admitted having such an ineffable bond with his friend: We were both Jews and knew of each other that we carried this miraculous thing in common, which  inaccessible to any analysis so far  makes the Jew. In Jacobsons survey of the scars left by history on the imagination, we sense a similar attempt to give substance, though fictional, to that mysterious essence.

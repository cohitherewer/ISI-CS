	Wrong decision                  
	Sir  Rohit Sharma was recently penalized for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during a match in the T20 world cup. Sharma had gestured to the umpire, Billy Bowden, who had given him out, to tell him that the ball had hit his arm. This was confirmed by the action replay. But Bowden did not feel the need to consult the third umpire. Given the kind of technology that is available, there is no need for field umpires. It is only out of respect for cricketing tradition that umpires are given discretionary powers, and they have no right to misuse them.          
	Yours faithfully,        Tuhin Bhattacharjee, Calcutta
        
	Another crown          
	Sir Viswanathan Anand must be congratulated for winning the World Chess Championship title for the fourth time in 11 years. The Indian grand master defeated his Bulgarian challenger, Veselin Topalov, in the 56th move of the 12th and decisive game of the tournament (Every inch a king, May 13). Anand maintained his cool throughout, and planned his moves on the board brilliantly. This triumph will definitely encourage chess enthusiasts all over the country to take this game up more seriously.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Compared to the contest between Viswanathan Anand and Vladimir Kramnik in Bonn in 2008, the conditions at the recent championship in Sofia were particularly hostile for the Indian grand master. While Kramnik was a refined player with impeccable behaviour, Anands opponent this time, Veselin Topalov, and his manager, Silvio Danailov, are known to be ruthless, as the Toilet-gate episode of 2006 had shown.  
	The recently-concluded battle between Topalov and Anand was indeed a war of nerves, where tactics and tenacity were of utmost importance. However, if Anand deserves praise for his prowess and preparation, one cannot take away anything from Topalovs potential. The see-saw tussle between the two lasted for more than six-and-a-half hours. On the final day, Anand had the odds stacked against him as he was playing with black, but he stole Topalovs thunder.          
	But even as history was unfolding in the Balkans, the cricket-starved Indian media chose not to give it adequate importance. On the contrary, they seemed to have all the time for the IPL saga. It is inexplicable why a nation of billion-plus people sticks to one sport while allowing other games to die silently. The money-machine that runs cricket has helped it hog the limelight, in spite of Indias ignominious exit from the T20 championship. Countries like Bulgaria and Turkey had bid to stage the World Chess Championship, but India showed little interest, as if there was a shortage of funds and sponsors.          
	Finally, as someone who has followed Anands triumphs and travails for two decades, I can say that he has never failed to surpass the nations expectation. His exemplary personality traits are what make him a great sportsman. Anands mother, Susheela, has reportedly said, I want him to continue to be a nice man. She believes in him, and so do we.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Viswanathan Anand has proved his might in the world of chess and done India proud. It is unfortunate that the media hype around Anands victory is less than what is reserved for cricket. The prime minister as well as the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, the state from which Anand hails, should honour the chess master appropriately.          
	Yours faithfully,         R. Sekar, Visakhapatnam

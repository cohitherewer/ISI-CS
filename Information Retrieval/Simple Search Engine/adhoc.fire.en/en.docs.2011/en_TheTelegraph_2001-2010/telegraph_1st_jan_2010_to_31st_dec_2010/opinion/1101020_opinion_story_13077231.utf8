                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        STEP ON IT                                  Tobacco use is on the rise among the young in eastern India. But West Bengal is doing little to implement a law that bans smoking in public places, reports Shabina Akhtar                                                
	Lifes a drag in West Bengal. Elsewhere, the harmful use of tobacco is being tackled in right earnest. In the eastern state, people  including smokers and cigarette sellers  are seemingly oblivious of a law that bans smoking in public places.        
	Walk into any college canteen and youll find yourself enveloped in a haze of smoke. No one would have heard of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (Cotpa), 2003, which bans smoking in places such as educational institutions, hospitals, auditoriums, restaurants and public transport. And those who have heard of it couldnt care two hoots about the law.        
	Smoking within our college premises is yet to be banned by college officials. And it would be best if they stayed away from implementing Cotpa here, says Rupsha Chakravarty, between blowing smoke rings in her college canteen. Chakravarty, 19, started smoking at 14 and graduated to having five packs a day within two years. The college student is a typical example of the growing band of smokers in the state.        
	Dr Sarbani Mittal, a former health consultant with the World Health Organization, says that 70 per cent of men and almost 23 per cent of women in West Bengal are smokers. What is worse is the growing trend of smoking amongst teenagers, says Dr Mittal.        
	A global youth tobacco survey has found that the percentage of teenage smokers in eastern India increased from 7.7 per cent in 2003 to 12.7 per cent in 2006. Cotpa had been framed specifically to discourage the young from taking up smoking  Section 6 (a) and (b) of the law forbids the sale of tobacco products to minors and near educational institutes.        
	But take a walk down College Street in Calcutta and you will find a dozen tobacco kiosks on the stretch between Presidency College and the Calcutta University campus. Dont the police fine them? After all, the law specifically states that if someone sells tobacco products within 100 yards of an educational institution  defined as school, college or a recognised institute of higher learning  he or she can be fined up to Rs 200.        
	Only once were we asked, rather casually, by a police officer to stop selling tobacco products, says Karunakaran Parida, who sells cigarettes, chewable tobacco and bidis to students, professors and passersby from a kiosk some 10 yards from the Calcutta University campus.        
	Clearly, in a state where the chief minister himself smokes, little is being done to prosecute offenders. No money has been collected as fine for violating Cotpa, nor have we received any feedback from the 12 partners of ours who are working with us for tobacco control in West Bengal, says Dr Gangadhar Mahapatra, assistant director, health services, government of West Bengal, and the nodal officer of the West Bengal Tobacco Control Cell.              
	Compare this with Tamil Nadu where, according to the latest National Family Health Survey, 40 per cent of the population is addicted to tobacco. Since October 2008, when the ban on smoking in public places was enforced, the government has collected around Rs 22 lakh as fines from over 19,000 violators. In Tamil Nadu, 2,200 educational institutions have been declared no smoking zones. That was possible because offenders were routinely fined Rs 200.        
	In West Bengal, on the other hand, the law is being blatantly flouted. So why are the police not cracking down on smoking in public? Jawed Shamim, deputy commissioner, detective department, evaded the question, saying, I take care of the law and order situation in the city. For Cotpa implementation you need to talk to the relevant officers in charge.        
	Arun Chatterjee, officer in charge of making Lalbazar police headquarters a smoke-free zone, declined to comment.        
	Says Soumita Chakraborty, media communication officer of the Cancer Foundation India, When we began our Smoke Free Howrah initiative earlier this year, not only did we face problems from the common people but also from the officials. In fact, medical colleges and educational institutes were reluctant to participate in our initiative.        
	So is it just the lack of political will that makes Cotpa ineffective in West Bengal? Smoking in a public place is a bailable offence and that robs Cotpa of its teeth. But then you cant make a law banning smoking more draconian than that, says Jay Sengupta, a Calcutta High Court lawyer.               
	If the government came up with policies to bar manufacturers from producing tobacco products, it could fight tobacco addiction more effectively, feels Protik Prokash Banerji, another advocate of the Calcutta High Court. Instead of raising the price of cigarettes or imposing fines on offenders, it would be best to impose a prohibitive tax on the manufacturers. This would force them to come up with alternative products such as nicotine chewing gum and thus help in controlling the tobacco menace, he says.        
	Banerji feels that Cotpa is not strong enough to make people abstain from smoking in public places. You cant change the mindset of people by legislation. Smoking is a habit and an addiction that can be eradicated by social awareness and not by penalisation, he says.        
	Social activist Saikat Nasker feels that stringent implementation of the law along with more social awareness programmes would help Cotpa achieve its goal. We need to make people aware of its ill effects to make the smoke-free movement a success, he says.        
	To spread awareness, the law specifies that large boards be put up outside places where smoking is an offence. All shops selling tobacco products are also supposed to have notices displayed prominently stating that the sale of tobacco products to minors is a punishable offence. But the political will to implement Cotpa seems to be missing. That is why young teenagers are lighting up with impunity  and the law is going up in smoke.

	The teacher who wore a wig                
	Mr Olivers Diary (Puffin, Rs 150) by Ruskin Bond documents the year-long travails of a schoolmaster, Mr Oliver, or Olly for short, in a school in the hills. Mr Oliver is bald as a coot, wears a wig, has a Roman (Armenian?) nose, and keeps a pet parrot whose favourite words are Bottoms up! Mischievous brats led by Mirchandani, alias Mirchi, a melancholy Headmaster who is a thwarted violin player, and the pretty lady teacher, Miss Anjali, populate his universe. The boys play all sorts of pranks  coating one of Ollys wigs with green paint  and even play the matchmaker, successfully, for their favourite teacher. Bonds new book is a gem, full of that old-world charm with which the author is associated. It would be unwise to give this book a miss.                        
	Hindu: A Novel (Samya, Rs 250) by Sharankumar Limbale has been translated from the Marathi by Arun Prabha Mukherjee. Limbale is a well-known Dalit activist, writer and critic, who has been writing on the evils of the caste system for quite some years now. Speaking about his mission, he says, The fabric of Hindu society, interwoven with inequality, and the disfigurement of the caste system Hindu has been written to perform a post mortem of these two. To speak against the caste system is to speak the language of national unity, of aesthetic beauty. But to think that Hindu is just a tirade against the caste system or a glorification of the Dalits would be to undermine its craft. Limbale manipulates his narrative voices in such a way that it becomes difficult to deliver a straightforward judgment on the characters. For instance, one of the narrators, Milind Kamble, is a Dalit who connives, willingly and unwillingly, with the corrupt upper-caste twins, Gopichand and Manikchand, to make politics a lucrative business. Even the omniscient third-person narrator never attempts to shape the readers views, leaving them to come to their own conclusions on the basis of what they see happening in the novel. Reading Hindu would be a lesson in self-knowledge, since it makes us aware of our own prejudices in relation to caste or gender issues.                        
	Lie: A Traditional Tale of Modern India (Tranquebar, Rs 395) by Gautam Bhatia is a graphic novel with illustrations by Shankar Lal Bhopa, Birju Lal Bhopa and Ghansham, who are miniature artists from Rajasthan. This attempt to satirise the current state of affairs within the country by using traditional form of expression is unique. It has a nightmare landscape filled with unscrupulous politicians, prostitute-turned-ministers, criminal-turned-teachers and sinister mothers-in-law. Everything is exaggerated to such an extent that it becomes grotesque  a woman, Reena, gives birth every month, that too on banquet tables or in bank lockers; all her babies, being female, are dumped in dustbins or pushed into the bank safe by her mother-in-law; her husband promises a lakh every year to each of his electorates if they vote him to power; her father-in-law chokes to death on a piece of chicken.         
	The satire is acrid, no doubt, but loses its edge by being over-stretched. There is also not enough humour to offset the grimness. As a result, the novel begins to drag after a while.                                  
	The King of the Verdant Island (Ponytale, Rs 125) by Sunil Gangopadhyay is, as the name makes clear, a translation of the famous Kakababu-Santu mystery, Sabuj Dwiper Raja, which had also been made into a film. Tridiv Chowdhury has translated the text from Bengali, and the illustrations are by Subir Roy. The flavour of the original has more or less been kept intact. Occasional infelicities like class ninth for Class IX can probably be ignored for the sake of the breathtaking adventure.

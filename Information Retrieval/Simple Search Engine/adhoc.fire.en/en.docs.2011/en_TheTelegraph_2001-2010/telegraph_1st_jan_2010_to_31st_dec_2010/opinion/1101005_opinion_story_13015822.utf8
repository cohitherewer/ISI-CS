The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | How To Spoil A Show
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOW TO SPOIL A SHOW                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The 19th Commonwealth Games have been inaugurated, and, hopefully, the horror of putting them together is behind us. At the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, on the evening of October 3, a full house witnessed the opening ceremony while the rest of India watched an ostensibly live relay on television. But live it was not, and the staggered transmission killed the real event for the viewers. I could hear the loud crackers and fireworks that ended the extravaganza while the small screen was showing some ridiculous dance number. In 2010, with India announcing itself an emerging economic and political power, this is unacceptable and rather silly.         
	The evening began with the magnificent drummers from across the many regions and cultural spectrums of India. The perfect start was spoilt by a slow and dull rendering of Swagatham. After that, we  the television viewers who had stayed home deliberately  did not get to know the sequence of events because we were shown endless, badly-designed adverts interspersed with a carelessly crafted patchwork of Indian culture. The presentation was clichd and lacked the vitality of our young and agile nation.         
	To think that the choreographer must have been handsomely paid to put together this unsophisticated natak makes one want to scream with rage. From the organizers and managers to the contractors and the culture czars, quality was in short supply among all. The money spent for what was delivered was also humungous. Babudom seems to have overwhelmed culture.        
	New script        
	We are such a vibrant nation. We create some of the most inventive music, dance and fusion. We have thriving and vibrant folk traditions that are the bedrock of our cultural ethos. Our classical legacies are unmatched. Yet, we pick and present the same old boring lot who spend their time lobbying for a place in the sun, grabbing all the plum spots that showcase India. The babu dispenses largesse and, therefore, if you cannot win over the babu, you will drown. The opening ceremony defined the status quo we are wallowing in and from which we need to extricate ourselves if we are to fly and take the lead. We must unshackle ourselves from what has been the norm for decades of State sponsorship. Till then, the dancers will trip on wires and fall down.        
	Here I have to say that what Sheila Dikshit has managed to do, after being pulled in at the last moment by the government to eradicate the problems that had afflicted preparations in the Games Village, was a feat extraordinaire. The applause for Dikshit every time her name was mentioned in one of the speeches made one proud. The chief minister needs proper statehood for Delhi. The fact that she is not the single nodal point of reference, but is the face of the State is most unfair and ridiculous. This leads to the creation and perpetuation of corruption, politicking and a complete lack of accountability, with each department pointing accusing fingers at another. The Delhi Development Authority, Municipal Corporation of Delhi, New Delhi Municipal Council, law enforcement agencies and so on must come under one head. Otherwise, Delhi will die.        
	As citizens of this ancient and layered city, all we can do is hope that the powers-that-be rewrite the mandate for the governance and protection of Dilli, the soul of India. It has grown and become the symbolic representation of India, and needs, therefore, to set fresh standards for life and inclusive living. And, if the NDMC area, where the rulers reside, needs to be under the jurisdiction of the Central government  for reasons best known to it  then it should be separated from the larger state. But let us not destroy what is a fine and composite city.

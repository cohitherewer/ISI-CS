	The financial tsunami that had originated in the United States of America in December 2007 gathered momentum and engulfed the country by mid-September 2008. It began to hit the shores of other countries as well. Immediately, stock markets crashed and credit stopped all over the world. The situation has improved, but only a little. Both the US and China still have high unemployment levels. Other countries have shown low or negative growth, with India being an exception. But most nations are still afflicted by job losses.        
	It may be worthwhile to investigate the root of the crisis. The US had enjoyed a boom for a decade. This ended in 2000 when the technology bubble burst, sending stocks of information technology companies crashing. A period of recession began, and the situation worsened after the 9/11 attack. To come out of the recession, the rate of interest was drastically reduced and liquidity vastly increased. This ushered in a period of credit-financed high growth when the demand for new houses and their prices grew.        
	The American banks were flushed with liquidity and they doled out numerous loans. In the process, they often crossed the permissible limits, and the phenomenon of sub-prime lending was born. This implied giving loans to people who were non-creditworthy. In 2005 and 2006, such loans exceeded $1.2 trillion. The total quantum of loans given out till January 2008 was a staggering $5.26 trillion, while the US gross domestic product in the corresponding period was over $14 trillion.        
	Thanks to too much money chasing new houses, housing prices soared. The sub-prime loans were given out on the assumption that the borrowers would repay the loans out of the higher prices of their houses. People mortgaged their properties and headed for the shopping malls to buy consumer durables. Household consumption, the main engine of growth in the US, shot up, but it was entirely credit-driven.        
	The banks bundled mortgages of varying proportions, turned them into securities and sold these to financial institutions.        
	With the intervention of mortgage-backed securities, housing loans ceased to be a bilateral affair between the mortgage lender and the home buyer. Mortgage lenders began securing their mortgages in bulk and sold them as MBS bonds to financial institutions and private investors. Consequently, the lenders did not know the ultimate users of the funds and had to trust a a number of intermediaries linked sequentially  lenders, mortgage brokers, valuers, rating agencies, legal and accounting firms  to invest in MBS bonds. Rating agencies were supposed to rate the MBS for investors. In practice, the agencies rated the MBS at the instance of the issuers with acceptable ratings. By mid-2006, housing prices began to fall. The result was catastrophic because loans had been given out assuming that prices would escalate.        
	Then began the process of defaults and delinquencies in loan repayments. This was followed by extensive foreclosures and banks being saddled with properties they could not sell or, sell only at very low prices.        
	The entire financial structure in the US crumbled, and Lehman Brothers, one of the top five Wall Street banks, actually collapsed on September 15, 2008.

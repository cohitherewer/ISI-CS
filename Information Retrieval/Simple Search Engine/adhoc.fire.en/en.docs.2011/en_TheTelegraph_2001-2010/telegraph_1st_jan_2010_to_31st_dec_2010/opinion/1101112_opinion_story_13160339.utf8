	President Barack Obama and the First Lady have made quite an impact on the straightforward, ordinary, unpretentious Indian by the manner in which they engaged with the people. The less privileged amongst us, the working class of middle India, noticed how subtle and civilized the security arrangements around the president were. There were no uniformed men besieging and distracting him. There were no gun-toting characters surrounding him who were visible, bang on the face, of ordinary Indians. It was true security when compared to the screeching, unpleasant sirens and red lights atop cars, which speed about breaking rules, telling citizens that our leaders are up and about, setting wrong standards. The unfriendly arrogance that accompanies our president, prime minister and all grades of other ministers need to be shed. Our security arrangements look like a charade, a ridiculous VVIP baraat of sorts, rather than serious, invisible management of safety. If there is to be a shared learning process between India and the United States of America, we can start with security arrangements that work.        
	It was wonderful to see President Obama visit Humayuns tomb. Thankfully, this particular monument is still a treat, only because it has been meticulously restored under the supervision of the Aga Khan Foundation and Trust. Unfortunately, the scant respect that successive governments have had towards our heritage, combined with shoddy, archaic management techniques and stifling bureaucratic regulations, has succeeded in degrading the edifices that embody our great culture. The Obamas could not visit the National Museum because it is an embarrassment. It is shameful that the national repository of an extraordinary and many-layered civilization has been reduced to a virtual dump. Here again, we have a great deal to learn from the cultural institutions of the US about the inclusive management of museums, archives and libraries where professionals from civil society work with the government to protect and secure their traditions.                
	Positive points        
	President Obamas ability to be a normal human being and engage with the people is another important element that our snobbish and condescending political leaders need to learn. Despite having very little to show for itself, our political class is pompous and disconnected, unable to have a public dialogue on diverse issues. How many Indian politicians are able to field questions from varied disciplines?        
	Now that the visit is over, India would like to know what the leadership here intends to do with the US in Afghanistan. What is happening to the Kashmir dialogue? What is our position vis--vis China, a world power that has enveloped us in all manner of ways, some of which are politically ominous? What are the views of the government of India on these matters? Equally critical are the many socio-economic realities that plague this country which do not seem to get the urgent attention of those who lead us. These range from internal strife, militancy, overwhelming corruption to mismanagement of civic bodies, educational and cultural institutions, as well as of the service sector operated by the government. Our administration needs an overhaul if corruption is to be weeded out of India. All the positive points that the Obama visit represented would mean nothing if corruption and mismanagement continue unchecked.        
	Will we go on breaking environmental rules in the name of development? Will we have time and energy only for the privileged? Or, will we change course with determination, now, and become a modern society rooted firmly to an ancient civilization?

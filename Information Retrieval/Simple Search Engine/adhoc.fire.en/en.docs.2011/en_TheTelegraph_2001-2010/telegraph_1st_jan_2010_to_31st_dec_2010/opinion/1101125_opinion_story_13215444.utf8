                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        GAMES PEOPLE PLAY                                  Neha Sahay                              
	Pretty Chinese girls are everywhere in Guangzhou, smiling, pouting and generally driving people crazy  literally. A Yemen player blamed the cheerleaders for his teams loss to Indonesia in the beach volleyball event, saying they had affected the way his team had played. Dressed in bikinis, these cheerleaders were selected from among university students through special competitions. Their repertoire includes fan dancing and martial arts.        
	While the cheerleaders can flash broad smiles showing all their teeth, the volunteers for the Asian Games have been trained to show just four teeth while smiling. Apparently, this is in deference to the Chinese tradition of females having to cover their mouths while laughing, a practice still seen among some highly educated women. How do they show just four teeth? After hours of practice, keeping a spoon in their mouth. A million youngsters applied to be volunteers at the Games  68 per cent of them were college students. Among them, 600,000 were chosen, mostly from Guangzhou itself, and trained for 18 months. Among these, 380 were chosen to be Miss Etiquettes, those who stand with medal trays during the medal ceremonies. Their special training included standing for hours with a book on their heads, or with trays full of mineral water bottles, perfecting the angle in which to hold the medals tray, and practising a 15-degree bow.        
	All that obviously took its toll  during the medal ceremony for the boat-racing event, a volunteer passed out while carrying a tray full of medals. The athletes waiting for their medals on the podium had to help revive her. A medical student, she explained apologetically that she had had breakfast at 6.30 am and had had no time for lunch.                
	New look        
	Guangzhous waterfront has always been its most enchanting part, with the bridges and boats all lit up. For the opening ceremony, residents living near the waterfront, who would have had a ringside view of the show, were asked to leave their homes for security reasons till the ceremony was over, but to leave the lights in their homes on to add to the fairyland effect. Many were given tickets and free mascots as compensation; some were simply given cash. They were told either to watch the ceremony on televisions installed at plazas, or in the ground floor of their buildings on community TV sets. More than 2,68,000 video cameras have been installed in the city, on all streets and even in lanes near the venues.        
	Guangzhous traffic jams are legendary. The authorities came up with an unusual solution to get cars off the roads  free metro rides from November 1. Immediately, the number of commuters doubled and the plan had to be abandoned within a week. Instead, all residents were given a transport allowance of 150 yuan each for the duration of the Games. As in Delhi for the Commonwealth Games, in Guangzhou too, the poor have been hidden away behind high walls covered with huge pictures of the venues. Two such walls hide what remains of the old villages of Nanting and Beiting, parts of which were demolished for the Games. As late as August, clashes were taking place between police and villagers resisting demolition as part of the citys makeover. Many of the houses demolished were ancestral homes dating back to the early 20th century.        
	Typical Chinese touches to the Games preparations: old buildings near the venues got not just a new coat of paint, but also had windows painted on their faades. New signboards in Chinese and English,with spelling mistakes galore: lndor stadium instead of indoor; wets instead of West. The best one, however, was the slogan for the Games  Lets make love everywhere in our Guangzhou.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LOST IN TIME                                  Visual arts - Uddalak Mukherjee                                                  
	Forty-nine years ago, Goa was liberated by the Indian army. But for some residents of this former Portuguese colony  the Catholic community, for instance  freedom had come with fetters. It is this community, locked inside an opulent past and united in its loathing for a present marked by slow decay, that forms the backdrop of Prabuddha Dasguptas exhibition, Edge of Faith (Seagull Arts and Media Resource Centre, January 23-February 3).        
	The first thing that strikes one about some of these images is their setting. Most of the subjects have had their photographs taken inside their dwellings  within a private, solitary space  indicating their possessiveness and pride for objects and spaces and a way of life on the wane. Dona Georgina sits smiling in a spacious, lit-up dining room filled with antique furniture, while in another house, on a bare veranda with an empty aquarium, Treeza DSouza stares fiercely at the camera. The world outside has changed, but the women and the rooms that shelter them are unwilling to keep pace. The crumbling house in Parra, with walls sprouting root-like veins, the abandoned Fiat at Fontainhas, the wristlet dangling from Katina DMellows aged hands are all visual registers of this painful transition. Out of these vignettes emerges a terrible sadness, one that slowly infuses the minds eye that was only capable of imagining Goa as a land of light and revelry.        
	Dasgupta employs a visual style whose economy is stunning, as is evident in the photograph of the bed in Wendell Rodricks house. The muted light that illuminates shadows on the walls, the bed covered in soft, white linen, the draped mosquito net that opens on one side, like a door to another world  each element has been captured with precision and simplicity. Like most of the other images, this one too does not appear to be contrived, or overly sentimental. There is also a dexterous use of light, most notably in DMello residence, Anjuna, in which a single beam cuts through a wall adorned with a cartoon.        
	What is missing in these images is the tension that usually marks every unequal transition. The subjects, the living and the lifeless, seem to have given up all hope of retribution. Their impassive faces, occasionally creased with faltering defiance, make their tragedy even more heart-rending. The sense of doom comes through most tellingly in the eerie photograph of a tall, hooded figure attending what appears to be a church service (Procession of Tails, S Cathedral, Old Goa, picture). Some of the men, women and children around seem to be aware of this, as if spectral, presence. It would seem that the spirit of the Goa now lost forever has come to attend its own funeral.

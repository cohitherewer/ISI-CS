                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Hear no evil                  
	Sir  I am an 87-year-old resident of Golf Green, which is a place known for its quietness and greenery. Even if one talks here at a normal pitch, ones voice can be heard 50 yards away. The serenity and silence of the area are seriously affected during Kali Puja. People burst banned crackers and bombs that create a thunderous sound, rattling the glass windows of residential buildings. It is surprising that the sound never reaches the ears of policemen at the Jadavpur police station, which is not too far away.           
	Yours faithfully,        Dilip Sengupta, Calcutta
        
	Keep hoping          
	 Sir  The editorial, Body blow (Nov 2), succinctly summarizes the factors responsible for the fall of the Left Democratic Front in the just-concluded municipal and panchayat elections in Kerala. In West Bengal, alarm bells have been ringing for the Communist Party of India (Marxist) since the last panchayat elections. The results of the Kerala elections have further proved the rapid erosion of the Lefts support base in India.           
	However, as the editorial points out, the reversal of the CPI(M)s fortunes in Kerala is not surprising since the people of that state had the sense to change the parties in government every five years. What is shocking is the rout of the Left in the local bodies in Kerala. This indicates that the Lefts hold is weakening right at the grassroots. The election results should be taken by the party leaders as a warning call. The CPI(M) in Kerala must urgently revamp itself if it is to regain its lost glory.           
	In the case of West Bengal, the CPI(M)s age-old belief in unchallenged authority coupled with corruption in every sphere of governance has resulted in the loss of its strong grip over the masses. The party has been ruling continuously for 33 long years. After some good land reforms at the initial stage, there has been a sharp fall in the states economic condition. The performance of the industrial sector has been particularly dismal, resulting in the exodus of the labour force to other states. The editorial correctly diagnoses the flaws of West Bengals ruling party  Corruption, glorification of the incompetent, habitual lying, blatant nepotism, a self-perpetuating mindlessness.           
	The present anti- incumbency wave in West Bengal amply proves that the CPI(M)s ideology is no longer acceptable to voters. The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seems not to have lost hope in spite of the repeated poll debacles. He is still trying to give the state a facelift. Only time will tell whether he will succeed in his mission.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Jayant Mukherjee, Calcutta

                          
	Too late          
	 Sir  On October 23, my family and I had a harrowing experience while travelling in the Jabalpur- Calcutta Puja special train. Within an hour of leaving Jabalpur, the train was kept waiting in between stations to allow two other trains to pass. Thereafter, at Katni junction, the train stood for another one to one-and-a-half hours without any ostensible reason. Throughout the journey, the train stopped at almost every other station. It ultimately reached Calcutta about seven hours after the scheduled time, taking 32 hours in all to cover a distance of 1,154 kilometres.           
	What is the point of running trains if they are not punctual? Does the responsibility of the railways end with collecting the fare and putting passengers on the trains?                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A. Chakravorty, Calcutta

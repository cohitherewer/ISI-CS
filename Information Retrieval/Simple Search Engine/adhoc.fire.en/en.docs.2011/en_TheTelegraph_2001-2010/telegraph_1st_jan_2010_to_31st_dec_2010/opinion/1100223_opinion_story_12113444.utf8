	In peril                  
	Sir  It was only a few years ago, in July 2004, that a devastating fire in Kumbakonams Sri Krishna Aided Primary School caused the death of 90 children. And now an outbreak of fire at a school hostel in Palin, Arunachal Pradesh, has resulted in the death of at least 10 children (Hostel fire kills kids in sleep, Feb 13). Had the brave boy, Takam, not saved some of the children by shaking them out of sleep and thus helping them escape, the death toll would have been much higher. It sends a shiver down the spine to imagine the terror of the innocent children who had found themselves within the blazing bamboo walls of the hostel while they slept.          
	Perhaps the government will set up an inquiry commission to investigate the matter, and a few teachers will be suspended eventually. But nothing practical will be done to prevent the recurrence of such tragedies. How can a school hostel have a thatched roof or bamboo walls? In Calcutta, puja organizers are not permitted to erect pandals if fireproof material is not used. In a remote town such as Palin, any kind of assistance, medical or otherwise, is difficult to come by. As such, it is imperative that security measures in schools or colleges are never compromised with.          
	The authorities of Don Bosco School, where the children studied, cannot abdicate responsibility by saying that the hostel was privately run. Even the parents are partly responsible for the mishap. They cannot just admit their children in a hostel or school without inquiring into the details of available safety and security measures within the school and hostel premises.          
	Deaths by fire are not uncommon in India, be it in business establishments, in hotels and restaurants or in academic institutions. Yet, they hardly serve as a lesson for the future. Two years ago, just before jamai sasthi, a popular garment store in Sodepur became the site of 12 deaths from asphyxiation after a fire broke out there (City of peril, May 19, 2008). The victims were not burnt, but they choked to death because the fire extinguishers in the shop did not work. The macabre incident raised questions about emergency provisions in shopping malls, schools and the like. But the queries, inevitably, died down with the passage of time. Keeping in mind the present episode in Arunachal Pradesh, I think that the Union education minister, Kapil Sibal, should convene a meeting of ministers of states of the relevant departments to examine the infrastructure and security standards of educational institutions throughout the country. Schools and colleges should not become profit-making industries.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Road ahead          
	Sir  I have been living in Kerala for the last several years and keeping a close watch on National Highway 47. The highway has changed a lot in the last few years. Today, it is more a place for commuters and vendors than for vehicles. Innumerable fish and meat vendors occupy the waysides. They and their customers have turned the highway into a busy marketplace, which stinks to high heaven, thanks to the decaying fish and meat. The wastes piled by the roadsides attract stray dogs. Often, the dogs get killed and drivers meet with accidents trying to avoid the dogs coming in the way of their vehicles.           
	The highway has become more dangerous after it was dug up for laying water-supply lines and optical fibre cables. The owners of cranes make good profit by lifting the heavy vehicles that land up in the huge craters created by the workers. When one drives along this highway of potholes, one is assaulted with the sight of scattered garbage, open drains, muddled traffic, dirty vendors and food corporation outlets, whose queues extend several metres into the road.           
	It is dangerous to drive a vehicle on any of Keralas roads. The state spends huge sums on road repair, but only about 40 per cent of the amount spent gets reflected in the work done.           
	Recently, newspaper technology has been adopted in Kerala for repairing roads. The workers fill potholes with metal or sand and then cover them with newspapers dipped in coal tar. This patchwork hardly lasts for a week, and then the team is ready with a fresh bundle of old newspapers for starting another bout of work at the same spot. Road repair has thus become a never-ending process, siphoning off huge sums of money from the State exchequer.           
	But I would like to know whether India has applied for a patent for its newspaper technology used in road repair. For all we know, America or Japan might be interested in this.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  I visit the Mary Cooper Home for senior citizens on Diamond Harbour every month to see my aunts and uncles living there. I was shocked to see pools of stagnant water and mounds of dirt right in front of this old age home. We all know that stagnant water breeds mosquitoes, which carry deadly diseases such as malaria, dengue and the like. Old people, who are weak and feeble, are susceptible to such diseases.           
	It is good to know that tram tracks in the area near the home are being made cemented. But the construction work should not inconvenience the senior citizens by leaving roads pot-holed and uneven. I hope that the accumulated water will be suctioned off, and the place made into a mosquito-free zone soon.           
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The Dhanbad-Sindri Road in Jharia has been in a poor condition for the last several months. Lots of potholes make it dangerous for pedestrians, especially for patients and the elderly. But we have to use it since it is the only road in the region.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Kabita and Kum Kum Goswami, Dhanbad

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        HOW TO CREATE PERFECT HARMONY                                  MUSIC: Fauzia Marikar                                                  
	The rarely heard combination of the woodwind quintet  flute, oboe, bassoon, french horn and clarinet  was a welcome inclusion in the winter concert season this year. Presented by the consulate-general of the Federal Republic of Germany at the Sandr Memorial Hall of the Calcutta School of Music, the Arirang Quintet played a tantalizingly short  just under one hour  but delightful concert on November 15.        
	Formed in 2002, the quintet comprises members from the Junge Deutsche Philharmonie  Jrg Schneider (oboe), Steffen Dillner (clarinet), Monika Schneider (bassoon), Sebastian Schindler (french horn) and Sakura Kindynis (flute). Although the horn is a brass instrument, it is generally considered a part of the woodwind combine.        
	The programme was neatly distributed with works from the classical, romantic and modern genres. It commenced with one of the three quintets for woodwind by Franz Danzi. These were composed as a tribute to Antoine Reicha and presented in 1821. The treatment of these is in early-sonata form, classic in structure and beautiful to listen to. The texture is mostly crisp and lively throughout the four movements  allegretto, andante con moto, menuetto-allegro and allegro. They were neatly executed, and were characterized by sparkling passages for the oboe and flute.        
	August Klughardts Quintet in C op. 79, the only wind quintet that he composed, starts with sombre rising passages for the bassoon in the allegro non troppo first movement. Monika Schneiders lovely tonal quality was a pleasure to listen to in this rarely heard instrument. This was followed by a lyrical and flowing andante, and the last allegro molto vivace preceded by the solemn adagio introduction displayed the intimate interaction among the performers.        
	The last part of the programme was from the three short pieces for wind quintet, and might as well have been written by Mozart. The lively clarinet and flute performances brought the presentation to a fitting end.        
	The balance of the evenings programme was neat and, on the whole, it was all too short. In response to a long applause, the quintet played two little encores  the polka and tango from Denes Agays Five Easy Dances for woodwind quintet. The small auditorium was almost filled. However, one did not see too many music teachers or students in the crowd. Two young boys were seen sitting spellbound throughout the evening. Expectedly, those under the age of 50 showed considerable interest in the proceedings. If young students of the piano and the violin were to attend such concerts by players of other instruments, it would do a world of good to them.

	Q: I am an Indian national. I had inherited a property in Chittagong, Bangladesh, by virtue of a succession certificate issued by a court of law in Chittagong. I decided to donate it to an organisation in Chittagong. Accordingly, the property was handed over to Mridul Kanti Dey, secretary, Adyapeath Ramakrishna Sangha of Chittagong, with a power of attorney (POA) and a trust deed. However, Dey has now misappropriated the property. He has also declared that he has dual citizenship of Bangladesh and India. The matter was brought to the notice of the municipal authorities and superintendent of police, North 24 Parganas, home secretary of West Bengal and income tax authorities (vigilance). But I have received no feedback since then. What should I do?        
	Ashim Duttagupta, Calcutta                
	A: Since the alleged misappropriation relating to the trust property has taken place in Chittagong, the cause of action relating to your complaint seems to have arisen there. Hence, whatever legal action is to be taken has to be done in Chittagong.              
	Q:The tenant of the house adjacent to mine is an old lady with at least a dozen cats. The cats regularly defecate on the plastic awning in front of my house. The area stinks. If I complain, she claims that other cats are responsible for the nuisance. Can this be termed a nuisance quot; under the Tenancy Act? What can I do to prevent this?        
	Rudradeb Mukhopadhyay, Calcutta                
	A: Since your neighbour is not your tenant, the tenancy laws are not relevant in your case. However, being your neighbour, the lady owes a duty of care towards you and must ensure that her pets do not disturb others. Try sorting out the matter taking the help of your local councillor or other neighbours. If nothing works, send her a legal notice as a last option.              
	Q:Is a married Hindu daughters share in her fathers property paternal or acquired according to the current Indian Succession Act?        
	Name withheld                
	A: A Hindu female is governed by The Hindu Succession Act, 1956, and a daughter, married or unmarried, being a Class I heir, has the right to her fathers property if she survives her father and if her father dies without making a will.

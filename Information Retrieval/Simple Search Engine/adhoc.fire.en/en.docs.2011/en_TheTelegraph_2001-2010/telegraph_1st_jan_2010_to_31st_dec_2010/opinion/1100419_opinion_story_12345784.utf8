	A different ball game                  
	Sir  What started as a Twitter war between the chairman and commissioner of the Indian Premier League, Lalit Modi, and the minister of State for external affairs, Shashi Tharoor, has now acquired alarming proportions (Shashi caught in lady storm, April 13). Tharoor, who is expected to resign from his post, is no stranger to controversy. In the course of his brief tenure, he has caused embarrassment to the Union government more than once. Modi, who revealed the members of the consortium that won the bid for the new IPL team, Kochi, alleged that Tharoor was involved with Rendezvous, which is part of this consortium. Tharoor, on his part, has maintained that he only gave his blessings to Rendezvous and his sole intention was to bring cricket to Kerala.          
	The involvement of Sunanda Pushkar, who has been linked with Tharoor and is reportedly an entrepreneur based in Dubai, added another element to the situation. This mysterious lady has been given free equity in the said consortium, a circumstance that has been perceived by many to be a result of her association with the influential external affairs minister. Tharoor is a Union minister and a public figure. He is accountable for all his actions and, as the saying goes, even Caesars wife should be above suspicion.          
	As for Modi, he is not blameless in the matter either. Disclosing the names of all those in the consortium was completely unwarranted. Moreover, according to media reports, Modi and his relatives have substantial financial stakes in the IPL franchise that had not been revealed previously.          
	New developments continue to unfold every day. According to reports, the former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Sharad Pawar, has come out in support of Modi. It would appear that nobody has the courage to antagonize the powerful Modi, who had been nominated by the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, as the latters alternate representative from India at an International Cricket Council meeting. Money and politics have destroyed a gentlemans game. Where there is money, crime and corruption will inevitably follow. Maybe it is time to ban the IPL.          
	Yours faithfully,         Tapan Das Gupta, Dasghora, Burdwan               
	Sir Shashi Tharoor admitted to helping the consortium come to Kerala, but has reiterated that he would not derive any financial benefit from his association with Team Kochi, now or at a later stage (Shashi hits out over insult, April 17). What is mystifying is that Modi, whom Tharoor considered a friend, would choose to make damaging revelations about the Kochi consortium at this juncture.          
	It is evident that Modi has vested interests, both political and financial, in doing so. If he was so concerned about transparency he should have disclosed details of the ownership of all IPL teams. It is to be noted that Modi, who allegedly holds a large stake in the Rajasthan Royals, is no disinterested party. His personal financial interests could explain his efforts to ensure that the Adani and the Videocon groups do not lose out in the bidding process.          
	Undoubtedly, Tharoor is a controversial figure, thanks to his Twitter posts and his unconventional lifestyle. However, his encouragement to Team Kochi does not prove that he was involved in a massive financial scam. People want to know exactly which laws were broken. It is a pity that, like other icons, Tharoors every move is fodder for gossip, both in the electronic and print media. Meanwhile, a shrewd businessman like Lalit Modi, who has killed cricket as an entertainment and covertly amassed huge sums of money, cries foul when it suits him. It is Modi who should be investigated thoroughly. The BCCI, silenced by the lure of money, may continue to support him, but the government should take action. The IPL chiefs office has already been raided by the income tax department. It is also suspicious that a huge amount of money is spent on the IPL but there does not seem to be a correspondingly heavy tax imposed on it. Among other things, the amount received from taxes could have been spent on the development of the tribals and the poor.          
	Yours faithfully,         Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad              
	Sir  It seems that the electronic media, eager to attract more viewers, concentrate on sensational news. At the moment, it is obsessed with the battle between Tharoor and Modi as well as with Sunanda Pushkar and her stake in Team Kochi. In a country racked with problems, is there no other news to report? The media must concentrate on more serious matters instead of being mouthpieces for politicians.          
	Yours faithfully,

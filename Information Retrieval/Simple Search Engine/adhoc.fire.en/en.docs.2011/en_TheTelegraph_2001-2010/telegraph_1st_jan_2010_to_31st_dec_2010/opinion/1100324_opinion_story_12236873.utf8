	Horror stories                  
	Sir  I found the editorial, Just teaching (March 16), well timed and instructive. Reports of corporal punishment appear in the media with shocking frequency. This is surprising, considering that the Supreme Court has outlawed corporal punishment long ago. One shudders to think of the various forms of sadistic behaviour that children are subjected to.          
	A few days ago, I came across a news item in a Bengali daily, which reported that an entire class in a girls school was made to stand in the heat for hours as punishment. One has heard of worse incidents, such as children being sexually exploited by teachers. However, the accused is often shielded by the head of the institution who invariably blames the media for tarnishing the schools reputation. Not very long ago, a girl from Durgapur died after the teacher threw a duster at her for not finishing her homework.          
	The editorial has mentioned the governments slackness in not notifying school authorities of the apex courts order on corporal punishment. It seems that the authorities are not bothered about how teachers behave in school, let alone checking if the Supreme Court order is being implemented. As mentioned by the editorial, something has gone grievously wrong with the administration and society when it comes to childrens education. Else, teachers wouldnt have been let off after having done such gross disservice to their profession.          
	Rights go hand in hand with responsibilities. Not being aware of our obligation towards children is as good as going back to the dark ages. Rather than a court order or administrative action, both of which are slow to come by, it is public alertness that can put an end to such practices. Shall we wake up to the reality or leave hapless children at the mercy of ruthless murderers?          
	Yours faithfully,

	Unequal partners          
	Sir  The timing of Anchita Ghataks article could not have been better (Dreams, songs, laughter and roses, but also bread, March 9). As mentioned by Ghatak, International Womens Day has taken on the colours of a celebration, albeit in a manner that is different from its intended purpose. The article was informative and well-written, clearly explaining the genesis of International Womens Day. It also elaborated on the courses of action taken by womens organizations and marked out the several issues that concern women.          
	But it would have been great had the article also referred to increasing instances of crime against women. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, cases of sexual harassment and rape have gone up considerably. There has been an alarming rise in crime against women employees. A large number of women work nowadays, and sexual harassment and eve-teasing are among the many forms of harassment that they encounter when they step out of their homes.           
	One does not have to be a part of the womens movement to understand how patriarchy manifests itself within different social institutions such as family, religion, marriage and education. Recently, at a job interview, when I was asked how I would manage my work once I got married, I was reminded, once again, of the stereotypical notions concerning women professionals. One wonders whether the interviewer had put the same question to the male candidates as well.          
	Should a womans identity be thought of only in terms of marriage? What if she chooses not to marry? The onus to look after the home does not rest with her alone. The heterosexual woman is indeed taken to be the parameter. In that sense, heteronormativity plagues not only womens movements but the society at large. The need of the hour is to be aware of the prejudices so deeply internalized that they are taken to be normal. Unless we ensure that everyone lives with dignity, a 33 per cent quota for women in politics will not change things at the ground level.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The editorial, Of a different colour (March 14), sounded like the voice of reason in the dark. Although I am a woman, I am opposed to the womens reservation bill. In fact, I am against any kind of reservation. The concept of democracy envisages equal opportunity for all, so much so that anyone with the necessary credentials can stand for elections. But if some of the seats are already reserved for certain groups, isnt the very idea of democracy compromised? The womens reservation bill seeks to recognize the unequal status of women and attempts to set it right. However, real victory will be attained only when both sexes can compete on an equal footing, with no special advantage to either side. This is what the State should work towards. It is not an impossible task, as illustrated by the examples in the editorial.Sadly, none of the opponents of this bill is challenging it on the grounds of equality of rights. Nor are the opponents raising questions about alternatives such as increasing the number of schools and colleges for girls or prevention of female infanticide. It is true that we need a revolutionary change in the attitude towards women, but this bill is not the answer.          
	Yours faithfully,

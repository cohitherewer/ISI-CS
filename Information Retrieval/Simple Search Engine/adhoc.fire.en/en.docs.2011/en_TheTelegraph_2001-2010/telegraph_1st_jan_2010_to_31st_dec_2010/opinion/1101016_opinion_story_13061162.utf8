The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Lessons of Asias past
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        LESSONS OF ASIAS PAST                          - Celebrating 2,500 years of Asia-Europe exchanges in Brussels					 					      Sunanda K. Datta-Ray                        Bozar				                                             
	He responded with a flow of mellifluous Sanskrit  Kalidasas Sakuntala  to my Pujarini in Tagores Bengali. Jan Van Alphen organized (with Singapores Kenson Kwok) A Passage to Asia, an evocative celebration of 2,500 years of Asia-Europe exchanges that ended last week at Bozar, the Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels where he chairs the scientific committee after having been director of Antwerps Ethnographic Museum for 25 years.        
	All his exhibitions, commemorated in handsome coffee-table volumes, exalt the triumph of civilization and the lessons Asias past holds for Europes future. But a more sombre underpinning  History is always about dealing with barbarians, he says  recalls Constantine Cavafys poem about civilizations interaction with barbarians, without, however, Nirad Chaudhuris apocalyptic vision of universal darkness burying all. Van Alphen leads to the enlightenment.         
	Two visually similar exhibitions in Singapore came to mind. The mural inscription, The influence of Indian cross-cultural interactions was the major common factor across early Southeast Asia greeted visitors to the National Librarys KaalaChakra (Wheel of Time) show. The second  On the Nalanda Trail at the Asian Civilizations Museum  traced Buddhisms path from India to China and thence to South-east Asia using artefacts from all over the world.               
	They fleshed out Singapores strategic discovery of India. Bozar cast a wider net, as befits the cultural accompaniment to ASEM 8, the eighth meeting of 16 Asian and 27 European heads of State and/or government representing 58 per cent of the worlds population, 52 per cent of its gross domestic product and 68 per cent of global trade. But India remained a compelling presence and Dominique Girard, the Asia-Europe Foundations executive director and Frances former ambassador to India, slipped into the predictable mistake of saying A Passage to India during a brief introductory speech.        
	Van Alphen would be careful not to fall into such an obvious trap. He knows India well after 46 visits including youthful backpacking trips, two years studying Sanskrit and sitar at Bombays Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, where he made friends with Ravi Shankar and Alla Rakha as well as Amitabh Bachchan, and stints among adivasis learning Munda. His wife, Chris de Lawer, Belgian but India-born, specialized in 11th century Jain texts and taught Sanskrit and Hindi at Ghent University. For several years, the two did a touring show based on Kalidasa, Van Alphen on the sitar while his wife danced. The Kavya Mala show nearly cost them their lives once when their car overturned in the snow.         
	He talks as knowledgeably of Austronesian adventurers who sailed to Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, Borneo and even Madagascar 3,000 years ago as of the Hellenistic relics that survived in Mazar-i-Sharif until the Taliban onslaught. Ancient mans achievements evoke his wonder  the knowledge of human anatomy that medieval Tibetans acquired, a single mine on the Afghan-Tajikistan border providing lapis lazuli for Pharaonic masks, and rings with Nandi bulls in the pre-Angkor kingdom of Funan around the Mekong delta.         
	He has hunted down ancient medicinal tankhas in Tibet, explored Korean Buddhism and accompanied Belgiums Crown Prince Philip to Jakarta and Singapore. Surprisingly, such a versatile man has written no straight books, only the commemorative volumes. But he has made films (Bombaywallah is one) and CDs, and his exhibitions highlight the story of man. The more than 300 Asian treasures in A Passage to Asia included none from European collections. India gave 70 objects, including a Hoysala dynasty statue of an adivasi girl and a Chola bronze from Nagapatnam made for Southeast Asian worshippers.        
	India, especially Indian music (I was in love with music), is his first commitment. Antwerps Jains, who have almost taken over the Jewish monopoly of cutting and polishing diamonds, call him Tirthankar. I was told he might be the only European permitted to enter the white marble splendour of their new temple to Parshvanath. I reached it after changing buses on a young Gujarati womans advice and directions from a helpful Bengali with a bushy tiki, testifying to his Iskcon antecedents, whose card read Shyam Cash amp; Carry, Wholesale amp; Retail.         
	But a muscular Belgian security guard politely but firmly told me to leave. No, I could not even walk round the buildings. I had already trespassed by strolling into the compound behind a bunch of Jain women who gather there on Thursdays. No house of god could be more jealously guarded. Back at Shyam Cash amp; Carry, Wholesale amp; Retail, I asked the young Bengali if he worshipped in the temple. I am Hindu! he announced with proud defiance. Arent they, I wondered. Do they say they are? he countered. Do Sikhs?        
	I fled the politics of theology to catch my train to Brussels and Bozar where a book on Van Alphens exhibition of Jain art and religion extolled Mahaviras steps to liberation. Tranquillity alone is the cure for the disease of existence for those of simple, pure intelligence, wrote my old friend Pratapaditya Pal, quoting one of the 24 Jinas.        
	Kapila Vatsyayan and Ranesh Ray were other familiar names. They collaborated with Van Alphen in producing an exhibition titled Tejas, subtitled Eternal Energy, that Sonia Gandhi opened in 2007. He explained that Tejas permeates Indias mythology, philosophy, music, literature and plastic arts, and sustains the cycles of creation. Tracing the development of Tejas from the second century BC to the 15th century AD through the medium of bronze and stone sculptures, the display captured Indias energy in all its forms, from the meditating Buddha to the dancing Siva.        
	Conflict is inseparable from culture. I learnt how sensitive the governments of India, China and Pakistan could be over borders as maps were juggled to explain A Passage to Asia. I also learnt that the time Van Alphen spent among the Gonds of Bastar reinforced the lesson of history where civilization is forever forced to defend itself against nomadic hordes. Apparently, Pravir Chandra Bhanj Deo, Bastars ill-fated 20th maharaja, was stabbed in the back on March 25, 1966, not accidentally killed in police firing to quell a tribal revolt, as reported at the time. Van Alphen is fascinated by the tragedy. Through him, his uncle has collected enough material for a book on yet another of modern Indias hidden dramas.               
	The tension between civilization and savages is especially strong in what is today China, and Van Alphen talks of the Hunnu (Hun in English), as Mongolians called their notorious ancestors in the Taklamakan desert and the Chinese called Xiongu, barbarians of the north. The Great Wall of China still recalls that ancient enmity. Jiang Rongs famous novel, Lang Tuteng (Wolf Totem), develops the theme. The atavistic and xenophobic fear of wolves marauding beyond the border is so deeply ingrained in Chinas psyche that the worst insult the Chinese could hurl at the Dalai Lama was wolf with a human face.        
	Nation-building is also nation- destroying, and external enemies serve internal purposes. And now what shall become of us without any barbarians?/ Those people were some kind of solution Cavafy chanted in an English translation I dont particularly like. (Mavrogordatos is more lyrical but I dont have it here.) The necessary barbarian can be Hun, wolves, the Dalai Lama, Pravir Chandra Bhanj Deo or, as some 21st century analysts suggest, terrorists.         
	But it all comes right in the end as culture completes the circle. While the Chinese fought the Xiongu, they, in turn, pushed the Yueh-chih tribes towards the Aral Sea in the west. One branch, the Kyue Shan, became northern Indias first century Kushana dynasty whose kings, Kadphises and Kanishka, were protectors of Buddhism. The Kushana united two great civilizations to make the first Gandhara Buddha images. A Passage to Asias two splendid examples of that Graeco-Indian synthesis  a standing figure of Drona and a 10th century Sarnath Buddha in sandstone  illumines faith in civilizations triumph over barbarians.       sunandadr@yahoo.co.in

	Burdened with knowledge                  
	Sir  Some leading educational institutions of India have become money-making machines, thus defeating the very purpose of learning. The government wants to make education accessible to the poor. Yet, certain reputed institutions hike fees constantly. Attending courses, such as orientation training and information technology training, are often made mandatory. These classes hardly contribute to the betterment of the pupils. Students get nine months to complete eight subjects, and the extra classes add to their burden.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Bina Daga, Calcutta

    
	Historic occasion          
	Sir  For many in America, who have seen the ghost of socialism being viciously exorcised by Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s, even a hint of its return is enough to ring alarm bells (Health concern, March 24). It is the die-hard conservatives who are worried about the healthcare bill. Despite being dealt a blow by two wars, and in spite of suffering from the trauma of recession, a majority of Americans sees social liberalism as the ultimate evil.           
	America has embraced raw capitalism and unrestrained individual enterprise from the very beginning. This hedonistic outlook, along with the economy it produces, does not envisage a role of the State in extending healthcare to the poorest of the poor. The bill may not last long in the statute books. Nevertheless, the historic occasion of the passing of the bill on March 21 will belong to Barack Obama, who has broken the reign of dogma.                    
	Yours faithfully,																															 R. Narayanan,Ghaziabad    
	Sir  The House of Representatives in the United States of America created history by passing the healthcare bill in a do-or-die situation. It is a feather in the cap of Barack Obama. He has achieved what he promised. The bill will give him great political mileage. It is likely to benefit 95 per cent of Americans, including the elderly and the poor. Children will be covered by their parents health insurance plans till the age of 26. The bill will make it compulsory for citizens to buy insurance, although subsidies will be given to those who cannot afford the premiums. But buyers of the policy should also have been offered tax exemptions by the government.          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Ramachandran, Ooty 

    
	Fair enough  
	Sir  I agree with the Supreme Courts verdict that premarital sex or live-in relationships cannot be seen as offensive (Living-in no offence: SC, March 24). The Chief Justice of India said that the Tamil actress, Khusboo, cannot be penalized for holding the view that premarital sex is fine. A bench of three judges said that live-in relationships, seen as immoral by sections of society, cannot be branded as an offence. The judges cited the example of Radha and Krishna, pointing out that they too lived together. They were, in fact, an adulterous couple. Most of us not only accept them, but also glorify and worship them.           
	Our mythologies are replete with cases of adultery, premarital sex, rape and other such activities. In the Mahabharat, Kunti gave birth to Karna before marriage. Even in todays society, adultery is a common phenomena, especially among the elite. The recent paternity suit against N.D. Tiwari proves this.           
	I value morality, but in this age of artificial insemination and surrogate motherhood, none should make an issue out of premarital sex and live-in relationships.          
	Yours faithfully,         R.C. Dey, Calcutta

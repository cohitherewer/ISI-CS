                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        UNKNOWN ALPHABETS                                  VISUAL ARTS - Soumitra Das                                                
	The first thing that strikes viewers as they walk into the magnificent (some may find it intimidating) colonial space of the Harrington Street Arts Centre is the manner in which most of the works of the 15 participants connect with one another to develop the original idea behind the title, Writing Visuals (until July 24). Adip Duttas curatorial note offers an explanation for his choice of works and artists: Writing Visuals deals with the practice of drawing. Drawing as a form of expression shares many elements with writing. Writing is a symbolic expression of an understanding through words that constitute language and drawing is a structural expression of perception appearing in the form of motifs used almost like visual alphabets.        
	The last line of Duttas note encapsulates the concept behind Manisha Parekhs fine drawings in black highlighted with hints of gold. Her starting point was a real object  often identifiable  which she pared down to its essence, thereby creating motifs that it would not be far-fetched to call hieroglyphs, structurally simple yet resembling the letters of some unknown alphabet. An entire series of these works is lined up on a wall, and although these are small, intimate works they are not swallowed up by the sprawling hallway. This is Duttas strategy for putting up this exhibition in which he was assisted by Jayashree Chakravarty, who is a participant as well. He makes up for the lack of size by sheer numbers, and it is a strategy that works.                    
	Dutta says he only invited those artists he could relate to to participate, thereby forming a group of like-minded people. It is quite remarkable how one group of works leads to another, forming a link as it were. Duttas own works seem to be the flip side of Parekhs, for his delicate line drawings of objects are an accumulation of minute dots. These resemble botanical drawings in their detailed and meticulous rendering of the weave of cloth and the scales of a snake. An actual object  steel wool, a bottle brush or somesuch is planted amidst the drawings creating a startling contrast between the real and the simulacrum. Mithu Sens tangle of tresses and her prints generate a similar tension.        
	Vivan Sundarams works stretch drawings to another dimension where they have been translated into material. The line is important here but not lines drawn with a pencil so much as geometrical patterns stitched on paper with coloured thread. Cut-outs of butter paper and tracing paper, some resembling puppets, are stitched to paper throwing shadows that are reflected in the jagged lines scribbled under them. These works are the precursors of Sundarams bad drawings created for Dost organized in honour of Bhupen Khakhar.        
	The extensive use of lines connect them with the early drawings of Jogen Chowdhury who has lent three of his seminal sketchbooks covering a decade from 1996 to 2005 that have served as the matrix for several of his major works such as Leaping Tiger (top), the Wounds series and Fierce Durga. Chowdhury revisits them from time to time for inspiration, and on these pages he makes detail plans for the final work, down to the shades he would apply. He jots down his thoughts as well, both in English and Bengali, and in one such note he has expressed his aversion to excessive intellectualisation of art. These notebooks open a fascinating window on the workings of his mind. While design is crucial to Chowdhury, Sudhir Patwardhans two biggish drawings are accidental, chancy.        
	Partha Pratim Deb and Kishore Chatterjee, better known for his writing on Western classical music, are strange bedfellows here. Dutta has brought them together because of their whimsicality. Some of Debs sketches as a student shed light on how he tailored the modernists to Bengals milieu. His lugubrious terpsichorean ensemble provides a counterpoint to Chatterjees bizarre musical hybrids. Wit is the high point of Dilip Ranades intriguing play with lines. Debnath Basu exploits his undoubted skills as a miniature artist to create a lurid world of perfervid sexual activity, which on the face of it is calm and sedate. His art is very close to that of the cartoonists and provided a linkage with Samir Roys huge drawings of sad, saucer-eyed creatures, the largest and sootiest of them behatted, Eliza-Doolittle-at-the-Ascot style (bottom).        
	Jayashree Chakravarty is the second artist who has hung a huge canvas along with a series of smaller, bejewelled (quite literally with beads) works. In a melange of ancient cartographic icons and biological drawings, she records the evolution of Salt Lake that still bears traces of the marsh that it originally was.        
	While these works cohere although they have little in common, there are three misfits. This has nothing to do with quality. They write, but quite differently.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	The rot within                  
	Sir  The Calcutta Municipal Corporation and its former mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, are to blame for the deaths of three people caused by the collapse of sections of the dilapidated Strand Warehouse (Strand, a picture of tragic grandeur, May 30). The CMC failed to contain the fire that damaged the building this February. It also had no scruples about leaving the structure in a precarious condition, making it an open death trap. In any civilized metropolitan city, such callousness calls for the arrest of the people responsible.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah 

                
	Sir  The editorial, Old tale (May 31), made some accurate observations. It should be noted that it is typical of the CMC to pass the buck and to claim that it was unable to demolish the condemned building, no matter how grave the danger to human life. It was apparently up to the Calcutta Port Trust to see to the maintenance of the building. In Calcutta, the same tragic story repeats itself, from buildings in Burrabazar to Stephen Court to the Strand Warehouse. The editorial aptly observes that while the rest of the world presses for civic beautification and the preservation of heritage structures, the inhabitants of Calcutta are content to live with damaged and decrepit buildings, even if that means losing lives.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Monstrous reality          
	Sir  The headline, Monsters (May 29), was appropriate for the report on the railway tragedy near Kharagpur that killed at least 145 people. It makes one wonder who the real monsters are.The railways minister and her party colleagues, who form the Opposition in West Bengal, only tried to get political mileage out of the incident, with an eye on the approaching assembly polls. The inept chief minister of the state, who has redefined the term governance by displaying a complete lack of it, is happy to engage in a perennial blame game whenever he is asked awkward questions.          
	The government at the Centre, meanwhile, has done nothing to put in place an effective disaster-management system in each state, to ensure a timely response to calamities such as this. Even when help finally reached the victims, the rescuers were not equipped enough to cut through the coaches and save the people trapped inside (Crash buries dead 5 ft under, May 30). Then there are the intellectuals who are vocal about the reason behind the Maoist problem but fight shy of condemning the brutal attacks.           
	Finally, of course, there are the actual perpetrators of the attacks on innocent people. It seems that the sovereign, democratic republic is fast turning into a lawless State governed by self-interest and personal gain.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The decision to temporarily suspend night trains in the Kharagpur-Adra and Kharagpur-Rourkela sectors following the Maoist attack on the Jnaneswari Express can only encourage the perpetrators of the attack (Night train ban till June 7, June 4). Once again, it was the common man who suffered, since train services to cities like Delhi have been affected. It would have been a better idea to strengthen the task forces meant to patrol stretches of the railways in Maoist-dominated zones. Elite armed forces trained to counter guerrilla attacks should also be employed. With modern equipment and more vigilance, night train journeys could have been made safer.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
R. Sekar, Vishakhapatnam 

                
	Sir  The recent sabotage of the railway tracks in West Midnapore led to the derailment of the Jnaneswari Express and its subsequent collision with a goods train running at high speed. The site of the tragedy, it must be noted, was very close to the Indian Air Force base at Kalaikunda. There must be some tracking device that can be used in such circumstances. It might also be advisable for night trains in Maoist-infested stretches to have air cover and the protection of the Central Reserve Police Forces.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  I have been wondering how experts of British Petroleum and the United States of America will be able to stem the gush of oil in the disastrous Deepwater Horizon oil spill that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico (US says oil flow stopped, May 28). The plan to drill relief holes could be a practical solution as it is likely to reduce the pressure on the damaged rig. However, the process will take about two months, in the course of which the damage to the coastline will be immeasurable. The situation has become a grave problem for the people and for the nation as a whole. It is also also a serious threat to the global environment, not to mention the economy.          
	Yours faithfully,      
K.B. Goswami, Virginia, US

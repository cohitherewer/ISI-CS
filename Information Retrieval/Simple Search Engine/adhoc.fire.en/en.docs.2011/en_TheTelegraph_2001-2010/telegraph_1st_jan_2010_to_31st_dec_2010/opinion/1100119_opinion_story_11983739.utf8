	Act of faith                  
	Sir  The editorial, Return to roots (Jan 8), could not have been timed better. It came close on the heels of a crucial amendment to the constitution of Bangladesh, following a landmark order passed by the supreme court of that country. The said judgment stipulated that the fifth amendment to the constitution should be annulled. Enacted by the government that was in power before  a regime that was dominated by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party  the fifth amendment had removed the word, secularism, from the constitution. Although restoring the word is only the beginning of a much greater change, it has undoubtedly provided a shot in the arm for the ruling Awami League government that won a landslide victory in the recently-held elections.          
	It is true that the fifth amendment to the constitution reflected the political intent of the then government rather than the general wishes of the people. It is also true that secularism was one of the main objectives behind the creation of Bangladesh under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The promise to eliminate fundamentalism and reaffirm the original ideals behind the formation of Bangladesh formed the core of Sheikh Hasina Wajeds pre-election pledge to the people.          
	The prime ministers move to ban religion-based parties from a predominantly Muslim country, however, might incite a violent backlash. As in the ostensibly secular India, religion and politics are inextricably connected in Bangladesh as well. Indias secular fabric is constantly threatened by the frequent communal conflicts. Political parties have no compunctions about stirring religious sentiments for the sake of votes. Muslim and Hindu fundamentalism are but two sides of the same coin.          
	The prime minister has taken a courageous step towards secularism. During my visit to Comilla district in Bangladesh in March last year, I witnessed immense goodwill for the new government. The Hindus, in particular, feel more secure at the present moment. One wishes Sheikh Hasina much success. India must also play a part in her efforts to revive Bangladeshs secular credentials.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Googles decision to discontinue its services in China is worth noting . The editorial, Search for power (Jan 16) stated that in China, a Google search for photographs of Tiananmen Square is likely to yield pictures of smiling tourists instead of the brutal pictures of the massacre that has made the square infamous. Similarly, a search for Dalai Lama will also yield unexpected results. This exposes Chinas attitude to the right to information as well as its obvious nervousness about public opinion.           
	Such repressive measures are reminiscent of that other communist regime, the former Soviet Union. The Nobel laureate, Boris Pasternak, was expelled from the Soviet Union and his book, Doctor Zhivago, was banned by the State. Despite its attempts to clamp down on the freedom of expression, the communist State collapsed in 1991. It remains to be seen whether China will be able to sustain its present authoritarian stance for long.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Chinese hackers penetrating secure computers and accessing vital information are a sign of the shape of things to come (Google hack snub to China, Jan 14). Intelligence gathering has become increasingly dependent on cyberspace. Computers will play a much more dominant role in the wars of the future. In defence and government offices, where security is crucial, computers should be sanitized and internet connections routed through reliable nodes. If it is necessary, India should take steps to develop its own cyber warfare technology with the help of private software companies.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Parting shot          
	Sir  The article ,The time to search for cleaner energy is here (Jan 5), by Bikash Sinha, highlights the dangers of our overdependence on fossil fuels. Nuclear energy may be an alternative but it requires a lot of investment and expertise, which many countries lack. Solar energy is also an expensive option.           
	However, one other renewable and environment-friendly source of energy is ocean power. Although the idea of harnessing ocean power for the production of energy has existed for quite some time, it has not yet been harnessed in a viable manner to meet the global demand for energy. Perhaps the time has arrived to direct collective attention and resources towards this promising source of renewable energy.                    
	Yours faithfully,

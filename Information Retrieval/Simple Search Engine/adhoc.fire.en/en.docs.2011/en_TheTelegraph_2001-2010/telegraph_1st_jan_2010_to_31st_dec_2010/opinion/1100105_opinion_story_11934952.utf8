                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Question of honour                  
	Sir  December 27 was a Black Sunday for cricket lovers in India (Ditch pitch in deadly Delhi, Dec 28). The shameful incident at Ferozeshah Kotla has blighted the pitch and ground committee of the Delhi and District Cricket Association, led by Chetan Chauhan, as the one-day international between India and Sri Lanka ended on a sadly controversial note.          
	The under-prepared pitch did not present the Board of Control for Cricket in India in a favourable light either. It is unfair to put the blame solely on the curator of the much-talked-about pitch. If the pitch was unplayable, why did the players stay on field for 23.3 overs? They should have discussed the situation earlier in the day. So the sudden eruption of anger among the spectators was understandable. The only good thing from the Indian perspective is that the hosts had bagged the ODI series in the penultimate tie in Calcutta. Else, in a 2-2 situation, calling off the Delhi match would have been even more dispiriting for the home crowd.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Subhayu Saha,Khagra, Murshidabad            
	Sir  The editorial, Silly point (Dec 29), is pertinent. Although Indian cricketers are doing well, the same cannot be said of cricket administrators in India. The latters incompetence led to the dismal pitch at Kotla. In this, the BCCI cannot escape responsibility, although the DDCA was actually in charge of preparing the pitch.          
	The Kotla ground has a glorious history, having hosted major cricketing events over the decades. The pitch was relaid in April last year, and its top surface dug up in November to plant grass and bind the surface. It has now been revealed that Vijay Bahadur Mishra, the curator of the ground, had no previous experience of his job. It is also customary to use pitches for domestic matches first before using them for international cricket. Even that was not done. If this is how a rich and powerful sporting body of the country functions, one dreads the things to come in the run-up to the Commonwealth Games.          
	The Kotla controversy has not only brought ridicule, but Delhi could also face a ban of up to two years on hosting international cricket. That will rule it out as one of the venues for the World Cup in 2011. All this because the apex body as well as local organizations for cricket in India are run most unprofessionally.           
	Yours faithfully,      
Dilbag Rai, Chandigarh

                
	Sir  Two mishaps, within 72 hours last year, put a question mark on the efficiency of cricketing bodies in India. On December 24, the floodlights failed in Eden Gardens during a crucial match between India and Sri Lanka. Then, on December 27, the final ODI was scheduled on a highly bouncy pitch at Ferozeshah Kotla stadium in Delhi.          
	It is a mystery how a pitch was selected for an ODI which was yet to be tested on national-level matches. Had the BCCI and the DDCA been more prudent, this awful incident could have been avoided. The persons responsible should be dealt with firmly. The behaviour of the crowd, after the match was abandoned, was immature. The match referee, Alan Hurst, would probably leave no stone unturned while submitting his report to the International Cricket Council. India better prepare itself to face some uneven bounce from the ICC, when an umpire may not be around to hear its appeal.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Asis Narayan Biswas, Durgapur

                
	Sir  Arun Jaitley should have resigned from the post of the president of the DDCA after the embarrassing episode at Ferozeshah Kotla recently. However, it is well known that politicians are generally above feeling shame, and prefer to stick to the posts held by them. It is unfortunate that Indias already preoccupied politicians should feel the need to control national and state-level cricket, even when many of them might not have even elementary knowledge of the game.          
	Cricket has become an issue of national prestige. The Union sports ministry should not remain a mute spectator to malpractices in super-rich cricketing bodies. The Centre should formulate strict guidelines so that only retired cricketers, having the time to devote to cricket, may be inducted into such governing bodies. Steps should be taken to end financial mismanagement and the distribution of complimentary passes, which are often sold later.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

                
	Sir  It is odd that veterans like Chetan Chauhan and Daljit Singh, who were responsible for the pitch at Ferozeshah Kotla, could have allowed the match to proceed on such a pitch. Even the match referee, umpires and captains must have inspected the pitch at the start, but nobody suspected anything seriously wrong. It was astonishing that the pitch was found to be too dangerous only in the 24th over.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

                
	Sir  Although India deserves praise for winning the ODI series against Sri Lanka, the power failure at Eden Gardens and the pitch at Kotla have brought more shame than glory. Some political parties are using these instances to accuse one another. These incidents have cast a shadow of uncertainty over Indias prospect of hosting the World Cup in 2011. India should be more vigilant, and punish those who are responsible for playing with its honour.           
	Yours faithfully,       
Anindya Bhattacharya, Calcutta

	Driving home: An American scrapbook By Jonathan Raban, Picador, Rs 820              
	Jonathan Raban is a great admirer of William Empson  a scientist who took to writing  for the latters interest in what Raban calls the subaquatic life of literature. In this enjoyable collection of articles, written over two decades, that offers reliable insights into the Pacific Northwests ever changing social, political and cultural milieu, Raban provides compelling evidence that he is as gifted as the man he admires. Despite its intimidating size, readers will cherish Rabans book of essays for it brings to light significant truths that lie concealed within the fabric of American society.        
	Take, for instance, Rabans reconstruction of the political events immediately after the horror of 9/11 in Indian Country. Developing on Susan Faludis central idea in The Terror Dream, Raban argues that Americas return to neo-conservatism can be explained by the countrys waking up to its oldest, darkest, and most enduring folk memory: that of a sudden attack by native Indians. The attempt to look at the transformation in American minds by borrowing indigenous cultural indices is certainly impressive.         
	While excavating uncomfortable truths, Raban seldom appears dull or preachy. His acerbic humour livens up his prose without mitigating the seriousness of the issues he addresses. Writing on the Obama-Clinton tussle for the American presidentship, Raban quips that in contrast to Obama, the mercurial Hillary wields the domestic metaphor of the broom. After the damage wrought by the Bush years, Hillary recognized that there was an urgent need to fix things. But the damage, Hillary seemed to suggest in the course of her presidential campaign, was superficial and not structural. Raban chuckles at Clintons naivety, and it is difficult to disagree.        
	Apart from politics, Rabans other great concern is environmental degradation. The depleted stock of steelheads in the river (Raban, by his own admission, looks at things in angling terms), the miles of razored forest, or the farcical clash between the Neah Bay Indians and their opponents over a whale hunt are all indicators of the fact that Americas once-plentiful natural wealth has been cruelly depleted. But, here too, Raban offers a caveat. Environmental activism has its own pitfalls. In America, the campaign to replenish nature, although perfectly justified, offers very little space to marginalized communities such as those of loggers, farmers and timber merchants, whose traditional lifestyles and occupations have been threatened by this landscaping in reverse. Raban also points out that the 2004 general elections were as much about Iraq, healthcare, terrorism, gun control, abortion as about the peoples right to land and natural resources.         
	There is a bleakness that laces the lives of many of the characters we meet in the course of Rabans journeys. Most of them, like Raban himself, are battling alienation and loneliness. There is the bartender in Walla Walla who drowns his misery in small talk; the Schmidts at Forks who reminisce about lost birds and animals; then there are the Wollastons. Raban delves into Percy Wollastons memoir to show how a community was doomed after being lured by the devious State to farm an inhospitable tract on the Montana Prairie. The author is equally unrelenting when he exposes how the State failed, yet again, to alleviate the sufferings of the people when the Mississippi burst its banks. Mississippi Water  an engaging piece of reportage  chronicles all that Raban saw as he journeyed along the raging rivers shores.        
	Rabans narrative does not follow a linear structure, but the sudden shifts in time and place do not disturb its rhythm. He stitches together the past and the present seamlessly, as he enlightens readers about the Lewis-Clarke expedition in the fall of 1805, or the endeavour of George Vancouver who, while exploring the Pacific Coast, had complained bitterly about its unceasing dullness.        
	There are brief interludes where Rabans tone is more personal. During these moments of candour, we discover Raban pondering questions that surround the philosophy of travel. The world is littered with travellers who asked one question too many, got a satisfactory answer, and never went home again. Those who think that travel is always about returning to the place of origin should perhaps pause and reflect on the wisdom of these lines. At other times, Raban records the melancholic beauty of the Pacific waves crashing on Oregons shores. Elsewhere, he appears bemused by the contradiction that while the ocean is a wilderness, beyond the reach of the customs of the land, the occupant of a boat remains a citizen, answerable to the conventions of society.         
	Raban, an Englishman, chose to make Seattle his home at the age of 47. At times, he appears to have mastered his feelings of not belonging. But, inevitably, the demons return, complicating his relationship with his adopted city. He is dismissive of Seattles social life (predictably threadbare), heaps scorn on some of its inhabitants (the Microsoft millionaires) and yet remains enchanted by his own estrangement. This is most evident in Julias City where Raban is unsettled by the discovery that Seattle  a city of newcomers, which, at times, appears as welcoming as distant lights in the gloom  has opened itself up to his daughter but has left him knocking on its doors.        
	Those who have journeyed and attempted to drop anchor elsewhere will understand Rabans feelings better. For despite the great distances that emigrants try and put between themselves and their roots, they carry in them all that cannot be left behind.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Promises to keep                  
	Sir  The results of the assembly elections in Bihar have proved that honest and efficient governance is valued more than empty rhetoric (Thank you, PM; No thanks, Centre, Nov 25). This is evident from the paltry number of seats the Congress has managed to secure. It has failed to win the confidence of the people of Bihar. The state is geared towards development now, and religion and caste have taken a backseat.          
	The chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, and his party, the Janata Dal (United), have brought about a lot of changes in Bihar. During Kumars previous tenure in office, roads were rebuilt and long-delayed projects were completed. He revived the education system of Bihar by heavily increasing the number of schoolteachers. He ensured that doctors were always present at healthcare centres and the right medicines were available. Most important, he galvanized the process of delivery of justice by cracking down on politically-backed criminals. Instead of blaming other people for the troubles of Bihar, Kumar himself undertook the responsibility of solving those problems.          
	In a few months, West Bengal will go to the polls. Industrial growth has slowed down pitiably in our state. One hopes that Bengal will follow the example set by Bihar. It must vote for progress and good leadership, leaving no room for political parties to break their promises.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Chandan K. Bhattacharjee, Mumbai

                
	Sir  It is Nitish Kumars inclusive approach to governance and not the sectarian stand of the Bharatiya Janata Party that led to the landslide victory of the BJP-JD(U) combine in Bihar (Hoping game, Nov 25). Once associated with lawlessness, Bihar has now voted for a leader who has not only promised progress, but has also delivered it. Kumar disregarded divisions of caste, creed and class. Moreover, he was successful in keeping Narendra Modi out of the BJPs election campaigns in Bihar. This gave the BJPs religious bigotry a wide berth, thus winning Kumar the confidence of the minority communities. Lalu Prasad did not have the courtesy to accept his defeat with dignity. Kumar, however, reacted to his victory in a pragmatic and humble manner. His government has pulled Bihar out of the doldrums.          
	This spectacular victory is similar to the Left Fronts triumph in the 2006 assembly polls in Bengal. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tried hard to industrialize Bengal. He brought investors to the state and denounced his partys archaic rhetoric on class and capital. But he was unsuccessful. If the Trinamul Congress comes to power in the 2011 polls, it should pay heed to the outcome of the Bihar polls, and know that there is no substitute for good governance.          
	Yours faithfully,        Ranesh Dey, Melbourne, Australia            
	Sir  The BJP was aware of Nitish Kumars popularity with the people of Bihar. So it compromised on its stand in order to form a successful alliance with him. The best aspect of the election results is the defeat of the Congress. Rahul Gandhi is too inexperienced to deliver all that his party promises to the people. Another favourable outcome is the defeat of Lalu Prasad, during whose reign booth-capturing was a common practice.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
S.S. Almal, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Now that the Congress has suffered a crushing defeat in the Bihar assembly polls, it is blaming the partys local leadership for the poor performance. Had the Congress won a large number of seats, all the praise would have been heaped on Rahul Gandhi. The Congress is known for taking minimal action against corrupt persons in the party even when there are strong allegations against them. These people are just removed from office. No attempt is made to recover the looted money.          
	Yours faithfully,      
N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta

                
	Sir  Never before has a political alliance secured such a huge number of seats in Bihar. The development that the state experienced when the National Democratic Alliance was in power led to the victory of the JD(U)-BJP combine in the recent assembly polls. The gleaming highways and roads are the new prides of Bihar. Girls going to school on bicycles have become a common sight. But the biggest achievement yet is the reformed state of law and order in Bihar. The people of Bihar had not witnessed development on this scale when the Rashtriya Janata Dal was in power. Caste-based rule has been rejected in favour of progress in Bihar.                    
	Yours faithfully,        Sanjeeb Kumar Sahoo,Dhenkanal, Orissa            
	Sir  The assembly polls in Bihar have shown that people will accept nothing less than good governance. Bihar still has a long way to go, but the state government has encouraged the setting up of small and medium-scale industries. The truth is that the Nitish Kumar government has capitalized on its secular image in order to garner votes. However, it cannot afford to become complacent, for the people will expect it to fulfil the promises it has made.          
	Yours faithfully,         Jayanta Datta, Chinsurah, Hooghly

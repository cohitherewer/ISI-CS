The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | That liberal hour 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THAT LIBERAL HOUR                           - Economic planning began with the dreams of a young India        CUTTING CORNERS -   ASHOK MITRA                                                        
	Once one reaches a certain age, deaths of even very close friends cease to cause much of a convulsion. Perhaps a defence mechanism is at work: the mind has a limited absorptive capacity; it can take in this much of sad tidings, and nothing beyond. Besides, K.N. Raj was a far gone Alzheimers case for the past few years. It was an excruciatingly painful experience to watch him suffer. His death a couple of months ago  why pretend otherwise?  was deliverance.        
	And yet, there is no bar to surfing in a flurry of memories, many taking one back a full five-and-a-half decades and even a bit more. Raj had created history by becoming full professor in the Delhi School of Economics while still in his twenties. It was a proud moment for young academics and their friends. The realization struck them like lightning: they had arrived, they had arrived and gained social reckoning, henceforth they were going to have a role in determining how newly liberated India was to be moulded. All honour and respect were due to the older generation, whose advice and counsel were worth their weight in gold, but a proper hearing had to be accorded to what the youngsters had to say. The young crowd admittedly had not gone through the rigours of the freedom struggle, they were without the wisdom which being around for some while endowed. Was not their freshness itself, though, an immense asset? Because they were young, their minds had not got frozen; they possessed antennae that were extraordinarily sensitive to the new vibrations that kept the world a-trembling. Some of the young academics were in foreign universities during the Second World War and in the years immediately following and had the opportunity to observe directly the sequence of confusion, stampede, destruction and creativity which constituted contemporary history. They knew as much of the New Deal in the United States of America as of the Stakhanovites in the Soviet Union.              
	This young lot had arrived in the nations capital from different parts of the country. They were bubbling over with both ideas and enthusiasm and could not wait to see action. New Delhi was where the constituent assembly was in session. It was where Jawaharlal Nehru was all the time expatiating on the mystique of planned development which would transform India. It was the seat, too, of the newly established Planning Commission which was the deus ex machina for giving concrete shape to the nations aspirations to build a just, prosperous, secular society. Raj had joined the Commission the day it opened its portals and had put together, along with J.J. Anjaria, most of the First Five Year Plan document. None was more conscious than he and his colleagues of the modesty, often bordering on timidity, underlying the First Plan. Of this bunch of young people who congregated in New Delhi, some were in government, some were in the university, a few were with private corporate entities. They came together by happenstance, perhaps because they were all billeted in the same hostelry. They were outwardly irreverent, full of doubts and questionings; none could still accuse them of taking leave of their manners. Their irrepressible hilarity would often skirt dangerously the outer fringe of lightheartedness, but, deep down they felt an enduring passion for the country they belonged to. The nation, they firmly believed, was capable of doing a lot better than what the First Plan promised. Nehru was the accepted godfather; he would continue to be enshrined where he was: the young cubs were ready, if not to take over the mantle from his shoulders, then to be on his side even as he held out the promise of a breathtaking tryst with the future. True, the youngsters tucked into themselves political ideologies that were not identical, but that did not prevent them from taking a common and united pledge to strive, jointly and severally, for a bolder initiative in the nations development efforts.        
	Rajs friends were proud of his key role in the preparation of the First Five Year Plan. His entry into the Delhi School of Economics was occasion for more cheering. Youth had gatecrashed into the sanctum of the establishment, now things were bound to change. The young ones had, in fact, begun to infiltrate into the citadels of power at different strategic points. One amongst them was the first Indian to be appointed director of armament supplies in the post-independent national navy. That too called for celebration. Further excitement was soon to follow. There was that distinguished body attached to the Planning Commission, a nominated collage of senior dons, known as the Panel of Economists. Most members of the Panel were well past fifty, some of them were even more ancient, hoary octogenarians. Revolution knocked at the door; K.N. Raj, then barely thirty-one, was nominated to the Panel. When it assembled to discuss P.C. Mahalanobiss draft outline of the Second Five Year Plan, Rajs sheer brilliance  and the lucidity of the arguments he deployed to espouse its virtues  both bewitched and flabbergasted the old hegemony.        
	The season was one of expansive liberalism, and one which was not confined merely to the admittance of the young flock into the concourse of elders. The liberal spirit infected the portentous chambers of decision-makers too. Take, for instance, Mahalanobiss Plan model. Contrary to the image painted later by the free enterprise fetishists, Mahalanobis wore no horns, he had impeccable Cambridge credentials. While acutely aware of the art of the possible, he was still firm in his belief that enough was enough, the colonial sloth would no longer do. The growth model he offered was a watered-down version of the original Feldman model the Soviet authorities had toyed with in the late 1920s in their endeavour to speed up self-reliance and economic growth. Mahalanobis reworked the model to accommodate issues germane to the Indian realities of mass unemployment and a decentralized economic structure. The conditions on the ground called for a balance between emphasis on investment in heavy industry and the necessity to innovate with labour-absorbing, employment-creating activities.        
	The Planning Commission was then no sheeps opera as it has become today. It consisted of men of stature with minds of their own. The incumbent finance minister, the seasoned civil servant from British days, Chintaman Deshmukh, who was an ex officio member of the Commission, came to scoff, but was so bowled over by the rationale of the proposed new Plan model and its internal consistency that he even agreed to be president of Mahalanobiss foster child, the Indian Statistical Institute. Many of the ruling politicians were of the persuasion of Fabian socialism; quite a few represented the interests of landed gentry and private industry. The countrys resource endowment, they, however, all agreed, warranted a vigorous strategy of self-reliant growth that the Second Plan embodied. The young crowd Raj belonged to spearheaded this drive for a national consensus on faster growth. Just as Raj corralled the Panel of Economists, others set to work within the government and industry as well as the media. About everybody who mattered became a believer in economic planning at that juncture. Tolerance, too, for other points of view was, however, not lacking. Amongst the 20-odd members of the Panel of Economists, one eminence held out and wrote a note of dissent. It was circulated, under official auspices, as extensively as the recommendations of the Panel as a body.              
	Liberalism also implied communion between home and the world. India, so to say, kept open house. Cognoscenti from all over the world were invited to come and offer their comments on Indias new Plan model. Those who came were from different continents and different ideological alcoves. One or two conventional planners from the Soviet Union were juxtaposed with such mavericks as Michal Kalecki and Oskar Lange from Poland. If Joan Robinson and Nicky Kaldor arrived from Cambridge, the invitation went out to Milton Friedman at Chicago as well. Paul Baran, the rigid Marxist from rather unlikely Stanford, found himself in the company of the New Deal zealot often lapsing into cynicism, John Kenneth Galbraith. The effusive Swede, Gunnar Myrdal sat next to the saintly Jan Tinbergen from the Netherlands and, what do you know, the inscrutable Ragnar Frisch from Norway too was there to offer suggestions. Humility was in the air. Politicians and decisionmakers were keen to know the views of the respected foreign scholars on what the nation was embarking upon.        
	Behind the scene, the junior-most member of the Panel of Economists had a great deal to do with arranging these visits and the continuous exchange of views and counter-views. It was Indias greatest liberal hour. K.N. Raj contributed in a major way to the making of that hour; he was also one of its finest products.

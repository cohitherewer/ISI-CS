	The United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, has called for an end to the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip. Britain, France, Germany and Russia have done the same. After Israeli commandos killed nine peace activists recently aboard a ship that was trying to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza, even the secretary of State of the United States of America, Hillary Clinton, called the blockade unsustainable and unacceptable. How can it be ended?        
	The atrocious attack on the aid ship has put the Israeli policy of blocking supplies to the Gaza Strip in the spotlight and raises two questions. Does it really give Israel added security at a reasonable cost to Palestinians? And if it is doesnt, then how can it be ended?        
	The blockade of Gaza began in 2007, after the Hamas, which does not recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli State, won a brief civil war and took control of the densely populated territory. It launched thousands of crude, home-made rockets against towns in southern Israel, killing 10 Israelis. So in early 2009, Israel attacked the Gaza Strip.        
	At least 1,300 Palestinians died, and only 13 Israelis. Since then, the Hamas has observed a ceasefire. Other Palestinian militants still launch sporadic rocket attacks from the Gaza Strip, but only one person in Israel has been killed in the past 18 months. Yet the blockade continues unabated.        
	Only one-quarter of the normal volume of supplies makes it through the sole Israeli checkpoint. The 1.5 million people in the Strip have been reduced to abject poverty, and Israel seems determined to keep up the pressure until the people reject the Hamas (which they backed in free elections in 2007) and overthrow it. Just how they are to do that, however, is not clear.        
	Israel has the right to prevent weapons from entering the Gaza Strip, but it is hard to see how cement, macaroni, footballs, tomato paste and fruit juices (all banned) fit that description. In any case, the material to make the rockets has always come in through tunnels under the frontier with Egypt, and is unaffected by Israels blockade.                
	Tactical change        
	The blockade is simply collective punishment, which is illegal under international law. It has not overthrown Hamas, but instead has strengthened its control over the population. It should be ended, but how?        
	The Israeli government is now on the defensive on this issue, and a cheap and effective tactic would be to send an aid ship or flotilla every week or so. The cargo should be inspected and certified as weapons-free by the port authorities in Greece, Italy, France or wherever they sail from.        
	The blockade-runners should not agree to go to an Israeli port, because then their cargo would fall victim to Israels blockade rules. (Almost all of the aid ships 10,000 tonnes of cargo was construction materials, and would have been blocked by the Israelis.) The ships should not surrender at the first challenge, but should sail on towards Gaza and compel the Israelis to conduct hostile boarding operations against them.        
	The crews should not physically resist the Israeli troops, but some of them would probably be hurt. Would some be killed? Possibly, though Israel will try to avoid another public relations disaster. Might they end up serving jail sentences in Israel? Maybe, if Benjamin Netanyahus government is in a particularly self-destructive mood.        
	Volunteers can easily be found for these aid missions, and so can the money to pay for them. Carry out one operation a week for the next couple of months, and the blockade would almost certainly crumble. Netanyahus government would either change its policy or fall. Either outcome would be greeted with pleasure in almost every capital of the world, including Washington.

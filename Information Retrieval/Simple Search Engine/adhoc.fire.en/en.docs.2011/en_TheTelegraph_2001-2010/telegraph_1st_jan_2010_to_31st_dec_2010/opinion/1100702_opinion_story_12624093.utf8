	The gentleman is a member of the Union cabinet holding a major portfolio. He is said to be next in importance to, and sometimes even more effective than, the prime minister. And yet, he has the other day gone on record: it is indeed regrettable that, inflation in the prices of food items has not stopped, and has actually crossed 17 per cent; but not to worry, should the monsoon be good, food prices are bound to come down.         
	Not one word on measures that could be deployed to restrain prices and provide some relief to the poorer sections. The government is for all practical purposes washing its hands of the matter; why, it is up to the rain god whether prices will subside. The Indian economy is thus being returned to the era of the gamble of the monsoon. The authorities have contributed, with craft and care, towards ensuring this journey back to antiquity. Public investment in agriculture has been scrupulously neglected over the past two decades. Hardly any significant irrigation or land reclamation projects have taken place under Central auspices. The output of foodgrains, alongside that of other crops, has therefore advanced at a rate less than that of the rate of population growth. The state of what is called food security has accordingly become more and more perilous. As if determined to aggravate further the misery of the poor, the government has joyfully proceeded to sabotage the public distribution system which had been providing some relief to vulnerable sections. The instruments of economic policy that can discipline prices have been kept in abeyance. Even in the current year, when food prices have continued to shoot ominously upwards, there is no proposal to adjust fiscal or monetary policy to curb speculation and hoarding of essential commodities.         
	The rule of the free market is absolute. Big traders, who, like all other rich specimens, are taxed lightly, can borrow from the banks at low rates. They can thereby cover the cost of carrying stocks and merrily jack up prices. Ruling politicians benignly watch the proceedings. They are not bothered, for the backbone of democratic resistance to the perpetration of such outrages has been broken by the series of developments following economic liberalization: the ebbing away of trade union strength, the agrarian crisis, which, while failing to mobilize distressed peasantry widely dispersed over different regions of the country, has splintered them further along caste lines, and, finally, the succumbing of some segments of the middle class to the mirage of economic gains globalization will supposedly offer. Even though suffering on account of rising prices is widespread and leads to anguish and anger, there is no collective explosion of that anger. Men and women grumble; that is about all. They at most turn philosophical and murmur in the manner of a subdued Doris Day: Whatever will be, will be.        
	Coming down, as the clich goes, to brass tacks, ministers are not displeased with galloping prices. It helps their class cause; traders and hoarders are on their side of the class divide. If the ambience is such that their class friends are enabled to make some extra money, that should be occasion for quiet celebration and not concern. Besides, elections to the Lok Sabha are far away. Once that season is imminent, some sops might be offered to the poor and starving. Meanwhile, why not allow the noble doings of the free market to add to the prosperity of those near and dear to the ministers? Something more is in fact on the anvil to benefit the traders and middlemen at the expense of the poor. A proposal has been sponsored by no less than the dynasty presiding over the ruling party that programmes, such as the national rural employment guarantee scheme that had been alleviating somewhat the economic distress in the countryside, should be transferred to the care of private contractors.         
	Ministers need not, and do not, feel guilty for their could-not-care-less stance. They are political animals. Politics is essentially about seizure of power. The capture of power, though, is not like occupying an empty box. Those who come to power acquire authority over administration and authority over resources at the disposal of the State. Being in government also entitles them to decide how, in what manner and from whom these resources are to be collected as well as how, in what manner and for whose benefit these resources are to be spent. Politicians will naturally avail of these diverse sources of authority to advance the cause of the class or group they belong to. They will use authority to ensure the accrual of more income and wealth to their own fraternity at the expense of their class adversaries. The diverse instruments of economic policy  administrative, fiscal and monetary  will be applied  or not applied  with the same objective in mind. This is economics reduced to its basics. Economics has no corpus apart from what the political infrastructure provides it with. Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov summed it up so succinctly nearly a century ago: economics is distilled politics.         
	Which is why it is difficult to suppress amusement at the spectacle of economists, distinguished economists who have achieved much academic distinction in their earlier career, entering the portals of administration fired by the ambition to enrich the governments economic policy by their particular wisdom. They  at least some of them  nurse illusions about miracles that the spellbinding quality of their inputs will usher in into the arena of economic policy. Such illusions will get dissipated in no time. Politicians whom they agree to advise know the nitty-gritty of economics much more than these academicians: economics is to serve the class cause, period. What academicians joining government can at most do is to supply politicians with clever-clever arguments on behalf of policies supportive of the class cause. Politicians have already finalized their decisions on what to do and what not. Economists, especially those with outstanding scholastic achievements, are no doubt a very smart lot. Their sophistication and the manner in which it manifests itself can charm bystanders. One or two ministers welcome the imprimatur of such sophistication on their public pronouncements; it contributes to glamour. That apart, ministers are seasoned practitioners of public relations; they lend, or pretend to lend, an ear to the outpouring of highfalutin theoretical constructs presented by serving economists. When final formal decisions are to be taken, politics, however, is in command. A few of the more evangelical-minded economists may go to great lengths to try and convince the minister that a devastating catastrophe could well occur if their point of view does not find official acceptance. If that point of view cuts athwart the political interests of ministers, the economists would be told off; there are so many ways of being told off. Economists will then have the option to either walk out, or remain. In case they choose to stay back, they will be reduced to the status of glorified speech-writers. They usually write elegant prose and succeed in putting across thoughts the ministers would like to put across much more precisely than many others are capable of. Some economists, more foolhardy than the rest, might sometimes try to smuggle in one or two of his own ideas into the text of the ministers speech which do not quite tally with those held by the minister. He will be duly found out and shown the door.               
	The old order does not  cannot  change. Politicians will proceed along lines defined by their class position. Economists who enter government with grand notions of remoulding official economic policy in their own image, will soon know their bearings. They, of course, have their uses. They are like saintly scholars who adorned royal courts in ancient times. They will at most dot the is and cross the ts of ministerial views. Soon a time will come when even such economists, recruited from outside and with the reputation of fiercely independent minds, will begin to echo the ministers: everything is fine and excellent with the economy and prices will decline once the weather god is in the right mood. They may initially feel uncomfortable when fielding queries: why, in that case, is there any need at all for the huge paraphernalia of economic and statistical expertise the government has come to accumulate? Smart people, they will recover quickly, and put out brilliant notes justifying the opening of more and more economic research cells within the premises of the government to study, econometrically or otherwise, particular facets of the working of the with-every-day-growing-more-complex economic system. Meanwhile, with the latest decision to jack up fuel prices, food inflation is likely to cross 20 per cent and beyond. The government will do nothing, politics will remain in command.

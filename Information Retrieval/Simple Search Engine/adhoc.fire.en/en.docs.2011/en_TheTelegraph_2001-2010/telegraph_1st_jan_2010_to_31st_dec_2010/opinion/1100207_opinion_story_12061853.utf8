                                                                                                                         5                                                                                      Letters to Editor
                
	Real hero                  
	Sir  Shah Rukh Khan must be complimented for standing up to the bullying by the Shiv Sena (Conciliatory but consistent, Feb 4). The Sena has unleashed a violent hate campaign against the actor for his so-called unpatriotic act of backing the inclusion of Pakistani players in the Indian Premier League. Earlier, Karan Johar had succumbed to similar threats from the Sena, but Khan stood his ground, and politely asked the Shiv Sena to mind its own business. One hopes more people from the film industry will show such courage.          
	Yours faithfully,

	In poor taste          
	Sir  The Indian high commission in Britain has done the right thing by protesting against the negative portrayal of Mumbai by Kevin McCloud in his documentary on the slums in Dharavi (Poverty porn slur on UK TV producer, Jan 26). Similar protests should have been lodged after Calcutta was shown in a poor light time and again.          
	Calcutta has become some sort of a pilgrimage on the poverty map. People from across the world visit the city to look at the dirt and squalor that are supposed to exist there. The extent of Calcuttas poverty has clearly been blown out of proportion. Even when a celebrity visits the city for some other reason, the international media give prominence to his or her visit to the slums or Mother Teresas Home.          
	I have watched one episode of McClouds documentary. Although extreme poverty has been shown, the poor people have been depicted as self-reliant and dignified. In contrast, whenever Calcuttas poor are shown on a documentary or television programme, they are projected as helpless and solely dependent on Western charity.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The news report on Kevin McClouds documentary on Dharavi raises valid points. But it ignores a critical question: why do Indian authorities and citizens keep quiet when Calcutta is maligned in a similar manner. Calcuttas prospects in tourism and industrialization have been damaged by this continuous slander. Its image as a poor city is now firmly ingrained in the collective psyche. It seems that Indians are too afraid to address the reasons behind the misrepresentation of a lovely city.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Lower the volume          
	Sir  These days, young people play loud music on their mobiles and watch films on their laptops in public places. This is turning out to be the biggest public nuisance after smoking. On a recent train journey, I had the misfortune of travelling with some young people in an air-conditioned coach. Imagine my horror when three of them started watching movies on their laptops with the volume turned up. I was also greatly disappointed to find that two of them were a newly-married couple but they seemed to have little interest in each other, preferring instead to soak in what was being shown on their laptops.           
	I remember my younger days when the railways used to put up warnings not to play transistors on trains so as not to disturb other passengers. Hopefully, the railway authorities will start thinking of pasting warnings on train compartments like they used to in the past. Only this time, passengers will be warned against using laptops and cell phones without headphones. This way, the interests of older passengers like us who have no inclination for the public display of films would be greatly served.                     
	Yours faithfully,

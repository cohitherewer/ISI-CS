	Mysterious circumstances                  
	Sir  It is high time the government of Orissa took steps to investigate the recent deaths of elephants in the forests near Telkoi and Keonjhar. Every month a couple of elephants die under mysterious circumstances here. The forest department suspects it to be the work of poachers and just keeps mum. Its a shame that poachers manage to infiltrate the forests and kill the elephants regularly despite the presence of guards, who are meant to protect these animals. Perhaps poachers are even helped in their task by the protectors.           
	Yours faithfully,        Samhati Mohapatra, Dhenkanal, Orissa 
        
	Bailed out          
	Sir  I must say that justice granted by Indian courts often seems dubious, especially in cases concerning women. It is disheartening to know that after 20 years of a pitched battle in court between the former Haryana police chief, S.P.S. Rathore, and the family of Ruchika Girhotra, who committed suicide after allegedly being molested by Rathore, the Supreme Court has granted bail to the latter (Bail for Rathore, Nov 12). A person apparently responsible for the death of a schoolgirl is freed after merely six months in jail. The Ruchika Girhotra case shows that the common man, without money or power, can never hope to be treated fairly. If this is so, then our country has failed to uphold the dignity of its citizens. My faith in the Indian judiciary waned after Rathore was freed.                     
	Yours faithfully,      
Nasreen Ghani, Dhenkanal, Orissa

                
	Sir  The release of S.P.S. Rathore on bail is demoralizing. It is surprising that big shots get away with everything by the strength of the power they wield while the helpless ordinary citizen has to face the music even in petty cases. The apex court accepted Rathores bail plea on the basis of the closure reports filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation. After all the strong evidence in support of the charges against Rathore, how could the investigative agency suddenly infer that there are no sufficient grounds on the basis of which the case against the delinquent cop could be continued? Would an ordinary citizen involved in a similar case get away so easily? We have seen several instances where criminals with political clout have escaped the long arm of the law. The Todis, for example, in the Rizwanur Rahman case, hoodwinked the law-enforcement agencies with their money power. Strange indeed are our legal methods. People who go about killing innocents  like some of the murderers of Graham Steins and his two sons  go scot free, the Godhra butchers are still unpunished, and there are political leaders with dubious track records who roam about with their heads held high. Should not our legal and political systems be cleaned of the muck?          
	Yours faithfully,       
S. Ram, Pune 

                
	Sir  It is not unusual for the CBI to change its stance at various stages of a case. By closing two fresh cases filed by Ruchika Girhotras family against S.P.S. Rathore, the CBI paved the way for the latters bail. Yet, the same agency had strongly argued against Rathore in the high courts of Punjab and Haryana. The CBI should have provided a copy of its closure reports to the family members of the victim days before the case was to be heard by the Supreme Court. That would have given Ruchikas family the opportunity to properly study the reports and prepare arguments against them.                     
	Yours faithfully,

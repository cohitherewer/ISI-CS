	Q:I have three shops on the ground floor of a building. A tenant on the ground floor of the adjacent building has a sweetmeat shop there. He has no trade licence or clearance from the police, fire brigade or the pollution control board. As his neighbour I suffer the most from the smoke that comes out of the shop. It is also a fire hazard. What should I do?        
	Sunil Kumar Ray, Calcutta                
	A: As per the provisions of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1980, no person is permitted to use his or her premises without a licence granted by the municipal commissioner for any purpose which in the opinion of the corporation is dangerous to life, health or property or is likely to create a nuisance. Hence, you could lodge a complaint with the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) against the tenant as well as the landlord.         
	Q: Some of the flat owners in our building want to construct a toilet on the roof. We have already got the completion certificate from the KMC and mutations are over too. Will the structure be legal?         
	Name withheld                
	A: Since you have already got the completion certificate and the mutation is done too, you cannot erect any structure on the building without the prior sanction of the municipal commissioner. You would have to give a written notice to him of your intention along with the necessary documents in accordance with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1980, and the CMC Building Rules, 1990.              
	Q:My father died intestate in March 1955. He was survived by his wife, three sons and four unmarried daughters. Will the daughters have any right to their fathers property?        
	Sekhar Datta, Calcutta                
	A: Succession laws related to Hindus were codified in 1956  now known as the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Before the act came into force, female heirs to a male had only a limited interest in the property. They could enjoy the property but had no right to transfer it. The Hindu Succession Act, though prospective, has a restrospective element in Section 14 (1) which makes a female Hindu the full owner of a property in her possession, irrespective of whether she acquired it before or after the commencement of the act. In your case too the female heirs will have similar rights to inheritance.

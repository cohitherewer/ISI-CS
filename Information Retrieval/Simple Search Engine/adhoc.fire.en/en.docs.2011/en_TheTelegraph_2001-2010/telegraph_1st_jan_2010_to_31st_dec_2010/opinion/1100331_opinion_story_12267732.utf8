	Food for none                  
	Sir  Ashok Mitra has decried the free market in his article, On sin and godliness (March 26). He has argued that the market is saturated with the presence of monopolists and oligopolists, who increase their profits by controlling the output. But how many items of daily use that we buy are manufactured by the so-called monopolists and oligopolists? For almost every item, there is a handful of manufacturers vying with one another for a share of the market. There may be an odd item whose producer has a monopoly in the market, but one cannot think of too many industries where there is no competition at all. So Mitras opinion, that it is the monopolists practice of restricted production which leads to price rise, is flawed. It must be remembered that no monopolist or oligopolist does business in foodgrains, yet food prices go up. The author is perhaps aware that the hoarding of foodgrains is not the cause, but the effect, of shortage. Moreover, since anti-hoarding law has been created by the State, why do Left-ruled states such as West Bengal succumb to the designs of blackmarketeers, who are anti-poor?          
	Mitra has lamented about the inaction of the State when it comes to controlling price rise, but he has failed to see that many a state government gives rice and wheat to the poor at two or three rupees a kilogram. This is why we have not seen widespread starvation in India as in China or North Korea, where millions of people die of hunger. Indias population has swelled considerably since Independence, and yet no major famine has visited the country. This speaks volumes about our achievement in effectively feeding the nation.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Ashok Mitras views in On sin and godliness are absolutely right. The proposal of issuing coupons to the poor instead of supplying foodgrains through the public distribution system is a sign of the failure of the latter. There are loopholes in the PDS, which falls short of meeting the peoples expectations. The system needs to be strengthened.          
	Moreover, we must enhance the storage capacity of foodgrains for successful implementation of the provisions in the Food Security Act. Unless we develop the infrastructure to support an effective PDS, the endeavour of providing food for all will not bear fruit. Several government programs have been unable to deliver the desired output because of the lack of proper organizational support. The initiative to provide food security will suffer the same fate unless this project is taken up with sincerity.                    
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  Why do we have to substitute the PDS with the coupon system? It is because we have failed to stop the misuse of, and corruption in, the PDS? At present, the best alternative seems to be to make these coupons non-transferable, and valid only for buying food. These tokens could also be turned into smart cards for easy use and access. But creating this facility will take some time.          
	In the meanwhile, food coupons could be produced at the existing fair-price shops by the customers. We must also find ways to let the owners of these shops buy grains directly from farmers. This will not only reduce the cost of food, but also curtail the role of middlemen, who bring corruption into the system.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Sir  The concept of a free market entails that buyers and sellers interact with one another without interference from the State. Absence of speculators is also a characteristic of the free market. This ensures that supplies reach the consumers without getting hoarded, and that prices are not manipulated. But who is to make sure that this system runs smoothly? If the State were to take up this duty, then its role must remain purely supervisory  that is, it should not get involved in starting or running any business enterprise, but restrict itself to keeping an eye out for speculators and hoarders in the supply chain, and weeding them out.          
	Is not the diversion of foodstuff from PDSs to the open market a fact? Are not some PDS shop-owners part of the racket of black-marketeering grains? If the administration has failed to ensure that ration shop owners deliver goods in a proper manner, what else can be expected of such a government? In that case, the government should exit from the scene. All the credit for a failed PDS goes to lousy state government officials, who seem to have consigned the concept of socialism to the dustbin. Even if free market becomes the new ideology, it too may fail because of the presence of speculators. The poor will always need food  with, or without, vouchers.                    
	Yours faithfully,

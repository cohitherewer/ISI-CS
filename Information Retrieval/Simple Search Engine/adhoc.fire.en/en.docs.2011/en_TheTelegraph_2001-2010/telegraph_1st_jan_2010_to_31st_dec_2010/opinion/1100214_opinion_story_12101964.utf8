	The problem with bullies is that one day someone will call their bluff. And those who do so may just be ordinary people out to watch a film. The Shiv Senas aggressive campaign against the film, My Name is Khan, fizzled out on the day of its release in Mumbai in the face of the enormous turnout of waiting viewers that gave hesitant theatre owners the courage to throw open the bookings. With all their high-pitched  and totally perverse  notions of nation and all their threats, Shiv Sena activists were beaten by peaceable, fun-loving people who waited around patiently till they got what they wanted.        
	This, of course, is the main story. Like all remarkable stories, this too had a number of subplots that converged upon the climax. Perhaps the least exciting but very important subplot was the fact that the state government not only declared its opposition to the Shiv Senas bullying explicitly, but also kept its word, providing protection to viewers and theatre owners, arresting troublemakers and following security procedures at every theatre. It is heartening to see a government refusing to play into the hands of regressive, violent forces. This must have been reassuring to the people, although the cheerfully defiant spirit they displayed seemed to suggest they would have gone to watch the film anyway. And it was, ultimately, not just the magic of a much-hyped Bollywood film, or the draw of an iconic film star or the desire to watch a once-successful romantic pair on screen again  all that was there, of course  that lay behind the viewers determination, but magic of a different kind. It was an unplanned but overwhelmingly concerted statement against physical coercion and political bullying, against sectarianism and provincialism, against all that tries to kill fun, art, togetherness and laughter. As if to underline this awareness, personalities from the film industry not only came out to watch the film but also spoke their mind, on the media, in blogs and on Twitter.        
	The irony of the outcome would make people wonder if the Shiv Sena knows which side it is on. Its opposition to the film sprang from Shah Rukh Khans remark that players from Pakistan should have been allowed in the Indian Premier League. Since terrorists from Pakistan were supposed to have carried out the hideous 26/11 assault on Mumbai, the Shiv Sena pilloried Mr Khan for being a lover of Pakistan, that is, against the nation. In one of those peculiar twists of circumstance, the message of the new film is that belonging to a particular community does not make someone a terrorist and that no religion teaches violence towards innocents. The Shiv Sena gave Mumbai, the victim of 26/11 and very much a part of the nation, the perfect opportunity to vindicate that message. Perhaps Bal Thackeray is a closet Shah Rukh fan?

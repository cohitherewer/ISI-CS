	Q: I purchased two cottahs of land under the Kheyadaha gram panchayat in Sonarpur and got it registered in August, 2007. I paid khajna (tax) for 2009 in my name. I thought that when I paid the khajna, the land was mutated in my name. But a middleman now tells me that it has not yet been mutated. How do I know whether the land has been mutated in my name or not?        
	Rajib Bhaumick, via email                
	A: From the facts of your case it appears that you do not possess the mutation certificate. If so, you could apply to the gram panchayat for a mutation certificate in your name. This will enable you to ascertain whether your property has been mutated or not.              
	Q:The land on which I live belongs to my deceased father and his two brothers. While my father and one brother have equal shares, the other one has a lesser share. Now the latter is trying to take every issue related to the land into his control. My mother is alive and I have a sister too. The land has not yet been divided. My questions are (a) who will get my fathers share and (b) how can I restrain my uncle?        
	Saikat Sen, Krishnanagar, West Bengal                
	A: Your fathers share as per the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, will be inherited by your mother, your sister and you equally. In order to restrain your uncle, you and the other heirs could file a civil suit for partition and injunction against him.               
	Q:I have a flat in a three-storey building. The building has three shops, one of which is an eatery. The industrial exhaust fan there runs from 6am to 11pm. The constant smell of food, loud voices of the employees of the shop and the sound emitted by the exhaust fan are proving to be a nuisance. Can the shop owner be prosecuted? He is not ready to discuss the matter with us.        
	K.J. Paul Poulose, Calcutta                
	A: Being one of the flat owners in a building which has three commercial shops, you have no choice other than to adjust to your surroundings. The eatery must have obtained a licence from the municipal corporation to carry out its business. So your objections may prove futile unless you get the support of the other flat owners.

                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        ONION SOUP                                                    
	Prices of onions have risen to a point where the impact risks causing the demise of this government. In the last 30 years of Indian politics, onion prices have often played a critical role in the fortunes of the main political parties. In 1980, Indira Gandhis Congress used the jump in the price of onions to oust a Left-leaning government in New Delhi. The Bharatiya Janata Party is said to have lost the New Delhi state elections in 1998 for similar reasons. In various states from Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu, sudden price increases have shaken incumbent governments to the core. In Delhis case, the city consumes between 2,000 and 3,000 tonnes a day; supply has dwindled to 800 tonnes a day now. The story in cities from Bangalore to Mumbai is similar to Delhis. An essential commodity in household budgets, some politicians are now suggesting that its price be controlled by something like the Essential Commodities Act. That would be a bad idea; the solution lies in rectifying past policy gaps and, more important, seeing it for what it is: a symbol of food-price inflation driven by supply constraints that can no longer be ignored.        
	India is the second largest onion producer in the whole world, though the bulk of the production is consumed domestically. As incomes have risen across the country, they have changed food consumption patterns: fruits like grapes, once the preference of the middle classes that could afford them, are now consumed by more people from the lower middle class. That new and additional demand is shifting agricultural production from staples like onions to the more expensive and greater cash-generating crops like sugarcane and grapes. Imposing heavy export duties, as the government has just done, is no solution. It just postpones consideration of the problem, which is dramatically increasing investments in agriculture and building the infrastructure that will support a supply chain, including cold storage and food processing capability. Allowing foreign investment that would bring the expertise of global leaders like Wal-Mart and Carrefour might not be a bad idea either. It is part of the long-term reform plan of both major political parties. While the price increases have been partly reversed in the short term, the government should spend some serious political capital (meaning its talent) in addressing supply-driven food-price inflation  before it all ends in tears.

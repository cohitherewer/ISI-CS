	Until it was flattened by a massive earthquake last month, Haiti was best known as the poorest neighbour of the worlds richest country. Since its devastation, it has not only become the centre of attention in the global media but also inspired a wave of piety across the world. (Even the Senegalese president made a sensational offer of voluntary repatriation to Haitians whose ancestors were displaced from West Africa in the heyday of the slave trade.) Of course, the United States of America was the first to jump into the fray. Scores of US welfare organizations suddenly woke up to the inhuman realities that have afflicted this next-door nation for years. Relief workers were shocked by the pathetic lack of medical facilities, hygiene and infrastructure in Haitian towns. Western observers were upset to learn that a great many children in the orphanages are not actually orphans: they have simply been dumped there by their parents, who are unable to care for them. NGOs are further dismayed by the discovery that the State-run care homes are veritable dens of vice, with a record of trafficking and other forms of exploitation that are still all too common in third-world countries.        
	The situation in Haiti has thus turned out to be more complex than any that can be amended with generous financial aid. The historical ironies are too cruel. Haiti was colonized by the US in 1915, an invasion that ruined the economy of this small Caribbean nation. Since the mid-1980s, Haiti has seen a stupendous growth in its domestic drug industry. Through successive regimes and coups, the police and the drug-dealers have worked as accomplices, catering to the biggest consumer of cocaine in the world, the US. Thanks to its proximity to such a useful neighbour, drug trafficking is a billion-dollar industry in Haiti. The picture is all too familiar: ex-colonizers trying against all odds to salvage a nation they have bruised and battered in the first place. Belated do-gooding usually leads to facetious consequences, as the US is learning in Haiti at present.

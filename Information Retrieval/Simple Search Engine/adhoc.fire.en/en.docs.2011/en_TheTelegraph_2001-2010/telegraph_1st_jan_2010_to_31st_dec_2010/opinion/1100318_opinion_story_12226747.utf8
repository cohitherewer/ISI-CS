	Each time a school boy or girl commits suicide, there is a hush for a while followed by a buzz that lasts longer. Each time we are awash with an overwhelming sense of guilt along with feelings of shock and grief, and then, invariably, anger. Today we are trying to cope with a startling new social phenomenon of young people choosing death over life at a time when life has barely begun for them.        
	The statistics in the United States of America were easily available. For each (young) person who dies by suicide (a completed suicide) there are an estimated 50 to 100 suicide attempts. When people under age eighteen are asked if they have ever seriously attempted suicide, at least one out of twenty say that they have. The figures in India, and especially in West Bengal (940 in 2008), are alarming too.        
	Psychologists and experts agree that the causes for the increasing incidence of teenage suicide are complex and are related to several factors, including genetic disposition, pressure to perform in diverse areas, lack of self-esteem and a disturbed family life. Sexual awakening and sexuality concerns further complicate matters. It is generally accepted that the cause that is usually attributed or speculated about with regard to each case of suicide  such as a scolding or a dismal examination result  is in fact just the trigger.              
	For years, educationists and mental health experts have been trying to address the issues of anxiety and stress in children, especially in relation to school work and examinations. New student-friendly examination reforms are being introduced and soon  much to the dismay of many  the concept of passing and failing may cease to exist. In spite of these efforts, the pressures on youngsters to achieve keep mounting. Young people today are required to be competent all-rounders. That is, in addition to academics, they are expected to excel or outperform others in all kinds of extra- and co-curricular activities such as sports, public speaking, dramatics, dance, music, quizzing and so on. As a result, these activities are no longer enjoyed for their own sake and can hardly serve as avenues of relaxation.        
	The sudden rise of prosperity levels and advent of a dramatic technological revolution have generated, in a disturbing manner, a whole set of social pressures and complications. It is an accepted fact that children today are growing up in the midst of images of violence if not actual violence. But these make for another long and complicated story.        
	No doubt we need to be concerned about these pressures. But associated with these is a rising phenomenon that is extremely disturbing. In the wake of reports of suicide and of children inflicting self-injury, parents are becoming dangerously diffident about disciplining their children. They are unable to be firm with their children, they openly declare, because they may go and do something drastic. Some children have confided that they take full advantage of the situation and resort to emotional blackmail to get their way. A fall-out of this is that parents are increasingly relying on school authorities to discipline their children who have become used to calling the shots at home.        
	Another parenting trend that is emerging in this confusing state of affairs is an over-protective attitude. Parents tend to rationalize and defend their childrens behaviour and are ever ready to blame a teacher for some remark that may have offended the child. Just as teachers have to be sensitive to childrens feelings, it is also important for children to learn to be emotionally stable and take criticism, praise, an occasional scolding or public applause in their stride. They must learn to accept that there will always be others who are better than them, just as there are some who are worse. It is hard, but it is imperative that parents allow their children to face disappointments and not rush to compensate in other ways. This is a sure way of damaging the learning process. It is indeed vital for every child to learn to respond to setbacks in a healthy and robust manner. In their zeal to protect their children in every way, parents end up contributing to their fragility.              
	Whenever we hear about a miserable child, a depressed child or a suicidal one, it is inevitably the school that comes under the scanner. And then comes the spate of reports and rumours about harsh teachers, dismal examination results, the fear of failure and broken friendships. Often corporal punishment meted out in school is singled out as the most significant cause of suicide. Strangely, the home front and other complexities in the childs life are completely overlooked. Sometimes one hears of terrible beatings and other forms of abuse that are suffered at home and it is next to impossible to control these because children in turn protect their parents loyally, and society finds it convenient to blame public institutions.        
	What is a saving grace in these testing times is that there are still many parents who take a sensible and practical approach in dealing with their wards. They want to be advised about appropriate parenting, and certainly more parents are seeking professional help to resolve problems. What is sad, however, is the loss of easy camaraderie between teachers and students. Teachers say that they have to measure and weigh their words far too carefully these days in case they are accused of being insensitive. Gone are the days when teachers could use the most colourful expressions to make a point and students would take them in good humour and joke about them for years after. What is sadder still is that parents have stopped being parents in the fullest sense of the term. And what is tragic is that we are losing our children in more senses than one.

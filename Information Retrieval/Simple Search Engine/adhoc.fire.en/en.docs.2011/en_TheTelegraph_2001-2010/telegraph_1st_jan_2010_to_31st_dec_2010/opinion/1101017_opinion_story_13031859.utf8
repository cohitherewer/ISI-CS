	Unwelcome barb                  
	Sir  It was very disappointing to hear that the South African swimmer, Roland Schoeman, had likened the spectators at the Commonwealth Games to monkeys (Monkey jab and gaffe, Oct 9). The crowds at the Fifa World Cup earlier this year, in his home country, were just as noisy, armed with their vuvuzelas. While an audiences cheering can hamper ones concentration, Schoeman should understand that it is also a way of showing support and love, without which a sportspersons career is incomplete.          
	 Yours faithfully,          
	Sneha Majumder, Calcutta  
	Forgotten hero          
	Sir  The news of the British scientist, Robert Edwards, winning the Nobel for medicine this year is welcome. However, one must remember our very own Subhas Mukerjis contribution to the field of in-vitro fertilization as well (Test tube triumph amp; tragedy, Oct 5). Mukerjis experiment, which was revolutionary by nature, was scorned at by his contemporaries and by the panel that analysed the work, thus hampering his progress and resulting in his suicide. The worlds first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, is famous, but no one seems to know the worlds second test-tube baby, Durga, born just 10 weeks after Brown. The murky bureaucracy in Bengal in the 1970s nipped a talent like Mukerjis in the bud.          
	Yours faithfully,        Oindrila Thakur, Calcutta              
	Sir  With his tireless research into curing infertility, Subhas Mukerji broke new ground in the field of reproductive science at a time when it was relatively unexplored even among better-known scientists and doctors from developed nations. His experiment of harvesting and freezing human eggs before transplanting them in the womans womb led to the successful birth of Indias first test-tube baby, Durga. Unable to grasp the implications of his discovery, the medical fraternity branded Mukerji a fraud. The medical authorities did not care to get his claims examined and verified by other experts in the field. Bureaucratic vindictiveness even prevented Mukerji from presenting his research papers at conferences or from visiting Kyoto University. It was T.C. Anand Kumars research that authenticated Mukerjis claims. Mukerjis life is an example of what stands between a scientist and his achievement.                    
	Yours faithfully,         S. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta              
	Sir  Soon after the birth of Louise Brown, Kanupriya Agarwal, also known as Durga, was born, thanks to the ground-breaking research by Subhas Mukerji. Instead of honouring his contribution to science, the West Bengal government ordered an inquiry against him, resulting in his suicide. It is in the fitness of things that the government of India recognizes and honours his work posthumously.                     
	Yours faithfully,       
A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

                
	Parting shot          
	Sir  The raj delusions of the Calcutta High Courts Central public information officer made for an enjoyable read (Victorian interlude, Oct 10). However, one wonders how the letters patent, under which the high court was constituted by Queen Victoria, was suppressed during the transfer of power at the time of Indias independence. That crucial information might render the CPIOs claim not so amusing after all, given the fact that we are still a part of the Commonwealth.                    
	Yours faithfully,      
Ranjit Sen, Calcutta

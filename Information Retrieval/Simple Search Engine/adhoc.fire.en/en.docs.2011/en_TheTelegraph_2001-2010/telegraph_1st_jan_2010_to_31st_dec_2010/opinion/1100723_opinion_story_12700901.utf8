	Money matters                  
	Sir  The new rupee symbol, adopted by the Union cabinet, is a masterpiece of design (Honey our money has an ID, July 16). It ingeniously combines the English R with the Devanagari Ra. The new symbol will bring a certain glory to India in the global arena. But the credibility of the rupee should also be maintained.          
	Steps should be taken to check the circulation of fake currency and the use of the rupee as black money. For instance, India could stop printing currency notes of high value, just as Britain and the United States of America have done. Drafts, pay-orders and travellers cheques must carry names and addresses or account numbers of purchasers. The validity period of such cheques and drafts should be restricted to 45 days in order to clamp down on their misuse as conduits of black money. Moreover, the payment for all purchases above a certain amount should be made through banks.          
	Yours faithfully,      
Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

                
	Sir  The new rupee symbol has been criticized for using the Devanagari script, which is not popular with a large section of Indians, and may therefore be difficult to use. A simpler alternative might have been a zero with two lines across it or running down it vertically. The zero, after all, has played a significant role in the history of this civilization. There can be no better unifying symbol for the whole country. However, it is great news that the Indian currency will be given a marker which will lend it an international significance.          
	Yours faithfully,       
N.K. Goyle, Mumbai

                
	Sir  I am unable to understand the hype over the new rupee symbol. What difference does make it to our economy? One concedes that symbols are important, and the United Progressive Alliance government has done well to choose one for the rupee. The symbol also perhaps suggests Indias newfound self-confidence.          
	Nevertheless, a new symbol cannot do much to improve the value of the rupee or the deprivation that millions are still subjected to. The new rupee symbol should inspire all of us to work harder and actually earn the glory that comes with it.          
	Yours faithfully,

	Thrown off the track          
	Sir  It is a pity that the highest authority in the ministry of railways is pointing fingers at the deceased drivers, holding them responsible for the collision so that the system failures remain undisclosed in the absence of evidence from the drivers (Railway grapples with driver riddle, July 20). A similar effort was made to hide the signalling failure in the collision near Mathura a few months ago. It is unfortunate that the media have not cared to find out the results of the inquiry held by the commissioner of railway safety or what action was taken thereupon.          
	The statement made by the Union minister for railways, Mamata Banerjee, is also aimed at sweeping under the carpet the system defects and at putting the blame on her political archrivals, the Left Front government in West Bengal.          
	The collision at Sainthia is riddled with several technical and administrative questions which cannot be left to be probed by the commissioners of railway safety. The commissioners would naturally be biased in favour of the ministry of railways, to which they look for personal conveniences. A judicial inquiry, assisted by a team of independent railway signal engineers and operating officers, is necessary, notwithstanding the fact that judicial inquiries are never completed in time to attract public attention.          
	Just as the former railways minister, K. Hanumanthaiah, changed the Indian Railways attitude towards punctuality in the 1970s, the attitude of the senior management, too, has to change. In Mughalsarai, on July 20, the engine of the Rajdhani Express became uncoupled from the rest of its coaches. This is not an event to be ignored. I remember some couplings are not compatible with particular types of coaches. I wonder whether the railway staff and officers are aware of this incompatibility. In the working timetable of the Eastern Railway, the use of such incompatible couplers was prohibited. I do hope that the instructions are still there for the information of those concerned. Such ignorance and indifference to safety instructions tend to cause accidents.          
	Yours faithfully,        H.C. Johari,Indian Railway Traffic Service (retired), former COM,  Eastern Railway and          Director Railway Board                      
	Final countdown          
	Sir  The editorial, Birth of understanding (July 10), presents a bleak picture of the future. It points out that World Population Day, celebrated on July 11, is also a warning against the alarming population explosion. The threat of growing numbers is even more menacing than global warming. In India, population control is beset by problems like illiteracy, superstition and ignorance. The 1970s saw the controversial sterilization programme, ruthlessly enforced by Sanjay Gandhi, son of the former prime minister, Indira Gandhi. Population growth still remained uncontrollable. The prospect of people jostling with one another for an inch of land is frighteningly close. The only solution, perhaps, is to seek out another suitable planet people can migrate to, far from the madding crowds ignoble strife.                    
	Yours faithfully,       
Dilip Kumar Kar, Jalpaiguri

	Success cannot be imitated, it has to be achieved. It may look as if this simple reality has slipped Mamata Banerjees mind. She has made a point of showing off her intellectuals, that is, writers, theatre personalities, painters and music-makers, as though in competition with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), whose easy access to a substantial panel of intellectuals demonstrates the Lefts presence in West Bengals culture. The CPI(M), of course, is the beneficiary of a long tradition, by virtue of the fact that artists and intellectuals the world over inclined towards communism and Marxism for a longish period in history. As some did towards fascism. Ideology had a lot to do with their support for leftwing parties. Whether or not ideology alone is the reason for the CPI(M)s present following of intellectuals is a different question.        
	Ms Banerjee, unfortunately, cannot lay claim to any such specific ideology. It has to be inferred that artists and writers taking the Trinamul Congresss side today have other reasons to do so. Not the least of them is disillusion with the CPI(M), and disgust at its perceived tyranny  a reason that many of the group have actually voiced. The presence of such an eminent writer and personality as Mahasweta Devi lends credence to this argument. But shorn of ideology, this reason is ultimately negative. It is conditional on the Trinamul Congresss ability to teach the CPI(M) a lesson and undo its excesses, both of which are political eventualities. Just having a band of intellectuals in tow does not give the Trinamul Congress the aura Ms Banerjee seems to crave. It cannot supply the tradition that all Left parties draw on, however degenerate their present forms.        
	Rather, it merely leaves her with the problems that artists bring with them. The long list of artists and writers who were either thrown out of Left parties all over the world or who left of their own accord is enough to prove that the relationship between an artist and a political party is never peaceful. Individuality and party discipline cannot be yoked together. Ms Banerjee has experienced this only with Kabir Suman so far. After deciding to quit the party and Parliament, the singer and composer changed his mind, not for a political reason but what can be called a personal one. Ms Mahasweta Devi has persuaded him to stay on. A perceptible distinction can already be made between the Trinamul Congresss agenda and that of the artists it would like to call its own. The senior writer and activist has reportedly said that if she finds Ms Banerjee engaged in anti-people actions, she will speak out against her too.        
	That is exactly the point. An artist may be political, but his politics are his own. By nature anti-establishment, few artists can abide the establishmentarian conventions of a political party, even if the party is in opposition. Ms Banerjee needs to remember that.

	 Even before Mumbaikars had got their chance to prick the ego of Bal Thackeray, the great Indian saffron family had deflated much of it. The first potshot had been taken by no less than the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief himself, who announced that Mumbai is for all Indians. Then followed the barrage from others in the Hindutva brotherhood without any concern for Balasahebs age or his troubles. With a (foster) family like this, one surely does not need enemies. A person likely to second this observation is Nitin Gadkari. One of the youngest presidents of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Gadkari has been the target of much vitriol. At a recent book release in the capital, the speaker on the dais kept talking about Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, before mentioning that both leaders had died at the age of 52. In his next sentence, he mentioned the happenstance that Gadkari is 52. The statement was followed by complete silence, and senior leaders like LK Advani were seen fidgeting uneasily. Gadkari would have dismissed such ominous thoughts with a laugh. For like Balasaheb, he believes in the dictum, never say die.                
	 Apparently, the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit has proved to be a great morale-booster for Shashi Tharoor. It so happened that the president of Slovenia, Danilo Trk, had been in the capital and took time off to catch up with buddy Tharoor. Before becoming president, Trk had served as UN assistant secretary-general when Tharoor served in the UN. Tharoor, reportedly, drew solace from the fact that Trk had faced a lot of bad press and opposition from his critics. With a population of just about two million, Slovenia picked Trk as president. Tharoor got elected in a parliamentary constituency of over a million. Clearly, Tharoor can go beyond twitter.                            
	 The residential addresses of some top BJP leaders have a common number. LK Advani stays at 30 Prithviraj Road, Venkaiah Naidu at 30 Aurangzeb Road, and Nitin Gadkari at 30 Ferozeshah Road. Of course, it could be sheer coincidence, but there could also be a twist in the tale. Or are we reading too much into it?                            
	 There cannot be smoke without fire. That is the bottom line of the diamond saga involving an official of the Commonwealth Games secretariat. The said official had gone abroad in connection with the games and routed his tickets through Dubai. On one trip, as he has clarified, he indulged in window-shopping at the local jewellery market. The courier of a diamond ring from the jewellers in Dubai, arrested by the customs in India, has a different story to tell. He says that the official not only bought the ring worth Rs 14 lakh but also shopped generously at the jewellery mart. Customs officials have issued a notice after confirming that the man had indeed been in touch with the jeweller. His telephone records bear evidence of this fact. If a petty official can buy himself jewellery worth lakhs, think of how much unscrupulous men may be raking in in the name of the Games, which could leave the country holding a huge bill but without any medals?                            
	 The stringent security norms in government buildings in Luytens Delhi pose problems for many visitors. The other day, a leading industrialist was denied a chauffeur-driven entry into Shastri Bhavan. The visitor  a known fitness-freak  had no problems in walking down the path to meet the minister for coal. He was followed by another industrialist who, however, did not take to things kindly. He lamented that his successful legal battle to secure the right to fly the national flag every day could not earn him a hassle-free entry into a government building.                            
	 P Chidambarams stature continues to grow. The BJP CMs showered praise on him. He is in demand among people associated with finance and industry too. Even at the World Economic Forum in Davos, he was missed by many despite the presence of ministers like Kamal Nath, Anand Sharma and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission.                        
	 Abhishek Manu Singhvi had organized a dinner on the day senior party leader, Ram Niwas Mirdha, passed away. Mirdha comes from Singhvis home state, Rajasthan, and was respected for his probity in public life. Strictly speaking, there is no code or convention that prohibits party leaders from organizing a do on a day a colleague dies, but with Mirdha many felt that an exception should have been made. Singhvis bash also embarrassed S Jaipal Reddy, but for a different reason. Reddy had organized a lavish lunch few days back, but had missed inviting the Union I amp;B minister, Ambika Soni. For most part of the evening at Singhvis dinner, Reddy was seen trying to explain to Soni why she got left out of the guest list. Soni, meanwhile, tried to get Reddy talking on the menace of paid news.

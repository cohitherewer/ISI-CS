	It is too early to know how much Rahul Gandhis recent visits to West Bengal would energize the Congress in the state. But there is one unmistakable sign that Mr Gandhis plan has begun to work. This is evident from Mamata Banerjees reaction to his visits. Never one to mince words, she has compared Mr Gandhis visits to the calls of the cuckoo in spring. Not one to be a seasonal bird in politics, Ms Banerjee is a seasoned enough politician to know that a resurgent Congress can spoil her party in Bengal. It is the season of change in Bengals politics with the long-reigning Left Front almost certain to find itself out in the cold in next years assembly polls. Ms Banerjee thinks that the credit for an Opposition victory should go entirely to her. But she has to live with what, to her, is a rather unpleasant fact  that she needs the Congress in order to oust the Left from power. The last state-wide civic polls in Bengal proved precisely that. Her party, the Trinamul Congress, may have won the polls in Calcutta on its own, but the rest of Bengal was still beyond her reach without the Congresss help. She has to also contend with the fact that the Congress would like, as much as she does, to occupy the space vacated by the declining Left.        
	Congress leaders in Bengal should actually be happy with Ms Banerjees reactions to Mr Gandhis visits. But they cannot expect him  or any other national leader of the party, for that matter  to do their job. Mr Gandhi has given them a roadmap and possibly a push, but it has to be their own journey. Ms Banerjees party remains a part of the United Progressive Alliance at the Centre. It will probably continue to be an ally of the Congress for next years polls in Bengal. But the Congresss revival in the state should be important to its leaders and followers, irrespective of any alliance. Having been out of power in Bengal for 30-odd years, the partys leaders tend to forget what it stands for. No matter what its strength is in any state, the Congress is a national party with not just a history but also an ideology that makes it distinct from regional parties in India. This was why Mr Gandhi repeatedly told his partymen in Bengal not to surrender the partys honour while carrying on with the alliance with Ms Banerjees party. But the weak are rarely honoured in the competitive world of mass politics. Even if it is a war of the allies, it has to be fought and won.

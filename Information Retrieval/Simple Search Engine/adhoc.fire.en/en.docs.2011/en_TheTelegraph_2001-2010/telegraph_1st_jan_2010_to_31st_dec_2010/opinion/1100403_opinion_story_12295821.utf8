	The numbers say it all. Some Rs 36,000 crore are being spent to prove, among other things, what a physics graduate scribbled on the back of an envelope in a north Calcutta alley. This is nearly the amount that a country like India, with its population of 1.15 billion, spends in a year on education. And it spends less on health. The budget outlay on health this year was Rs 22,300 crore, while a 300-bed hospital, set up in Gujarat with earthquake-resistant material, cost all of one billion rupees. If the best science is as expensive as the Big Bang experiment, would humankind gain more by knowing whether or not the Higgs boson exists, and what dark matter might be, or by funding the means to clean up the atmosphere and trying to cure hitherto incurable diseases?        
	But do numbers really say it all? There was no talk of schools or poor children and incurable sicknesses when Fox Star bought the rights of Shah Rukh Khans film, My Name is Khan, at the unprecedented amount of around Rs 100 crore. Entertainment is costly, especially if it aims to touch the heart of the world. Science, even in the most sceptical assessment, is at least as necessary to humankind as entertainment; without the former, there would be none of the latter. At the same time, trying to find out whether the god particle exists and searching for the nature of dark matter seem not only slightly hubristic but also like pursuing a chimera, rather far from any conceivable practical purpose. It is the pursuit of pure knowledge, a desire to seek the origins of the universe by emulating as closely as possible the conditions that are thought to have existed seconds after the Big Bang. No one knows where this will take human thought, and how far it will expand the universe of knowledge, and to what practical use the result of such a remarkable expenditure of money, energy and time may be put years from now.        
	Yet man does not live by gravity alone. He needs to know as much as he needs to eat. He is driven by the desire to better his condition, and much of the time, though not always, reason tells him that to do so he must find ways to improve the conditions of the world. Human beings must feed the poor and heal the sick if they want their planet to be healthy; they must send all children to school and clean up the earth if they want life to be peaceful and equitable. That they often do not is another matter. But for both knowledge and action there have to be resources. So many things need to be done, as any householder knows, but only a few are possible. He must decide whether he will start building a house for an unseen future or buy a car for immediate use with the resources he has. An exciting venture into the unknown may turn out like the mission to the moon, spectacular but of little incremental value in science. Knowing how the world began may open up the portals to another plane of understanding altogether. Or not. Only then will humankind know whether searching for the god particle was worth it.

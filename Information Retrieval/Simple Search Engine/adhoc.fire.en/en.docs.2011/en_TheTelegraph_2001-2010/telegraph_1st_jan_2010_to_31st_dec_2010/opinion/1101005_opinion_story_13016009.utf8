	When the occasion demands applause, the clapping should not be half-hearted. The success of the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games is undeniable and should make all the prophets of doomsday eat humble pie. It was a spectacle that made the nation proud. Thus what was feared to become the symbol of Indias shame has become a triumph for the nation. Patriots were ecstatic but even those who are not easily given to patriotic excesses were forced to admit that as a spectacle the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi outshone the opening of the Olympic Games in Beijing. The ceremony in Beijing, because it was the product of a highly regimented society and of a totalitarian regime, was so marked by discipline that it lacked spontaneity. It gave the impression that it was executed not by humans who had emotions to display and a sense of joy to communicate. Everything was too perfect to be true. The show in New Delhi had discipline and bore the signs of being well-planned and well-rehearsed but was not completely bereft of human will and emotion. These enhanced the overall impact by making the opening ceremony more humane and perhaps even humanizing.        
	The opening ceremony demonstrated to the world that India and Indians are capable of achieving the best. The process of reaching excellence, in this case, was not without hiccups; but this could not lower the standards of the performance on the opening day. There may be something uniquely Indian in this. India seemingly presents so much diversity that casual observers often miss the underlying unity of the mosaic. Similarly, the apparent chaos of the preparations deflected attention from the striving, away from the limelight, to touch excellence. Success always has many parents. But as critics work overtime to morph themselves into admirers, the fallout from the Games will be garnered by the ruling party to its own political and electoral advantage. This is par for the course under the circumstances. It is also fair since the ruling party would have had to take the responsibility of any failure. The spectre of failure has disappeared. Even if India does not win too many medals in the nineteenth Commonwealth Games, the most important trophy  that of organizing the Games  will go to India. It is the festive season when all Indians can hold their heads high.

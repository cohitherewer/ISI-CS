The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Moving on, but not away
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        MOVING ON, BUT NOT AWAY                                                                  
	I have never really heard the phrase, moving on, being applied to anyone other than to couples who have recently parted ways. Nevertheless, I did not find it odd  whether I concurred with the tag was a different matter  to hear the phrase being used in relation to the youth of the country in the wake of the long-awaited Ayodhya verdict. For the Ayodhya dispute has been somewhat like a faithful long-term partner  enduring, steady, but also turbulent at regular intervals  especially for the generation that grew up during the years succeeding the demolition of the Babri Masjid.        
	I was six years old when the demolition occurred. I remember next to nothing of it. I remember no television images, no voices or phrases. I do, however, remember an atmosphere of unease and tension that I was unable to comprehend at that age. The memory of that charged atmosphere is something I have not forgotten over the years. Does that mean I have not moved on  from the volatile relationship I forged with the issue 18 years ago, simply by virtue of being an Indian?        
	Come to think of it, everything that my generation has grown up hearing about the Ayodhya and Babri Masjid disputes has come down to us in the form of what weve been told  by our families, politicians and the media. Many of our own inferences have been based on this information. In conversation with Zainab Malik, an undergraduate student of economics, I chanced upon someone who was able to recognize that the Ayodhya land dispute and the demolition of the mosque were two different issues, even though they were necessarily linked, one being a consequence of the other. Malik says that the she felt a sense of pride when she saw what she described as the maturity with which people my age reacted to the issue in the years leading up to the verdict. She was four at the time of the demolition. She agreed that being able to recall the actual incident was very different from growing up just hearing about what happened. The former provided a baseline for gauging the real nature of events that were to occur later on.        
	Zainab is just one of the many young Indian people, here and outside the country, who seem reluctant to believe that the youth of India do not wish to engage with the countrys political and religious past. And as far as Zainab is concerned, her religion was secondary to her immediate response to the issue. I will not deny that my identity as a Muslim will always be a part of my reaction. But it does not govern my opinion on the Ayodhya dispute. She believes that the verdict was just. But even if she had believed otherwise, she said, it would have had less to do with my religious identity, and more with the facts of the case.        
	A number of young Muslim and Hindu people in Mysore were in the news just before the announcement of the verdict  because of their call for peace and harmony. One of them, 16-year-old Syed Inayatullah, said that the youth of the country wished to put all the years of unrest behind them and move on. And there it was again. Moving on  a stamp of progress that young people are unsure they have any claim to at all. What have we moved on from? And what do people mean when they claim that the youth have moved on? It is difficult, and indeed unfair, to make sweeping statements about how a group of people as heterogenous as Indias youth feels. If moving on suggests that the youth of India are uninterested in how different communities in their country achieve peaceful coexistence, then we  that is, my generation  have not moved on. If it means that the country can rot as long as our own lives and interests are on track, then were still exactly where we were 18 years ago. But if it means that were done with violence and religious unrest once and for all then, yes, we have indeed moved on.

	Democracy, being the government of the people, by the people, for the people, often puts politicians in a quandary. The wisdom of Abraham Lincolns famous words could have summarily ended the controversy brewing around the construction of an Islamic cultural centre, Cordoba House, near Ground Zero in Manhattan. Two-thirds of the American people, supported by prominent politicians who want to retain or reclaim power in the upcoming mid-term polls, oppose the plan. If public opinion were the sole criterion, the proposal would have been dismissed in minutes. However, the constitution of the United States of America is a far more sophisticated, robust and inclusive document to allow such simple-minded solutions. By drawing on the principles of liberty and equality enshrined in the First Amendment, it could be argued that privileging popular sentiment, in this case, amounts to a logical fallacy. The argument against the building of Cordoba House is entirely based on moral outrage: if such a project comes to pass, it would be an affront to the memory of the thousands who perished with the fall of the twin towers in the 9/11 attacks. So Cordoba House, which is meant to promote a better understanding of Islam in the US, is ironically being reduced to a symbol of terror. Aggressive national pride seems to be obscuring rationality and common sense.        
	Such an attitude is untenable not only from a judicial but also a philosophical point of view. The illegality of the demand is evident in the way it violates the freedom of religion, which the US president, Barack Obama, has defended. As for bad, indeed twisted, logic, the majority seems to be confusing, or rather conflating, Islam with terrorism. If there is no doubt that the perpetrators of 9/11 were jihadis trained in a militant school of Islam, it is equally true that millions of ordinary Muslims all over the world deplore violence and bloodshed as vehemently as the enlightened West does. So, raising a hue and cry over Cordoba House not only ends up reinforcing Western stereotypes of Islam but also imposing new standards of assimilation on Muslim immigrants  a goal that Europe is actively pursuing with its burqa ban. Whatever be the outcome of this controversy, either way, it will end up deepening the differences between Islam and the West incontrovertibly.

	With Gordon Brown gone, six people have declared themselves candidates in the contest to elect a new Labour leader. One is a black woman, Diane Abbott. Another is avowedly left wing, John McDonnell. Neither stands any chance of winning. The next Labour leader will be chosen from four rather similar men in their forties whose entire working lives have been spent in Labour Party politics. In fact, make that two very similar men, David Miliband and his younger brother Ed, because their rivals Ed Balls and Andy Burnham might struggle like Abbott and McDonnell to get enough backing to get their names on the ballot paper. In other words, the final struggle to fill the shoes of Brown, Blair, Wilson, Attlee (etc) will most probably be between two siblings four years apart in age who grew up in the same north London house, went to the same university (Oxford), started their careers as young political advisors and policy wonks (David for Blair, Ed for Brown) and rose effortlessly to become ministers in the last government.        
	This is choice? Thirty years ago, as a reporter covering India, I used to work for a foreign editor on The Sunday Times who would give exacting briefs. He was a clever man who suffered from asthma and had a raspy voice that always seemed to mock the world. Your next piece must tell us, he said one week, why it is that with so many people to choose from  a population of 800 million, after all  India always decides that its prime ministers must come from the same family. I may have pointed out that this wasnt quite true  even then, there were Shastri and Desai to consider  but I dont think I ever wrote the piece. It would be like trying to explain why Britain still has a monarchy. Odd, irrational and indefensible it may be, but any explanation would demand more than a thousand words.         
	So, likewise, with the Milibands: quite what such a narrow choice says about Britain or even the Labour Party is hard to say. The political differences are tiny. David says he wants to rebuild Labour as a great movement for change and reform. Eds imperative is a wider movement that can show in opposition that we are rooted in peoples lives. The other former cabinet members, Balls and Burnham, are no more concrete. We need to set out our vision for the future and show how, in a modern global economy, we can deliver more highly-skilled and green jobs, and narrow inequality, says Balls. I want Labour to be the peoples party again  a force for progress and good, says Burnham. Only the unelectable McDonnell comes close to what you might call specifics, by calling for an end to privatization, Britains nuclear missile and the armys presence in Afghanistan.        
	The real question over the future of Labour is much bigger than wholl be the next leader; all that may boil down to is electing the character with the most televisual appeal and ease with the media (for me, thats Ed Miliband), because the party will be forever haunted by the memory of Gordon Browns on-camera awkwardness. What Labour needs is that rather old-fashioned thing, an ideology  a set of beliefs and attitudes that not only sets it apart from the new governing coalition but also finds a popular response in the electorate. Theres no sign that one will arrive any time soon. Every mainstream party in Britain now flies flags labelled progressive and fair. As Blair copied Thatcher, so Cameron copies Blair. All say they will do something about immigration and climate change; all make equally feeble or unfulfillable promises to restrain the banks and rebalance the economy away from the financial service industries.        
	The consequences of Labours great blunders  the Iraq war, light-touch financial regulation  hang heavy in the air. Every left-of-centre party in history has disappointed its more utopian followers as a sell-out, but the disenchantment with Labour (New Labour as it rebranded itself) has been particularly acute. People have left the party in droves. Making it anew will be the work of two hundred thousand Milibands rather than two. Five years in opposition  supposing the new coalition lasts  may not be enough time to find them.              
	************              
	A striking example of the kind of radicalism thats vanished from Labour is provided by the late Ralph Miliband, father to David and Ed. Miliband senior was a Marxist who taught politics at the London School of Economics and belonged to the same generation of socialist thinkers and writers as his friend, E.P. Thompson. He helped found the New Left Review. When the then prime minister, Harold Wilson, spoke in favour of the United States of America during the Vietnam War, he attacked Wilsons support as the most shameful chapter in the history of the Labour Party. We now know it wasnt quite that  we know, for example, that Wilson resisted Lyndon Johnsons demands that Britain send troops, and we can contrast that independence of mind to Blairs gushing cooperation with George W. Bush in the Iraq misadventure. Ralphs elder son voted for that war  the younger had still to be elected to parliament  and so far hasnt retracted his support for it.        
	But then look at the different histories of father and son. Ralph, born in a Polish Jewish family, fled to London from Brussels when the Germans invaded in 1940 and served in the Royal Navy during the war. Before he became an academic, a lot had happened to him. David, born in luckier times, went straight from Oxford and MIT to a bright-boy position in government policy-making. Like many or perhaps most people now in parliament, he must see politics as a career rather than a cause; politics as managing expectations rather than raising them. This, too, may carry implications for the early prospect of a Labour revival.              
	************              
	One of the great delights of living in London is exploring it. You think you know the city, and then one day you find that you dont even know the territory half a mile from your doorstep  even if, as in my case, youve lived here for 40 years. This happened to me last Sunday when we went for a walk by the side of a channelled stream called the New River, which was built in the 17th century to bring water dozens of miles from Hertfordshire to the households of the capital. Thanks to recent conservation work, a footpath now follows it for most of the way. The familiar geography of the north London suburbs is suddenly made strange by an unfamiliar viewpoint, and for a mile or two we had no exact idea of where we were, though we were only 20 minutes from home.              
	Were we, in fact, in London at all? We saw swans and their cygnets, coots, moorhens, ducks and an elegant heron, as well as the common London sight of pigeons and magpies. Buttercups splashed the banks with yellow. Dragonflies hovered in the grass. There were very few other human beings, apart from the exotic sight of a family of Hasidic Jews  skullcaps and dreadlocks  looking completely at sea as they paddled hesitantly across a reservoir in a canoe. When we turned a corner and climbed to a road and got back to the London we knew  the mixed-up, turbulent London of Algerians and Bengalis, Somalis and Russians, Nigerians and Poles, Kurds and Greeks  it was as though wed spent an hour in a different country. England probably  the rural parts. But we went to a Turkish store and bought a box of Pakistani mangoes and were glad we lived where we did.              
	************              
	Reports suggest that some Indians arent happy that the Queen isnt coming to Delhi for the Commonwealth Games. Give the old girl a break, I say: shes 84 and must be wearied of jaunting round the world, asking people where they come from and what they do. A typical exchange that she has avoided by staying at home:        
	Have you travelled far?        
	Yes, maam, Benares.        
	Oh, we went there once and met your marvellous raja, didnt we Phillip?        
	(Moves on.)              
	And indeed she did, in 1961. Many years later I crossed the Ganges on a bridge of boats to meet the same maharaja in the same palace. As I remember it, his highness was a Brahmin, perhaps the only Brahmin maharaja in India, and very orthodox. He wouldnt drink tea in front of me and took it in a separate room. Not to worry, he said, in a comforting kind of way. When the Queen of England came, I refused to drink tea even with her.

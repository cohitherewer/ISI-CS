The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | An act of cowardice 
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        AN ACT OF COWARDICE                                                           
	There was nothing revolutionary about the Maoists killing one of the policemen whom they had taken captive in Bihar. It was an act of cowardice that even the Maoist sympathizers among human rights activists found difficult to defend. Only terrorist groups and criminal gangs would take the life of a hostage in order to push a bargain. But it is not enough for the Maoists supporters in civil society to condemn the killing of the policeman. It is necessary that they also stop confusing the issues relating to the spread of Maoism and the ways to deal with it. Some ideologues and activists never tire of justifying killings by Maoists as a response to State-sponsored violence. In the case in Bihar, the rebels threatened to kill all four captive policemen unless the state government released eight of their jailed comrades. The fact that the captured rebels are in jail stands in stark contrast to what the Maoists have done to the defenceless policeman. There are many injustices that shackle the rule of law in India. But the justice of the Maoists kangaroo courts violates all norms of a civilized society.         
	Not that this is the first time the Maoists have killed an unarmed hostage. They have done it before in other states and will most certainly do it again. This is so because their aim ultimately is to spread the red terror deep and wide enough to paralyse the functioning of the State. But the message from the murder in Bihar should be clear both to the states chief minister, Nitish Kumar, and to Indias political class as a whole. It is all very well to talk about the social and economic factors behind the spread of Maoism. There is an urgent need to address the issues involved. But it is dangerous to use these issues as a cover for inaction or confusion. Mr Kumar has been reluctant to take the security approach in dealing with Maoists in Bihar. He even stayed away from a meeting the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, called in New Delhi to discuss the Maoist challenge. But the fact is that the Maoists have forced the State to a battle and no state government has the choice not to join it. This is so irrespective of what the government does to address the socio-economic issues.         
	Mr Kumars strategy is usually attributed to his compulsions for the coming elections in Bihar. But some election or the other takes place in India most of the time. There are two problems in linking the battle against the Maoists to electoral politics. Partisan interests in elections are seasonal affairs and can change like the weather. The second problem is really at the core of the fight against Maoism or any other extremist political ideology. Ultimately, the question is about the survival of democratic politics in India. The Maoists sympathizers may be right about the many inadequacies of the democratic system. But the Maoists themselves have no confusion about their goal: they want to destroy this State and seize power in an armed revolution. It is simply not a matter of the politics of the vote.

	It needs a poets insight to see a world in a grain of sand but it requires no special acumen to read a political mood from the results of polls. The people of West Bengal, in two elections at two different levels of the polity, have made their preference abundantly clear. What needs to be noted is that in the one year that separated the Lok Sabha elections from the municipal polls, the verdict of the people has not changed; in fact, it has hardened. Not even the most dyed-in-the-wool comrade can deny that the majority of the people of West Bengal have turned their back on the Left Front, which has ruled the state for more than three decades. The anticipation of a political change has now been cast in ballot papers, not once but twice. The chief minister of the state, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, should not err in comprehending the mood of the people expressed through the way they have voted. The results say one thing and one thing only: the Left Front has lost its mandate to rule West Bengal. It is true that according to the Constitution, the de jure writ of this government runs for one more year. But this cannot diminish the immense reality of its loss of the popular vote. Mr Bhattacharjee, if he wants to retain a modicum of moral integrity, should step down as chief minister and seek a fresh mandate from the people of the state. This is what the election results demand of him. He should not fail to see the moral world in the grain of municipal poll results.        
	Those who see themselves as the self-professed harbingers of change  Mamata Banerjee and all those who sail with her  have every reason to be delighted that their steadfast opposition to the Left has found such an overwhelming response among the people. Ms Banerjee has fashioned herself as the sole spokesman of all anti-Left people of the state and she, as the poll results show, is also perceived as such. She would be overenthusiastic if she assumed, however, that she has conquered the whole of West Bengal. She has aced the Left on her own in Calcutta, but her control over all the districts of the state is still a trifle tenuous. The principal reason for this is that there is life yet in that old Adam called the Congress. The decision not to accept Ms Banerjees domination helped the Congress retain its dignity and perform honourably. For the Congress, this opens up a space to work towards maximizing the possible in the future.        
	The swing of the popular vote away from the Left has made the present ruling dispensation completely lame. It cannot in any way  ethically or practically  impose its will on an electorate that does not respect it. A new government, whatever its colour, may be better for the state than one in rigor mortis.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | The hoarding pledge
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        THE HOARDING PLEDGE                          - Charity begins at home, but not in India					 					      Krishnan Srinivasan                                                      
	The end of the year is the traditional time to exchange gifts and goodwill. Gifts are an essential aspect of the spirit of charity. Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians spelled it out: and now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity. Aeschylus had earlier coined the word, philanthropy, from a combination of love and humanity.         
	In March, 2010, according to Wikipedia, the Indian dollar billionaires numbered 69, compared to 52 last year. India is second only to the United States of America, which has 403. The recent economic fortunes of India have brought untold wealth to certain individuals, who unlike the panwallah millionaire of popular legend, are also not shy about flaunting it  like Mukesh Ambanis Mumbai house, 27 storeys high and worth 630m, ostentatious mega-cost weddings, Bollywood extravagances and the Indian Premier cricket league. The brand value of sporting celebrities, who earn over a crore of rupees per commercial photo-shoot, is gleefully reported in our media, as is the soaring market value of IIT graduates and IT personalities. On October 28, 2010, the launch in India took place of the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 car at the cost of Rs 16 crore each, and the company aims to sell 60 of these vehicles here in the first year alone.        
	According to Forbes, the combined net worth of Indias 100 richest people rose to $300 billion this year from $276 billion last year, driven by the countrys booming economy and a rally in the stock market. Mukesh Ambani tops the list, followed by the steel baron, Lakshmi Mittal, who retained his second position with a net worth of $26.1 billion. Premjis wealth increased to $17.6 billion from $14.9 billion last year, taking him to the third spot. Fourth on the list were the Essar Energy brothers, Shashi and Ravi Ruia, with a net worth of $15 billion, bolstered by the companys initial public offering in the United Kingdom, which raised $1.85 billion. Mukeshs younger brother, Anil, lost the third spot on the list to Premji of Wipro and fell to a lowly sixth position. Mayavati, who owned next to nothing when she launched herself into politics, now admits she is worth Rs 88 crore. Much lesser known Indians are buying assets abroad  for example, Venkys Chicken, hardly a name to trip off the tongue in India, purchased Blackburn Rovers, a premier division football club in the UK, for $37 million and debts of $30 million. Hardly chicken-feed.         
	Diego Forlan, the Uruguayan footballer of the last World Cup, was brought to Calcutta only a few weeks after the World Cup, and the Baywatch star, Pamela Anderson, appeared for a few fleeting days in an Indian reality show for Rs 2.5 crore. This is just a glimpse of the huge amounts available in India in the entertainment industry.        
	Yet, with all this loose change sloshing about in India, where is the support for education, the arts, theatre, music and other good causes? We admire the love of their fellow-men shown by people like Steve Waugh who come rarely to our country but take the time and trouble to raise money altruistically for a good cause here. To stave off the implied criticism of our own celebrities, we are told that they are also in the habit of doing good works, but prefer to do so anonymously, presumably not for any reasons of modesty but to avoid the attentions of the taxman. So we are never told where and what their charitable involvements are, though we are vaguely aware of their lavish donations to temples, gurus and hospitals that bear their name and collect fees from patients though they have charitable windows of opportunity, probably again to avail themselves of tax benefits.        
	Yes, our dignitaries and celebrities participate in runs, walks and other fund-raising events, but nothing as exhausting as the (so far) 12 long-distance walks of Ian Botham, including one of a 900 mile one-end- of-the-country-to-the-other, to raise 12 million for leukemia and lymphoma research. Nelson Mandela, who has no shortage of attractive engagements and invitations, chose to celebrate his 90th birthday in 2008 as the main attraction for a star-studded concert for charity in Londons Hyde Park. The former World Cup Italian footballer, Roberto Baggio, commands nothing like the income owned by Bollywood stars or Indian cricketers, but he has been voted the winner of an award in 2010, not just by Italians, but by former winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, for his personal efforts for charity, for Aung San Suu Kyis freedom, for hospitals, for the victims of the earthquakes in Haiti and to combat bird flu.        
	Where are the endowments by our Indian plutocrats to universities and institutes of higher learning and research? Funding by charitable donation is taken for granted in the US, whether in politics or in academia. It is interesting to observe that the contributions of Indian corporate capitalists to educational institutions outside India, especially in the UK and US, such as Oxbridge, Stanford, Cornell and Harvard in recent years is hundreds and probably thousands of times higher than their contributions to universities and centres of learning in India. One Indian corporate giant has given $50 million for a building in an Ivy League university. This presumably betrays a lack of confidence in the Indian educational structure.         
	It is also particularly galling when leading universities in the West come calling cap-in-hand to India seeking donations, to this country that is the poorest low- income country in the G-20. It is a shameful irony for the West when it seeks a bail-out for its tertiary sector from poverty-stricken India. It is equally shameful, this time for India, that there are still hundreds, if not thousands, of Western volunteers working in India, often with irregular visa status, in our educational and non-governmental organizations, who seem to look abroad for both manpower and money, when there is such abundance of both in India.         
	In the UK, about 1 per cent of the GDP is spent in charitable donations, and in the US this figure rises to about 2 per cent. In the US, households with an income of $200,000 a year or above give 7.4 per cent of their money to charity, and in the UK, 1.2 per cent. Comparable figures for the Indian well-off are not available, but would make them ashamed if they were capable of any feelings. Andrew Carnegie gave $7 billion in todays money to build the Carnegie Hall in 1901. The Sainsbury family donated the magnificent Sainsbury wing of Londons National Gallery. Warren Buffet has made the worlds largest individual donation of $31 billion to charity; Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, are busy spending their money on fighting malaria and river blindness far from the shores of the US. Leonard Blavatnik gave 75 million to Oxford University. J.K. Rowling, who once lived on welfare benefits in Scotland, and Elton John of humble origins, are leading philanthropists, betraying none of the insecurities and family concerns that apparently prevent Indian first-generation millionaires from reaching into their pockets for charitable good causes.               
	Gates and Buffet recently launched a Giving Pledge to get their fellows in the league of the wealthy in the US to donate half of their fortunes to charity. One may well conjecture what would be the outcome of such an appeal to the Indians who figure on the rich list. But before they hasten, led by the Reddy brothers, Madhu Koda and Lalit Modi to convey their regrets to Gates and Buffet, they would do well to remember the advice of Francis Bacon that money is like manure  it is only useful when it is spread around.

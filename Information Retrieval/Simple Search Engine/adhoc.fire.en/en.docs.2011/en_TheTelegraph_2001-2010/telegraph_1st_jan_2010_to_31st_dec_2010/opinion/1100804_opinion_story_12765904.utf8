	Familiarity is the enemy of enterprise. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee failed to look outside his familiar world while setting up a search committee to find a vice chancellor for the new Presidency University. The committee thus consists of persons who are known to be sympathizers or cronies of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Mr Bhattacharjees dream of making his alma mater a university of international excellence is confined to the narrow world of Calcutta-based party intellectuals. The composition of the search committee continues the tradition that the CPI(M) has established over the last 30 years. The tradition dictates that every academic committee should be packed with persons who will do what the party asks them to do and every post in educational institutions  from the vice chancellor to a peon  should be held by a yes-man tied to the apron strings of the apparatchiki in Alimuddin Street. Loyalty to the party has always prevailed over merit. There may even be something more than the privileging of loyalty. It is entirely possible that the leaders of the CPI(M), in their delusion, believe that men and women owing allegiance to them are the best and therefore there is no need to look into any other pool of talent. The result has been the rise of worthless people and the destruction of educational institutions.        
	It is no coincidence that the three members of the search committee are all Bengalis from Calcutta. There cannot be an argument that the first vice chancellor of the new university should only be selected by Bengalis. Even if one were to accept such a parochial assumption, why only Bengalis from Calcutta? It is easy to think of any number of Bengali academics of international standing in their fields who are working in different parts of India and the globe. But none of them would say aye aye to the party on every point. The frog-in-the-well mindset is dangerous in every sphere of life; in education it leads to disaster. The search committee shows that the CPI(M) remains trapped in that narrow world. Presidency University is to be an institution for the future, but its first vice chancellor is to be selected by people who are well past their prime  one of them is nearing the biblical four score years. Are they the best suited to visualize the future? Mr Bhattacharjee had a chance to make the future. But he chose to cling to his past.

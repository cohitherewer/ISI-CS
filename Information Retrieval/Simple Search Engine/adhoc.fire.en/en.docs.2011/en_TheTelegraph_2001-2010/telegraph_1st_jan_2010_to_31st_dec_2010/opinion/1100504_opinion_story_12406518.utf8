	Self-preservation is a basic instinct as much for a political party as for any species. It is natural for the Congress, therefore, to want to survive even in Bengal where it has long been an endangered party. If the partys attempts at self-preservation in Bengal had not been very successful all these years, it had much to do with the partys history, especially the relationship between the state unit and the Congress high command. Since pre-Independence days, the Congresss Central leadership has treated the partys unit in Bengal with little sympathy and often utter disdain. Although Bidhan Chandra Roy enjoyed the Central leaders respect, it did not alter their attitude to the state party leaders in general. The only other Bengal Congress leader who enjoyed the Central leaders trust for a brief spell was Siddhartha Shankar Ray. The state unit leaders, as a rule, had little choice but to succumb to the diktat of the high command. The Bengal leaders war of attrition with the bosses in New Delhi over the Calcutta civic polls is thus quite a departure from party history. That the high command finally saw the logic in the Bengal partys argument is a positive trend that was long overdue.        
	That logic is simple and irrefutable. For any political party, the primary aim in any election has to be an improvement of its present position. If a party happens to be as weak and dispirited as the Congress in Bengal, the importance of this aim should get precedence over any other objective. If the strengthening of the Congresss position comes with the weakening of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), that is a collateral advantage. An alliance with another party is meaningful only if it helps the Congress survive and improve its position. The problem for the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance seems to be that the two parties have conflicting aims. While the Congresss primary aim in Bengal is to survive and possibly get strong, the TMC is focused on not just defeating the CPI(M) but also on taking over the entire anti-Left political space in the state. But the TMCs efforts at self-improvement militate against the Congresss aim of self-preservation. Mamata Banerjees threat to reduce the Congress in Bengal to a signboard is a wake-up call for the party. Even if the Congress does not do well in these polls, it can rebuild itself in Bengal on the state units new will to fight and be fit to survive.

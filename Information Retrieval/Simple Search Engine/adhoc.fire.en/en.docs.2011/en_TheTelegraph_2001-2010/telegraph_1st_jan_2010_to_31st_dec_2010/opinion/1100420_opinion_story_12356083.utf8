	Shashi Tharoor tried desperately to defer the inevitable. He could have retained his honour by resigning as soon as the scandal broke regarding the Kochi team for the Indian Premier League. He has now lost both his ministership and his honour. Mr Tharoors attempt to give himself a clean chit by way of a statement in the Lok Sabha convinced no one, least of all anyone of consequence in his own party. Being new to politics and to the Congress, Mr Tharoor was not conscious of the simple fact that after the experience of Bofors, the Congress and its president would not touch with the proverbial bargepole any person who has been touched by the tar of corruption. Mr Tharoor obviously has delusions about his own indispensability. He thus believed that his own protestations about his innocence would be taken seriously. What was much more important was the general perception that he had been involved in a deal that was apparently shady. He could have fallen from grace more gracefully, but he chose not to and thus cut a rather pathetic figure.        
	There is another aspect to cause clbre that demands attention. The United Progressive Alliance government allowed the matter to fester for too long. It is true that the prime minister was away from the country, but it is not as if he could not be reached on the phone by senior cabinet colleagues, like Pranab Mukherjee, or by the Congress president. Mr Tharoors hand was forced a good 24 hours after the prime ministers return to New Delhi. The whole affair could have been nipped in the bud by making Mr Tharoor resign as soon as his impropriety was public knowledge. Instead, he was allowed to make a spectacle of himself in the Lok Sabha even after his meeting with Mr Mukherjee. The UPA government and the Congress could have saved themselves a furore, some embarrassment and needless speculation by acting with greater swiftness. There is nothing that warrants the delay that occurred in asking for Mr Tharoors resignation. The distaste that the prime minister and the Congress president have for any individual tainted by even a hint of corruption is well known. This impression could have been strengthened with action that did not carry with it the suspicion of wavering. The UPAs commitment to a cleaner public life will stand up to scrutiny if it takes action against the IPL, which appears to be utterly rotten.

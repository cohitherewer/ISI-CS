                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        TIME AND AGAIN                                                    
	Bad pennies have an odd knack of turning up at a time when they are least sought. Many Pakistanis, who had voted decisively to oust Pervez Musharraf from power in 2008, must be comforting themselves with this idea when they look at the newly-launched All Pakistan Muslim League of the former military dictator. But the likes of Mr Musharraf may no longer be as undesirable in the Pakistan milieu as they would seem two years ago. A mental swing away from a pro-democratic disposition could be detected in August, when the plea of the Muttahida Quami Movement leader, Altaf Hussain, for the return of a patriotic military leader to power generated substantial public response. The failure of the government to provide security to the people from terror attacks, a poor economy, and bad governance  laid bare by the devastating floods  have turned the public mood in Pakistan. Mr Musharraf, who has been detecting this swing for a while, now feels sufficiently emboldened to try his luck, as perhaps any other adventurer would in the troubled waters of Pakistan.        
	The problem is that the odds against Mr Musharraf may be stacked higher than he thinks. Among the two major parties, the Pakistan Peoples Party, with whom he had once cut a deal, is hardly looking forward to his return. It may double the PPPs problems on the National Reconciliation Ordinance issue. The Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) has never made any effort to hide its hostility towards him and wants him tried in court. The worst part is that the other factions of the Pakistan Muslim League, particularly the Pakistan Muslim League (Qaid), which had been the kings party, no longer want to have anything to do with him. There are probably too many skeletons in the cupboard. The PML(Q), in fact, has merged with PML(Functional) under the leadership of Pir Pagara, who is believed to be close to the army. In other words, Mr Musharraf can no longer hope for unstinted support from the military, which has distanced itself from him and is, evidently, working on its own designs. Nevertheless, the fact that a former military dictator is seeking a return to political power through the democratic route should be seen as a statement of sorts on the changed political paradigms in Pakistan. Making a naked bid for power is no longer fashionable.

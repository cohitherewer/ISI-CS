	The Trauma and the Triumph: Gender and Partition in Eastern India, Volume 2 By Jasodhara Bagchi, Subhoranjan Dasgupta, and Subhasri Ghosh, 
  Stree, Rs 550        
	Scores of books have been written on the partition of India, and yet it seems as if the subject has not been exhausted. More than 60 years have passed since India was partitioned by the British on the eve of its Independence. Beyond the political dimension, it is the never-ending human suffering on both sides of the border that has caught the attention of several recent writers.         
	This book, however, only considers the issue of gender among many other facets of the partition. In tragedies it is always the women who suffer the most. Yet womens misery go largely unreported. As the title suggests, the book is not only about the trauma and the ordeal of Partition, but also shows the triumph of ordinary people living through an event that shook their world. The book is in six parts divided into stories, reminiscences, interviews, screenplays and documentary evidence of the period. The first volume had focused on the Indian part of the experience of partition and the struggle and recuperation of the Hindu community of the region. In the second volume, the editors have included the Muslim voices and experiences of people on the other side of the border, that is from East Pakistan, now Bangladesh.        
	Most of the fictional writings are drawn from Bengali writers translated into English and show the trends in Bengali literature on both sides of the border. It is not that Urdu writers of East Pakistan have not written about the pain of being uprooted. But somehow the editors have only concentrated on Bengali writers. They depict the troubled times when society suddenly went awry. Yet, as the stories show, human love and sympathy, irrespective of religion, remained untouched, even among the common and unlettered people, and especially in times when communal tension ran high.        
	There are six short stories, five reminiscences, six interviews, one screenplay and three examples from the field. There is also the documentary evidence, divided into three parts: the first containing an unpublished piece by the inspector-general of police on the riots of 1946. Strangely enough, the source of this piece has not been disclosed.         
	The second part contains four speeches from assembly proceedings between 1948 and 1957. The third contains an excerpt from Mridula Sarabhais report to the Enquiry Commission on the outbreak of violence in Calcutta in 1950. These, as well as interviews of more than a dozen individuals, reveal the complex nature of migration that took place on either side of the border.        
	The book addresses the plight of the refugees  how the State failed to do something for them. The editors have also not forgotten to include the voices of some women from the minority community, though only from the rural areas. But the best part of the book consists of short stories by writers like Ishaq Chakhari, Hasan Azizul Haq, Selina Hossain (picture), Samaresh Basu, Narendranath Mitra and Sulekha Sanyal, as also a screenplay by Supriyo Sen. These not only depict the ways in which writers look at contemporary society, but also show the myriad shades of human nature when faced with difficult times. As always, literature is the best vehicle of expression of the times.        
	The book focuses on womens displacement and their struggle to build their lives from scratch. It should not be missed by scholars keen to unravel the knots of history.

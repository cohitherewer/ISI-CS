The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | no time to look back
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        NO TIME TO LOOK BACK                                  Abhijit Bhattacharyya                              
	Police in India are seldom perceived as being professional in their approach. Even if, on rare occasions, they manage to do a job, they are appraised with scepticism. In spite of the important role they play, the Indian police have an oddly poor image.        
	So, for the police, the practical dilemma  To act or not to act  gets murkier in a state like West Bengal. As the state has not seen any change in the ruling class for 33 years, it can be safely assumed that two generations of officers of the Indian Police Service have served only red bosses here. Understandably, the monopoly of one class of rulers has made the men in khaki lose their shine.         
	In 1998, I was an election observer in one of the seven Lok Sabha constituencies of Calcutta. The late Jyoti Basu was still active as the undisputed official leader of the state and the police were unabashed followers of Alimuddin Street. However, it would be unfair to single out the Bengal police. No doubt, they are bipartisan, but they have not yet fallen to the pits as have the police in other parts. They are fearful of the ruling party rather than of their own officers.         
	To this chaotic cauldron of Bengali politics, has now been added the clarion call of the leader of the Opposition, urging good policeman to go on medical leave en masse to avoid being party to the misdeeds of the present rulers. It has also been suggested that the opposition party would regularize the leaves with full reimbursement once it comes to power.         
	So who are these good policemen? Apparently, those who stand suspended or face various disciplinary proceedings today fall into this category. This unprecedented public declaration by the opposition leader deserves scrutiny as she is also a cabinet minister of the Union government with an all-India jurisdiction.                
	Necessary challenge        
	If such an important figure gives a call to the police to resort to indiscipline, the results could be disastrous in future. Does the leader realize the potential reaction to, and implication of, her statement on the already demoralized Bengal police? The decline of the Bengal police and the district administration began in 1970 with the Sai household murder in public. Subsequently, the death knell was sounded in 1984, when an outstanding IPS officer, Vinod Mehta, was butchered by a government instigated mob, led by a notorious political leader of the ruling coalition in Bengal. The spine of the Bengal police was further broken by a few careerist and cowardly IPS officers who ditched Mehta in 1984. The polices ineptitude was in focus again when goons of the ruling party launched a murderous assault on an opposition leader in 1990 in broad daylight.        
	The police in Bengal face myriad problems today. Being the state with the highest population growth rate, Bengal has to deal with land problems, unbridled migration, and a corrupt administration at the district level. Bengal today poses a serious threat to itself, compounded by failure, frustration and despondency all around. Much depends on the conduct and speech of the leaders: they should not speak hastily, out of anger or to settle personal scores. Too many scores have already been settled by the ruling party for 33 years. If incumbent rulers also start retaliating with mindless violence and unrestrained utterances, the situation will get worse.        
	What if the same call for indiscipline is given by tomorrows new Opposition? The Opposition may have been bruised and battered for long, but it has no right to provoke the police to revolt. The present, as well as aspiring, rulers of Bengal should learn from the mutiny by Bangladesh Rifles last year. From the art of agitation to the craft of administration, the journey may be long and difficult, but potential rulers have to embrace the challenge.

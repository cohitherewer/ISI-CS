The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | In an ancient land tainted by many vices
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        IN AN ANCIENT LAND TAINTED BY MANY VICES                                  Today, India stands at a dangerous intersection because of the frightening level of corruption that plagues its civil and military institutions, writes Abhijit Bhattacharyya                          Poor example                                  
	It suddenly seems that a truly wonderful season has befallen the wonder that is India. Indeed, one is at a loss when it comes to prioritizing which one of the issues that the season brought to light should be dealt with first. Should it be the land scam involving serving generals, the adventures of a turbulent states former governor, or the past misdeeds of a retired police chief? The threats posed by the Taliban and the al Qaida, the adventurous diplomacy of the Han kingdom, and the innumerable instances of corruption spanning the length and breath of India could also be included for examination. However, to an avid follower of the goings-on in our country, it is the misdeeds of the bureaucracy which pose the biggest and gravest threat to this wonderful nation.        
	What are the reasons behind this supposition? The shelf-life of a civil servant in critical and sensitive positions can be anything between 32 -38 years. Compare this with the longevity of an average minister. It could be anywhere between 32 days to 38 months or some more time. Similarly, what is the durability of military men in senior positions in the armed forces? Hardly 0.5 per cent would be the correct answer, as very few senior armymen can afford to aspire for a good outing in an elevated position. By comparison, a civil servant is considered to be the boss from the day he joins that exclusive club.        
	It does not require any special skill to make out how a small section of the entire bureaucracy is holding the nation to ransom. For this, one merely has to go to the field  ports, airports, railway and police stations, Central revenue building, the district headquarters or the offices of the district collector  and savour the experience.        
	Such an experience would go a long way in compiling an impressive datum of facts and figures to create an encyclopedia of corruption in India. The experience would also offer a wonderful opportunity to learn how not to use bona fide power to abuse the system with mala fide motives. The biggest gain, however, could be that an exercise such as this will surely help in identifying a malicious and motivated fraternity among the various actors in the establishment.              
	Today, the whole of India is singing the chorus of retribution on the former police chief of a northern state for his horrendous act perpetrated on a young girl. But Indians must remember that the country is not yet run by a dictator or an autocrat who rules the roost. In reality, no crime can be committed or go undetected unless there exists a chain of connivance that binds various actors who are actively engaged in shielding the perpetrator. S.P.S Rathores crime has come to light after almost two long decades. But there exist innumerable other Rathores who remain unobserved or are too deeply embedded in the system, which is prone to ignore the worst crimes of the chair. It is equally indifferent to or negligent of the need to reward the good and the efficient. Else, how did Rathores unpardonable act go unpunished by the powerful establishment?        
	Enlightenment indeed is the catchword. A man in uniform can get away with almost anything, including the molestation of a teenager. The criminals subordinates are his puppets, while his superiors are individuals who may share similar objectionable habits.        
	This is all part of a dangerous game that is being played out within the pillars of our enlightened democracy in which the Centre has no role to play within the fiefdoms of the regional satraps. The police can never be rubbed the wrong way either. Are not they supposedly the custodians of law and order? But in reality, they look after their bosss interests and save them from the threats of an attack emanating from every side. Hence, there is a need to protect the few delinquents and tolerate their harmless activity of molesting teenaged girls.        
	Several other such incidents have also taken place elsewhere in the country. This is neither a State nor a military secret. On many occasions, an inefficient and corrupt civil servant has been successful in getting an important posting with the help of his personal machinations. Moreover, there are also numerous instances of civil servants in responsible and sensitive positions looting the country of its riches with their divine right to rule.              
	Of late, there have also been a few instances in which senior armymen such as majors or lieutenant-generals have found themselves in the dock. But there is one major difference in this context. On most occasions, the army takes prompt action against its errant members. This is not the case with the civilian administration. It may take the authorities years to bring guilty bureaucrats to book. In fact, precious time is lost when it comes to taking deterrent action against the culprits. It is often the case that an accused dies even before a judgment is passed against him. Thus, there is seldom any dearth of professional law-keepers turning into talented law- breakers while on duty. This tradition now appears to have contaminated Indias erstwhile spotless military high command as well.        
	The truth is that today, India stands at a difficult and treacherous crossroads owing to the frightening level of corruption in the ranks of its civil and military institutions. The tragedy is that a benign indifference exists at the level of the political class when it comes to tackling the impending threat that can destroy the base that holds the countrys political identity together. So much so that virtually every corner of the Indian continent appears to be sitting on a proverbial tinder box.        
	A cursory look at the list would reveal the real extent of the imminent threat. Several members of the judiciary have been found to be mired in corruption. Army generals, too, are in league with the unscrupulous and tax-evading trading class. The revenue departments are notorious for their inability to do the right thing owing to unbridled greed for cash and land. Civil administrators have also been found to keep the company of wheeler-dealers and fixers in New Delhi. Police action against such individuals is conspicuous by its absence. Even hospitals have turned into dens of corruption. The same goes for education institutions in some parts of the country which have earned notoriety for their unprincipled conduct.              
	If Indians do not try and curb such devastating corruption that plagues their country, the time is not far when foreign elements will take it upon themselves to do what Indias citizens should have been doing in the first place. Real power, in keeping with the past, will then be returned to the hands of those who may be anything but Indians.

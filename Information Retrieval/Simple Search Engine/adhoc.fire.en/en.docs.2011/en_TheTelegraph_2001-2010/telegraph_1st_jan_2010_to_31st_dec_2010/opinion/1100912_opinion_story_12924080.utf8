                              Funny take      
	If you thought that Indias political leaders fail to appreciate the lighter side of life, think again. Under that thick veneer of seriousness, the Union home minister, P Chidambaram, hides a deadly sense of humour. His wit was on full display at a recent press meet on a very solemn subject  Indias internal security. Pleasantly surprised by the informal atmosphere, the assembled scribes began shooting questions at Chidambaram. Someone asked the minister if he was aware that militants from the Lashkar-e-Toiba were setting up base in Kerala. Looking the questioner in the eye, Chidambaram asked if he would consider joining the Intelligence Bureau. Next, the home minister was asked about his intention to visit strife-torn Kashmir. Chidambaram answered that he was actually planning to shift base to Srinagar. The scribes, surprised by PCs wit, laughed to their hearts content.                        
	We dont quite know if controlling unruly men in the Lok Sabha is boring the Speaker, Meira Kumar, to death. But she has now taken up the responsibility of strengthening Indias ties with many third world countries. Kumar is leading an all-woman delegation on a 10-day tour to Kenya to attend the executive committee meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the 56th Commonwealth parliamentary conference for women. The Speaker seems to be making full use of her experience as a former IFS officer. She is literally going places  Swaziland in May, and Mongolia for a global economic conference. Perhaps travel helps in taking her mind off the bunch of belligerent men in whites.                        
	 The Congress owes the Bharatiya Janata Party a favour or two for helping it pass the nuclear liability bill. So the former could not but give in to the BJPs demand that PC Chacko, who was on the panel to chair the Lower House, be banned from presiding over the House. Sushma Swaraj, the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, had written to the Speaker, Meira Kumar, against Chacko and threatened to boycott Parliament if the ban on the MP was not imposed. It so happened that while speaking on illegal mining during a discussion, Lal Singh, an MP from Jammu and Kashmir, went hammer and tongs at the Reddy brothers. This seemed to majorly upset J Shantha, the BJP MP from Bellary, who interrupted Singh repeatedly. Singh did not take these interruptions kindly and, on one occasion, apparently had this to say to Shantha: Kya aap bhi usme hai, aapka maal bheech me hai (are you also in this, is your money also in this?). The BJP sprang to Shanthas aid, and demanded that Chacko, who was chairing the session, expunge the words. Chacko, however, found nothing objectionable. Chacko may not have much to complain about, however. He will no longer have to suffer the experience of taking such difficult decisions.                            
	 Now that the prime minister has announced that he will increase representation from the youth, there is hope that some members of Team Rahul, especially from the Dalit community, will make it to the cabinet. But the Dalit front-runners do not have age on their side. One is PL Punia. He is 65 years old, and joined the Congress after falling out of favour with both Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati. The other probable candidate is the 54-year-old Kamal Kishor, who is a Gandhi loyalist. The former NSG commando has obediently done the partys bidding. He even shifted his constituency from Gorakhpur to Bahraich in accordance to Sonia Gandhis wishes. Kishor was reportedly wooed by Behenji, but he stood steadfast behind the Gandhi family and the Congress. The cake, if any, may go to him, and Punia may be given the chairmanship of the SC/ST commission after Buta Singh steps down.                            
	 At a time when the Commonwealth Games have run into a host of problems, the Union minister for tourism, Kumari Selja, has ordered her ministry to prepare a number of Commonwealth packages to coincide with the troubled games. A closer scrutiny would make it obvious that they are actually outbound packages that are most likely to be used by Delhi residents keen to stay away from the national capital during the event.                      
	Thanks to Sushma Swaraj, the Opposition is cultivating a new image. But Swaraj hasnt quite managed to get everyone convinced about the need to change things. There is resentment among the saffronwallahs, many of whom have alleged that she is turning the BJP into a B-team of the Congress. As if acquiescing over the nuclear liability bill was not enough, Swaraj visited the Veer Bhumi uninvited and called up Sonia Gandhi to inquire about her mothers health. But Swaraj isnt the only talk of the town. There is also Murli Manohar Joshi, who has suddenly taken to wearing designer kurtas. He can now be seen sharing a joke or two with journalists and intervening on practically all subjects in the Lok Sabha. He also speaks up for allies. Recently, a JD(U) MP was being denied time by the chair to speak till Joshi came to his rescue.

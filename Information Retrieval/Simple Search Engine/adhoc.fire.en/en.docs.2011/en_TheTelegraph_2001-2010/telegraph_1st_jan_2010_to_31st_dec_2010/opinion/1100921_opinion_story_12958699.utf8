                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        SHAKE UP THE SYSTEM                                  Malvika Singh                              
	India remains an adolescent democracy, full of the tantrums and petulance of a kid trying to mature into a responsible adult. The sad truth is that when one political dispensation replaces another, the incoming head of government spends his valuable and limited time and resources undoing all the initiatives and experiments of the outgoing chief minister in a rather unnecessary manner. More often than not, this is a knee-jerk reaction that hardly brings about any positive result. As we know, corruption is all-pervasive in India, and no individual or party in the political or administrative arena has addressed this debilitating illness.         
	There are examples that illustrate this reality. In one particular case, a section of the Central Secretariat was cleaned and spruced up, and transformed into a place where the public could arrive with its grievances, and also when summoned. The partitioned office cells, which have become the hallmark of a government office, were replaced by open spaces where officers could either be seen working or doing nothing. The bureaucrat, as a rule, hates such architecture because it compels him to at least pretend to work. Incompetent chief executives too  men and women who are the political bosses, who are insecure about their ability to govern well and with integrity  prefer closed-door cubicles from where they can operate under cover.         
	One sachivalaya was restored and reinvented, and made to look, feel and smell like an open and clean space. It was embellished with wonderful art, both antique and contemporary, which lay unattended and decaying in the basements of government institutions earlier.                
	Gross misuse        
	Today, with a change in the government of that state, the treasures are back in the basement, the restored carpets have been folded back to collect dust and mould, accusations of every kind are flying about, and the horrid smells and filth, along with lethargic babus presiding over their tiny cubicle kingdoms, have returned to haunt, insult and embarrass the public.        
	Often, a chief minister who is well acquainted with the changing mores and is conscious of the aspirations of a new generation steps out of the box, so to say, restructures cultural policy, initiates new projects, and then the new incumbent just damns those changes, stalls them and more often than not, throws them into the waste bin. This amounts to a gross misuse of municipal and public funds. Other initiatives for good governance are also jettisoned. Such a way of functioning is not democratic, but frighteningly dictatorial.        
	To be austere and Gandhian does not mean one must discard beauty, art, restoration projects and suchlike. Sadly, there is a breed of politicians in this country who know no better, who are unable to comprehend a changing modern world where the demands for clean governance are becoming extremely important. The time has come to celebrate the good work done. Let us not get into parochial positions that demean the larger good and, in turn, the people of India.        
	We need a radical overhaul in the cast of characters who rule us. We desperately require modern, creative, non-dogmatic and energetic minds regardless of age. We cannot tolerate regressive leaders who prefer the obsolete and strangle change. Political parties must make their redundant members retire, and let in fresh faces with new ideas and an inclination to shake up the sleeping, lazy system. India will be caught in the status quo that our top leaders have shielded themselves with as they wait for the term to end. In this atmosphere, individual likes and dislikes take precedence over change and reinvention.

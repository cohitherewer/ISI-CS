The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | Rule With An Iron Fist
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        RULE WITH AN IRON FIST                                  Sumanta Sen                              
	Indira Gandhi had once said, You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist. She was referring to Pakistan, but her words are applicable in other spheres too. It is not known whether the chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, remembers what the former prime minister had said but he would do well to refresh his memory. The incident at Lakhisarai ought to make him realize that where Maoists are concerned, the State has to be firm.         
	When Nitish Kumar had stayed away from the meeting that the home minister, P. Chidambaram, had called with chief ministers of the Maoist-affected states in Calcutta, he said that he had other plans of tackling the Maoists, and that they did not necessarily involve the use of force. If his attitude had been different, Lakhisarai might not have happened.        
	But Nitish Kumar is not the only one who is against the use of force. Ever since the Centre and the states launched a joint operation against the Maoists, some groups have been clamouring for a peaceful settlement of the problem through talks. Some of these people have sympathies for the Maoists, but they are unwilling to admit this. Instead, they seem to be suggesting that the Maoists are merely people who have gone astray by mistake, and that they can be made to see reason through negotiations across the table.         
	The Maoists have not gone astray. They have deliberately chosen the path of armed uprising and they follow a distorted interpretation of a political philosophy in support of their choice. They are not people with a memorandum of demands that can be discussed and a settlement reached. The advocates of talks will do well to answer a simple question: do they really believe that those who have launched a war against society will agree to meet the oppressive State halfway and settle for a few development projects here and there? Will they, after a few rounds of talks, scratch their heads and admit that they are in the wrong and become peace-loving citizens?                 
	Hard option        
	And what about the State? Should it read the scriptures to those who believe that it is only the gun that can do the talking for them? The State has a responsibility towards its citizens, and it must take up the challenge when called upon to do so. As for the do gooders, they have another question to answer: why is it that they are always up in arms, be it against plans to construct an irrigation project or tackling the Maoists? They have formed a kind of a club whose members can be counted upon to oppose the State, no matter what the purpose. When they speak against the joint operations, do they think of the poor people who have been slain by the Maoists?         
	It is interesting to note that while these activists claim that politics has no place in their scheme of things, they are often at the beck and call of politicians who have their own axe to grind. Thus, in Bihar, Lalu Prasad is currently mightily pleased with the Maoist activities as he sees in them evidence of his contention that the talk of development during Nitish Kumars regime is just hogwash. Leaders like him want to bury the fact that the Maoists themselves are keen to thwart all development plans.         
	Maoism, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has repeatedly asserted, constitute the biggest threat to Indias internal security. It is now time for the prime minister to make it clear that people, including those in his own party, must stop suggesting that a softer approach be taken towards the Maoists. There is little point in saying, as is the case very often, that after all they are our own people. So are criminals of all shades. Should they also be dealt with lightly?

	Albert Einstein once said that filing a tax return is too difficult for a mathematician: it takes a philosopher. The direct taxes code bill tabled in Parliament on Monday is this governments attempt at reformist legislation that is crisp, certain and one that will make it easier for most people and companies to pay their taxes without lightening their wallets too much or burdening their conscience too heavily. But the final version of the DTC is neither reformist, crisp nor certain. The broad aims of a single DTC were to reduce the scope for litigation, make tax law simple and understandable (thereby reducing the cost of compliance), keep it flexible (reduce the frequency of amendments) and provide stability (helping individuals and companies to plan long-term). The original draft DTC envisaged a cut in slabs and tax rates that would result in 95 per cent of all taxpayers falling within the lowest bracket (10 per cent), and had capped the highest tax rate at 25 per cent. A rapidly changing global dynamic has, however, scared the government into retreating from such an audacious gamble: the highest tax rate has been retained at 30 per cent. In fact, many observers say the tabled version is vastly diluted from its first draft. The new DTC isnt very new: it is longer than the current Income Tax Act  it has more than 300 sections compared to the current 297, and 22 schedules compared to the current 14.        
	A big problem with current IT law is that certain sections permit a plethora of exemptions, many of which conflict with other provisions of the IT Act. With the discretion given to the tax authorities on interpretation, there are a few lakh cases pending resolution in various tribunals over the correct interpretation. True, the language has been simplified: in calculating tax liability, the DTC uses mathematical formulae that are very specific, rather than ambiguous terminology. However, a number of exemptions still remain, like the one on interest on housing loans; at the same time, the DTC is silent on how house rent allowance will be treated.        
	It poses a larger problem for employers, who may find that their personnel costs could go up by a significant amount. Experts believe that there will always be amendments; for example, in clarifying long-term capital gains tax, the DTC allows for a 100 per cent deduction, rather than removing it entirely. In other words, future governments can reintroduce it. Other taxes have been raised: the minimum alternative tax is no longer minimum, and hiked to 20 per cent of book profits. Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the finance minister to King Louis XIV, said that the art of taxation consists of plucking the goose to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the least amount of hissing. The DTC causes more hissing.

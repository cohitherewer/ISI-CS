	The dire state of the finances of the West Bengal government has been in focus of late. To avert a severe cash crunch, the state government hurriedly mopped up Rs 500 crore from the market in addition to hiking value added tax by 1 per cent  an exercise that is expected to bring in Rs 200 crore annually. The finance minister, Asim Dasgupta, was quick to point out that this was a temporary problem and not a crisis, and to blame the Central government for the situation. After all, the Centre owes the state Rs 7,000 crore. But the truth is that even if there were such a due which was to be paid by the Centre, the fiscal crisis of the state is too grave to be addressed by the inflow of a single payment of Rs 7,000 crore and an annual Rs 200 crore.        
	According to a report, State Finances: A Study of Budgets 2009-10, of the Reserve Bank of India, West Bengal tops the list of 17 non-special category states in terms of the indebtedness of its people as a collective entity at 42.2 per cent of its gross state domestic product. The corresponding figures for some other states are 26.1 per cent for Maharashtra and 25.5 per cent for Karnataka. The report shows how, in 2008-09, the state registered a revenue deficit of 3.7 per cent of the GSDP, the highest in the country  the perpetual deficit in the revenue account compelled [it] to divert funds from capital to finance revenue deficit, thus bloating the indebtedness year after year. Consequently, over a five-year average, the state has spent Rs 2,766 per head as development expenditure compared to Rs 5,322 in Karnataka and Rs 7,804 in Maharashtra, and on social sectors like education, health or food distribution, a mere Rs 2,066 compared to Rs 5,219 in Maharashtra, Rs 3,081 in Karnataka, and on capital outlay only Rs 339 compared to Maharashtras Rs 2,024 and Karnatakas Rs 1,493.        
	Dasgupta has been less than forthright regarding disclosures of deficits in his budgets. In his budget speech for 2010-11, he stated that total expenditure, taking plan and non-plan expenditure together, will stand at Rs 7,6432.07 crore [while] total receipt will be Rs 7,6318.07 crore [resulting in] an initial deficit of Rs 114.0 crore. This statement, taken at face value, does not show the true picture. Normal accounting practice requires the total receipt to reflect the sum of revenue and capital inflows and expenditure as the sum of revenue and capital outflows. If computed this way, it results in a deficit of Rs 22,832.12 crore as per the governments own figures. This explains both the current years deficit and the accumulated deficit as well as the consequent outlandish borrowings. If what the finance minister projected was correct, there would have been no reason to borrow such large sums.        
	The major concern right now is that West Bengals own tax collection as a percentage to GSDP is on a downward slide. In case you were comforting yourself by saying that the fiscal situation cannot get any worse now that we have hit rock bottom, there is more. After the reversal in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, the Left Front government created around 1.2 lakh jobs in schools, colleges and municipalities with an eye on the 2011 assembly elections. In addition, the dearness allowance of its 10 lakh employees and around 4 lakh pensioners has been increased, costing the government a further Rs 950 crores. With revenue receipts dwindling and expenses of the government going up steadily, the fiscal situation can only get worse.

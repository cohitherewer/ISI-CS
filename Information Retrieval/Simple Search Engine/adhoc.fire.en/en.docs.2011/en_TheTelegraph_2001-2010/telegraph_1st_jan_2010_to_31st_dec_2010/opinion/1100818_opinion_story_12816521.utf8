	The real test                  
	Sir  Three cheers to Ramachandra Guha for holding forth on Test cricket, which is on the verge of being deliberately sacrificed at the altar of other formats such as one-day cricket and Twenty20 (Three cheers for Test cricket, Aug 14) . Crickets organizers alone are not to be blamed for this. The changing taste of cricket-lovers has contributed to the radical alterations in the games complexion. For instance, shorter versions of the game have got the better of the long one. To put it differently, the wedge between tradition and modernity in cricket has widened. Guha, who possesses a keen cricketing sense, has succeeded in analysing the character of Test cricket. Old-timers like us will hardly object to his reasoned analysis that draws on his long experiences as a cricket columnist.          
	Thanks to modern communication, cricket has become more accessible. Anyone interested in the game can now follow the events online, ball-by-ball, with the aid of live commentary. But it is undeniable that some of the romance associated with cricket has disappeared. Greater access and scrutiny have enhanced scepticism. Scribes of an earlier generation were not obliged to dwell upon topics that have become the staple subject matter of contemporary cricket-writers. Cricket is characteristically holistic. Cricket writing ought to be the same.          
	Guha has brilliantly compared the last Test played between India and Sri Lanka with another match played 40 years ago that saw India beat Australia at the Feroz Shah Kotla. The comparison not only refreshed our memories but also made Guhas article unique. Guha has managed to capture every twist and turn witnessed during the match with his uncanny flair. It must be remembered that Test cricket has retained its charm because of these twists and turns that continue to thrall cricket-lovers.          
	It is thus unfortunate that Test cricket has had to make way for shorter versions of the game. One-day internationals and T20 have their own moments of thrill and splendour, but that does not mean that Tests should be relegated to the periphery.           
	In conclusion, one must pledge ones support for Test cricket. After all, this form of the game is associated with some great names such as Don Bradman, Garfield Sobers, Sachin Tendulkar and so on.                    
	Yours faithfully, P.B. Saha, Calcutta            
	Sir  I completely agree with Ramachandra Guhas views on Test cricket. These days, most people seem to have lost interest in this format. But it is a fact that the longer version of the game is the ultimate test of a cricketers abilities. Unlike ODIs and T20, which are dominated by batsmen, Test cricket has something in store for the bowlers too, especially on the first morning and on the last couple of days. A batsmans technique, temperament and character are called to the test in this version.          
	The International Cricket Council must look at ways to preserve Test cricket. The prize money is higher in ODIs and T20 than in Test cricket. Naturally, younger players are more keen to play in these formats.They do not enjoy the rigours of Test cricket, and, given a chance, would save their best for ODIs and T20 cricket.          
	Yours faithfully,       
Chirag Mandal, Howrah

                
	Difficult neighbour          
	Sir  Kanwal Sibal deserves praise for exposing Pakistans diplomatic double-facedness (Ready with a long rope, Aug 11). I wonder why India has failed to learn from the mistakes it has made while formulating policies concerning Pakistan. As is evident from Sibals critical analysis, relations between India and Pakistan are going through one of their worst phases. Indias repeated attempts to normalize ties with Pakistan is looked upon by that countrys establishment as a sign of Indias inherent weakness. This is a matter of great shame for every Indian citizen. What is the reason behind Indias apparent weakness while dealing with its neighbour? A one-sided friendly approach can never bear any fruit. A country that deflects international attention from its role in patronizing terrorists and threatens to weaken Indias secular foundations and economic development can never be Indias friend. But this simple truth eludes Indias leaders. India should break all diplomatic relations with Pakistan immediately after lodging a strong protest against its neighbour with the international community.          
	In his article, Sibal mentions that the recent talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries ended in failure. One wonders if there is any use in talking to a neighbouring country whose hatred for India has been manifest on many occasions. I would urge Indian leaders to shake off their weaknesses and prepare themselves for the battles ahead to promote peace and prosperity in the subcontinent.                    
	Yours faithfully, Dilip Kumar Kar, Jalpaiguri

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Opinion | from denial to decay
                                                                                                                         5                                                                                        FROM DENIAL TO DECAY                                  Malvika Singh                              
	The after-effects of an over-regulated and stifling command economy that India had to operate within for 40-odd years, after its liberation from another form of command, have been most terrible. In the first decade of Independence, parameters were set and institutions created, which were led by the government and ruled by the babu, who replaced, first, the feudal lord, and later, the colonial lord. We have never been liberated from the stranglehold of the few who have kept civil society out of the loop when formulating policies for the majority. Our examples to choose from are three  the royals, the colonials and the babus.        
	The command economy professed that its mandate was to bring a basic level of equality into play  roti, kapda aur makan, as well as health, education and basic infrastructure of water, electricity, roads and law and order. It failed on all fronts because it only delivered for the few and not for India. Today, in an era of restructuring, the babu is more destructive than the worst of the colonials and feudals. Sadly, the elected representatives of the people  the politicians  have ceased to control the errant babus. Whether they are in the municipalities or in the exalted offices of the Central and state governments or administering the far-flung districts of this exploited and neglected nation, the babus leave much to be desired.        
	We tend to hurl abuse at political leaders for ineptitude and corruption but spare the errant babu, who deftly twists the system from behind the scenes and with zero accountability. In sharp contrast, politicians have to return to the hustings to win again while all that the babus have to do is curry favour with the incoming bosses, do their bidding, and lead protected lives at the cost of the tax-payer. The babu and his babudom have become the single-largest scandal in the public domain.                 
	A different low        
	From a hard-working labourer in the street, or one in rural India, to corporate honchos, wealthy citizens, and everyone in between, the consensus on the role of the babu is rooted in personal experiences of exploitation, corruption, sometimes extortion, stalling of development and change, class and caste discrimination, and more. Deviations from the code of conduct mandated to the babus happen 24X7, with no accountability, as they harass those they are meant to protect. They are not respected as they once were in the Fifties and Sixties. The nation is united in its disapproval of their tactics. Indians across the spectrum beat the system rather innovatively, not because they are corrupt, but because they want to avoid having anything to do with the fearsome, debilitating babu.        
	So, this edifice that was conceived as the staunch backbone of a young nation-state fast succumbed to corrupt practices, as the babu condoned deviations from the laws of the land in an effort to please rapacious political bosses. The spine of India has hunched over, and its many vertebrae are in denial as the marrow becomes poisoned and the bone disintegrates.         
	Who will stem the rot? Will the educated, cosmopolitan youth, from the towns and cities, who have grown up without the baggage of post- Independent India, aspire to join politics or the administrative services and embrace the challenge of building a great power? Will we pull ourselves out of the cutting-a-deal phenomena for every single thing that happens in this benighted country? The scale of illegalities has soared to unimaginable heights. Ordinary, intelligent mortals believe that corruption has been replaced by loot. Being in denial, the existing colonial anthem, needs to be changed to a democratic mantra, We shall not be denied, we shall, together, overcome.

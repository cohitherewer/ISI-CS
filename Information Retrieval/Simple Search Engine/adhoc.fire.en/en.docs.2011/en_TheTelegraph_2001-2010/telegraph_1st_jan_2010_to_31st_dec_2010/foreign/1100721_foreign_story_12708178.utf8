          J HEMANTH                               
	Kathmandu, July 20: The race for Nepals premiership picked up momentum today with top leaders of the three main parties including Maoist supremo Prachanda announcing their candidature at the eleventh hour even as the deadline for the nominations ended this evening.         
	Apart from Prachanda Nepali Congress Vice President Ram Chandra Poudel and CPN-UML chairman Jhala Nath Khanal also filed their nomination for the prime ministers election scheduled to be held tomorrow.         
	The three leaders filed their nominations after the political parties failed to evolve a consensus on the structure and composition of the next coalition government and also a common prime ministerial candidate.         
	Though the Nepali Congress took the lead and announced the candidature of Poudel two days ago, the Maoists and the CPN-UML did so at the last minute owing to internal differences.         
	The Maoists were divided on the issue of putting up a candidate as the party had no hopes of winning the election despite being the single largest party in the parliament. The CPN-UML which headed the outgoing government was also bogged by infighting with a major section of the party led by outgoing Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal opposing the moves of the faction headed by Khanal to head the next government.         
	While the Maoists have 237 lawmakers in the 601-member parliament, the Nepali Congress has 114 and the CPN-UML has 109. The Terai-based Madhesi parties have about 80 lawmakers and their support would be crucial of all the three candidates.         
	The CPN-UML decided to back Khanals candidature with a fiat that he would contest the polls only if he had a chance of emerging as a consensus candidate. Talking to reporters after filing his nomination, Khanal said he was confident of getting the support of all the parties including the Maoists. The other two candidates will withdraw their nomination to pave the way for me to lead the new government, quot;he said.

	Clooney knot     
	 London, Jan. 5 (PTI): Actor George Clooney is all set to end his days as a bachelor with rumours suggesting that he is planning to tie the knot with his Italian girlfriend.       
	The 48-year-old, famed as a ladies man, has been dating actress Elisabetta Canalis for the past five months and wants to finally settle down, reports the Daily Star. The 31-year-old had met Clooney while he was holidaying in Italy and the pair have been inseparable since.       
	He seems to be truly ready to walk down the aisle with Elisabetta, said a friend of Clooney. The Oceans Eleven star, who has twice been voted the Sexiest Man Alive by People magazine, had earlier said in interviews that he would never marry.

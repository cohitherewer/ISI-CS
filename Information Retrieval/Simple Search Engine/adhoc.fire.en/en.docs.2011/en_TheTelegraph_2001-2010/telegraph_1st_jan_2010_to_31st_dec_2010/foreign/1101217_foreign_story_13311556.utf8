	Kathmandu, Dec. 16 (AP): All 22 people aboard a small plane that went missing were killed when it crashed in Nepals rugged east, apparently after its wing clipped a mountaintop, the civil aviation minister said today.        
	 The wreckage was located about 160km east of the capital, the Rescue Coordination Committee at Kathmandu Airport said. The bodies were flown to the capital by rescue helicopters.        
	 Civil aviation minister Sharad Singh Bhandari said the government was investigating the crash. Our preliminary findings indicate that the planes right wing clipped the edge of a mountain and the plane crashed after that, Bhandari said.        
	The aircraft had been chartered to carry pilgrims to a Hindu temple and was on its way back to the capital.        
	Debris from the plane was scattered over a 300-metre radius on the side of a mountain, police official Bhesh Bahadur Thapa said in a telephone interview from near the crash site.        
	The Canadian-built Twin Otter aircraft operated by domestic Tara Air took off on Wednesday from Lamidanda, about 320km east of Kathmandu, and then disappeared.        
	Airport official Dinesh Shrestha said three rescue aircraft including an army helicopter scoured the area last evening and early today and located the crash site.        
	The three crew members were Nepali nationals. One of the passengers was a Tibetan holding a US passport. Officials were trying to identify the remaining 18 passengers, but indicated many were believed to be Bhutanese nationals.        
	A team of Bhutanese officials arrived in Kathmandu today and were trying to find out if their citizens were on the flight.        
	Paras bail        
	Former crown prince Paras Shah was freed on bail today after being detained for firing a gun into the air after an argument, officials said. He had been held by police since Tuesday after firing his gun after a weekend argument with two guests at a jungle resort.

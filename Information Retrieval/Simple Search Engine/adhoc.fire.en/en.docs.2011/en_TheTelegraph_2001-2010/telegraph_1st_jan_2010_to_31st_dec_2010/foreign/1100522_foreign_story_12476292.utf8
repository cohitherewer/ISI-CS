	Islamabad, May 21: The owner of an elite catering company that organised events for American diplomats here has been detained by the Pakistani authorities on suspicion that he helped the Pakistani-American being held for the failed Times Square bombing, a western official said today.        
	The US embassy, in a message sent by email and posted on its website, warned American residents in Pakistan to avoid using the company, Hanif Rajput Caterers, because terrorist groups may have established links to it.        
	The detained caterer, Salman Ashraf Khan, 36, disappeared on May 10, when he failed to arrive at the company headquarters after leaving his house in his car, his father, Rana Ashraf Khan, the chief executive of the company, said in an interview in Islamabad.        
	An official of the ISI said he was not aware of Salman Ashraf Khans arrest. Khan and a close friend and business associate, Ahmed Raza Khan, were detained the same day, Rana Ashraf Khan said.

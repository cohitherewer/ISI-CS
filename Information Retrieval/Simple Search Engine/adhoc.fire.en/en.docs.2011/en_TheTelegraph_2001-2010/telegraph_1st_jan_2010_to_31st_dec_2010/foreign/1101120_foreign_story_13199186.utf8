	Dhaka, Nov. 19: Unidentified men threw Molotov cocktails into the residence of a Bangladesh Chief Justice in a posh area of Dhaka last night where most government ministers and Supreme Court judges live.         
	Chief Justice A.B.M. Khairul Haque was at home during the bombing but no one was injured in the incident.        
	It comes after several judgments were delivered by the High Court including the eviction of BNP chief and former Prime Minister, Khaleda Zia from her house at Dhaka miltary barracks where she had lived for 40 years. The attack also comes after the BNP called fresh protests against the eviction.        
	While the Awami League called the attack an act of vengeance, home minister Shahara Khatun has said that the incident is still under investigation. Those who want to destabilise the country have performed the act, she said.         
	Asked if the bombing is connected with Khaledas eviction , Khatun said if its true, the guilty will be held accountable. We, however, cannot think that someone will hurl the bombs to retain the house. But if it is found that the attack was carried out to retain the house, the people concerned will have to answer for it, Khatun added.         
	Haque had administered the oath of office to two High Court judges  M Ruhul Quddus and M. Khasruzzaman  despite protests. Haques predecessor had refused to do so.         
	The BNP- dominated Supreme Court Bar Association called Quddus and Khasruzzaman murderers and vandals and demanded Haques resignation. The lawyers said Haque had violated the Constitution by administering the oath to the two judges.

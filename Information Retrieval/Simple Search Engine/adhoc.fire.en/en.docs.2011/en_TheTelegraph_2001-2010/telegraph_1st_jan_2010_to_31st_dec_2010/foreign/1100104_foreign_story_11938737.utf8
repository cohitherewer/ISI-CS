The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Death knell for Mujib 5
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Death knell for Mujib 5
                            
	Dhaka, Jan. 3 (Agencies): A judge today signed the death warrants for five former army officers accused of killing Bangladeshs independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, formally setting the clock for their executions within four weeks.        
	Court officials said the signed warrants would be forwarded to the prison authorities immediately and the executions would take place within the next 21 to 28 days.        
	However, the executions may be delayed if the five convicted men seek another review by the supreme court or request presidential clemency.        
	Mujib, whose daughter Sheikh Hasina is Prime Minister, was slain with most members of his family in a revolt by young army officers on August 15, 1975, that ended the nations first spell of democracy and set the stage for a series of coups and foiled coups. Hasina and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana survived the putsch as they were abroad at that time.        
	Fifteen men, mostly former army officers, were sentenced to death by a Dhaka court in 1998, but the high court later reprieved three of them. Of the remaining 12, six fled, one died abroad and the other five remain in prison awaiting execution.         
	The warrant was issued more than two weeks after the apex appellate division of the supreme court rejected the final appeals of the five in Bangabandhus assassination trial.        
	Sessions judge Mohammad Abdul Gafur signed the warrant as court officials submitted the papers in a folder in presence of the public prosecutors.         
	The five convicts are sacked lieutenant colonels Syed Faruq Rahman, Sultan Shariar Rashid Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), A.K.M. Mohiuddin and former major Bazlul Huda.        
	According to the Bangladeshi constitution, death row convicts are entitled to an opportunity to seek a review of the verdict at the appellate division within 30 days, and if rejected they will have a last chance to seek presidential clemency within the subsequent seven days.         
	Senior lawyers and legal experts said the appeals would not bar the counting of days for the execution and if the review petition was accepted the warrant would automatically stand suspended.        
	Defence lawyers had earlier said they had planned to file review petitions against the judgment within the stipulated time.

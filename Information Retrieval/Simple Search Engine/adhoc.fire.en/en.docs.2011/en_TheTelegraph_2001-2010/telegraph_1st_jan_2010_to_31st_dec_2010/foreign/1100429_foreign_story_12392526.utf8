          CLAUDINE BEAUMONT                          Privacy issues                                  
	April 28: Four Democrat senators have written to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks founder and chief executive, to reverse recent changes to the site that will allow users information to be shared more widely with third-party websites.        
	Preferred partners, such as Pandora, Yelp and the new Microsoft Docs service, would be given access to public information on Facebook profiles, such as names, friends lists, and the likes and interests of users. Third-party websites will no longer be obliged to delete this data after 24 hours, and, crucially, Facebook users are opted in to the service automatically, and must actively opt out to avoid sharing their information with other people or companies.        
	Michael Bennet, the senator for Colorado, Mark Begich, who represents Alaska, Al Franken, the senator for Minnesota, and Charles Schumer, the senator for New York, made a joint statement in the Senate opposing the changes. They called on the US Federal Trade Commission to lay down strict guidelines that would safeguard privacy on social networking sites.        
	Now, users have less control over private information, and it was done without the users permission, said Senator Schumer, referring to the changes that were announced last week in San Francisco.        
	We [have written to Mark Zuckerberg] to express our concern regarding recent changes to the Facebook privacy policy and the use of personal data on third party websites, said the senators.

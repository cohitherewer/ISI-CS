	London, April 23: Sleeping on a problem really works, scientists have claimed after discovering dreams are the brains way of getting to grips with complex issues         
	Researchers at Harvard Medical School believe that sleeping  and dreaming  after learning a complex task or piece of knowledge helps your brain make sense of and consolidate it.         
	They found that if a person learns a task and then sleeps on it they could be up to 10 times better at it than if they had stayed awake.         
	A group of 99 volunteers were asked to sit in front of a computer screen and learn the layout of a three-dimensional maze. The aim was to learn to find their way to a landmark  a tree  when they were dropped at a random location within the virtual space five hours later.         
	Those who were allowed to take a nap and then dreamt of the task found the tree in less time. They were actually 10 times better at the task than those that did not sleep or those that did not dream, the researches found. The findings suggest that sleeping on the job or daydreaming can actually be a way of getting better at a complex task.         
	Professor Robert Stickgold, of Harvard Medical School, who led the study, said: Whats got us excited, is that after nearly 100 years of debate about the function of dreams, this study tells us that dreams are the brains way of processing, integrating and really understanding new information.         
	Dreams are a clear indication that the sleeping brain is working on memories at multiple levels, including ways that will directly improve performance.         
	In fact, this may be one of the main goals that led to the evolution of sleep. If you remain awake, you perform worse on the subsequent task. Your memory actually decays, no matter how much you might think about the maze.         
	He said it was not that the dreams led to better memory, but rather that they were a sign that other, unconscious parts of the brain were working hard to remember how to get through the virtual maze and the dreams were essentially a side effect of that memory process.         
	Our brain works on the things that it deems are most important, said fellow researcher Erin Wamsley. Every day, we are gathering and encountering tremendous amounts of information and new experiences.         
	It would seem that our dreams are asking the question, How do I use this information to inform my life?         
	Stickgold said there might still be ways to take advantage of this phenomenon for improving learning and memory. For instance, it may be better to study hard before you go to sleep than in the afternoon, or to take a nap after a period of intense afternoon study.

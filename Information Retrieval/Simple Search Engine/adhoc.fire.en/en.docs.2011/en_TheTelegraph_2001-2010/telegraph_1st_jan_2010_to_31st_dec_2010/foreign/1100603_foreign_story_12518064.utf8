The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 12 killed in UK shooting spree
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      12 killed in UK shooting spree
          AMIT ROY                          Derrick Bird                                  
	London, June 2: The Lake District of England is one of the most beautiful and peaceful areas of the country, especially popular with tourists from India, but today it witnessed a horrific nightmare as Derrick Bird, a 52-year-old apparently normal taxi driver, went on the rampage with a shotgun killing 12 people and injuring 25 others before turning the weapon on himself.        
	As the scale of the killings taking place in the county of Cumbria unfolded through the day, it was thought that five had died.        
	Five was certainly thought to be the toll at lunch when David Cameron, the new prime minister presiding over his first prime ministers questions, addressed a sombre Commons chamber.        
	That was grim enough but when Detective Constable Stuart Hyde, a senior police officer involved in the hunt for Bird, called a news conference just after 5pm, there were audible gasps from journalists as he announced: At this stage weve recovered 12 bodies plus Mr Bird. The 25 injured are in a range of conditions. There were two weapons, weve recovered both of them.        
	Birds body was found in a forest after he had driven through picturesque villages, where the crime rate is the lowest in the country, picking off his victims, including women out shopping, at random.        
	In all, police are investigating 30 separate crime scenes.        
	 Its been a truly exceptional and challenging incident that Cumbria Police has had to deal with today, admitted Hyde. This has shocked the people of Cumbria and the country to the core.        
	He pointed out: Cumbria prides itself on being a safe place to work, play and to enjoy life. Its a tightly knit community covering some of the most beautiful countryside in the land. It will take us some time to identify the victims. I wouldnt give a guess to his motivation.        
	This kind of crazed killing is normally associated with America where it is much easier to obtain firearms. The first alert was sounded at 10.35am in the village of Whitehaven after a man was reported to have shot one or more taxi drivers. Shortly afterwards, police said that a number of people had been injured in shootings and urged villagers in Whitehaven, Egremont and Seascale to go home and lock the front door.        
	At 12.41pm, police named Derrick Bird, 52, from Rowrah, near Frizington, as the wanted man, issued a photograph of him and the registration number of his car.        
	 Derrick Bird has been located near Boot at 1.40pm today and we believe he took his own life, the police said when the gunmans body was found in a forest.        
	Police are now piecing together the sequence in which Bird shot his victims.        
	 In the village of Egremont, a woman in her 60s is believed to have been shot dead, while a man is understood to have been killed on the old bridge in the town. Eyewitnesses reported seeing him lying in a pool of blood.        
	In Seascale, it is understood two people were killed. Garry Purdham, son of farmer John Purdham, of Low Boonwood Farm, was believed to have been shot dead at point blank range in a field near Gosforth, a tiny village close to Seascale.        
	A cyclist who spotted Bird but did not understand what was happening had a narrow escape when the gunman ignored him and drove off. Bird got out his car and walked off into the forest when he had decided he had taken enough lives to make whatever point he had wished to make.        
	 The policeman heading the inquiry said: Were not really able to understand at this stage the motivation behind it or whether this was premeditated or random.        
	Todays Lake District killings recall previous massacres in Hungerford, Berkshire, and Dunblane, Scotland.        
	On August 19 1987, loner and gun fanatic Michael Ryan went on a shooting rampage in Hungerford. Armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and at least one hand grenade he shot 16 people dead, including his mother, before killing himself.        
	On March 13 1996, former Scout leader Thomas Hamilton entered the gymnasium at Dunblane Primary School and opened fire on a class of five and six year olds, killing 16 children and their teacher. In a shooting spree which lasted less than three minutes, Hamilton, who was armed with two pistols and two revolvers, fired a total of 109 rounds.

                              Man-to-man                            
	Aug. 2: Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has invited Barack Obama, his US counterpart, to face him in a televised one-on-one debate to see who has the best solutions for the worlds problems.        
	The provocative proposal came as Iran dealt with a new wave of international sanctions  driven by Washington  aimed at pressuring the Islamic Republic over its nuclear programme.        
	Towards the end of summer we will hopefully be there for the (UN) General Assembly and I will be ready for one-on-one talks with Obama, in front of the media of course, quot; Ahmadinejad said in an address broadcast live on state television.        
	We are ready to sit down with Obama face-to-face and put the global issues on the table, man-to-man, freely, and in front of the media and see whose solutions are better.        
	Ahmadinejad suggested such a debate last September, which was not taken up by Washington. He said Obamas predecessor, George W. Bush, had declined similar invitations because he was scared.        
	Ahmadinejad has previously said that the US and Israel dont have the courage to attack Iran.        
	During a visit to Brazil at in November, he said an attack on Iran over its suspected nuclear programme was no longer a possibility. The age of military attacks is over, now weve reached the time for dialogue, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Senate passes bill to strip Zardari powers
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Senate passes bill to strip Zardari powers
          NASIR JAFFRY                          President Zardari                                  
	Islamabad, April 15: Pakistan on Thursday took a step forward in stripping President Asif Ali Zardari of sweeping powers to dissolve the parliament and dismiss the Prime Minister, as the Senate unanimously approved package of constitutional reforms.        
	The National Assembly had passed the same package last week after it was finalized by a 36-member constitutional reforms committee comprising lawmakers from all the leading opposition parties and the Pakistan Peoples Party-led coalition government.        
	President Zardari will now sign the bill, which will reverse all controversial changes made by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2003 as part of efforts to prolong his quot;undemocratic quot; rule.        
	The package is approved with 90 votes in favour and none against in the house of 100 members, chairman Senate Farooq H. Naek said announced amidst thumping of desks by members. Prime Minister Yousuf raza Gilani, who will now emerge as the most powerful chief executive was also present in the house.        
	 quot;It is a day symolizing victory of democracy, quot; Gilani said in his address, saying quot;We are now answerable to the nation and the parliament. quot;        
	He said the approval of the package is a landmark in the history of Pakistan, adding quot; We should all now have to work together to strengthen democracy and national institutions. quot;        
	The package, known as 18th amendment bill takes away Presidents powers to dissolve the National Assembly, dismiss a Prime Minister and appoint chiefs of the powerful armed forces.        
	The process to push through the draft bill from the two houses of the parliament has been set into motion at a time when Pakistan Peoples Party government, of which President Zardari is the co-chairman faces pressure from the Supreme Court for implementation of its judgement on notorious National Reconciliation Ordinance, which granted amensty to Zardari and hunderds of other politicians from graft charges.        
	The apex court had struck down the NRO as illegal, which Musharraf had promulgated as part of a pwer sharing deal with opposition leader and former Prime MInister Benazirt Bhutto in October 2007. But she had been killed in a gun and suicide attack during an election rally in the garrison town of Rawalpindi in December same year.        
	The court has also directed the government to re-open money laundering cases against Zardari in Switzerland, which had been closed under the NRO. Swiss government shelved a probe into alleged money laundering against Zardari and his late wife, Benazir Bhutto more than two years ago after the then attorney general Malik Mohammad Qayyum sent a formal request in this regard.        
	Bhutto and Zardari allegedly used Swiss bank accounts to launder about 12 million dollars in bribes paid by different companies seeking contracts for customs inspection in Pakistan in the 1990s.

	Beijing, March 23 (AP): A former medical worker stabbed to death eight young children and wounded five others today in a bloody rampage outside an elementary school in eastern China.        
	The 41-year-old attacker struck in the morning as students arrived for classes, mingling with parents at the school gates before suddenly pulling out his knife and slashing children, according to witnesses interviewed on local television.        
	In the aftermath, doctors treated small children and bodies lay covered in bloody sheets after the attack at Nanping City Experimental Elementary School in Fujian province. Police officers manned a cordon around the school. Some comforted distraught parents. China has witnessed a series of school attacks in recent years, most blamed on people with personal grudges or suffering from mental illness, leading to calls for improved security.        
	The rampage in Nanping was finally stopped by passersby and school security guards and the attacker was arrested, the reports said. The suspect was identified as Zheng Minsheng, 41. Zheng worked as a senior nurse in a community clinic before resigning last June, the official Xinhua News Agency said, quoting Huang Zhongping, spokesman for the Nanping city public security bureau. Zheng was known to have a history of mental illness, said a man surnamed Wu in the Nanping city government office, who would not give his full name.

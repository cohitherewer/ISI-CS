                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Scientist killed in Tehran blast
                            
	Tehran, Nov. 29 (Reuters): Two car bomb blasts killed an Iranian nuclear scientist and wounded another in Tehran today in what Iranian officials called an Israeli or US-sponsored attack on its atomic programme.        
	The bombings, rare attacks in the Iranian capital, occurred ahead of a possible meeting between Iran and major powers next month to discuss its nuclear activity, which western officials suspect is aimed at developing atom bombs. Iran denies this.        
	Majid Shahriyari was martyred and his wife was injured ... Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani and his wife were both wounded, state radio said, referring to the two scientists. The attackers planted a bomb on each of the teachers vehicles.        
	Abbas-Davani has been personally subjected to UN sanctions because of what western officials said was his involvement in suspected nuclear weapons research. He was not seriously injured in the blast, the semi-official Mehr news agency said.        
	Irans atomic energy agency chief Ali Akbar Salehi said Shahriyari had a role in one of its biggest nuclear projects, but did not elaborate, the official news agency Irna reported.        
	Salehi warned enemies not to play with fire by carrying out such attacks. Our nations patience has a limit ... When it is over our enemies will face a tedious fate, Salehi said, as quoted by Irna. Dr Shahriyari was my student for many years and he had good cooperation with the Atomic Energy Organisation.        
	Iranian television showed police and plainclothes security agents examining a silver-coloured Peugeot 206 car with what looked like shrapnel holes in its bonnet.

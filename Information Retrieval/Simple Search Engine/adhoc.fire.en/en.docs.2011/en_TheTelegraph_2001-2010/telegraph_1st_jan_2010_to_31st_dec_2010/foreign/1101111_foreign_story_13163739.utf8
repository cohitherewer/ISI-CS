The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palin takes on reporter in row over reading
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Palin takes on reporter in row over reading
                              Price anger                            
	New York, Nov. 10 (PTI): Former Alaska governor Sarah Palins statement that grocery prices are on the rise in the US has sparked off a war of words with Wall Street Journal reporter Sudeep Reddy, who challenged her inflation claim.         
	 The dispute stems from a speech Palin gave at a business convention in Phoenix, Arizona, criticising the Federal Reserves monetary policy. In the speech, Palin said: Everyone who ever goes out shopping for groceries knows that the prices have risen significantly.        
	Responding to Palins claim, Reddy wrote in his blog that grocery prices have in fact, not risen all that significantly.        
	The consumer price indexs measure of food and beverages for the first nine months of this year showed average annual inflation of less than 0.6 per cent, the slowest pace on record, he pointed out, raising question marks over Palins statement.        
	Angered by Reddys post, Palin wrote on her Facebook page that she read a story in the Journal that contradicted the reporters claim, implying that Reddy perhaps did not read his own newspaper. Now I realise Im just a former governor and current housewife from Alaska, but even humble folks like me can read the newspaper, Palin said.        
	Im surprised a prestigious reporter for the Wall Street Journal doesnt, she wrote, referring to an article on the Journal.        
	While Palin may have dispelled the notion that she doesnt read newspapers, her response to Reddy was not completely accurate, the New York Daily News reported.        
	The WSJ article Palin referred to was Food Sellers Grit Teeth, Raise Prices: Packagers and Supermarkets Pressured to Pass Along Rising Costs, Even as Consumers Pinch Pennies published on November 4.        
	 Food prices are rising, according to the article, but the story centred around the pressure facing supermarkets and restaurants to pass the costs to consumers.

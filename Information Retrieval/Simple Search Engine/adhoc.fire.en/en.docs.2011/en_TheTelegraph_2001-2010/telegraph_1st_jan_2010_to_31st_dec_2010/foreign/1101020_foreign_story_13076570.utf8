	Racy spy strips    
	 Moscow, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Russian spy Anna Chapman posed in the Russian version of Maxim magazine in the most provocative photographs yet to appear of the secret agent who was deported from the US in July.      
	A photograph on www.maximonline.ru shows red-haired Chapman dressed in nylon and lace and posing with a handgun. Anna Chapman has done more to excite Russian patriotism than the Russian soccer team, wrote Maxim.

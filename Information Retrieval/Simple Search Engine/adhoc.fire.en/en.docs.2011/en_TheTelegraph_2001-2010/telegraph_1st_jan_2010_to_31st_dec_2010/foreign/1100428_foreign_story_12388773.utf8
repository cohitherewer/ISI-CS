	April 27: Gawker Media said yesterday that computers belonging to one of its editors, Jason Chen, were seized from his home on Friday in an apparent investigation into the sale of a next-generation Apple iPhone.        
	Gawker suggested the action violated Californias shield law for journalists.        
	The technology blog Gizmodo, which Gawker owns, published articles last week about the phone after buying the device for $5,000 from a person who, according to the site, found it at a bar in California last month.        
	The authorities in San Mateo county are considering criminal charges in connection with the sale of the phone, which Gizmodo returned to Apple last week. Some media writers have said that Gawker Media could find itself in legal trouble if the phone was classified as stolen.        
	Last week, people familiar with the investigation said charges would most likely be filed against the person or people who sold the prototype iPhone, and possibly the buyer. The people were not authorised by their employers to speak on the record. According to the warrant, officers had probable cause that Chens home was used as the means of committing a felony.        
	Gawkers chief operating officer, Gaby Darbyshire, said in a letter to the authorities on Saturday that shield laws protected Chen and his computers. She said Gawker expected the immediate return of his property.        
	Under both state and federal law, a search warrant may not be validly issued to confiscate the property of a journalist, Darbyshire wrote. Jason is a journalist who works full time for our company, she continued, adding that he worked from home, his de facto newsroom.        
	It is abundantly clear under the law that a search warrant to remove these items was invalid. The appropriate method of obtaining such materials would be the issuance of a subpoena, she wrote.

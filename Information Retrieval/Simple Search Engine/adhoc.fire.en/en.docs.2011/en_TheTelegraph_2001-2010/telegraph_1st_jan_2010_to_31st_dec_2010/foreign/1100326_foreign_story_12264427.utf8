	Dhaka, March 25 (AP): Bangladesh has set up a war crimes tribunal to try people accused of murder, torture, rape and arson during its 1971 independence war.        
	A law ministry statement today named three high court judges to sit in the tribunal.         
	Bangladesh began war crimes trials in 1973, but they were halted in 1975 when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated.

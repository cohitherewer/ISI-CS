	Digital Grisham    
	 New Delhi, March 21 (PTI): Fans of John Grisham are in for a double treat. After deciding to pen his first-ever childrens book series, the best-selling author will now make his debut in digital.       
	The two novels in the kids series will be aimed at readers aged between eight and 12. The first book in the series, Theodore Boone, Kid Lawyer, is scheduled for publication on May 25 and will follow the adventures of a 13-year-old amateur attorney who unwittingly becomes involved in a high-profile murder trial. The second book in the series, also featuring Theo, is to be published in 2011.     
	Bruni rival     
	 London (PTI): Move over Carla Bruni, Frances glamorous First Lady. Samantha Cameron, the wife of Britains Opposition Tory leader David Cameron, was no less a supermodel a decade and a half ago. Today the 38-year-old may be carefully cultivating an ordinary look by shunning high fashion for off-the-peg clothes from the high street, but pictures show that she once cut an altogether vampish dash.

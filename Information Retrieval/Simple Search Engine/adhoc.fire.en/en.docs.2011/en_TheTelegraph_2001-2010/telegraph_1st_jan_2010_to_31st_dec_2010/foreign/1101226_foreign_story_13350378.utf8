The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Coming to House floor: iPad
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Coming to House floor: iPad
          MICHAEL D. SHEAR                          Instant access                                  
	Dec. 25: Tucked into a new rule proposed by the incoming House Republican majority are three little words that could fling the chamber  for good or ill  into the 21st century: that impairs decorum.        
	Those three words are added to the long-standing prohibition on the use of electronic devices by lawmakers on the floor of the House.         
	Under the new rule, that ban would be somewhat qualified: Members may not use an electronic device that impairs decorum.        
	What a change.        
	That appears to mean that BlackBerrys, iPhones, iPads and the whole burgeoning universe of applications that run on them are now available to members of Congress even as they are working hard (or not so hard) on the House floor.        
	The rule, if it is adopted without change at the start of the 112th Congress, would still require members to silence their devices. It simply wouldnt do to have Cry Me a River go off as someones ringtone right in the middle of a speech by Speaker John A. Boehner.        
	But as long as the mute switch is on, members will be able to use their phones and tablets during speeches or during the many endless procedural votes.        
	Is that a good thing?        
	There are two ways of looking at the development. On the one hand, the change could allow lawmakers the kind of instant access to information that would help their decision-making.         
	Their advisers could send them important messages even as they speak. And, especially with the iPads bigger screen, lawmakers could abandon the paper copies of bills in favour of electronic versions. You could imagine a member of Congress quickly using Google on their smartphone to check something a colleague had just said. Or logging on to an advocacy website to look up an important fact.        
	On the other hand, less high-minded lawmakers could use the devices to play games, send Twitter messages, do their Amazon shopping, check their bank accounts or find movie listings.        
	Now, lawmakers who are giving a speech from the podium will have to work harder for the attention of their colleagues. When the cameras pull out for the crowd shot of the chamber, one can imagine seeing the tops of a sea of heads, looking down at their devices rather than forward towards the lectern.

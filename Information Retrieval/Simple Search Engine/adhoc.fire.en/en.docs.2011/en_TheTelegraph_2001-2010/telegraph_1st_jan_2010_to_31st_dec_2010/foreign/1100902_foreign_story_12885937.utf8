	Lahore, Sept. 1 (AP): Three bombs ripped through a Shia religious procession in Lahore today, killing 25 people and wounding at least 150 others, police said.        
	The explosions appeared to be the latest in a string of attacks by Sunni extremists against the minority Shias they consider infidels. The bombs exploded at three separate sites as 35,000 Shias marched through the streets of Lahore.        
	After the blasts, the marchers erupted in fury, setting fire to a police station, another police facility, two police cars and three motorcycles, said Zulfiqar Hameed, a senior police officer.         
	The first blast was a time bomb that exploded in the street near a well-known Shia building, Hameed said. Footage of that explosion shown on Geo television showed a small blast erupting amid a crowd of people on the street followed by a large plume of smoke.        
	 Hundreds of people fled from the blast, while others rushed to the area to carry the wounded to safety.        
	Minutes later, with the streets in chaos, a male suicide bomber who appeared about 18 years old tried to force his way into an area where food was being prepared for the marchers and exploded, Hameed said.

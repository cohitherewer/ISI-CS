	Golden glove    
	 June 28: Michael Jackson fans have bought nearly a million dollars worth of the singers memorabilia at an auction held one year after his death, including a sequined glove that sold for $192,000, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The glove studded with Swarovski crystals that Jackson wore during his 1984 Victory Tour was among several trademark items of the King of Pop that sold for more than 10 times their estimated value during the auction timed to coincide with the first anniversary of his death on Friday.    
	Spears slip    
	London (PTI): Pop star Britney Spearss boyfriend stepped in to save her from an embarrassing wardrobe malfunction by lending his shirt. The singer stepped out in a flimsy orange summer dress that kept slipping down. Boyfriend Jason Trawick soon realised her predicament and offered his shirt that the singer wore on top of her dress.     
	Jolie stunt    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Actress Angelian Jolie, who has done some death-defying stunts in her new film Salt, says taking up the movie soon after the birth of her twins was a huge challenge. She first read the script days after giving birth to Vivienne and Knox. Jolie, 35, said it was difficult to imagine making an action-thriller which would involve stunts at that time. Jolie performs most of the stunts herself, including gritty fight sequences.    
	Perry pose    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Pop star Katy Perry has posed topless for Esquire magazine. She is dressed only in high-waisted, old-fashioned underwear and black stripper heels on the cover of the magazine, reports Aceshowbiz. Though the official cover is not out yet, it has hit the Internet.     
	Mel mess    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Actor Mel Gibsons split from Oksana Grigorieva has taken another nasty turn with the Russian singer alleging that the actor often punched her during violent altercations. Though sources close to Gibson said that he did not get violent with Grigorieva, her camp is saying that he is spinning the facts to protect his reputation, reports TMZ online.    
	Mom offer    
	New York (PTI): Singer Justin Beibers mother has been offered $50,000 to pose topless for Playboy. But Pattie Bieber, the 34-year-old single mother who gave birth to the Baby singer at the age of 18, has turned down the offer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak taps China for energy
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pak taps China for energy
                            
	Beijing, July 7 (AP): Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari appealed today to Chinese business leaders for help in developing his countrys ailing energy sector, pointing to nuclear power as one area of growth but making no public mention of a deal with China that has alarmed the US and India.        
	The weeklong visit to China is Zardaris fifth since he came to office in September 2008, underscoring the robust diplomatic, military and commercial ties between the neighbours.        
	Zardari met business leaders in industries ranging from banking to defence in a bid to attract investment to Pakistan, according to a statement from his spokesperson, Farhatullah Babar. He singled out energy as a growth industry in Pakistan, where some areas experience electricity outages of up to 18 hours a day.        
	Authorities planned to feed the grid through hydro, coal, gas, nuclear and renewable energy sources, he said, without elaborating on the growth of nuclear energy.        
	Zardari was expected to meet Chinese President Hu Jintao and sign agreements in trade, public health and other areas. But the spokesperson didnt answer a question on whether they would sign any deals on nuclear power. China agreed in 2008 to build two nuclear power plants for its neighbour, a deal that critics said violated international non-proliferation agreements.        
	Pakistan, which has leaked sensitive nuclear secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea, has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the main international agreement meant to stem the spread of nuclear weapon technology. China signed the treaty in the 1990s.        
	The deal came about after a wide-ranging agreement that allowed the US to sell nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India, which, like Pakistan, is not a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.        
	China, a major arms supplier for Pakistan, shares Islamabads fierce regional rivalry with India.        
	 So far, the plan to build two new reactors at the Chashma site in Pakistans Punjab province has apparently gone forward. But the US and other countries have said it does not have the necessary approval from the 46-country Nuclear Suppliers Group.The US and other NSG states may object to the pending transaction but they cannot prevent China from exporting the reactors. Other countries are not only concerned about leaking nuclear information to rogue states but also the risk of attack from insurgents battling the Pakistani military in the countrys northwest tribal areas adjacent to Afghanistan.

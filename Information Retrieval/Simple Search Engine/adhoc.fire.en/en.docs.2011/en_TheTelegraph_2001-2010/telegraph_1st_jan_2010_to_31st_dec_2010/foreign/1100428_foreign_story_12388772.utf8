The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Korean first to climb 14 peaks
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Korean first to climb 14 peaks
                            
	Kathmandu, April 27 (AP): A South Korean mountaineer made history in the Himalayas today by becoming the first woman to scale the worlds 14 highest mountains, beating a Spanish rival for the record.        
	Oh Eun-sun, 44, crawled on all fours for the final, steep stretch to the peak of Annapurna, her feat broadcast live in South Korea.         
	At the top, she pulled out a South Korean flag, waved, and then wept.        
	Annapurna, at 8,091 metres above sea level, was the last of the 14 Himalayan peaks above the 8,000-metre level she had wanted to conquer. She narrowly beat Edurne Pasaban of Spain to the 14th peak who was seeking to become the first woman to scale all 14 peaks.

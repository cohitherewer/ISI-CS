                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fifth-time lucky for Bridges
                                  
	Los Angeles, March 8 (AP): Jeff Bridges, the affable and well-liked star of Crazy Heart, won the best actor Academy Award, an honour that has eluded him four times before.         
	His first nomination came nearly 40 years ago in 1971.        
	 Once onstage last night, Bridges took a fun and lively victory lap, thanking his parents, collaborators, agent and his wife and three daughters.        
	Thank you mom and dad for turning me on to such a groovy profession, a clearly pleased Bridges said in accepting the award. He spoke about how his father, the late actor Lloyd Bridges, used to sit him on a bed and teach him the basics of acting. His mother was the actress Dorothy Bridges.        
	This is honouring them as much as it is me, Bridges said of his parents.        
	Bridgess career has been a mix of critical and popular favourites. One of his most popular roles was as The Dude in the cult classic The Big Lebowski, but turns in films such as 1984s Starman and 1971s The Last Picture Show have accounted for some of his previous Oscar nominations.        
	Backstage, Bridges clutched his Oscar in one hand and a glass of champagne in the other. Asked to assess his life and career, Bridges invoked his character in The Big Lebowski. Ups and downs  what does The Dude say?  strikes and gutters, man, Bridges said. He sipped his drink at times and raised his glass as if to toast reporters.        
	He won for his portrayal of Bad Blake, a past-his-prime country star searching for redemption and another shot at stardom. The role almost never happened  Bridges initially turned down the part because he didnt feel that Crazy Heart had the appropriate musical heft.        
	When Grammy-winning producer T Bone Burnett came on board, Bridges signed on to play Blake, whose passion for music is second only to his penchant for self-destructive behaviour. The win was not exactly a surprise  Bridges, 60, has been considered the favourite to win the best actor Oscar for months.

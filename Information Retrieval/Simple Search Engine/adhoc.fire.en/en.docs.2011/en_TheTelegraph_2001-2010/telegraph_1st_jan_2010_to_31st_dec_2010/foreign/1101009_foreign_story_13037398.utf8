The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mumbai to West Bank for Freida
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Mumbai to West Bank for Freida
                          Freida Pinto                    
	Ramallah, Oct. 8 (AP): Freida Pinto has moved from the slums of Mumbai to the squalid refugee camps of the West Bank for a new film: the story of a defiant Palestinian girl who wants to fight against Israel in a story with a Mideast twists.         
	Miral, directed by award-winning artist Julian Schnabel and with cameos by Willem Dafoe and Vanessa Redgrave, stands apart for more than its star power.        
	Due for US release in December, its also likely to give Western audiences  some perhaps more used to movies depicting Arabs as violent Islamic militants  a compassionate view of the Palestinians.        
	For Mumbai-raised Freida Pinto, 25, who became a star after Slumdog Millionaire shot from obscurity to box-office success and eight Academy Awards, it was a chance for a different setting.         
	Miral sweeps across decades of the Mideast conflict. The cinematography lays out beautiful Palestinian landscapes and Pinto glows in her scenes. But the dialogue comes across at times as preachy, and Schnabel seems to try pack in as much Palestinian history as possible in the 112-minute film.         
	At a news conference in Ramallah before the screening late yesterday, some Palestinian movie crew members said they hoped Pintos star power would draw audiences into cinemas and that Schnabels Jewish faith would deflect claims of bias.

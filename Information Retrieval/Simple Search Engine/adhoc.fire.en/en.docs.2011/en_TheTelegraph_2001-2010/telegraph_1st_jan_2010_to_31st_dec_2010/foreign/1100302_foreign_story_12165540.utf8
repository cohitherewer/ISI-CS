The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | White House mulls nuke policy revamp

	Washington, March 1: Senior White House advisers say President Obama will permanently reduce Americas arsenal by thousands of weapons as he begins making final decisions on a broad new nuclear strategy for the US.         
	However the administration has rejected proposals that the US declare it would never be the first to use nuclear weapons, aides said.        
	Obamas new strategy  which would annul or reverse several initiatives by the Bush administration  will be contained in a nearly completed document called the Nuclear Posture Review, which all Presidents undertake.         
	Aides said secretary of defence Robert M. Gates will present Obama with several options to address unresolved issues in that document, which have been hotly debated within the administration.        
	First among them is the question of whether, and how, to narrow the circumstances under which the US will declare it might use nuclear weapons  a key element of nuclear deterrence since the cold war.        
	Obamas decisions on nuclear weapons come as conflicting pressures in his defence policy are intensifying.         
	His critics argue that his embrace of a new movement to eliminate nuclear weapons around the world is nave and dangerous, especially at a time of new nuclear threats, particularly from Iran and North Korea.         
	But many of his supporters fear that over the past year he has moved too cautiously, and worry that he will retain the existing American policy by leaving open the possibility that the US might use nuclear weapons in response to a biological or chemical attack, perhaps against a nation that does not possess a nuclear arsenal. That is one of the central debates Obama must resolve in the next few weeks, his aides say.        
	Many elements of the new strategy have already been completed, according to senior administration and military officials who have been involved in more than a half-dozen Situation Room debates about it.        
	The new strategy commits the US to developing no new nuclear weapons, including the nuclear bunker-busters advocated by the Bush administration. But Obama has already announced that he will spend billions of dollars more on updating Americas weapons laboratories to assure the reliability of what he intends to be a much smaller arsenal.

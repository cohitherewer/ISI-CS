                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lohan freed from jail, heads to rehab
                              Any other inmate                            
	Los Angeles, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Actress Lindsay Lohan was released from jail under the cover of darkness early today after serving 13 days of a 90-day sentence and whisked straight into a rehabilitation programme.        
	Los Angeles county sheriffs deputy Benjamin Grubb said Lohan left the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood, south Los Angeles, at 0835 GMT, managing to evade the dozens of paparazzi waiting outside for her.        
	In line with the court order, she is now under the jurisdiction of a treatment programme, Grubb told Reuters.        
	Lohan, 24, whose promising career has fallen foul to several years of Hollywood partying, was sentenced last month after violating her probation on a 2007 drunk-driving charge by missing a string of alcohol education classes.        
	She booked into the all-female jail on July 20 and was placed in solitary confinement but her sentence was reduced for good behaviour and under early-release programmes to combat overcrowding in Los Angeless budget-strapped jail system. Her sentence mandated that she begin an immediate 90-day stint in rehab on her release from jail. According to celebrity website TMZ.com, Lohan will be treated for bipolar disorder and an addiction to amphetamines.        
	Both TMZ and rival outlet Radaronline.com said Lohan would head to a facility operated by the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Hospital System in West Los Angeles.        
	Lohans representative was not immediately available to comment.        
	The Mean Girls actress said in 2007 she was addicted to drugs and alcohol and made three trips to rehab that year. She was also found in possession of cocaine at the time of her 2007 arrest and spent 84 minutes in jail as part of her sentence.        
	Lohan found fame at age 11 in a remake of The Parent Trap, and her subsequent work in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls established her credentials as one of Hollywoods most promising actresses.        
	But she found it hard to follow up on her early success after hitting the night-club circuit and was dropped from a movie earlier this year.        
	Lohan was sent to jail after a Beverly Hills judge overseeing her probation grew frustrated with her multiple absences from court-ordered alcohol education classes.        
	Lohan served her time in isolation because of her high profile. But prison officials have said she was treated like any other inmate, eating the non-gourmet jail food and serving her time in a nine sq. metre cell.

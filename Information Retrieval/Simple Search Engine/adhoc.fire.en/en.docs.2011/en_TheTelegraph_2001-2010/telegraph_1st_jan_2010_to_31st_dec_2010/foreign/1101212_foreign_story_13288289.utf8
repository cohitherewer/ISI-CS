	The news service reports component suppliers are bracing to produce a revamped version of the tablet which will feature front- and back-mounted cameras. Citing people familiar with the situation, Reuters says the new iPad will be slimmer, lighter and include an improved display.        
	An Apple spokesperson declined comment, according to the report. An analyst quoted by Reuters predicts the new iPad could be revealed next month. Since launching April 3, the iPad has become one of the hottest tech gadgets. In May, Apple announced sales of the device topped 2 million in less than 60 days.         
	Based on the Reuters story, the new iPad would come out almost exactly a year to the day that Apples original tablet took the public by storm.

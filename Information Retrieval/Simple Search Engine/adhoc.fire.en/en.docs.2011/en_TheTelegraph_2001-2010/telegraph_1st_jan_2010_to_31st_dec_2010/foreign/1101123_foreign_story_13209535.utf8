	Greymouth (New Zealand), Nov. 22: Police have admitted for the first time that the 29 men missing following an explosion in a New Zealand mine on Friday are possibly dead.        
	Officers, who had previously insisted that they were committed to mounting a rescue operation to bring the men out alive, changed tack and began preparing the families of the men for the worst.        
	Hours after releasing an official list of the names of the men in the mine at the time of the blast, Superintendent Gary Knowles said that some of the miners may not have survived. We are keeping an open mind, we are optimistic, but we are planning for all options, including loss of life, he said.        
	Three days after the blast ripped through the mine on Friday afternoon, samples of gases from the underground still showed high and fluctuating levels of methane. The conditions are considered too dangerous to send a human team in to look for the men. Superintendent Knowles said that he has been in touch with his counterparts in Chile and the US to discuss the best way to tackle the situation.        
	There is no evidence that any part of the mine has collapsed, indicating that the men could have walked out if they were able to.

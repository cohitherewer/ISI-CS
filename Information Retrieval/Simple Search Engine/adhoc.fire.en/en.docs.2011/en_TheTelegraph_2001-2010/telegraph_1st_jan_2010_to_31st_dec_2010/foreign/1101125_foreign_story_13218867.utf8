	Nov. 24: Facebook has been given the go-ahead to start proceedings which could allow the company to trademark the word Face.        
	A Notice of Allowance, has been given to the company which is the first step towards it potentially being allowed to trademark its brand.         
	Facebook has now been given three months to pay the necessary administration fee, before it can begin the procedure.        
	If it is successful, Facebook would be the only company permitted to use the word Face in the following way: Telecommunication services, namely, providing online chat rooms and electronic bulletin boards for transmission of messages among computer users in the field of general interest and concerning social and entertainment subject matter, none primarily featuring or relating to motoring or to cars, according to the Notice of Allowance.        
	The notice also states an opposition period has been completed without any problems, which is why the procedure has been allowed to move forward.        
	Apple currently use the term Face in a telecommunication context as its new visual telephone service is called Facetime. It is unknown whether this brand would need to be changed should Facebooks application be successful.        
	Earlier this year Facebook sued a teachers community website for using the word book in its name.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Islamabad, March 17: The five American nationals arrested four months ago for allegedly trying to link up with militants and plotting terror attacks in Pakistan , were indicted by a Pakistans anti-terror court today.         
	The five boys, two of them Pakistan-Americans, pleaded not guilty after charges were read out against them during the proceedings which took place in Sargodha jail under tight very security arrangements. Police officials had called for terror charges and life imprisonment for these boys for arriving in Pakistan to plot acts of terror.         
	Defence lawyer Shahid Kamal said that charges had been framed against all the five boys, which are terrorism specific and punishable by life imprisonment.         
	All the five accused, who had been arrested from Sargodha in November last year, have been accusing Pakistani and the FBI officials of torturing them.         
	The five US men with dual nationality have been in judicial custody after completion of investigation by top police and intelligence officials, who said their links had been established with militants, many of them foreigners in South Waziristan tribal region where the military has been battling Taliban and al Qaida-linked fighters since October 17 last year.         
	The boys, who had confessed during one of the hearings that they wanted to help their brethern in Afghanistan , had disappeared from in late November from suburbs of Washington.         
	After touching down in Karachi, the men tried to join an extremist Islamic school near Karachi and approached another extremist organisation, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, in Lahore, according to intelligence officials.         
	They were rebuffed in both places because of their western demeanour and the fact that they did not speak the national language , Urdu, reports in the US media said.         
	According to US intelligence officials , these five foreigners used to praise and discuss militsnts strikes on US troops in Afghanistan . One of the five men, Ahmed Abdullah Minni, 20 would regularly visit a video-sharing site to view footage of attacks on the US military.         
	Pakistans Lahore High Court had recently barred the government to hand over these men to US.

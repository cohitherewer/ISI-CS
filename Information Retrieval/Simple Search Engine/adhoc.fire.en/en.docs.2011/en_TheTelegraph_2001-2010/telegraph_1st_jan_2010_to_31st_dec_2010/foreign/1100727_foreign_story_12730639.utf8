The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Leak ties ISI to Afghan terror groups
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Leak ties ISI to Afghan terror groups
          MARK MAZZETTI, JANE PERLEZ, ERIC SCHMITT AND ANDREW W. LEHREN                          A US soldier on patrol in Kandahar province of Afghanistan. (AFP)                                  
	July 26: Americans fighting the war in Afghanistan have long harboured strong suspicions that Pakistans ISI has guided the Afghan insurgency with a hidden hand, even as Islamabad receives more than $1 billion a year from Washington for its help combating the militants, according to a trove of secret military field reports made public yesterday.        
	The documents, made available by an organisation called WikiLeaks, suggest that Pakistan, an ostensible ally of the US, allows representatives of its spy service to meet directly with the Taliban in secret strategy sessions to organise networks of militant groups that fight against American soldiers in Afghanistan, and even hatch plots to assassinate Afghan leaders.        
	Taken together, the reports indicate that American soldiers on the ground are inundated with accounts of a network of Pakistani assets and collaborators that runs from the Pakistani tribal belt along the Afghan border, to southern Afghanistan, and all the way to Kabul.        
	Much of the information  raw intelligence and threat assessments gathered from the field in Afghanistan cannot be verified and likely comes from sources aligned with Afghan intelligence, which considers Pakistan an enemy, and paid informants. Some describe plots for attacks that do not appear to have taken place.        
	But many of the reports rely on sources that the military rated as reliable.        
	While current and former American officials interviewed could not corroborate individual reports, they said that the portrait of the spy agencys collaboration with the Afghan insurgency was broadly consistent with other classified intelligence.        
	Some of the reports describe Pakistani intelligence working alongside al Qaida to plan attacks. Experts cautioned that although Pakistans militant groups and al Qaida work together, directly linking ISI with al Qaida is difficult.        
	The records also contain first-hand accounts of American anger at Pakistans unwillingness to confront insurgents who launched attacks near Pakistani border posts, moved openly by the truckload across the frontier, and retreated to Pakistani territory for safety.        
	The behind-the-scenes frustrations of soldiers on the ground and glimpses of what appear to be Pakistani skullduggery contrast sharply with the frequently rosy public pronouncements of Pakistan as an ally by American officials, looking to sustain a drone campaign over parts of Pakistani territory to strike at Qaida havens.         
	The reports suggest, however, that the Pakistani military has acted as both ally and enemy, as its spy agency runs what American officials have long suspected is a double game  appeasing certain American demands for cooperation while angling to exert influence in Afghanistan through many of the same insurgent networks that the Americans are fighting to eliminate.        
	Behind the scenes, both Bush and Obama administration officials as well as top American commanders have confronted top Pakistani military officers with accusations of ISI complicity in attacks in Afghanistan, and even presented top Pakistani officials with lists of ISI and military operatives believed to be working with militants.        
	Benjamin Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said that Pakistan had been an important ally in the battle against militant groups.        
	Civilian deaths        
	At least 45 civilians, many women and children, were killed in a rocket attack by the Nato-led foreign force in Afghanistans southern Helmand province last week, a spokesman for the Afghan government said today.

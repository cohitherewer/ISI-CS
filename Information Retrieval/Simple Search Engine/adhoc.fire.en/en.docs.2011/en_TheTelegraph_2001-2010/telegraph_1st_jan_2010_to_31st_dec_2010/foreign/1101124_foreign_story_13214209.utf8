          GORDON RAYNER AND CAROLINE GAMMELL                          Kate, William: Over the moon                                  
	London, Nov. 23: Prince William and Kate Middleton are to marry at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, it has been announced.        
	The couple, who revealed their engagement to the world last week, were described as over the moon about their forthcoming wedding.        
	Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, the princes private secretary, said: Theyre on cloud nine like any other newly engaged couple and theyre now getting stuck into organising their wedding.        
	They are completely over the moon  Ive never seen two happier people which is fabulous.        
	Lowther-Pinkerton said: The couple have chosen to be married at Westminster Abbey on the Feast of St Catherine on Friday 29th April. The couple were moved to choose the venue because of its staggering beauty, its 1,000 years of royal history and its relative intimacy despite its size.        
	The royal family and the Middletons will bear the cost of the wedding, the reception and the honeymoon, although any associated costs such as security, policing and cleaning streets will be picked up by the taxpayer.        
	The details of who pays for what havent been worked through yet but the Middleton family are very, very keen to contribute, said Lowther-Pinkerton.        
	He added that the prince and Middleton want their wedding to be a classic British occasion and a classic example of what Britain does best. He said the couple and the royal family want the wedding to be an enjoyable event for the whole country.

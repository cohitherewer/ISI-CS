The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Karzai aide on US payroll
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Karzai aide on US payroll
          DEXTER FILKINS AND MARK MAZZETTI                          Karzai: Murky relations                                  
	Kabul, Aug. 26: The aide to President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan at the centre of a politically sensitive corruption investigation is being paid by the CIA, according to Afghan and American officials.        
	Mohammed Zia Salehi, the chief of administration for the National Security Council, appears to have been on the payroll for many years, according to officials in Kabul and Washington. It is unclear exactly what Salehi does in exchange for his money, whether providing information to the spy agency, advancing American views inside the presidential palace, or both.        
	Salehis relationship with the CIA underscores deep contradictions at the heart of the Obama administrations policy in Afghanistan, with American officials simultaneously demanding that Karzai root out the corruption that pervades his government while sometimes subsidising the very people suspected of perpetrating it.        
	 Salehi was arrested in July and released after Karzai intervened. There has been no suggestion that Salehis ties to the CIA played a role in his release; rather, officials say, it is the fear that Salehi knows about corrupt dealings inside the Karzai administration.        
	The ties underscore doubts about how seriously the Obama administration intends to fight corruption here. The anti-corruption drive, though strongly backed by the US, is still vigorously debated inside the administration.

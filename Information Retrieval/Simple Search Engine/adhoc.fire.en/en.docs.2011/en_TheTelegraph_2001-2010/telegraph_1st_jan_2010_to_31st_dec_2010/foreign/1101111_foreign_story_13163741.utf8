	Hong Kong, Nov. 10: Singapore Airlines pulled three of its A380 superjumbo jetliners from service today after tests revealed oil stains on their engines, the airline said.        
	The affected aircraft, two in Australia and one in London, were being flown to Singapore to be fitted with new engines, the airline said today.        
	Based on further analysis of inspection findings as the investigation into last weeks incident involving another operators Airbus A380 is progressing, Singapore Airlines will be carrying out precautionary engine changes on three A380s, an airline spokesman, Nicholas Ionides, said in a statement.        
	Rolls-Royce, maker of the Trent 900 engines used in Singapore Airlines A380s, recommended additional checks of the affected engines, Ionides said.        
	The move by Singapore Airlines came less than a week after a dramatic blow-out in one of the Trent 900 engines during a Qantas A380 flight that sent debris over Batam island in Indonesia. The Sydney-bound flight, carrying more than 450 people, safely returned to Singapore.        
	Prompted by the discovery yesterday of oil leaks on three Qantas engines, Rolls-Royce asked Singapore Airlines today to remove the engines in question to conduct more extensive tests, said two people who had been briefed on the investigation.        
	The oil stains on the Singapore Airlines engines were not new but had been found during the initial checks requested by Rolls-Royce after the November 4 Qantas incident, said the two, who requested anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.

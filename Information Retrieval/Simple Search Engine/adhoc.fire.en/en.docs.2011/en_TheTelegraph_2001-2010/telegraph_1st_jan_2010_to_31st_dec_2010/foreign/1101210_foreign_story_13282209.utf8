	London, Dec. 9 (Reuters): Britains parliament today approved plans to increase fees paid by university students, a vote which split the coalition government and sparked clashes between police and protesters outside the building.        
	The lower house of parliament approved the plan by a reduced majority of 21 votes, indicating that several members of the ruling Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition parties had failed to back it. The coalition has a working majority of 84 when everyone is present in the 650-seat house.        
	Demonstrators, angry at plans to raise the amount students pay for their university education, threw missiles and placards at police in the square in front of parliament. Mounted police then tried to break up the crowd in chaotic scenes.        
	Police said they had tried to contain protesters in the square after flares, snooker balls and paint balls were thrown at them. The protesters tried to push the police back using metal barriers and then started a fire in front of parliament. Police said seven people were arrested and three injured police officers taken to hospital.        
	Commentators said the vote was the biggest challenge faced by the coalition during its seven months in office and the clashes could herald further unrest as austerity measures bite.         
	Some protesters accused the police of being heavy handed. The police have been antagonistic in their approach to the demo.

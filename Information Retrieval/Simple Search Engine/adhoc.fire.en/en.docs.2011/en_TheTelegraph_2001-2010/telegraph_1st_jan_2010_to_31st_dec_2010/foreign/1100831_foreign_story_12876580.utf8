          BEN LEACH                          Christie: Family angry                                  
	Aug. 30: The family of Agatha Christie has criticised Wikipedia for revealing the ending of The Mousetrap, the worlds longest-running play.        
	The online encyclopedia states that the famous country house murder mystery is known for its twist ending, which at the end of every performance the audience is asked not to reveal. But the entry then goes on to reveal the identity of the murderer without any warning that it is about to be revealed.        
	Fans of the author have for years been petitioning the website to take down the information, or to at least include a warning.        
	Now the British crime writers family has added its voice to the criticism. Matthew Prichard, Christies grandson, who was given the rights to The Mousetrap on his ninth birthday, has called the situation unfortunate.        
	He intends to take the matter up with Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen, the plays producer for the past 23 of its 58 years in the West End, according to The Independent on Sunday.        
	My grandmother always got upset if the plots of her books or plays were revealed in reviews  and I dont think this is any different, he said.        
	I think it is a pity if a publication, if I can call it that, potentially spoils the enjoyment for those people who go to see the play. Its not a question of money or anything like that. Its just a pity.        
	Wikipedias policy on the matter has been the subject of extensive debate within its committee, who are members of the public approved to contribute to the site.         
	When asked what the sites policy on the matter is, a spokesman said: Our purpose is to collect and report notable knowledge. Its exceedingly easy to avoid knowing the identity of the murderer: just dont read it. Asking Wikipedia not to reveal the identity of the murderer is like asking a library to remove copies of The Mousetrap book from shelves because someone could just go and read the end.              
	The Mousetrap premiered in London in 1952, and has been performed more than 24,000 times.              THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

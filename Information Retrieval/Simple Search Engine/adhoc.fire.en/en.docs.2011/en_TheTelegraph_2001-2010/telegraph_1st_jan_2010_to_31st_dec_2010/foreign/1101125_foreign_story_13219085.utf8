	Nov. 24: Everyone aged over 45 should consider a small daily dose of aspirin to help protect themselves against heart disease and cancer, a panel of experts suggested yesterday.        
	Evidence is building that the benefits for many healthy middle-aged and older people far outweigh the side effects, according to the academics.In particular, individuals at higher risk from the countrys two biggest killers would be helped by taking the painkiller as a preventive medicine, they added.        
	The experts were speaking at the Royal Society of Medicine a month after research from Oxford University published in The Lancet showed that taking 75mg of aspirin daily for five years reduces the risk of getting bowel cancer by a quarter, and deaths from the disease by a third.

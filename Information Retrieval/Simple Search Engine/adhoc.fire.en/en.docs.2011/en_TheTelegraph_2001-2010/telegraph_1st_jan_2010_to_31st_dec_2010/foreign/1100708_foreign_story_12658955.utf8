	Judes deal    
	 London, July 7 (PTI) Hollywood star Jude Law has settled the legal dispute with his former wife Sadie Frost to prevent the actress from revealing all about their marriage in her forthcoming autobiography.       
	The Sherlock Holmes star began court proceedings last week in a bid to halt the release of her memoir Crazy Days, and stop Frost from exposing private details about their troubled six-year-long marriage, Contactmusic said.    
	Jolie Bond     
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Angelina Jolie was approached to play the Bond girl in Casino Royale but the actress declined the offer, saying she would prefer to be the 007 spy.       
	She recalls a meeting with Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. We had this lovely, playful talk about the fact that I would have preferred to have played Bond. I think they were thinking that maybe I could play the girl in the movie but I was pregnant at the time and I couldnt have done it. And it wasnt right for me... years later she called me and said I think Ive found it, Jolie said.      
	The it in question was Salt, her upcoming spy thriller, originally written for a male actor. The script was reworked to be adapted to make the protagonist, a CIA agent, into a female lead.

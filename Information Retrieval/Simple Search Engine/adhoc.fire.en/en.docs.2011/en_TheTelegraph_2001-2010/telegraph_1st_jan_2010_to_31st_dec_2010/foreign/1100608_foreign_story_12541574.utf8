	London, June 7 (Reuters): A fox attacked two baby girls while they were sleeping at their house in east London, in what one animal expert called a freakish event.        
	The twin baby sisters were in serious but stable condition in hospital today, police said. Animal experts said it was extremely rare for them to attack humans. The attack on Isabella and Lola Koupparis happened in Hackney on Saturday night while their parents were watching television. It is believed to have entered the house through patio doors which had been left open.

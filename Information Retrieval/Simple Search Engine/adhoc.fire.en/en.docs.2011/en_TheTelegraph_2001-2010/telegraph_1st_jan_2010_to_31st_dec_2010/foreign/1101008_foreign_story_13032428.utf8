	Oct. 7: A mechanism in the body that causes high blood pressure has been uncovered by British scientists in a breakthrough that could lead to new treatments for the condition.        
	Researchers have found for the first time a key step in how the body controls blood pressure and so how the process sometimes goes wrong.        
	By targeting the mechanism they can stop it from malfunctioning and so prevent the condition, known as hypertension, that affects millions of people in Britain and is a major cause of heart disease and stroke.        
	The researchers at Cambridge University and Nottingham University discovered the mechanism while studying pre-eclampsia, a potentially deadly form of high blood pressure which occurs in women during pregnancy.        
	Blood pressure is controlled by hormones called angiotensins which in too high a dose forces blood vessels to constrict, increasing blood pressure.         
	The scientists, who have spent 20 years researching the hormones, have discovered the very first stage in their development. They now believe they could develop a way of inhibiting the switch that allows the hormones to overproduce.        
	Prof. Robin Carrell at the University of Cambridge, said: We have found the first step in the main process that controls blood pressure.        
	We are excited by what we have found because of the potential insights it provides us.         
	By getting a step earlier and looking at an earlier change we are opening up new strategies and coming closer to the reason why some people develop hypertension.

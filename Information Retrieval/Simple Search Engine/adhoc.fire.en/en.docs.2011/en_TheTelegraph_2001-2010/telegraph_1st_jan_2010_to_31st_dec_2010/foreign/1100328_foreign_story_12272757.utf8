	London, March 27: British Airways cabin crew began their second walkout in a week today to protest cost-cutting plans that include a wage freeze and changes to in-flight staffing levels.        
	As of early today, at least 93 British Airways flights departing from Heathrow Airport had been cancelled, according to the airlines website, roughly one-third of the total. At least 38 arrivals were listed as cancelled.        
	Flights in and out of Gatwick Airport and London City Airport were unaffected.        
	British Airways said yesterday that it planned to fly more than 75 per cent of the 240,000 passengers with tickets during the strike, which was expected to last until Tuesday.         
	An additional 43,000 passengers have been either rebooked on other airlines or opted to fly on other dates.

	Vienna, July 23 (Reuters): At AIDS 2010, the PLWHA and the PLHIV have come together with MSMs, IDUs and other MARPs to see if they can bring about GIPA.        
	In other words, this weeks international AIDS conference in Vienna has plunged journalists seeking to make sense of the global epidemic into a thick alphabet soup.        
	Once you have figured out the basics, like HIV  human immunodeficiency virus, and AIDS  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  the acronyms move to another level.        
	MSM is short for men who have sex with men, IDUs are injecting drug users and MARPs are most at risk populations and LGBTs are lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people. Letters are swimming before me like alphabet soup. Its almost like they make a new one up every day, said one reporter .

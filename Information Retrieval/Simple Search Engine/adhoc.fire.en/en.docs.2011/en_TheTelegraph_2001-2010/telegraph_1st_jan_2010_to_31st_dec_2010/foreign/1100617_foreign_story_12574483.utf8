The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama vows BP will pay
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama vows BP will pay

	Washington, June 16 (Reuters): President Barack Obama yesterday laid out what he called a battle plan to tackle the BP oil spill and exhorted Americans in war-like terms to embark on a mission to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.        
	The President used the solemn setting of the Oval Office for a televised address to counter criticism that he has not shown enough leadership in Americas worst environmental crisis but offered few specifics on how he intended to get the job done.        
	Late tonight, an Obama administration official confirmed to Reuters that BP Plc had agreed to a $20 billion special oil spill claims fund. It followed talks between Obama and top BP executives, their first since the start of the crisis in the Gulf of Mexico.        
	Obama vowed that BP would pay the price for its recklessness in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and sought to harness public outrage over the disaster to build momentum for his goals of a greener energy future.        
	We will fight this spill with everything weve got for as long as it takes. We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused, Obama said in a speech aimed at restoring confidence in his handling of the crisis before it further tarnishes his presidency.        
	Obamas stern message for BP was a centrepiece of his high-stakes speech on the oil spill, which threatens to distract from his domestic agenda of reducing nearly double-digit US unemployment and reforming Wall Street.        
	How forcefully Obama responds to Americas worst ecological disaster will have implications not only for the British energy giant but also for the future of US offshore drilling and any hopes he has of reviving climate change legislation stalled in Congress.        
	Adding a fresh sense of urgency, a team of US scientists yesterday raised their high-end estimate of the amount of crude oil flowing from the well by 50 per cent, to a range of 35,000 to 60,000 barrels per day.        
	Obama spoke in a measured tone devoid of anger as he assured Americans the stricken Gulf region would recover. He predicted containment efforts should succeed in capturing up to 90 per cent of the oil gushing from the well in coming weeks.        
	Obama also sought to rally them by casting his effort in the language of war. He described the onslaught of oil as a siege and warned the public to gird itself for the long haul. Tonight Id like to lay out for you what our battle plan is going forward, Obama said.        
	While urging Americans to seize the moment to break their addiction to fossil fuels, he spoke in mostly vague terms, offering no detailed prescription or timetable for passing comprehensive energy legislation. Now is the moment for this generation to embark on a national mission to unleash American innovation and seize control of our own destiny, he said.

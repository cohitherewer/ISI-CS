	Nov. 14: Giant tobacco companies are stepping up efforts around the world to fight tough restrictions on the marketing of cigarettes, as sales to developing nations become ever more important to them.         
	Companies such as Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco are contesting limits on ads in Britain, bigger health warnings in South America and higher cigarette taxes in the Philippines and Mexico. They are also spending billions on lobbying and marketing campaigns in Africa and Asia, and in one case provided undisclosed financing for TV commercials in Australia.         
	The industry has ramped up its efforts in advance of a gathering in Uruguay this week of public health officials from 171 nations, who plan to shape guidelines to enforce a global anti-smoking treaty.         
	This year, Philip Morris International sued the government of Uruguay, saying its tobacco regulations were excessive. World Health Organization officials say the suit represents an effort by the industry to intimidate the country, as well as other nations attending the conference, that are considering strict marketing requirements for tobacco.         
	Uruguays groundbreaking law mandates that health warnings cover 80 per cent of cigarette packages. It also limits each brand, such as Marlboro, to one package design, so that alternate designs dont mislead smokers into believing the products inside are less harmful.        
	Theyre using litigation to threaten low- and middle-income countries, says Dr Douglas Bettcher, head of the WHOs Tobacco Free Initiative. Uruguays gross domestic profit is half the size of the companys $66 billion in annual sales.         
	Peter Nixon, a vice-president and spokesperson for Philip Morris International, said the company was complying with every nations marketing laws while selling a lawful product for adult consumers.         
	He said the companys lawsuits were intended to combat what it felt were excessive regulations, and to protect its trademark and commercial property rights.         
	Cigarette companies are aggressively recruiting new customers in developing nations, Dr Bettcher said, to replace those who are quitting or dying in the US and Europe, where smoking rates have fallen precipitously. Worldwide cigarette sales are rising 2 percent a year.         
	Philip Morris has not only sued Uruguay, but also Brazil, arguing that images the government wants to put on cigarette packages do not accurately depict the health effects of smoking and vilify tobacco companies.         
	In Australia, where the government announced a plan that would require cigarettes to be in plain brown or white packaging to make them less attractive to buyers, a Philip Morris official directed an Opposition media campaign during the federal elections last summer, according to documents obtained by an Australian television programme, and later obtained by The New York Times.

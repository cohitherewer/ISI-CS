	New York, Aug. 3 (Reuters): Whether its a pint of beer, a glass of wine or a shot of whisky, Americans are drinking alcohol at the highest rate in 25 years, according to a Gallup poll.        
	Sixty-seven per cent of the 1,020 adults questioned in the poll said they drank alcohol and 41 per cent said beer was their favoured beverage.        
	The high point for drinking in the US was in 1976-1978 when 71 per cent said they drank alcohol. This years figure was the highest since 1985. Residents along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts are more likely to prefer wine than those living elsewhere, the poll said. Beer remains the drink of choice in the Midwest.

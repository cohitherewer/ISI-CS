	Moscow, Aug. 27: Vladimir Putin has carefully crafted the image of a man of action over the past few years, being pictured bare-chested in various hunting shooting and fishing poses.        
	His latest endeavour is a slight departure from his usual macho pursuits. The Russian Prime Minister is undertaking a 2,092-km road trip across Russias east in a Lada.        
	His journey is designed to showcase the completion of the countrys first ever continuous east to west road. The trip is being chronicled by state media and comes after a blizzard of publicity for Putin who has been filmed shooting whales with a crossbow and piloting an amphibious fire fighting plane.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Worry over garbage dump near Naples
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Worry over garbage dump near Naples

	Terzigno (Italy), Oct. 23 (Reuters): Clutching her sickly one-and-a-half-year-old son, Anna Langella says the family doctor had this simple prescription for her: move somewhere else.        
	Langella says her toddler often vomits and she blames this on the foul smell and toxic waste piling up in a rubbish dump near her house in Terzigno, on the outskirts of Naples where the streets are strewn with mounds of garbage.        
	We have to keep the children inside, with the doors and windows shut, but even then its not enough, she told Reuters.         
	The dump was opened last year as a stop-gap solution for rubbish from Italys third largest city, where organised crime, inefficiency and political opportunism have turned waste disposal into a chronic emergency. It is already full and plans to open a new one have provoked protests.        
	After days of clashes between police and residents and newspaper headlines dominated by pictures of festering rubbish, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi promised yesterday to spend 14 million euros to upgrade the Terzigno dump and said there was no threat to public health from the site.        
	Residents of the town on the fringes of a national park at the foot of Mount Vesuvius, the volcano overlooking the Bay of Naples, are worried and sceptical.        
	The stench is bothering us but thats the lesser evil. The most important thing is that we are dying here, there is leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, said teacher Anna De Vincenzo. Medical experts say it can be difficult to assess the extent to which pollution is to blame for illnesses that are also caused by genetic, socio-economic and lifestyle factors.

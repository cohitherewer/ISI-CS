                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      12 arrested in France terror raids
                            
	Paris, Oct. 5 (Reuters): French police arrested 12 people today in early morning swoops the interior minister said were directly linked to a campaign to counter an elevated terrorism threat in Europe.        
	France is on high alert after seven hostages, including five French citizens, were kidnapped by the north African wing of al Qaida last month, and approval by the Senate of a bill to ban full-face veils. The hostages are still being held.        
	The US state department on Sunday issued a warning to Americans to exercise caution while in Europe. Also on Sunday, Britain raised its terrorism threat level to high from general for those travelling to Germany and France.        
	Yes there is a terrorist threat at the moment in Europe. It must be neither overestimated nor underestimated, interior minister Brice Hortefeux told Frances National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, after the raids had taken place.

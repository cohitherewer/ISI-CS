	Melbourne, May 26 (AP): A 15-month-old boy escaped with just a few cuts and bruises today after a train struck his stroller, which rolled onto the tracks when his grandmother looked away for just a moment.        
	Security camera footage of the latest incident shows the stroller rolling over the edge of the platform just as the train pulls into the station. The stroller is pushed a short distance down the tracks before the train comes to a halt in front of horrified people.        
	Its absolutely amazing that this child isnt more injured than what he is, given the circumstances of the accident, paramedic Kate Jessop told reporters. It would appear, amazingly, that its nothing more than a couple of grazes and a big fright. ... I was assuming the worst as well and had those awful pictures in my head of a child underneath the train.        
	The baby and his 3-year-old brother were being cared for by their grandmother. She told officials she saw the stroller on the platform, looked away for a moment, and turned back to see it on the track, Jessop said. Officials have not released the names of the children or grandmother.

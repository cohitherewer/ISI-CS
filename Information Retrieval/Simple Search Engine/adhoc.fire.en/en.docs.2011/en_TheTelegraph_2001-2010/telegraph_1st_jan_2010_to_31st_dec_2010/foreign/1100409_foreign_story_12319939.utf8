          CLIFFORD J. LEVY                                    
	Moscow, April 8: After a day of bloody protests that forced Kyrgyzstans President to flee the capital, a transitional government led by a former foreign minister said today that it had taken power, dissolved parliament and would remain in office for six months.        
	The unrest, which spread across the capital, Bishkek, yesterday, seemed to pose a potential threat to a critical American air base supporting the Nato campaign in nearby Afghanistan. But Roza Otunbayeva, a former foreign minister who has emerged as head of a coalition of Opposition groups, said today that the supply line would not be immediately affected.        
	Its status quo will remain in place, she said at a news conference in the parliament building. But she warned: We still have some questions on it. Give us time and we will listen to all the sides and solve everything.        
	Opposition politicians, speaking on state television after it was seized by protesters yesterday, said they had taken control of the government after a day of violent clashes that left 68 people dead, officials said.         
	Otunbayeva said an interim government would rule for six months to replace the repressive rule of Kurmanbek Bakiyev. You can call this revolution. You can call this a peoples revolt. Either way, it is our way of saying that we want justice and democracy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Facebook to lure voters
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Facebook to lure voters
                            
	London, April 9 (Reuters): British election officials will for the first time use Facebook to encourage more people to register to vote on May 6 after turnout fell to historic lows in the last two ballots, a watchdog said today.        
	The Electoral Commission said every visitor to the social networking site tomorrow will be asked if they have already signed up to vote. If not, they will be redirected to the commissions site where they can register. At least 3.5 million people failed to register for the 2001 election and the commission says there may still be millions in the same position.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Want to know the ending? Ask Wikipedia

          NOAM COHEN                          spoiler                                  
	New York, Sept. 18: At the end of each performance of the Agatha Christie play, The Mousetrap, the person revealed to be the murderer steps forward and tells the audience to keep the secret of whodunit locked in your heart.        
	Even after 58 continuous years of performances in the West End of London, the plays twist ending has been largely preserved by reviewers, guidebook writers and the great bulk of the estimated 10 million people who have seen the play.        
	There is one notable exception: Wikipedia. The encyclopedias article about the play succinctly summarises its two acts and then, in a single sentence, even more succinctly explains who the killer is.        
	That shocked Christies grandson, Matthew Prichard, who told the British newspapers late last month that he was dismayed to learn that Wikipedia could not keep a secret.        
	I dont pretend to be an expert on Wikipedia or modern technology, he told The Independent.         
	All I can tell you is that from the point of view of the theatre-going public, I think it does spoil the enjoyment of those going to have an entertaining evening at the theatre  one part of which is to guess who the murderer is.        
	In an age of information overload, it is getting harder and harder to preserve mystery and surprise in entertainment  that can mean Olympics results being reported via Twitter before they are shown at night on television, or TV cliffhangers that are scooped by people on the set or websites that offer the endings of celebrated movies and plays.        
	After all, recent and even old films and plays may as well be brand new to the people who have never seen them and might not know that Darth Vader is really Luke Skywalkers father (oops  sorry about that).        
	My grandmother always got upset if the plots of her books or plays were revealed in reviews, said Prichard, who was given the rights to the play as a present in 1952 for his ninth birthday, and I dont think this is any different. Still, Mousetrap has had nearly six decades for its secret to leak out. The documentary Catfish had its surprise ending revealed by Wikipedia before it even played in movie theatres  the brief plot summary and its spoiler were based on a screening at this years Sundance Film Festival.        
	Its hard to argue that there is an intellectual or academic reason for getting deeply into the secrets of a movie that the vast majority of the public has not had access to, said Andrew Jarecki, a producer of Catfish, whose 2003 documentary, Capturing the Friedmans, also contained crucial plot twists. At a minimum, Jarecki said, Wikipedia should offer a so-called spoiler alert to warn readers that you are about to enter a section likely to harm the experience of the movie for you.        
	There is little likelihood of that happening. Wikipedia considers itself a comprehensive reference work and thus does not censor facts or even warn readers that a spoiler is on the way.        
	As Jay Walsh, a spokesman for the foundation that operates Wikipedia, put it: Generally it appears most Wikipedians support the notion that encyclopedias are often exhaustive when it comes to facts, and someone searching for an article about a story should be prepared to encounter a summary of the plot. Jarecki himself reported that he knew a lot of Wikipedia users sympathetic to his film, who have tried to edit that description, who are registered users, and have been unsuccessful.        
	Movies, plays and books may be caught in the worst bind.        
	There is a distinct difference between spoiling something, and writing about something after it happens, says Carlton Cuse, an executive producer of the Lost TV series, whose episodes are individually summarised at Wikipedia. The Mousetrap is a work that exists in both spaces.

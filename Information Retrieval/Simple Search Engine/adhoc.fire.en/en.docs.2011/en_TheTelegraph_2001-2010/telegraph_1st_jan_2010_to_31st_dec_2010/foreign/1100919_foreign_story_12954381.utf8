	Rome, Sept. 18 (Reuters): Italian newspapers greeted Julia Robertss latest film Eat Pray Love with scorn after its local opening this week, scoffing at its romantic vision of an American womans voyage of self-discovery in Rome.        
	The only thing missing in Julias Rome is the mandolin, the daily La Repubblica wrote today. Eat Pray Love, based on Elizabeth Gilberts best-selling memoir of a globe-trotting quest for meaning after divorce, follows Robertss character Liz to Italy, India and Indonesia.        
	The section in Italy, where Liz savours gelato, pizza and the warm Latin way of life, left local critics fuming, however.         
	The Turin daily La Stampa damned the film, co-starring Spanish actor Javier Bardem, as kitsch regretting that the Italian actors in the cast were left drawing on retro images of Italy from the 1950s.

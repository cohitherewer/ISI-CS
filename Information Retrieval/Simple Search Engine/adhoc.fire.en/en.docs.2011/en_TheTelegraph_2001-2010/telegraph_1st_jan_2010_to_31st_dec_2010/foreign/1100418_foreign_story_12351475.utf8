The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Europe chaos spreads around the world
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Europe chaos spreads around the world

	London, April 17: A cloud of ash from an Icelandic volcano shut down much of air travel to and from northern Europe for a third straight day and flying was likely to be disrupted till Monday morning as a massive transportation gridlock spread around the world.        
	Airlines as far away as Australia and New Zealand cancelled flights again today, and warned of more disruption to come. Europes major airports  crucial hubs for international travellers and cargo  were closed.         
	Eurocontrol, the European organisation for the safety of air navigation, said that about 16,000 of the regularly scheduled 22,000 flights were cancelled on the continent today.        
	Frances Prime Minister, Franois Fillion, who held an emergency meeting today, announced that Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports in Paris, among others in northern France, would be closed until 8am on Monday. Airports in northern Italy were also ordered shut until 8am.        
	Actual evidence of the ash was being detected in Britain, where British Airways also cancelled all its short-haul flights until Monday morning.        
	In addition to shutdowns in Germany, where one Lufthansa official questioned the governments use of British data for guidance, airports were closed in Belarus and Ukraine as the cloud spread eastward.         
	Adding to the confusion was that scientists were uncertain when the plume, which presents a severe threat to aircraft, would dissipate. Volcanic ash is primarily made up of silicates, akin to glass fibres, which when ingested into a jet engine can melt, causing the engine to flame out and stall.        
	One German meteorologist noted that the fine spring weather throughout much of Europe  perfect flying weather under other circumstances  prolonged the ban on air traffic. The high pressure zone that delivered the sunny skies also helped hold the ash cloud in place, said Helmut Malewski, a meteorologist at the German Weather Service near Frankfurt.        
	One Icelandic geologist, Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson of the University of Iceland, told The Associated Press early today that activity was increasing at the volcano Eyjafjallajokull (pronounced EY-ya-fyat-lah-YO-kut), whose eruption on Wednesday began disrupting air travel the next day. But in a statement released shortly after noon, a spokesman for Icelands foreign ministry, Urdur Gunnarsdottir, said that the force of the volcanic eruption under the glacier had been constant during the night until 4am, when it appeared to decrease.        
	In extending its ban on flights to and from Britain until at least 7am on Sunday, the National Air Traffic Services said that the cloud was moving around and changing shape.         
	Lufthansa expressed impatience with what it suggested was excessive caution by authorities. Instead of accepting data from British authorities, it would help to look at other parameters, said Amelie Schwierholz, a Lufthansa spokeswoman in Frankfurt. German authorities should do their own measurements of the density of volcanic particles, she said.        
	Schwierholz noted that a Lufthansa long-distance passenger jet with only a flight crew on board flew from Munich to Frankfurt today without incident, albeit at a much lower altitude than usual. Lufthansa plans other such positioning flights, which are allowed by regulations, so that aircraft will be where the airline needs them when commercial service resumes, she said.        
	The major US carriers were cancelling the majority of their transatlantic flights again, and Continental said it was adding Rome and Barcelona on its list of cancelled destinations today. Most US carriers extended their travel waivers until April 22 for passengers to rebook, but even that date was not a guarantee that operations would return to normal.

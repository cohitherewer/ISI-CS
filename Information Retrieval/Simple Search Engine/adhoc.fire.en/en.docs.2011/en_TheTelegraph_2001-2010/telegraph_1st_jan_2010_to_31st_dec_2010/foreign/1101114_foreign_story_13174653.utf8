          MIGUEL HELFT                          Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg                                  
	Nov. 13: Facebook has more than 500 million users around the world. And Americans spend more of their time online with Facebook than with any other Internet company, including Google and Yahoo.        
	Now the company wants people to weave their online lives even more tightly into Facebook.        
	On Monday, Facebook is expected to unveil a revamped set of communications services that will include an e-mail system in which users will have addresses with the facebook.com suffix, according to two people briefed on Facebooks plans who asked to speak on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss them publicly.        
	Facebook has invited reporters to a press conference on Monday, but has refused to say what it plans to announcement. The company declined to comment on any unannounced communications services.        
	Facebook already offers an online chat service and a rudimentary system to exchange messages with other Facebook users. The new services, whose exact details could not be learned, will greatly expand Facebooks communications offerings.        
	But one person with knowledge of Facebooks plans said that the new communications services will not be meant to be used on their own, like other e-mail systems. Instead, they will be tightly coupled with Facebooks other services.        
	They are not trying to do a standalone rival to Gmail, the person said. The are building an integrated experience in everything they do.        
	Still the new services could sharpen Facebooks competition with Google and others.        
	All of the e-mail vendors should be worried  Google, Yahoo, MSN, said Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst with the Altimeter Group, who was not briefed on Facebooks plans. All of those platforms have been trying to add social networking features to their services.

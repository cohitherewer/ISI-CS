	London, April 14: A talented schoolboy is believed to have shot himself after leaving a message on Facebook saying: My life is so pathetic.        
	 Ross Langmead, 18, was described by friends as very bright  and planned to go to medical school later this year to study to become a doctor. But he was found dead after leaving messages on the social networking site saying: Never take life seriously. He was a qualified lifeguard and was due to take A-levels in geography, chemistry and biology next month.But Ross left haunting messages on his Facebook page saying: My life is so pathetic alongside an unhappy face icon. His page on the website also said: Never take life seriously  no one ever gets out alive anyway.        
	Ross is thought to have killed himself at his home with a pistol he used at a local gun club where he was a member.        
	Police are investigating the tragedy at Llantrisant, South Wales.They are studying Rosss computer but say there are no suspicious circumstances.        
	Ross was found dead last weekend at the house where he lived with parents Marc and Lisa and his younger brother Jack, 15. His cousin Karl Langmead said: Ross was a qualified lifesaver  he was a quiet and polite lad.        
	This is a massive shock to the family. My heart goes out to his parents, grandparents and brother.        
	Prayers have been said at Y Pant Comprehensive School in the village of Pontyclun where Ross was a star pupil. Headteacher Stuart Tucker said the mood at the school had been sombre since children returned from the Easter holidays.        
	He said: The whole school is shocked and saddened by the news. Ross was a very nice lad who got on with everybody.        
	Weve had two special assemblies, both for Year 12 and Year 10, which is the year Rosss brother Jack is in.        
	A special tribute page has been set up on Facebook and 600 people have left messages. An inquest was opened and adjourned by the Mid Glamorgan Coroner Peter Maddox.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BP in yacht trouble
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      BP in yacht trouble

	New York, June 20: BP officials yesterday scrambled yet again to respond to another public relations challenge when their embattled chief executive, Tony Hayward, spent the day off the coast of England watching his yacht compete in one of the worlds largest races.         
	Two days after Hayward angered lawmakers on Capitol Hill with his refusal to provide details during testimony about the worst offshore oil spill in US history and one day after the BP chairman said the chief executive would not be as involved in daily operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Hayward sparked the new controversy.         
	He is having some rare private time with his son, a BP spokesperson, Sheila Williams, said in a telephone interview yesterday. But Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, who taped an interview for ABCs This Week, called Haywards attendance at the race part of a long line of PR gaffes and mistakes.         
	Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, called Haywards yacht outing the height of arrogance. I can tell you that yacht ought to be here skimming and cleaning up a lot of the oil, Shelby said.

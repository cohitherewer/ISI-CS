	Not love, actually    
	 London, March 8 (PTI): Gwyneth Paltrow and Nicole Kidman are set to play lovers in The Danish Girl, but it seems there is not much love lost between them.      
	The pair have been living within miles of each other in Nashville for weeks, but Nicole, 42, declined an invitation to meet Gwyneth, who is filming Love Dont Let Me Down there.      
	Nicole lives in Nashville not far from where Gwyneth has been working on her latest movie for five weeks. Gwyneth made the effort to get in touch with Nicole but Nicole declined, said a source.

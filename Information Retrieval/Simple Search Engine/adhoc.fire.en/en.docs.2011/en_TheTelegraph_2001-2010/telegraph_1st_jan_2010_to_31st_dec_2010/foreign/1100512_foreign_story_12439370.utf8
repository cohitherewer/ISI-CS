	Newark (Delaware), May 11: Vice-President Joe Bidens son is being treated at a Delaware hospital, the White House said today, though it did not provide information about what might be wrong.        
	Delaware attorney-general Beau Biden was awake and alert and communicating with his parents and wife, who were with him at Christiana Hospital in Newark, where a state trooper was stationed at the main entrance.        
	The 41-year-old had considered running for the Senate seat his father held before becoming vice-president, but decided against it. He became attorney general in 2007 and previously served at the US justice department.

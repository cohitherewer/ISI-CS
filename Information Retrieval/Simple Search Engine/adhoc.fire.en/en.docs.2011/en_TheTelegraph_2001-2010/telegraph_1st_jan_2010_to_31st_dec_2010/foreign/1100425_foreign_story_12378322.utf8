	Naomi Campbell punched a TV camera after being accused of receiving a blood diamond from former Liberian leader Charles Taylor.         
	The supermodel, 39, stormed out of an interview after she was asked about being given the huge uncut stone.        
	Speaking to US television network ABC, Campbell told a reporter: I didnt receive a diamond, I am not going to speak about that.        
	When the interviewer then claimed she had been given the diamond after having dinner with Taylor, she replied: I had dinner with Nelson Mandela, before walking out and striking the camera.        
	Taylor is facing charges of crimes against humanity after thousands of people in Sierra Leone were killed or had limbs amputated between 1997 and 2001.        
	Prosecutors allege that Taylor, who is being held at The Hague, purchased weapons for his soldiers by using the so-called blood diamonds as currency.

                              More trouble                            
	Portland (Oregon), July 1 (AP): The police are re-opening an investigation into a Portland massage therapists allegations that former Vice-President Al Gore groped her at a hotel in 2006.        
	In a brief statement yesterday, the Portland police did not say why they were re-opening the investigation. The police earlier said they considered the case closed because there was no evidence.        
	A spokeswoman for Gore said he unequivocally and emphatically denied making unwanted sexual advances towards the woman. Further investigation into this matter will only benefit Mr Gore, said the spokeswoman, Kalee Kreider.        
	The masseuse told the police that Gore made unwanted advances during an appointment on October 24, 2006, at a downtown hotel. He was in Portland to deliver a speech on climate change.        
	Last week, the Portland police said that the womans lawyer came to them in 2006 but that the masseuse cancelled appointments with detectives. The case was reopened in 2009, when detectives interviewed the woman. They determined that there was insufficient evidence.        
	The woman alleges Gore made unwanted sexual advances during a massage appointment on October 24, 2006, at the downtown Hotel Lucia.

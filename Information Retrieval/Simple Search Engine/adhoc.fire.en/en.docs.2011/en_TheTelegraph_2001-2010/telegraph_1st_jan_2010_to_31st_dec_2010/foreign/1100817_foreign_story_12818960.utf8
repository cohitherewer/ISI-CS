	Beijing, Aug. 16 (PTI): A top leader of the Communist Party of China has called for reform in Buddhist monasteries by appointing monks and nuns who are politically reliable.         
	In a call to weed out pro-Dalai Lama clerics, Du Qinglin, head of the United Front Work Department of the partys Central Committee, also demanded that greater, concerted and solid efforts must be made to implement democratic management in the monasteries.        
	Currently, all top monk posts have to be filled with the approval of the Chinese government.

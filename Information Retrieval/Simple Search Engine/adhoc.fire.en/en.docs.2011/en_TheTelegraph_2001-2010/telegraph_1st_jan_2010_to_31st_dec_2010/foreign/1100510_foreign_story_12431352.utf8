The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK talks drag on
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      UK talks drag on

	London, May 9 (Reuters): Britains Conservatives said they held good discussions with the Liberal Democrats today but failed to conclude a deal to govern together.        
	Further talks are planned within 24 hours.        
	David Camerons Conservatives won the most seats in Thursdays parliamentary election but fell short of a majority and are seeking the support of Nick Cleggs third-placed Lib Dems to end 13 years of Labour Party rule.        
	We are agreed that a central part of any agreement that we make will be economic stability and the reduction of the public deficit, Conservative negotiator William Hague said after close to seven hours of talks with a team of Lib Dems.        
	Clegg appeared to be keeping his options open, with news emerging that while the Conservative-Lib Dem talks were going on, he met in secret with Prime Minister Gordon Brown at a nearby location.        
	The two met this afternoon at the foreign office to update each other. They had an amicable discussion. David Cameron was aware that they were meeting, said a Lib Dem spokesperson.        
	Brown, whose Labour came a distant second in the election, remains in office in a caretaker role. He stands ready to try for an alliance with the centre-left Lib Dems if they are unable to agree with the Conservatives.        
	But Browns position appeared precarious, with three of his own partys legislators calling on him to step down.        
	Hague said the sides would meet again within 24 hours and in the meantime would brief the party leaders, Cameron and Clegg.        
	Emerging from the government building where the talks took place, the Lib Dem spokesperson made almost identical comments.        
	A stumbling block to a Conservative-Lib Dem deal could be electoral reform, a long-cherished ambition of the Lib Dems who would win far more seats if Britain switched from its winner-takes-all system to proportional representation.

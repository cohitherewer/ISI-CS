	Oct. 20: Karachi, Pakistans largest city and financial hub, came to a standstill today after a spasm of ethnic and political killings in the city over the past four days left more than 60 people dead.        
	Public transport services were suspended this morning and schools and markets remained closed as a result of bloodshed the night before. At least 12 people were killed and several injured when gunmen on motorcycles entered a market in Shershah and attacked shopkeepers. In other incidents, Baloch and Pathan residents were also shot dead by gunmen.        
	Officials at the Edhi Foundation, a non-profit relief organisation, said at least 25 people had been killed since last night. Speaking to Aaj Television, Sindh provinces home minister, Zulfiqar Mirza, said that the government could impose curfews in parts of Karachi if the situation continued to worsen.        
	Unrest broke out in the city on Saturday, a day before a by-election was to be held in the city for a provincial Assembly seat that had been left vacant after an assassination in August. The election sparked clashes among ethnic groups that killed at least 22 people over the weekend. Targeted killings of various ethnic groups and political parties workers have left more than 300 people dead since 2008. The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), representing the citys Muhajirs, and Awami National Party (ANP), with a dominant Pathan support base, have had tense relations.         
	The MQM has accused the ANP of supporting organised crime and the ANP charges that its opponent is a terrorist organisation that is responsible for the killings of Pathan residents. Both parties are coalition partners with the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party in Sindh.

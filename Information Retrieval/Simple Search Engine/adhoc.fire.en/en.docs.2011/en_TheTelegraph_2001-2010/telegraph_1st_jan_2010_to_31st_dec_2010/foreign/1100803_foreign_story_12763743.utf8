          NORIMITSU ONISHI                              
	Jakarta, Aug. 2: Her left hand flitting between the BlackBerry and Starbucks cappuccino on the table before her, Julia Perez spoke with rising urgency into her cellphone at a shopping mall here one recent afternoon.         
	She took no notice of the passers-by who, sneaking glances her way, found confirmation in her tight-fitting, low-cut dress that it was indeed Julia Perez, the singer, actress, model  and soon, perhaps, politician  whose overt use of sex appeal has won her legions of fans in Indonesia but also condemnation from social conservatives.         
	The next day, though, Perez needed a traditional dress known as a kebaya, she told her designer at the other end of the line. The traditional ruler of Solo, a city in central Java, was conferring a title on her at a formal ceremony, she explained after getting off the phone.         
	Et voil! said Perez, who tends to speak in a mix of Indonesian, English and French. Its a big honour for me.         
	Since returning to Indonesia three years ago after a decade in France and the Netherlands, Perez, 30, better known as Jupe (pronounced jew-peh), has quickly become one of this nations most sought-after celebrities and a mainstay of television gossip shows.         
	In a society increasingly polarised between supporters of political Islam and western-style openness, Perez has led the charge one way with her sexy shows and music videos, her celebration of female sexuality and frank talk about sex.         
	Her best-selling album, Kamasutra, included a free condom, which drew the ire of Islamic organisations and got her banned from performing in several cities outside Jakarta, the capital.         
	Perez was rebuked recently after announcing her candidacy in a local election in December in Pacitan, a town in east Java that also happens to be the hometown of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.         
	Officials proposed changing regional election laws to forbid candidates with moral flaws from running. But critics in the news media and on social-networking websites counter-attacked, pointing out that Indonesian politicians are hardly known for their ethics.         
	So what if Im sexy? Perez said. You can still eat tomorrow if you see me and find me sexy. But if I steal your money, tomorrow you cannot eat and tomorrow you cannot go to school and tomorrow youll be a hopeless man.         
	Perez has no prior political experience and says that if elected, she simply wants to improve the lives of ordinary people in Pacitan. She was at once excited by the possibilities of Indonesias young democracy and aware of its limitations.         
	Maybe 30 per cent of the people feel this is a democracy, she said, suggesting that poverty and lack of opportunities still prevent 70 per cent of the population from enjoying meaningful options.         
	If success has brought her into the 30 per cent, Perez made it clear that her roots  and part of her motivation behind her political ambition  lay in the 70 per cent group.         
	Born here as Yuli Rachmawati, she was the eldest of three sisters in a household led by a single mother. With her mother doing odd jobs, the family often ate only rice with fried shallots. Growing up under Suharto, the longtime military ruler who fell in 1998, she saw little for herself here.

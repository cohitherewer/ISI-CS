The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Day-Lewis to play Lincoln
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Day-Lewis to play Lincoln
                              TOP HONOUR                            
	Los Angeles, Nov. 20 (Reuters): Oscar-winning British actor Daniel Day-Lewis has been tapped to play President Abraham Lincoln in an upcoming film directed by Steven Spielberg, the DreamWorks movie studio said yesterday.        
	Lincoln is based on the best-selling book, Team of Rivals by Pulitzer Prize winner Doris Kearns Goodwin. It profiles the President and his political clashes with the members of his White House cabinet as the United States engaged in civil war from 1861-1865. Day-Lewis is a four-time Oscar nominee and two-time winner of the film industrys top honours.         
	He earned one Academy Award for best actor in 1989s My Left Foot and a second for 2007s There Will Be Blood playing a ruthless oil baron. Daniel Day-Lewis would have always been counted as one of the greatest of actors were he from the silent era, the golden age of film or even some time in cinemas distant future. I am grateful and inspired that our paths will finally cross with Lincoln, Spielberg said in a statement.        
	The screenplay was written by another Pulitzer winner, Angels in America writer Tony Kushner. Filming is set to begin in 2011.

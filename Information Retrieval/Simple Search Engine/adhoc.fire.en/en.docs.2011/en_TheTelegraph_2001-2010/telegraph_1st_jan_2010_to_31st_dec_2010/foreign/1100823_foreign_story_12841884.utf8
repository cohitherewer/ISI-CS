The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Greens hold Aussie key
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Greens hold Aussie key

	Canberra, Aug. 22 (AP): The leaders of Australias two major political parties began negotiating power deals with Independent lawmakers today after the closest election in decades failed to deliver a clear mandate to govern.        
	Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who remains caretaker leader, said it was clear that no party had won a majority of parliamentary seats in Saturdays poll that delivered an extraordinary voter backlash against her Centre-Left Labour Party after a single three-year term.        
	Labour haemorrhaged votes to the environment-focused Greens party as the government was punished for shelving plans to charge major polluting industries for every ton of carbon gas that they emit.        
	The Greens record support in the polls increased the partys Senate seats from five to nine, giving them the leverage to become kingmaker in deciding which major party controls that chamber.        
	Market analysts predicted the uncertainty would push the Australian dollar and stock market lower when trading resumed on Monday.        
	Gillard and Tony Abbott, leader of the conservative Liberal Party, said they had initiated talks with three Independents in the House of Representatives as well as the Greens party in a bid to secure their votes in the House of Representatives. Neither revealed what they were prepared to offer in the confidential negotiations.        
	Both Labour and the Liberal-led coalition have conceded that neither is likely to hold the 76 seats needed to form a government in the 150-seat lower chamber.        
	Its my intention to negotiate in good faith an effective agreement to form government, Gillard told reporters.        
	She suggested that Labour would be better able to get it legislative agenda through the Senate, where major parties rarely hold majorities.        
	 So the question before all of us is this: Which party is better able to form a stable and effective government in the national interest? Gillard said.        
	But Abbott, who doubts the science behind climate change and rules out ever taxing polluters for their greenhouse gas emissions, said Labour had proved unstable even with a clear majority.        
	Bitter recriminations within Labour over the election result have begun, with at least one lawmaker who lost her seat blaming her colleagues dumping of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for Gillard.

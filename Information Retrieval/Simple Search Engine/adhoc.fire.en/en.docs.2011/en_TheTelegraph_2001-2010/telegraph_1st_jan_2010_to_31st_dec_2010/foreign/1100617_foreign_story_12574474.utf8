	Kabul, June 16: A Pakistani-based militant group identified with attacks on Indian targets has expanded its operations in Afghanistan, inflicting casualties on Afghans and Indians alike, setting up training camps, and adding new volatility to relations between India and Pakistan.        
	The group, Lashkar-e-Toiba, is believed to have planned or executed three major attacks against Indian government employees and private workers in Afghanistan in recent months, according to Afghan and international intelligence officers and diplomats here. It continues to track Indian development workers and others for possible attack, they said.        
	Lashkar was behind the synchronised attacks on several civilian targets in Mumbai, India, in 2008, in which at least 163 people were killed. Its inroads in Afghanistan provide a fresh indication of its growing ambitions to confront India even beyond Kashmir, for which Pakistans military and intelligence services created the group as a proxy force decades ago.        
	Officially, Pakistan says it no longer supports or finances the group. But Lashkars expanded activities in Afghanistan, particularly against Indian targets, prompt suspicions that it has become one of Pakistans proxies to counteract Indias influence in the country.        
	They provide yet another indicator of the extent to which Pakistani militants are working to shape the outcome of the Afghan war as the July 2011 deadline approaches to begin withdrawing American troops.        
	Recently retired Pakistani military officials are known to have directed the Mumbai attacks, and some Lashkar members have said only a thin line separates the group from its longtime bosses in the Pakistan security establishment.        
	Some intelligence officials say it is also possible that factions of Lashkar-e-Toiba, which means army of the pure, have broken from their one-time handlers and are working more independently, though Indian and Afghan authorities say the focus on Indian targets is being interpreted as a direct challenge from Pakistan.        
	Our concern is that there are still players involved that are trying to use Afghanistans ground as a place for a proxy war, said Shaida Abdali, Afghanistans deputy national security adviser. It is being carried out by certain state actors to fight their opponents.        
	A number of experts now say Lashkar presents more of a threat in Afghanistan than even al Qaida does, because its operatives are from the region, less readily identified and less resented than the Arabs who make up al Qaidas ranks. There were a few Lashkar cells in Afghanistan three or four years ago, but they were not focused on Indian targets.        
	A recent Pentagon report to Congress on Afghanistan listed Lashkar as one of the major extremist threats here. In Congressional testimony in March by Pakistan experts, the group was described as having ambitions well beyond India.

          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	Dhaka, Oct. 30: Biman Bangladesh pilots, who were locked in a dispute with the airline management over benefits, ended their strike today after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked them to resume work.         
	The pilots also apologised to Hasina for calling a strike during Haj.         
	Hasina, who met the airline management and the pilots representatives, said the national carrier represented the country to the world and any irregularities in its operation would not be tolerated. The pilots said they had no other option before them as they could not get in touch with Hasina.         
	 The pilots and the Biman management were locked in a confrontation over benefits. They said Biman extended their working age but took away a lot of perks. The matter is pending in court. Bimans managing director Zakiul Islam said two flights  Dhaka-London and Dhaka-Calcutta  had taken off according to schedule today.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Third Obama dinner intruder
                            
	Washington, Jan. 5 (Reuters): A third uninvited guest made it into a White House state dinner in honour of the Indian Prime Minister, but there is no evidence the person had contact with the President or First Lady, the Secret Service said yesterday.        
	A Secret Service spokesman was not immediately available to comment on whether the individual had any contact with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh or came close to the visiting leader.        
	In a second security lapse at the November 24 event, the person, who was not identified, travelled from a Washington hotel where the Indian delegation was staying and arrived at the dinner with the group, which was under the responsibility of the US department of state. This individual went through all required security measures along with the rest of the official delegation at the hotel, and boarded a bus/van with the delegation guests en route to the White House, the Secret Service said.         
	An Obama administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the man was a US citizen, was not seated at the dinner, did not appear to have mingled or approached any guests and left the event early.        
	The state department had arranged transportation for a group of Indian chief executives from their hotel to the dinner at the Indian embassys request, said a state department official, who spoke on condition that he not be named.        
	The official said he did not know the identity of the person who slipped into the group of CEOs and was transported to the White House.

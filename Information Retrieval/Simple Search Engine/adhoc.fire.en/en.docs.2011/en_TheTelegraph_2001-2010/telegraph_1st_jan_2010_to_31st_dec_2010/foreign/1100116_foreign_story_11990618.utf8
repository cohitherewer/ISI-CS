The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cuba lets US use air space
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Cuba lets US use air space
                            
	Washington, Jan. 15 (Reuters): The Cuban government has agreed to let the US military use restricted Cuban air space for medical evacuation flights carrying Haitian earthquake victims, sharply reducing the flight time to Miami, a US official said today.        
	White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said a deal had been reached allowing evacuation flights from the US Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to pass over the communist-ruled island on the way to Florida. The deal would shorten the flight time by 90 minutes on trips that normally are routed around Cuba.        
	US military disaster relief teams in Haiti have been taking injured quake survivors to Guantanamo for treatment. Some victims are being sent from Guantanamo to south Florida for further treatment.        
	An arrangement already exists between the US and Cuba permitting violations of airspace for emergency medical flights. But the Guantanamo base commander asked the local commander in Cuba to expand the authority to a standing basis, and Havana agreed, the New York Times quoted Obama administration officials as saying.        
	 The agreement puts aside decades of Cold War animosity between Washington and Havana in the midst of global efforts to help the injured and estimated 300,000 Haitians made homeless by the massive 7.0 magnitude quake on Tuesday.

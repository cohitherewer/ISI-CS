	London, March 21 (PTI): A suspected British drugs smuggler hasnt gone to the toilet for over a month, apparently to hang on to the cocaine parcels he swallowed before getting on a flight home from Columbia.        
	The 49-year-old man, whose name has been withheld for legal reasons, was held on suspicion of importing drugs on February 16 at Londons Heathrow airport, and charged three days later.         
	But since then, he is eating as little as possible to prevent nature from taking its course as he is thought to have hidden cocaine parcels in his stomach, the News of the World quoted police officers as saying.        
	The officers are being forced to play a strange waiting game. The suspects lawyers said he should be freed but a court has ruled that he should remain in the custody of the UK Border Agency until he went to the loo.

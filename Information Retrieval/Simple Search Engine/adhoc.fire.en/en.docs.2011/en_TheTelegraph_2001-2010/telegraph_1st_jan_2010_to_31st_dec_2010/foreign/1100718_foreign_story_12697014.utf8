The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Joss Stone to star in Bond game
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Joss Stone to star in Bond game
										                        Joss Stone: Ego boost				                           
	July 17: Soul star Joss Stone will star in a James Bond computer game.        
	A digital version of Stone will star as the femme fatale Nicole Hunter in James Bond 007: Blood Stone, the agents new video game.        
	Speaking at the games London launch, Stone said: Im the first Bond girl from the West Country  instead of Martini in my glass Im drinking cider and nobody will ever know. And the singer pointed out: Im the first Bond girl with a nose ring.        
	The Brit Award-winning artist has also penned an original song for the game with Eurythmics star Dave Stewart  swapping her R amp;B sound for something more Shirley Bassey, she said.        
	Oh my God, Shirley Bassey rocks and nobody will ever get to there, Stone said.        
	Shes really powerful but theres no ad-libbing or warbling because it wasnt needed. I was just inspired by her and I tried to sing it in a really straight, powerful way.        
	But I havent really got a big voice like Christina Aguilera or somebody, its trickery, Im just loud and I can fake it a little bit. Stone said she played her Bond girl a bit like a posh version of Paris Hilton. The game is not her first acting role. She has previously played the ugliest woman in Europe  Anne of Cleaves  in BBC2s The Tudors, so a Bond girl was an ego boost.

	Assalamualaikum. Salam sejahtera, Obama began, an Indonesian salutation meaning Peace be upon you, prosperous greetings, which drew whoops of approval from a crowd clearly impressed by his surprisingly good accent and delivery.

Pulang kampung, nih, he added, a slang phrase meaning Ive come home to the village, prompting laughs.

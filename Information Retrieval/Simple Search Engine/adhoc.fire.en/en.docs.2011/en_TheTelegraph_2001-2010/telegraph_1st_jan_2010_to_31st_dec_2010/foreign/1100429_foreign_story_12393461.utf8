	Strong Scarlett    
	 Los Angeles, April 28 (PTI): Actress Scarlett Johansson, who will play the role of secret agent Natalie Romanova, aka Black Widow, in Iron Man 2, says she likes to portray strong and independent characters onscreen.      
	The Matchpoint star is thrilled by the May 7 release of Iron Man 2, reports celebrity website Access Hollywood.      
	These characters are strong, independent women that could function with or without the men in their lives. They run a smooth, efficient operation and are at the head of their game and I really attribute that to director Jon Favreaus appreciation for a strong lady, she said.    
	Plump tone    
	Los Angeles (PTI): Actress Gwyneth Paltrow is known for her slender figure but the actress had to ditch her toned look for a new movie. After shooting for Iron Man 2, she rushed to Nashville to shoot for Love Dont Let Me Down. But Paltrow was told by the director to get fat for the role of a country musician.

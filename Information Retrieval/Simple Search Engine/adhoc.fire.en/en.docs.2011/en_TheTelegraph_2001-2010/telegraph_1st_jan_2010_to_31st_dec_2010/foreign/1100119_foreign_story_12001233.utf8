The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban militants strike in heart of Kabul
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Taliban militants strike in heart of Kabul

	Kabul, Jan. 18: A team of militants launched a spectacular assault at the heart of the Afghan government today, with two men detonating suicide bombs and the rest fighting to the death only 50 yards from the gates of the presidential palace.        
	Twelve people were killed in the assault. Afghan officials said that three soldiers and two civilians  including one child  were killed, and at least 71 people were wounded.        
	The attacks, the latest in a series targeting the Afghan capital, paralysed the city for hours, as hundreds of Afghan commandos converged and opened fire. The battle unfolded in the middle of Pashtunistan Square, a traffic circle that holds the palace of President Hamid Karzai, the ministry of justice and the Central Bank, the target of the attack.        
	As the gun battle raged, another suicide bomber  this one driving an ambulance  struck a traffic circle a half-mile away, sending a second mass of bystanders fleeing in terror. Five hours after the attack began, gunfire was still echoing through the downtown, as commandos searched for holdouts in a nearby office building. The Faroshga market, one of the citys most popular shopping malls, lay in ruins, shattered and burning and belching black smoke.        
	All seven militants died in the attack; five were gunned down and two killed themselves. The corpses of two of the militants lay splayed under blankets, their heads and bodies riddled and smashed.        
	The effect of the attack seemed primarily psychological, designed to strike fear into the usually quiet precincts of downtown Kabul  and to drive home the ease with which insurgents could strike the American-backed government here.        
	In that way the assault succeeded without question: The streets of Kabul emptied, merchants shuttered their shops and Afghans ran from their offices. Even guards assigned to Karzai himself came to join the fighting; it was that close.        
	All of a sudden three men came wrapped in shawls and then they pulled them off and we could see their guns and grenades, said an Afghan man who witnessed the attack. They told us to get out, and then they went to the roof and started firing.        
	The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Reached by telephone, a spokesman said the group had sent 20 suicide bombers for the operation. This was an exaggeration. Some of our suicide bombers have blown themselves up, bringing heavy casualties to government officials, said Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban.        
	And civilians, too. At the height of the battle, women and men, some of them clutching babies, ran down the streets, some bleeding, some sobbing.         
	A second Taliban representative, also reached by phone, said the attack was intended to answer American and Afghan proposals to reconcile with and reintegrate Taliban fighters into mainstream society. The plan is a central part of the American-backed campaign to turn the tide of the war, and will be showcased later this month at an international conference in London.        
	We are ready to fight, and we have the strength to fight, and nobody from the Taliban side is ready to make any kind of deal, Mujahid, the Taliban spokesman, said. The world community and the international forces are trying to buy the Taliban, and that is why we are showing that we are not for sale.

   Big freeze to leave gaps in markets

	London, Dec. 21: The big freeze is set to leave gaps on supermarket shelves and under Christmas trees across the country.         
	Farmers warned that if the snowfall continued, some of the staples of the traditional Christmas dinner would be in short supply because they will be unable to provide supermarkets with enough carrots, parsnips and sprouts. Supermarket delivery vans are also struggling to clear backlogs in time for Christmas.        
	Oliver Hammond, a parsnip and carrot grower from Norfolk, said that his farm was unlikely to be able to keep up with demand this week once shoppers who had delayed their Christmas shopping because of the snowfall returned.        
	One of the supermarkets rang us this morning and said: Throw anything that resembles a carrot or parsnip into a bag just so weve got something on the shelf, he said. It will be desperation if this continues.        
	Ian Hall, director of Tompsett Burgess Growers, which has farms in Essex, Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, said the company had to throw away two lorryloads of carrots  nearly 30 tonnes  because they had frozen. Parsnips are an even bigger problem because they cannot even be removed from the ground. The ground has been nearly solid for a month. If this carries on much longer, were going to come to a halt, he added.        
	Tesco took the unusual step of putting turkey crowns and other Christmas dinner products into its convenience stores to ensure that shoppers who are unable to reach larger stores will able to achieve a semblance of normality. Sainsburys said its delivery service was operating well, but that shoppers were being invited to pick up their shopping in stores in the event of cancellations.        
	Thousands of families will also be missing Christmas presents as couriers grapple with a two-week backlog. The extreme weather conditions that have brought motorways to a halt has forced leading retailers, including Marks amp; Spencer and Amazon, to admit to customers that they may not receive presents in time.         
	Matthew Hopkinson, a London-based company director, had his Marks amp; Spencer delivery pushed back from today to Christmas Eve. Its then or never, he said.        
	Marks amp; Spencer said it was working through a backlog and had cancelled some hamper and flower deliveries. A statement on Amazons website said that orders placed after December 17 may not arrive on time for Christmas.        
	The delays comes after a disastrous weekend for retailers. On what should have been the busiest weekend of the year, there were 20 per cent fewer shoppers in shopping centres compared with the same period last year, according to Synovate, the market research firm.         
	In the West Midlands and the southeast of England, visitors were down by a third. Analysts expect some shoppers to return in a last-minute dash this week, but the loss of impulse purchases alone could cost retailers tens of millions.        
	Royal Mail said it was extending evening deliveries and adding up to 14,000 extra rounds in an attempt to deliver as much mail as possible before Christmas.         
	Mark Higson, managing director, said: The authorities are doing all they can to keep major roads clear, but major routes together with rail and air services across the UK have been significantly impacted by heavy snowfalls in the last few days. We have had postmen and women on the streets for the last two Sundays in a row.

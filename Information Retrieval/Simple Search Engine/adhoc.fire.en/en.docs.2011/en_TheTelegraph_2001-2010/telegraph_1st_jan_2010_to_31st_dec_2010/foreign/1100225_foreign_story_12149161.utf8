The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Italy court: Google violated privacy

	Milan, Feb. 24: Three Google executives were convicted of violating Italian privacy laws today in a case that the company says could undermine freedom of expression on the Internet.        
	The case involved online videos showing an autistic boy being bullied by classmates in Turin. They were posted in 2006 on Google Video, an online video-sharing service that Google started before its acquisition of YouTube.        
	Prosecutors charged that the videos violated Italian personal privacy protections, and said they were removed only after complaints from Vivi Down, an Italian organisation representing people with Down syndrome, whose name was mentioned in the videos.        
	We are definitely satisfied that someone has to take responsibility for this violation of privacy, said Guido Camera, a lawyer for Vivi Down.        
	Google maintained that it had removed the videos as quickly as possible. The US search giant noted that it helped the authorities investigate the perpetrators who were punished under juvenile law. The company insisted that under EU law, video-sharing sites and other Internet companies are protected from liability for the contents of material posted.        
	The company portrayed the trial as part of a broader, politically motivated effort to reopen the debate over the extent of the liability of Internet companies for the content posted on their sites.        
	During the trial, Google said a guilty verdict could have a chilling effect on the development of the Internet in Italy and, perhaps, more widely across Europe. Screening or editing the contents of user-generated video sites in advance, the company says, is impossible because of the volume of material that is posted.        
	The officials who were found guilty are Peter Fleischer, Googles chief privacy counsel; David Drummond, senior vice-president and chief legal officer, and George Reyes, a former chief financial officer. The executives, who were named because Italian law holds corporate executives responsible for a companys actions, received six-month suspended sentences.        
	While the executives were found guilty of privacy violations, they were cleared of charges of defamation.        
	Though the executives will not have to serve prison time, the verdicts are nonetheless a black eye for Google, potentially tarnishing its self-styled dont be evil image.        
	Italy has been a difficult market for Google and other American Internet companies. A law currently being debated in the Italian parliament would increase such companies liability for potential legal issues arising from content available on their sites.        
	Google also faces an anti-trust investigation in Italy, stemming from complaints brought by newspaper publishers who say the company exercises unfair control over the online advertising business.

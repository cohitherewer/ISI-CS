	Lahore, Feb. 20 (PTI): Former Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Muaz, alias Omar Kundi, was shot dead by Pakistani commandos in Faisalabad yesterday.        
	Muaz allegedly carried out the May 2009 attack on the ISI headquarters in Faisalabad.        
	With the help of one of his close associates who was recently arrested, intelligence agencies located Muaz in Faisalabad, a senior police officer said.        
	He added that the police, with the help of the detained militant, laid a trap for Muaz.        
	They conveyed a message to former LeT chief that he should provide weapons for an attack on the ISI office in Faisalabad, located 100km from Lahore.        
	When Muaz and his accomplice Adil came in a rickshaw with the weapons, they were ambushed and killed by commandos hardly a kilometre from the ISI office on University Road.        
	Both Muaz and Adil were killed on the spot when they tried to open fire, said the police officer, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.        
	Muaz completed his MBBS from Punjab Medical College in Faisalabad in 2004-05. He later joined the LeT and became the amir (chief) of the banned group in the district.         
	After developing differences with LeT chief Hafiz Saeed over the working of the group, especially after the Lal Masjid siege in Islamabad in 2007, Muaz joined the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi to work against former President Pervez Musharrafs pro-US polices, the officer said.        
	Since then, Muaz has carried out several terrorist strikes in collaboration with the Punjab chapter of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.        
	He was also involved in attacks on ISI headquarters and the Federal Investigation Agency headquarters in Lahore and the police training centre in Manawan last year.        
	An officer of the Crime Investigation Department also said Muaz was heading a breakaway group of the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.         
	Air strike        
	An air strike killed 30 militants in the mountains on the Afghan border today.        
	The raid was in Shawal, a militant bastion near the border of the South and North Waziristan regions, where many Taliban are believed to have sought refuge. The hideout was targeted after we were tipped off that terrorists were hiding in the mountains, a military spokesman said, adding that 30 were killed.

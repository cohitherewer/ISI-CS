                              Reach for skies                            
	London, Oct. 4 (Reuters): Wartime leader Winston Churchill became the first British Prime Minister ever to enter the pop charts when an album featuring some of his most famous speeches set to music debuted in fourth place yesterday.        
	The album Reach For The Skies was recorded by the Central Band of the Royal Air Force (RAF) to mark the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, a crucial air campaign fought between British and German forces in 1940.        
	It is great that to a long list of Official Chart stars including Elvis, Madonna, Cliff (Richard) and The Beatles, we can now add Winston Churchill, said Martin Talbot, managing director of the Official Charts Company.        
	It is also a tribute to the amazing sacrifices of our servicemen that the British public have bought this RAF album in such large numbers.        
	Other new entrants in the album chart included KT Tunstalls Tiger Suit at number five, the Official Charts Company said, while Eric Clapton secured his 25th top 10 hit with Clapton, which was in seventh place.        
	In the singles chart, 21-year-old Londoner Tinie Tempah took the top spot with his second number one single Written In The Stars, which sold more than 115,000 copies in its first week  a figure topped by only two other singles this year. Adeles Make You Feel My Love jumped to fourth place.

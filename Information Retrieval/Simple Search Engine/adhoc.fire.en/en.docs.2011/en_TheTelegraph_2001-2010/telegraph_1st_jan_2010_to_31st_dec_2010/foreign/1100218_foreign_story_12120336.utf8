The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mossad did not carry out Hamas hit: Israel
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Mossad did not carry out Hamas hit: Israel
                            
	Jerusalem, Feb. 17 (Reuters): Israels foreign minister said today the use of the identities of foreign-born Israelis by a hit squad suspected of killing a Hamas militant in Dubai did not prove the Mossad spy agency assassinated him.        
	There is no reason to think that it was the Israeli Mossad, and not some other intelligence service or country up to some mischief, Avigdor Lieberman, asked about the operation and alleged passport subterfuge, told Army Radio.        
	But Lieberman did not deny outright Israeli involvement in the killing of Hamass Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel last month, saying Israel has a policy of ambiguity on intelligence matters and there was no proof it was behind the assassination.        
	Men with the same names as seven of the 11 suspects whose European passport photos were distributed by Dubai live in Israel. Those reached by reporters insisted their identities had been stolen.

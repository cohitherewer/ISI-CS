	Barcelona, Feb. 15: Microsoft today unveiled a new version of its flagship smartphone software at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.         
	It was called Windows Mobile but has now been dubbed Windows Phone.        
	Steve A. Ballmer, Microsofts chief executive, took the stage for a few minutes before a demonstration of the new software began. We debated a lot about how much we should position and talk about from whence we have come and what we will show you, Ballmer said. At the end of the day, we said: Lets get on with the show.        
	Windows Phone 7 Series has a cleaner look than most of todays phone software, with bright blue icons on a black background. One version of the initial screen has four large, square icons for phone, people, email and text functions that Microsoft calls Live Tiles.        
	Underneath, a rectangular box pulls in calendar information. And below that Microsoft is highlighting its Zune music and video software and its Xbox Live gaming service.

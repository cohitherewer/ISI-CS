The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Intense checks for Pak travellers to US
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Intense checks for Pak travellers to US

	Washington, Jan. 4: Citizens of 14 nations, including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria, who are flying to the US will be subjected indefinitely to the intense screening at airports worldwide that was imposed after the Christmas Day bombing plot, Obama administration officials announced yesterday.        
	But American citizens, and most others who are not flying through those 14 nations on their way to the US, will no longer automatically face the full range of intensified security that was imposed after the attempted bombing of a Northwest Airlines flight, officials said.        
	The change represents an easing of the immediate response to the attempted bombing of a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit that had been in place the past week. But the restrictions remain tougher than the rules that were in effect before the December 25 incident. The action yesterday further establishes a global security system that treats people differently based on what country they are from, evoking protests from civil rights groups.        
	Citizens of Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, countries that are considered state sponsors of terrorism, as well as those of countries of interest  including Afghanistan, Algeria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Yemen  will face the special scrutiny, officials said.        
	Passengers holding passports from those nations, or taking flights that originated or passed through any of them, will be required to undergo full-body pat downs and will face extra scrutiny of their carry-on bags before they can board planes to US.        
	In some countries that have more advanced screening equipment, travellers will also be required to pass through so-called whole-body scanners that can look beneath clothing for hidden explosives or weapons, or may be checked with a device that can find tiny traces of explosives.        
	Yesterday, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain announced that whole-body scanners would be introduced in that countrys airports. Officials in Amsterdam announced last week that they would begin using the scanners on passengers bound for the US.        
	Many, though not all, other passengers coming to the US will face similar measures, but that screening will be done randomly or if there is some reason to believe that a particular passenger might present a threat, officials said.        
	The changes should speed up boarding of international flights bound for the US while still increasing security beyond the standard X-rays of carry-on bags and metal-detector checks of all passengers.        
	The changes will mean that any citizen of Pakistan or Saudi Arabia will for the first time be patted down automatically before boarding any flight to the US. Even if that person has lived in a country like Britain for decades, he now will be subject to these extra security checks.        
	Nawar Shora, the legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, says the rule wrongly implies that all citizens of certain nations are suspect.        
	I understand there needs to be additional security in light of what was attempted on Christmas Day, Shora said, adding that he intended to file a formal protest. But this is extreme and very dangerous. All of a sudden people are labelled as being related to terrorism just because of the nation they are from. In the US, an order for a second screening has already been in effect.

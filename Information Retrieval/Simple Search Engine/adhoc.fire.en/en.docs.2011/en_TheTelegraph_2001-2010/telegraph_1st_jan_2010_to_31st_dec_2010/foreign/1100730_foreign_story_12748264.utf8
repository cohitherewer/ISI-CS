          ALASTAIR JAMIESON                          An iPad on display at an Apple store. (AP)                                  
	July 29: Apple is being sued by iPad owners who claim the device overheats too easily and shuts down, making it difficult to use outdoors.        
	The customers say the tablet computer is virtually unusable in relatively common conditions such as direct sunlight because it can cut out after only a few minutes of use.        
	A complaint has been filed by three customers  Jacob Balthazar, Claudia Keller and John Browning  at a federal court in Oakland, California.        
	It accuses Apple of everything from misleading and deceptive advertising to various breaches of business and consumer protection law.        
	The complaint also takes issue with Apples false marketing claim that the iPad is just like reading a book. Books do not close when a reader is enjoying them in sunlight, it says.        
	Lawyers behind the complaint are seeking class action status.        
	A Computerworld story said within hours of the products global launch on April 3, users had complained the device shut itself down in the sun.        
	PC Magazine editor Zach Honig put his iPad in the fridge in order to revive it when it cut out in hot weather.        
	The iPads instruction booklet warns the device could stop working if it is used in temperatures above 35 degrees Celsius.

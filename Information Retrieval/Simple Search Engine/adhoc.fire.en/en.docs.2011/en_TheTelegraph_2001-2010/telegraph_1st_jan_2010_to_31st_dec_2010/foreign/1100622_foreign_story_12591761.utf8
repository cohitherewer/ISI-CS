	Seattle, June 21: Back in the 1990s, typing out hello on most mobile phones required an exhausting 13 taps on the number keys, like: 44-33-555-555-666.         
	That was before the inventor Cliff Kushler, based here in Seattle, and a partner created software called T9, which could bring that number down to three by guessing the word being typed. Now there is a new challenge to typing on phones. More phones are using virtual keyboards on a touch screen, replacing physical buttons. But pecking out a message on a small piece of glass is not so easy, and typos are common.         
	Kushler thinks he has a solution once again. His new technology, which he developed with a fellow research scientist, Randy Marsden, is called Swype, and it allows users to glide a finger across the virtual keyboard to spell words, rather than tapping out each letter. While many smartphones have features that auto-complete words, correct typos on the fly and add punctuation, Kushler is aiming for the next level.         
	Weve squeezed the desktop computer, complete with keyboard and mouse, into something that fits in a pocket. The information bandwidth has become very constricted, he said. I thought, if we can find a better way to input that information, it could be something that would really take off.         
	Kushler says Swype is a big breakthrough that could reach billions of people. Thats not as ambitious as it sounds. To date, the T9 technology has been built into more than four billion devices worldwide. Swypes software detects where a finger pauses and changes direction as it traces out the pattern of a word. The movements do not have to be precise because the software calculates which words a user is most likely trying to spell.

	New York, Aug. 11 (AP): The JetBlue flight attendant who had a meltdown over a fight with an agitated traveller has been charged with felonies.         
	But he has already been elevated to folk-hero status by thousands who shrugged off allegations that Steven Slater endangered others and praised him for his take-this-job-and-shove-it moment.        
	Prosecutors say Slater flipped out over a fight with an agitated traveller on Monday, cursing over the intercom before grabbing some beer from the planes galley and making a grand exit down the emergency slide at Kennedy airport.        
	Slater, whose father was an airline pilot, wore a slight smile yesterday as he was led into a state court in the borough of Queens to be arraigned on charges of criminal mischief, reckless endangerment and trespassing, counts that carry a maximum penalty of seven years in prison. The judge set his bail at $2,500. Hours later, Slater exited a Bronx lockup after posting bail.        
	Sentiment online appeared to fall in Slaters court. By early yesterday afternoon, more than 20,000 people had declared themselves supporters of Slater on Facebook, and the number was growing by thousands every hour. At least one fan set up a legal fund on his behalf. Overwhelmingly people said it should have been the passenger who should have been ejected from the plane, said George Hobica.

	Feb. 4: The Kenyan aunt of President Barack Obama, Zeituni Onyango, is to appear before an immigration judge to fight deportation.        
	She will appear before an immigration judge for a second time to argue whether she should be allowed to stay in the US. Zeituni Onyango, 57, cared for Obamas siblings and moved to the US in 2000.        
	She has been living in Boston since 2008. Her first asylum request was rejected, and she was ordered to be deported in 2004. But she didnt leave the country and her status as an illegal immigrant was revealed just days before Obama was elected.              
	Obama says he didnt know his aunt was living in the country illegally. He says laws covering the situation should be followed.        
	A judge agreed to reopen the asylum case, which will be closed to the public in accordance with Onyangos wishes.        
	Mike Rogers, spokesman for the Ohio law firm defending Onyango, said she was not trying to capitalise on her relation to Obama  whose father was Onyangos half-brother.        
	Everyone knows shes related to him.        
	Its a no-win situation for him. He cant get involved in this. The law has got to run its course.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

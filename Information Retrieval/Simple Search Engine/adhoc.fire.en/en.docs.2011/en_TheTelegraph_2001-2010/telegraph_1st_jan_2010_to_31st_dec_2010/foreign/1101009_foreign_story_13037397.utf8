	Washington, Oct. 8: Afghan private security forces with ties to the Taliban, criminal networks and Iranian intelligence have been hired to guard American military bases in Afghanistan, exposing US soldiers to surprise attacks and confounding the fight against insurgents, according to a Senate investigation.        
	The Pentagons oversight of the Afghan guards is virtually non-existent, allowing local security deals among American military commanders, Western contracting companies and Afghan warlords who are closely connected to the violent insurgency, according to the report by investigators on the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee.        
	The US military has almost no independent information on the Afghans guarding the bases who are employees of Afghan groups hired as subcontractors by Western firms awarded security contracts by the Pentagon.         
	At one large American airbase in western Afghanistan, military personnel did not even know the names of the leaders of the Afghan groups providing security, the investigators found. So they used nicknames that the contractor was using  Mr. White and Mr. Pink from Reservoir Dogs, the 1992 gangster movie by Quentin Tarantino. Mr. Pink was later found to be a known Taliban figure, they reported.        
	In another incident, the US military bombed a house where it was believed that a Taliban leader was holding a meeting, only to discover later that the house was owned by an Afghan security contractor who was meeting his nephew  the Taliban leader.        
	Some Afghans hired by EOD Technology, which was awarded a US Army contract to provide security at a training centre for police officers in Adraskan, near Shindand, were also providing information to Iran, the report said. The Senate committee said it received intelligence from the Defense Intelligence Agency about Afghans working for EOD, and that the reporting found that some of them have been involved in activities at odds with US interests.        
	The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted the report by a unanimous vote, although Republican members were critical of the report for narrowly focusing on case studies in western Afghanistan.        
	In response to the report, defence secretary Robert Gates issued a letter saying the Pentagon has created task forces to help overhaul contracting procedures in Afghanistan. Through the new programs we have implemented, I believe DOD (department of defence) has taken significant steps to benefit our forces on the ground while not providing aid to our enemies, he wrote.         
	The Senate report focuses heavily on security contracting at remote American military bases in western Afghanistan, including the air base in Shindand, near Herat. ArmorGroup, a British-based security firm, was hired to provide security at Shindand.         
	Blast kills governor        
	A large bomb blast tore through a mosque in northern Afghanistan on Friday, killing Mohammed Omar, the governor of the Kunduz province, and at least a dozen others attending prayers, in the highest-profile assassination in over a year, Reuters reports.

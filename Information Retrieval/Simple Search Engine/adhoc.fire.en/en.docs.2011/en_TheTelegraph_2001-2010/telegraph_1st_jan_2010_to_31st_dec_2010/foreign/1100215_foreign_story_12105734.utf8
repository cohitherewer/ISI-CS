The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Varsity shooter had fired at kin

          SHAILA DEWAN AND LIZ ROBBINS                          Amy Bishop                                  
	Alabama, Feb. 14: The neurobiologist accused of killing three colleagues, including an Indian-American professor, at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, on Friday had fatally shot her brother in 1986 in suburban Boston.        
	Police are now questioning whether their department mishandled that case when it let neurobiologist Amy Bishop go without filing charges.        
	The police have charged Bishop with capital murder in yesterdays shootings that also left three people wounded during a faculty meeting.         
	Officials said the dead were all biology professors: Gopi K. Podila, the departments chairman, Maria Ragland Davis and Adriel D. Johnson Sr.         
	Bishop, who appeared to have had a promising future in the biotechnology business, had recently been told she would not be granted tenure, university officials said.        
	Yesterday, the police announced that 24 years ago, Bishop had fatally wounded her brother, Seth, in an argument at their home. The cops were considering reopening the case, in which she was not charged and the report by the officer on duty at the time was no longer available, said Paul Frazier, the Braintree police chief. The release of Bishop did not sit well with the police officers, Frazier said. He said the original account describing the shooting as an accident had been inaccurate.         
	A 1987 state police report, released yesterday by the Norfolk county district attorneys office, said Bishop had tried to teach herself to use the familys shotgun after a break-in occurred at their home. She said she had loaded the gun but could not unload it and asked her brother for help, in their mothers presence. She said the gun accidentally went off, striking her brother. Because her mother confirmed that account, the report said, the death was ruled accidental.        
	But Frazier said in his statement that the officer on duty, Ronald Solimini, remembered that Bishop had shot and killed her brother after an argument. She fired another round from the shotgun into the ceiling as she left the home, the officer said, and fled down the street with the shotgun. The officer also remembered her pointing the shotgun at a vehicle in an attempt to get the driver to stop, the chief said.        
	Another officer, Timothy Murphy, seized the shotgun, and Bishop was handcuffed and transported to the police station under arrest.        
	On Friday, she presided over her regular anatomy and neurosciences class before going to an afternoon faculty meeting on the third floor of the Shelby Center for Science and Technology.         
	There she sat quietly for about 30 or 40 minutes, said one faculty member who had spoken to some of the dozen people who were in the room. Then Bishop pulled out a 9-millimetre handgun and began shooting, firing several rounds, the police said. At least one person in the room tried to stop her and prevent further bloodshed, said sergeant Mark Roberts.        
	Bishop stopped shooting when the gun either jammed or ran out of ammunition, the faculty member said.        
	Bishop, a grant-winning scientist and a mother of four, is now charged with murder. If convicted, she will be eligible for the death penalty in Alabama.        
	Bishop may have had academic problems, but her business prospects seemed bright. She had developed a new approach to treating Lou Gehrigs disease. And she and her husband had invented an automated system for incubating cells that investors said would be a vast improvement over the petri dish.         
	From the way it looked to us, looking from the outside, shes had success, said Krishnan Chittur, a chemical engineering professor. Ive been here longer than she has, and shes had more success raising money than Ive had.

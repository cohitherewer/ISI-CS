	Islamabad/United Nations, April 1 (PTI): Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari wants a UN panel probing the killing of his wife Benazir Bhutto to question Afghan President Hamid Karzai and former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice as they had information about the threats to her life.        
	However, the UN says there is no need to include any further information as the report by the three-member independent commission, led by Chiles UN envoy Heraldo Munoz, is complete.        
	Zardari has quietly given names of four international personalities  Rice, Karzai, Saudi Arabian intelligence chief Prince Muqrin (bin Abdul Aziz) and the UAE intelligence chief  to the UN inquiry commission to ask them: how did they know the secret in advance that Benazir Bhutto would be killed?, The News reported today.        
	The panel has been asked to meet these four indirect witnesses before submitting its report on Bhuttos assassination, the paper said citing unnamed sources.        
	This new information has also resolved a two-and-half year old mystery  which two countries had warned Bhutto about a possible attack on her life when she returned to Pakistan from self-exile in October 2007, the report said.        
	It identified the two countries as UAE and Saudi Arabia, whose intelligence agencies chiefs had warned the Pakistan Peoples Party chairperson (about) threats to her life.        
	The report claimed the UN commission was making contacts with the four personalities to seek explanations from them as how did they already (know of) threats to Bhuttos life.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Airport security checks are redundant: BA
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Airport security checks are redundant: BA
          PETER HUTCHISON                              
	Oct. 27: Passengers are needlessly removing their shoes and having their laptops inspected because of pointless security checks at airports, the chairman of British Airways has claimed.        
	Martin Broughton criticised redundant airport checks and said Britain should stop kowtowing to American demands for increased security.        
	He told the annual conference of the UK Airport Operators Association in London that many of the security checks should be scrapped.        
	Broughton added that there was no need to kowtow to the Americans every time they wanted something done to bolster security on flights bound for the US.        
	In a speech he said: America does not do internally a lot of the things they demand that we do. We shouldnt stand for that. We should say: Well only do things which we consider to be essential and that you Americans also consider essential.        
	He pointed out that many of the checks, such as making passengers remove their footwear, are not required on internal US flights. It was introduced after the shoe bomber Richard Reid hid explosives in his shoes on a transatlantic flight in 2001.        
	Measures were increased following other threats. Liquids over 100ml were banned from flights after a plot in August 2006 which threatened to blow up a flight using liquid explosives and America increased demands for extra passenger checks on flights after a Nigerian man tried to detonate a device hidden in his underwear on a flight to Detroit in December last year.        
	He continued: We all know theres quite a number of elements in the security programme which are completely redundant and they should be sorted out.        
	He also suggested that differing attitudes towards technology made checks on laptops pointless.        
	Take the iPad, they still havent decided if it is a laptop or it isnt a laptop. So some airports think you should take it out and some think you shouldnt, Broughton said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Paris breaks blockade
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Paris breaks blockade
                                  
	Paris, Oct. 22 (Reuters): French riot police rushed picket lines to break a blockade of the main fuel refinery supplying Paris today as unions hardened their stance before a vote on President Nicolas Sarkozys pension reform.        
	Signalling their determination to keep fighting even after a bill raising the retirement age becomes law, the countrys six main unions have called for two more days of action on October 28 and November 6 against the unpopular reform.        
	The protests are not stopping, we just have different views on how to proceed, Jean-Claude Mailly, head of the more radical Force Ouvriere union told RMC radio. We still think that demonstrating is not enough ... we have to ramp it up ... we need a strong day of public and private sector strikes. The government appeared equally determined.        
	Police in riot gear wielding shields rushed a blockade and cleared pickets and burning tyres at dawn at Totals Grandpuits oil refinery, which supplies fuel for the Paris area. Scuffles broke out at the refinery southeast of the capital and one person was carried away on a stretcher after being trampled.        
	Analysts did not expect the strikes to have any lasting impact on sentiment towards French debt. France comfortably sold short-term paper today though it paid a premium from previous issues on what analysts said may be fleeting concerns over ability to enforce austerity measures.         
	The Centre-Right government resorted to a special guillotine procedure to speed the reform bills passage through the Senate, with a vote now due as pressure builds on Sarkozy to end the long-running impasse with the unions ahead of half-term holidays beginning this weekend.

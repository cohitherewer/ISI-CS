The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China to Dalai: No deal on Tibet
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China to Dalai: No deal on Tibet

	Beijing, Feb. 1 (Agencies): Chinese officials told envoys of the Dalai Lama there would be no compromise on Chinas control of Tibet and that communist rule was a boon to the mountain region, state media said today.        
	The Xinhua news agency report on the talks in China with envoys from the Tibetan government in exile suggested little has been accomplished in the latest discussions.        
	The representatives of the Dalai Lama, exiled from his homeland since 1959, arrived in China last month after Beijing laid out a new policy approach that for the first time includes all Tibetan regions, including those outside the official Tibetan Autonomous Region.        
	But Du Qinglin, the Chinese Communist Party official in charge of dealings with religious and ethnic groups, said his government would never back down from claiming full sovereignty over Tibet.        
	There is no space at all for any discussion of sovereignty and territorial issues, and not the slightest room for any concessions, Du told the envoys, according to the report.        
	Beijing has become increasingly irate over the Dalai Lamas international travels and meetings with foreign political leaders.        
	Du said that while the Dalai Lama continued such activities, there can be no progress in any contacts or discussions with the envoys of the exiled Buddhist leader.        
	Talks began in 2002 but broke down amid acrimony in 2008. China says the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Dalai Lama is a violent separatist. He says he only wants genuine autonomy for his homeland.        
	Violent anti-Chinese demonstrations in the Tibetan capital Lhasa left at least 19 dead on March 14, 2008. Exile groups say the real death toll was far higher. An official statement issued after the conclusion of the talks said: During the meetings (Communist Party) officials... reitera- ted that no concessions would be made on issues concer- ning Chinas national sovereignty.        
	It said the Dalai Lamas idea of high degree of autonomy (for Tibet) violates Chinas Constitution.         
	The statement said that the Dalai Lamas representatives Lodi Gyari and Kelsang Gyaltsen had expressed their opinion on relevant issues. The latest round of dialogue between China and envoys of the Dalai Lama comes a fortnight ahead of the Tibetan leaders visit to the US on February 16 where he is most likely to meet President Barack Obama.        
	The Communist Party officials had briefed the envoys on what it called recent achievements made by the Tibet Autonomous Region.        
	The envoys returned to New Delhi and later left for Dharamshala to brief the Dalai Lama and other senior Tibetan leaders on the talks.         
	A Tibetan official in Dharamshala said Chinese objections to sovereignty for Tibet were misplaced as we are only seeking autonomy and not independence.        
	Gyari and Gyaltsen held meetings with party and government officials in the central province of Hunan before moving to Beijing.

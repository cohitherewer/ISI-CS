	Yangon, Nov. 5: During nearly five decades of military dictatorship, the impoverished population of Myanmar has become accustomed to hearing soldiers shout orders. And now comes a more unusual request from the ruling generals: Vote!        
	Every citizen who values democracy and wants democratic rule must cast their votes without fail, says a daily exhortation running in the state news media that urges voters to choose candidates correctly.        
	The national elections to be held here on Sunday are the first since an effort to form a parliament 20 years ago was aborted by the military because it lost in a landslide. Judging from the juntas enthusiasm, the generals appear confident that this time they will come out on top.        
	Many citizens of Myanmar, formerly Burma, both inside and outside the country dismiss the elections as a sham, an empty exercise in legitimising the continued rule of the military, which will appoint a quarter of the members of the parliament.         
	There have been no campaign debates, the government has barred outside election monitors, the news media are heavily censored and parties must obtain permission to hold election rallies weeks in advance.        
	Even the countrys links to the Internet have been disrupted, with the low-capacity portals periodically overwhelmed with a flood of data that makes communications impossible. While the culprit could not be immediately identified, suspicion focused on the government, which has barred western journalists from covering the elections and generally seals off Myanmar from contacts with the outside world.         
	But many here have a more optimistic take. Accustomed to repression, they measure hope and progress with a lower threshold, and some see in the elections the seeds of a less hierarchical and authoritarian system.

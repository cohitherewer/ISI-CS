The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cameron steps in to quell revolt over cuts 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Cameron steps in to quell revolt over cuts 
          JAMES KIRKUP AMP; ANDREW PORTER                      David Cameron                          
	London, Oct. 16: David Cameron has intervened to halt a revolt by some of the most senior figures in the military over the scale of defence cuts.         
	The Prime Minister made his move after being told by the new head of the army that proposed reductions in the forces threatened Britains mission in Afghanistan.         
	General Sir Peter Wall, the Chief of the General Staff, made clear to 10 Downing Street that he could not accept cuts in army numbers and training which would hamper the Afghan operation. In the wake of Sir Peters warning, Downing Street sources last night said Cameron had blocked a treasury demand for a 10 per cent cut in the defence budget.         
	He has intervened against the Treasury. The Army will be protected, said a source.         
	Cameron told the treasury that he would not accept substantial reductions in army numbers. Downing Street sources added that Cameron was insistent that more savings be made from the Trident nuclear weapons system.         
	Final details of the budget deal were still being hammered out last night in Whitehall, and military sources refused to declare victory in the power struggle.         
	Camerons intervention followed a day of threats from senior defence figures. The angry response from the top brass came after the treasury attempted to force the ministry of defence to make cuts deeper than those which had been agreed previously. Military chiefs had described the move as a betrayal.         
	It had appeared on Thursday that Dr Liam Fox, the defence secretary, and George Osborne, the chancellor, had agreed a deal for a 7 per cent cut to the ministrys budget. But the treasury position hardened yesterday morning, with officials making renewed demands for 10 per cent cuts.         
	The last-minute switch caused fury at the ministry, and Forces chiefs were sent to Downing Street for crisis talks. In private meetings, senior commanders told Camerons team the bigger cuts package would undermine the Afghan war and potentially force Britain into a humiliating early withdrawal.

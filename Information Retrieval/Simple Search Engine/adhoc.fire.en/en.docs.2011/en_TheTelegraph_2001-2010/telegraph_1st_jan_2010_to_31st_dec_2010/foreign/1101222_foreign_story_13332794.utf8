	London, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Northern Europes big freeze wreaked more havoc today as some airports failed to cope with the snow.        
	More planes got off the ground than yesterday, but for thousands of travellers hoping to get home or away for Christmas, delays and cancellations were widespread.        
	Eurocontrol, which oversees air-traffic control across 38 countries, said it expected more services to operate after about 3,000 flights across Europe were cancelled yesterday.        
	Europes weather woes are having far reaching implications, with Kenya warning it was likely to miss its 2010 tourism forecasts as a result of the flight disruption.        
	With more snow forecast, there was little Christmas cheer for those camped at Londons Heathrow airport waiting for flights or queuing for cross-channel Eurostar trains in sub-zero temperatures outside central Londons St Pancras station.        
	Heathrow looked more like a refugee camp with angry and frustrated passengers camping in departure halls as they awaited information on delayed or cancelled flights.        
	BAA, owned by Spains Ferrovial, which runs the worlds busiest international airport, operated at a much reduced capacity for much of the day.         
	British Airways said it expected a significant number of cancellations to its shorthaul services from Heathrow, the carriers main hub. It blamed severe weather for the disruption, which it said would continue up to Christmas.        
	Londons Gatwick Airport, which closed overnight due to renewed snowfall, re-opened at 0600GMT but passengers were told to expect further disruption, delays and cancellations.

	Washington, Feb. 1 (AP): President Barack Obama sent Congress his new budget today, a plan that forecasts the government spending a record $1.66 trillion more than it takes in through taxes.        
	Obama blamed the huge deficit on the decisions of President George W. Bush, previous Congresses and his administrations steps to prevent an economic collapse.        
	The President said in normal circumstances he would have worked to pay down the yearly deficit immediately, but costly steps were needed to help an economy in free fall.        
	He asked lawmakers to follow his lead on reducing waste and to avoid grandstanding. The $3.83 trillion budget includes a huge tranche to lower double-digit unemployment  about $100 billion in tax incentives to hire workers and improve the nations infrastructure. The spending jump will be partially offset by higher taxes on wealthy Americans - families earning more than $250,000 yearly.

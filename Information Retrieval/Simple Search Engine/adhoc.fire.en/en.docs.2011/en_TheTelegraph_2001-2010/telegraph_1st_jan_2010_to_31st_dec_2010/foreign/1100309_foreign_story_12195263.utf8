The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bigelow gets a Yes from Cameron
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bigelow gets a Yes from Cameron
  - Moment of a lifetime                            Bigelow and Cameron at the Oscars in the Kodak Theater in Hollywood. (AFP)                                  
	Los Angeles, March 8 (AP): Kathryn Bigelow made Oscar history, becoming the first woman to win best director at the Academy Awards for her gritty Iraq war saga The Hurt Locker.        
	Bigelows film, which also won best picture last night, follows the dangerous daily existence of an army bomb defusal team. There is no other way to describe it  its the moment of a lifetime, Bigelow said, her voice quivering. She dedicated the award to the military men and women serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world: May they come home safe.        
	Bigelow was the fourth woman nominated for the prize, following Sofia Coppola for 2003s Lost in Translation, Jane Campion for 1993s The Piano and Lina Wertmuller for 1975s Seven Beauties. She was the front runner heading into the Academy Awards.        
	Barbra Streisand, director of films including Yentl and The Prince of Tides, walked out on stage to present the category. Well, the time has come, Streisand said.        
	Bigelow also got the better of ex-husband James Cameron, who was up for directing the sci-fi blockbuster Avatar  and she had been sitting directly in front of him during the Oscar ceremony.         
	Much has been made about the former spouses competing against each other, but their split was amicable and the two since have supported each other professionally.         
	As Bigelows victory was announced, Cameron could be seen clapping and saying, Yes, yes. Backstage, reporters repeatedly tried to coax her to dish on her ex, but she was abidingly diplomatic. I think hes an extraordinary filmmaker, she said , when asked what it was like to beat him.

	Shakira strip    
	 London, June 15 (PTI): Colombian pop star Shakira says she does not want to strip naked for a photo shoot but admits she may change her mind and reveal all after she turns forty.       
	Shakira, 33, who appeared in a skin-tight bodysuit and danced in a cage in her She-Wolf video, is too shy to bare all for a photo shoot.      
	I dont want to and I dont have to. I couldnt strip naked. Maybe when Im 40 I will change my mind, Shakira said.

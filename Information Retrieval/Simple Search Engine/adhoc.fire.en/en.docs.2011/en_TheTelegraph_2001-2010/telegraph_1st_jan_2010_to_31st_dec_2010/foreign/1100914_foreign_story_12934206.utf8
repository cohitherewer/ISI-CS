	Los Angeles, Sept. 13: Lady Gaga, who came under fire recently for wearing a meat bikini on the cover of Vogue Hommes Japan, wore a raw meat dress at last nights MTV Video Music Awards.         
	It was one of many outfits she wore throughout the night.        
	A teary-eyed Gaga accepted a Moon Man award for Video of the Year for Bad Romance  one of eight on the night for her  from Cher (wearing a vintage MTV outfit). Gaga was again wearing meat.         
	Ellen DeGeneres, who is a vegetarian, taped the season opener of her show last night at the Nokia Theater and asked Gaga about the dress.        
	Well, it is certainly no disrespect to anyone that is vegan or vegetarian. As you know, I am the most judgment-free human being on the earth, said Gaga. However, it has many interpretations but for me this evening. If we dont stand up for what we believe in and if we dont fight for our rights, pretty soon were going to have as much rights as the meat on our own bones. And, I am not a piece of meat.        
	Ellen then presented her with a veggie bikini and suggested she try that next time she wants to make a statement.        
	After accepting the Video of the Year trophy, Gaga said: Tonight, little monsters, were the cool kids at the party, said Gaga, referring to her nickname for her fans. She also thanked the gays, US servicemen and late designer Alexander McQueen, whose elaborate creation she was wearing.

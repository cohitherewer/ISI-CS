	Washington, Oct. 8: A New York auctioneer was contemplating a loss of at least $30,000 in fees and commissions yesterday after the FBI confiscated a set of John Lennons fingerprints.         
	The prints, valued at $100,000, were made in 1976. They were seized by a federal agent claiming that they might be government property.

	Paul sign inked    
	 West Chester (Pennsylvania), Aug. 17 (AP): A US woman has had Paul McCartneys signature permanently etched onto her body by a tattoo artist after the musical icon answered her pleas to sign her back.      
	Rose Ann Belluso took a sign to McCartneys show on Sunday in Philadelphia requesting he sign her back with a marker she had brought along. When McCartney called her up on stage and obliged, the Downingtown woman decided to make it last forever.      
	A tattoo artist at Extreme Ink Tattoo Parlour in West Chester went over the signature on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Holbrooke for greater Pak militant push
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Holbrooke for greater Pak militant push

	London, July 23 (Reuters): Pakistan is cooperating more with US-backed Afghan peace efforts but not to the extent sought by Washington, the US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan said today.        
	Speaking on a visit to Britain, Richard Holbrooke cited several areas of progress including a greater Pakistani military push against militants on its soil, but an Afghan Taliban faction called the Haqqani network remained a real problem.        
	Without Pakistans participation, this (Afghan) war could go on indefinitely, he said in a briefing for reporters after holding talks with Britains chief of the defence staff, David Richards, and UK National Security Adviser Peter Ricketts.        
	Theres much more cooperation at every level, he said, citing joint efforts to build bilateral military, consular and economic ties and an expanded assault by Pakistani forces against some militants in areas near the Afghan border.        
	But I dont want to mislead you ... it (cooperation) is not yet where we hope it will be, he said.        
	Pakistani action against militants on the frontier is seen as important for bringing stability to Afghanistan, where US forces are leading a major Nato offensive against the Taliban.         
	But Pakistan is believed to be using the Haqqanis to strike a deal with President Hamid Karzai to gain influence and keep the sway of rival India to a minimum should the US begin drawing down troops in July 2011 as planned.         
	The Haqqani network, led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son, Sirajuddin, is one of three main factions of the Afghan Taliban.        
	The group is blamed for several daring attacks on coalition and Afghan forces and is allied with both Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar and Osama bin Ladens al Qaida. Holbrooke declined to discuss North Waziristan, home of the Haqqanis and other armed groups. Washington has urged Pakistani forces to enter the area to attack fighters there.

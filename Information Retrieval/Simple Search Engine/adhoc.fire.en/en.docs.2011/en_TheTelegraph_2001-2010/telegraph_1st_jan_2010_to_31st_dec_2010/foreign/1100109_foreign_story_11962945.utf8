	 London, Jan. 8 (PTI): Victoria Beckham showed off her posh credentials on a recent shopping trip when she came close to spending a whopping $1.6 million on designer goods.       
	She visited Milan over the Christmas period and headed straight for the stores to splash out on gifts for herself and husband David Beckham.

	London, April 26 (PTI): Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood owes his musical excellence to The Beatles as he spent a lot of time listening to their riffs.        
	Wood, who joined the Stones in 1976, admits he picked up tips tuning into a live jam radio session the Beatles recorded in the 1960s when he was just starting out with his first band The Birds, reports the Daily Express . They had their own radio show. They were like a bunch of kids let loose in the studio, shouting and hollering, Wood said. I used to tune in every week and kop (steal) some riffs off them. When I was in my first band, we used to get inspired listening to their madness and the live tracks they would play, Woods added.

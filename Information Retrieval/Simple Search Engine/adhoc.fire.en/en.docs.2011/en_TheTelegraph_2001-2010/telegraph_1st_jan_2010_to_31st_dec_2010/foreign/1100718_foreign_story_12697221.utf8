The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Snipes faces jail over tax returns
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Snipes faces jail over tax returns
                                  
	Miami, July 17 (Reuters): Actor Wesley Snipes is headed for jail after losing his appeal of a three-year prison sentence for failing to file income tax returns for 1999 through 2001.        
	A federal appeals court yesterday upheld the 47-year-old actors 2008 conviction in an Ocala, Florida, court for three misdemeanours stemming from felony tax charges.        
	At his sentencing in April 2008, prosecutors said Snipes, a Florida native who has a residence in Windermere, had earned more than $38 million since 1999, but had filed no tax returns or paid any taxes. In his appeal, the actor claimed that the sentence was unreasonable and he should have been considered for probation.

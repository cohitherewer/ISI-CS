	Bush bore    
	May 17: Laura Bush, the former First Lady, has spoken for the first time about her husband George W. Bushs drinking, calling him a bore when he had too much, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	 an interview about her life with Bush, she said his love of alcohol left her disappointed, although she denied ever giving him an ultimatum about his drinking. Bush has always denied he was an alcoholic, but he gave up drinking when he turned 40. He was arrested for drink driving in 1976.      
	George drank the three Bs, a bourbon before dinner, a beer with dinner and then B amp;B [a mixture of Brandy and Benedictine liquor], a sweet after dinner drink, she said. He didnt have three drink every night, many times all he had was a beer. But when he poured enough, he could be a bore, Laura Bush said.

	His works include Saturday Night and Sunday Morning and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, which were later made into films.        
	He left school at 14 and worked in factories in his home city of Nottingham, before joining the air force. He fell ill with tuberculosis and was hospitalised for 18 months during which time he began to write.

          NICK ALLEN                          Cover up                                  
	Los Angeles, April 13: Pamela Anderson, the former Baywatch star, has failed to pay $493,000 in taxes, according to California officials.        
	Anderson is on the annual list of delinquent taxpayers released by the California Franchise Tax Board. She allegedly owes the money in personal income tax. The 42-year-old Canadian actress is among 250 individual and business taxpayers who each are said to owe more than $100,000 in back taxes.        
	 State records show a tax lien for $493,144 was filed against Anderson in April 2009. Her attorney, Robert T. Leonard, declined to comment further. Anderson is currently competing on the TV show, Dancing With the Stars. Producers asked Anderson to cover up to avoid any chance of a wardrobe malfunction.

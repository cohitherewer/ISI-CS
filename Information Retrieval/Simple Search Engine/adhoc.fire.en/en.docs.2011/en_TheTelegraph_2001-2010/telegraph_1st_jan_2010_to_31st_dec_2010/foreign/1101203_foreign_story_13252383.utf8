The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US has dim view of Putin
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US has dim view of Putin

	Dec. 2: Early in 2009, as recession rippled around the world, the US embassy in Moscow sent to Washington a cable summarising whispers within Russias political class. Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, the rumours said, often did not show up at his office.        
	The embassy titled the cable Questioning Putins Work Ethic. There are consistent reports that Putin resents or resists the workload he carries, it said, citing Putins fatigue, hands-off behaviour and isolation to the point that he was working from home.        
	The cable, approved by the American ambassador, John R. Beyrle, assessed the Kremlin rumours not as indicators of Putins weakness, but of the limits of his position in a period of falling commodity prices and tightening credit. Russias most powerful man sat atop Russias spoils. The recession left him with less to dole out, eroding some of his Teflon persona.        
	His disengagement reflects, the cable concluded, his recognition that a sharp reduction in resources limits his ability to find workable compromises among the Kremlin elite. Officially, the US has sought since last year what President Obama and his Russian counterpart, Dmitri A. Medvedev, have called a reset in relations.        
	But scores of secret American cables from recent years, obtained by WikiLeaks and made available to several news organisations, show that beneath the public efforts at warmer ties, the US harbours a dim view of the post-Soviet Kremlin and its leadership, and little hope that Russia will become more democratic or reliable. The cables portray Putin as enjoying supremacy over all other Russian public figures, yet undermined by the very nature of the post-Soviet country he helped build.        
	Even a man with his formidable will and intellect is shown beholden to intractable larger forces, including an inefficient economy and an unmanageable bureaucracy that often ignores his edicts.        
	In language candid and bald, the cables reveal an assessment of Putins Russia as highly centralised, occasionally brutal and all but irretrievably cynical and corrupt. Throughout the internal correspondence between the American embassy and Washington, the American diplomats in Moscow painted a Russia in which public stewardship was barely tended to and history was distorted.

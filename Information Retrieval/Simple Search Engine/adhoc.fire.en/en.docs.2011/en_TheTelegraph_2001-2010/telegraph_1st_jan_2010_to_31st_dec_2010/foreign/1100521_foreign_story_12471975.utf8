                              Tareq and Michaele Salahi                            
	Washington, May 20 (AP): The White House party crashers, Michaele and Tareq Salahi, were stopped in a limousine near the White House last evening as President Barack Obama was holding his second official state dinner.        
	The limousine driver ran through a red light at around 8pm (local time), just blocks from the White House and was stopped by a uniformed Secret Service officer, according to Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan. The driver had signalled to turn into a restricted area near the Ellipse.         
	The attention-hungry couple were among those in the limousine. They were released and went to dinner a few blocks from the White House after the incident. The driver was fined for running the red light.        
	The Salahis have been under investigation for attending Obamas first state dinner for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last November even though they were not on a guest list. It was a huge embarrassment for the White House that the couple got into the dinner uninvited and got close enough to the countrys highest officials.

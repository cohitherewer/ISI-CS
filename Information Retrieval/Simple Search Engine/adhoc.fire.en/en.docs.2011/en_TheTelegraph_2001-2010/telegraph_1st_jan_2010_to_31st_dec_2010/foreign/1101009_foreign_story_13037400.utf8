          RICHARD ALLEYNE                              
	London, Oct. 8: Researchers discovered that men on an average start perspiring much more quickly than women and twice as much when exercising.         
	But while this may make men look less cool than women in the gym, it actually means their bodies are working more effectively.         
	The study involved 20 women and 17 men, roughly half of whom were fit, cycling continuously at various intensities for an hour in a room heated to 30C. A special device measured the amount of perspiration leaving their bodies at any one time.         
	The scientists at Osaka International University and Kobe University in Japan found that men lost twice as much moisture per square inch of forehead, chest, back, forearm and thigh at any one time. The measure showed that men were more efficient at sweating and that women required a much higher body temperature before they started losing moisture.         
	In other words, women need to get hotter than men before they get sweaty. The studys coordinator Yoshimitsu Inoue said: It appears that women are at a disadvantage when they need to sweat a lot during exercise, especially in hot conditions.

  - Parliament not happy with candidates competence        ALISSA J. RUBIN                          Afghan MPs vote during a debate in Kabul on Saturday. (AP)                                        
	Kabul, Jan. 2: In a clear signal to President Hamid Karzai that he cannot count on parliament for support, lawmakers resoundingly rejected most of his nominees for cabinet posts and expressed discontent with the candidates competence.        
	Of Karzais 24 cabinet nominees, 17 were rejected and 7 approved. Of those who received votes of confidence, all but one are currently cabinet ministers.        
	The Presidents office had no comment on todays vote; the deputy spokesman, Hamid Elmi, said a news conference would be held tomorrow.        
	After being declared the winner of an election tainted by fraud, Karzai has been under pressure from western leaders and Afghan Opposition figures to help make things right by choosing cabinet officials not linked to corruption or incompetence.         
	Parliaments action today made it clear that they felt he had not met those requirements. In particular, they said that they were not consulted enough during the nomination process and that the cabinet would not have adequately represented Afghanistans ethnic mix.         
	That created questions about whether lawmakers were primarily interested in being partisan defenders of their own ethnic constituencies, though many denied that that was a factor.        
	The members of parliament cast their vote based on merit, not based on tribal or ideology or factional interests, said Kabir Rangbar, an independent member from Kabul. This is a reaction against Karzais choices.        
	Of those who were confirmed, four were Pashtuns, one was Tajik, one an Uzbek and one from the Sadat minority. The only woman nominated was turned down, and the two members of the Hazara minority who were nominated were also rejected. In all, seven ministers who were nominated for second terms were voted down, including the ministers of public health, telecommunications and counternarcotics.        
	Five of the most prominent and successful ministers during Karzais first term, the defence, interior, finance, education and agriculture ministers, were endorsed for second terms.

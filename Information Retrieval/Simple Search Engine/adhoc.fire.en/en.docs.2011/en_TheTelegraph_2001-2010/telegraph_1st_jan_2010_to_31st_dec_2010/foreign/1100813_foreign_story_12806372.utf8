The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak issues new flood warnings
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pak issues new flood warnings

	Islamabad, Aug. 12: Pakistan issued new flood warnings today that could last into the weekend as government and relief agencies scrambled to confront the toll from a growing humanitarian disaster.        
	The new warnings to several cities in Punjab and Sindh Provinces added to the desperation of survivors across the country facing a daily struggle for survival as Muslims around the world began to mark Ramazan.        
	President Asif Ali Zardari, who came under stinging criticism for making a trip to Europe as the flood disaster unfolded, made his first tour of flood-hit areas today since his return to the country this week, beginning with Sukkur in Sindh province, news reports said.        
	The US embassy in Islamabad announced that two Marine helicopters had arrived in the country, the first of a contingent of 19 American military choppers that has been ordered to assist the Pakistani government in relief efforts. The US has pledged $71 million for flood relief, and American officials have called for more.        
	The UN has estimated that at least one-fifth of the country is underwater, but the scope of damage seems far greater. About 14 million people have been affected by the floods, and 6 million of them are children, according to Unicef. Estimates of the dead have ranged between 1,200 and 1,600.        
	Today, flood alerts went out to several cities in Punjab and Sindh. The city of Muzaffargarh in southern Punjab province looked like a ghost town after more than 80 per cent of its population left because of flooding fears. Hundreds of residents moved to makeshift encampments along a road to the city of Multan.        
	One resident, Muhammad Farooq, said he chose to remain in Muzaffargarh to protect his house from theft while his family moved to Multan.        
	We are helpless and praying to God that our city is saved, as the threat is still there from the river Chenab, he said.

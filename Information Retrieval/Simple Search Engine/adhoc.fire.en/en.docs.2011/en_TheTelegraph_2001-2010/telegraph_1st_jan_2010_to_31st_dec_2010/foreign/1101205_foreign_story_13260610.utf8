The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Signs of new frenzy at Silicon Valley
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Signs of new frenzy at Silicon Valley

	Dec. 4: In a memorable scene in the movie The Social Network, Sean Parker, the investor played by Justin Timberlake, leans over the table and tells the founders of Facebook in a conspiratorial tone: A million dollars isnt cool. You know whats cool? A billion dollars.        
	These days in Silicon Valley, a billion dollars seems downright quaint. The enthusiasm for social networking and mobile apps has venture capitalists clamouring to give money to young companies.        
	The exuberance has given rise to an elite club of start-ups  all younger than seven years and all worth billions. Successive investments in Twitter have reportedly increased its value 33 per cent, to $4 billion, while Zynga, creator of the popular Facebook game FarmVille, is worth more than $5 billion.        
	Google was willing to pay $6 billion for Groupon, an online coupon company that was valued at $1.35 billion only eight months ago. And Groupon was willing to reject the bid last evening, presumably because it could sell for even more money later.        
	Less than a decade after the dot-com bust taught Wall Street and Silicon Valley investors that what goes up does not keep going up forever, a growing number of entrepreneurs and a few venture capitalists are beginning to wonder if investments in tech start-ups are headed toward another big bust.        
	The chief evidence, according to industry experts and analysts, is the way venture capitalists and established companies are clamouring to give money to young companies, including those with only a shred of an idea.         
	They are piling into me-too start-ups that imitate popular Web companies that already received financing. Companies that involve social shopping, mobile photo sharing and new social networking are finding it easy to attract investors because no one wants to miss the next big thing.        
	Yammer, a system for sending Twitter-like messages inside businesses, recently raised $25 million, while investors reportedly signed a check for close to $30 million for a niche blogging site called Tumblr. GroupMe, a new group messaging app for mobile phones, raised $9 million. Path, an iPhone app for sharing only photos on a social network limited to just 50 people, received $2.5 million. Its competitor, Picplz, scored $5 million. And those are just within the last few weeks.        
	It has some venture capitalists scratching their heads.        
	Im not saying Quora, Foursquare, Square arent eventually worth a lot of money, but the price to pay to get into those games is kind of amazing  $50 to $80 million? said Dave McClure, founding partner of 500 Startups, a technology incubator in Silicon Valley. These companies are in big markets with proven founders, so maybe not absolutely crazy but certainly eyebrow-raising.        
	Fred Wilson, a prominent venture capitalist, said he had watched the trend accelerate over the last six to nine months. I am seeing many more unnatural acts from investors happening, he said in a recent blog post. He attributes it to competition among investors eager to participate in popular young start-ups.         
	And he notes, I have never seen phases like this end nicely.        
	No one really knows if there is a bubble until after one pops. Nevertheless, there are many signs of froth. For example, enthusiasm for closely held Facebook shares has run so high that private investors are trading derivatives of it.

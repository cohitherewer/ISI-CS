The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kennedy bows out
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Kennedy bows out
                              Kennedy                            
	Washington, Feb. 12 (AP): Representative Patrick Kennedys decision not to seek re-election will leave Washington without a Kennedy in political office for the first time in more than 60 years.        
	The Democrats term ends early next year. However, he says in a television message viewed by The Associated Press yesterday that his life is taking a new direction and he will not seek a ninth term. The video was provided to AP by Kennedys office.        
	The 42-year-old son of the late Senator Edward Kennedy does not give a reason for the decision but says it has been a difficult few years for many people and he mentions the death in August of his father.         
	Illness took the life of my most cherished mentor and confidante, my ultimate source of spirit and strength, he said, as a black-and-white photo of him as a boy sailing with his father appeared on the screen. From the countless lives he lifted, to the American promise he helped shape, my father taught me that politics at its very core was about serving others.         
	The announcement is to air tomorrow on television stations in the state of Rhode Island, which Patrick Kennedy represents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Zardari: Militants can exploit flood chaos
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Zardari: Militants can exploit flood chaos

	Islamabad, Aug. 19 (AP): Islamist terrorists may exploit the chaos and misery caused by the floods in Pakistan to gain new recruits, President Asif Ali Zardari warned today.        
	His remarks were echoed by Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said America would stand by its vital wartime ally during the crisis.        
	The floods have affected 20 million people and about one-fifth of Pakistans territory, straining its civilian government as it also struggles against al Qaida and Taliban violence. Aid groups and the UN have complained that foreign donors have not been quick or generous enough given the scale of the disaster.        
	All these catastrophes give strength to forces who do not want a state structure, Zardari said during a news conference with John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, after the two visited some of the countrys hardest-hit areas and a relief camp.        
	There is a possibility that the negative forces would exploit the situation, Zardari said. Like they would take the babies who have been made orphans and take them to their camps and train them as the terrorists of tomorrow.        
	Zardaris government has been criticised for failing to respond quickly enough, and Islamist charities  at least one of which has alleged links to terrorism  have been active in the flood-hit areas.        
	There also are concerns the scale of the suffering could stoke unrest and political instability that may distract Pakistan from the fight against the Taliban. Already, the military has had to divert thousands of soldiers from battling the militancy to rescuing flood victims.        
	Jolie gives $100,000        
	Actress Angelina Jolie, who had appealed for donations to the flood relief effort, is leading by example and has donated $100,000 to the cause. The actress called on her fans to help raise funds for the people affected by the floods.

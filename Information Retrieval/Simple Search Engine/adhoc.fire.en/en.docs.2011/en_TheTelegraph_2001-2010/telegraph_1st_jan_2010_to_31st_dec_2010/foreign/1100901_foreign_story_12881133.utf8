The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Google offers respite from inbox overload

          NICK BILTON                          Huge relief                                  
	Aug. 31: If you hate your inbox, if the very thought of it makes you fretful and nauseous, youre not alone. Plenty of people who use email on a daily basis feel the same.        
	Now Google is trying to come to the rescue with a new Gmail feature announced today called Priority Inbox, which monitors your messages and tries to organise your inbox based on a number of criteria, like how often you correspond with a particular sender.        
	Google explains that the first thing Priority Inbox does is split your inbox into three sections: important and unread, starred and everything else. Important messages are judged to be the most significant, and sit at the top of your Gmail window. Next is the starred area, the messages you say are important. Finally, everything else includes those messages that can be dealt with later, or completely ignored  the ones that arent quite spam, but dont need to clutter up your screen or your brain right now.         
	Keith Coleman, Googles product management director, said in an interview that Google has been working to solve the email overload problem for the better part of a decade.        
	Features like Priority Inbox were in the prerelease version of Gmail but were not ready for the public, Coleman said.         
	Surprisingly, Coleman said that one of the tools put to use in the new inbox organisation is taken from the programming and algorithms used to categorise mail as spam.         
	He said Gmail looks for terms and people that you categorise as important, or not, and decides whether those messages make it into your priority inbox accordingly.

	Islamabad, April 19: Pakistans President Asif Ali Zardari today signed a landmark constitutional reforms package, restoring the countrys 1973 Constitution and reversing all the changes made by two former military dictators  Gen. Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq and former President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Zardari signed the bill at a ceremony in the Aiwan-e-Sadr, the official residence of the President of Pakistan. The ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, members of his cabinet and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.         
	The National Assembly and the Senate, the Upper and Lower Houses of parliament, have already passed the reforms package, known as the 18th amendment bill.        
	The package strips Zardari of key powers to dissolve parliament and sack the Prime Minister.         
	It also removes the name of Gen. Zia from the Constitution, which was drafted by former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto with the support of all parties in 1973. Zia removed Bhuttos elected government in July 1977 and executed the former Prime Minister over false and politically motivated charges in April 1979.        
	It is my hope that the doors of dictatorship have been closed forever.... Let no one think of subverting the Constitution, Zardari said in his address.         
	The President said he was delighted that the 17th amendment, introduced by Musharraf to prolong his rule, had been repealed. Gone are the days when state institutions upheld the subversion of the Constitution. Todays lesson is that our parliament is capable of delivering. It is also a lesson of today that we can achieve so much through reconciliation and by setting aside our personal egos, Zardari said.        
	The 102 clauses of the 18th Constitutional Amendment Bill include provisions to charge anyone who suspends or keeps the Constitution in abeyance with high treason.         
	The bill also re-names the insurgency-hit North West Frontier Province (NWFP) as Khyber Pakhtoonkhawa and deprives the President of his powers to appoint arned forces chiefs without consulting the Prime Minister.        
	Zardari made no mention of the fact that the bill would strip him of his sweeping powers, though Gilani praised him for surrendering his powers.

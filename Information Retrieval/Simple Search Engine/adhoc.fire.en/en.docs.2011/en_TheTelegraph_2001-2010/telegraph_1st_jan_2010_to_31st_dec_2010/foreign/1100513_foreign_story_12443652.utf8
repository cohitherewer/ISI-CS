	Hanzhong (China), May 12 (Reuters): Seven children and the owners of a kindergarten were hacked to death in northwest China today.        
	Eleven children were wounded in the attack soon after the school day started in Nanzheng county, a rural corner of Shaanxi province, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Two children were in serious condition.        
	A 48-year-old man, Wu Huanming, used a kitchen cleaver to kill five boys and two girls as well as the mother and son team who owned and ran the private kindergarten, Xinhua said.        
	Wu then returned home and committed suicide, Xinhua said, citing a statement from the emergency office. One local man, Zheng Xiulan, said the attacker had rented out the rooms for the privately run kindergarten, located in a row of low houses.

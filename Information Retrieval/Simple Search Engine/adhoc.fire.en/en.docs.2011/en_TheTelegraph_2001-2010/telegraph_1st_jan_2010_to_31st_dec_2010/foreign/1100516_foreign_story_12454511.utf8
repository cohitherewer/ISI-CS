The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Google owns up to privacy blunder
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Google owns up to privacy blunder
          BRAD STONE                                    
	San Francisco, May 15: Google said yesterday that for more than three years it had inadvertently collected snippets of private information that people send over unencrypted wireless networks.        
	The admission, made in an official blog post by Alan Eustace, Googles engineering chief, comes a month after regulators in Europe started asking the search giant questions about Street View, the layer of real-world photographs accessible from Google Maps.        
	Regulators wanted to know what data Google collected as its camera-laden cars methodically trolled through neighbourhoods, and what Google did with that data. Googles Street View misstep adds to the widespread anxiety about privacy in the digital age and the apparent willingness of Silicon Valley engineers to collect peoples private data without permission.        
	Facebook is currently engaged in a heated debate with its 400 million members about its shifting privacy guidelines.        
	Google appears to have acted quickly after questions were raised by the European regulators. Two weeks ago, Google tried to address their questions and criticism in a blog post. It said it did collect certain kinds of data around the world that identify Wi-Fi networks to help improve its mapping products.         
	The information on wireless networks can be used for location-based advertising services for mobile phones, which can sometime be pinpointed via a wireless network even if they lack a GPS chip.        
	But the company explicitly said then that it did not collect or store so-called payload data.        
	In a confession made yesterday afternoon that is sure to raise new questions about its privacy policies, Google said that its previous claims were wrong. Eustace wrote that a review of the Street View software has revealed that because of a programming error in 2006, the company had indeed been mistakenly collecting snippets of data that happened to be transmitted over non-password protected Wi-Fi networks.

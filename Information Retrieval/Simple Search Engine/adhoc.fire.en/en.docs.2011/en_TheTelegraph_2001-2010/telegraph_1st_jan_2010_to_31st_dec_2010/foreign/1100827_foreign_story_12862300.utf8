	Loud U2 fined     
	 London, Aug. 26 (PTI): Irish band U2 has been fined $22,000 for playing too loud and too long during the rehearsals for their 360 tour in Spain.       
	The band angered the authorities by breaching rehearsal rules while they were preparing for the tour in the Catalan capital in June 2009.      
	A spokeswoman said the group had been penalised for rehearsing until midnight, that was two hours over the scheduled time and at sound levels above those set by authorities prior to the concerts.

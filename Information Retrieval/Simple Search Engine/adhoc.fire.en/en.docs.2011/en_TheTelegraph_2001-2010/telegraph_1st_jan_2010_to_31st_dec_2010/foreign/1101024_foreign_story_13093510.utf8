The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gibson dropped from film
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Gibson dropped from film
          DAVID HARRISON                          NOT POPULAR                                  
	Oct. 23: Mel Gibson has been dropped from a $500 million blockbuster film following protests from some of the cast and crew.        
	 Todd Phillips, the director of The Hangover 2, revealed earlier this week that he had asked Gibson to take a cameo role as a tattoo artist in the movie. But he has now been forced to drop the actor after objections from other actors in the film. Gibsons comic role in The Hangover 2 had been seen as a chance to restore his battered reputation following damaging revelations about his private life.        
	I thought Mel would have been great in the movie, said Phillips, claiming his decision to cast Gibson was endorsed by Jeff Robinov, the president of Warner Bros.        
	But I realise film-making is a collaborative effort, and this decision ultimately did not have the full support of my entire cast and crew.        
	During the making of the original The Hangover, the cast were relatively unknown. The actors Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis, were happy to share the screen with Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist. But its success at the box office appears to have altered their attitude towards potential co-stars.        
	They reportedly objected to Gibsons appearance following revelations about his private life.        
	In 2006 the 54-year-old actor-director was arrested for drink-driving in Los Angeles.         
	He addressed a female police officer as sugar tits, and informed her colleagues that the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.        
	Gibson later apologised for his despicable remarks, blaming the incident on his alcoholism.        
	After a five-year break from acting, he returned to the screen this year in Edge of Darkness. But his comeback was curtailed when audio recordings of phone calls to his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva were leaked to the Internet. The tapes, in which Gibson is heard using racist terminology and calling Grigorieva a whore, were accompanied by allegations of domestic abuse against Grigorieva.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

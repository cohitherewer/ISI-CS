	Sandra scared    
	 Los Angeles, Feb. 16 (PTI): Actress Sandra Bullock is over the moon after being nominated for an Oscar this year but she is also scared because her role in The Blind Side has set the bar pretty high for her movie roles in the future.       
	It scares me more than anything, because you think, What do I do now? What do I do now that I dont step backwards  I step forward. Ive been thinking a lot about that  what do I do next? Bullock told reporters during the Academy Awards nominees luncheon in Beverly Hills.       
	I feel like because of this honour and what Ive been given these last couple of months, I really have an obligation not to step back even the smallest bit, she added.       
	Bullock has already bagged the Golden Globe and SAG Award for her role as the hard-nosed Leigh Anne Tuohy in the movie.

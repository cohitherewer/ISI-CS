                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Militants raid Afghan talks
                            
	Kabul, June 2 (Reuters): Taliban suicide bombers attacked a huge gathering of Afghan leaders and notables today as President Hamid Karzai launched an ambitious peace plan he hopes will persuade the insurgents to lay down their arms.        
	Officials said three rockets fell short of a vast tent where the traditional jirga, or gathering, was being held. Afghan police clashed with three gunmen who breached a massive security cordon by disguising themselves with the all-enveloping burqa worn by many women in Afghanistan.        
	The situation is under control, Farooq Wardak, the chief organiser said.

	Dhaka, Dec. 19 (PTI): A pornographic video was aired on a large screen at Bangladeshs main airport on Friday, prompting the countrys civil aviation authority to launch a probe.         
	The Bangladesh Civil Aviation Authority has launched an investigation into the incident at Dhakas Hazrat Shahjalal Airport where the pornographic movie was shown on Friday morning for five minutes, officials said today.         
	An investigation is underway while the people responsible for the scandal have been already taken to task, a civil aviation authority spokesperson said without giving more details.         
	An investigation was also ordered to find out if any criminal intent was involved.         
	But another official said the operator of the large screen was quickly handed down a jail term of two months after a summary trial by an on-duty magistrate at the airport.         
	The operator has been jailed instantly for two months, magistrate Siddiqa Akhter said.        
	We have also summoned the owners of the cable firm to investigate the incident, he added.        
	His comments came after newspapers carried a report that a large screen at the airport suddenly started airing a pornographic film, leaving several hundred passengers shocked and embarrassed.         
	The film was shown on the large screen at the main passenger lounge on Friday morning.        
	Civil aviation officials said the display screen is supposed to show recorded documentaries about the culture and geography of Bangladesh, a predominantly Muslim nation, where discussing sex openly remains a taboo.        
	Every day, thousands of people throng the terminal to receive or send off their relatives.        
	The airport is used by around 5 million passengers annually and is the primary air travel gateway to Bangladesh.

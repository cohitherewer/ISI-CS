The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Karzai admits his office gets Iran cash
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Karzai admits his office gets Iran cash
          ALISSA J. RUBIN                          Karzai at a news conference in Kabul on Monday. (AFP)                                  
	Kabul, Oct. 25: President Hamid Karzai acknowledged today that his chief of staff had taken money from the Iranian government, confirming a report in The New York Times. He said the cash was used to pay for presidential expenses.        
	His government will continue to receive the payments, which amount to no more than about $1 million twice a year, he said at a news conference with the visiting President of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, adding that the money is part of a relationship between neighbours.        
	They have asked for good relations in return, and for lots of other things in return, Karzai said of the Iranians.        
	And we have also asked for lots of things in return in this relationship. This is a relationship between neighbours, and it will go on and we will continue to ask for cash help from Iran.        
	This is transparent, Karzai said, maintaining that the US had long been well aware of the Iranian money. This is something that Ive even discussed while I was at Camp David with President Bush.         
	He said that the US had also given him cash. They do give us bags of money, he said. Yes, yes, they do. Its all the same. So lets not make this an issue.        
	 He added that several nations have given money to his office  the first being the United Arab Emirates, which provided $1.5 million nine years ago when Afghanistans interim government was formed.        
	The article in The Times said that Umar Daudzai, the Presidents chief of staff, received between $1 million and $2 million every other month from Iran and that the money, effectively a slush fund, was distributed to Afghan lawmakers, tribal elders and even Taliban commanders to secure their loyalty.        
	Karzai said that the Iranian money was used to pay expenses in his office and that he had instructed Daudzai to accept it. The money is given to help the presidential office and to help dispense assistance in various ways to the employees here and to people outside, he said.        
	Karzai denounced The Times and called on the Afghan news media to defame The New York Times just as they have defamed us.        
	He said that The Times published the article in an effort to tarnish Daudzai because he had taken a strong stand on terminating the use of private security companies. The security companies have become an explosive issue in the last few days because western countries and private contractors say they will have to halt projects in Afghanistan if they are not able to protect their employees.        
	While the US government has backed Karzais proposal to phase them out, it says that until the Afghan Army and police are better trained and well established, especially in insecure areas of the country, they cannot be relied on to protect western and Afghan employees. Yesterday, Karzai requested a list of national aid projects that needed protection by private security guards.        
	The Iranian embassy in Afghanistan dismissed the allegations that Tehran was making cash payments to Daudzai, calling them ridiculous and insulting. The statement was issued earlier today, before Karzais comments.        
	In Washington, Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said he was not surprised that Karzais office was receiving money from Iran, which he said was playing a destabilising role in Afghanistan.        
	I think Iran in Afghanistan  much as it has been in Iraq  has been walking both sides of the street for years, Morrell told MSNBC. On one hand, as this report indicates, clearly trying to curry favour with the government while at the same time on the other hand, training, arming, financing, directing anti-government forces.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Automatic sari for Julia
                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 25 (PTI): When Pretty Woman Julia Roberts had to wear a sari in Eat Pray Love, she was scared of tripping on the garment.        
	Roberts, 42, who converted to Hinduism while shooting the film in India, instead wore an automatic sari which was specially made for her by costume designer Michael Dennison.         
	The actress wore a teal, zari-laced silk sari in the wedding sequence of the film. It was a one-set piece that had snaps and closures on it. Almost like a skirt and I could wrap it around me and snap it. It was beautiful, said Roberts.

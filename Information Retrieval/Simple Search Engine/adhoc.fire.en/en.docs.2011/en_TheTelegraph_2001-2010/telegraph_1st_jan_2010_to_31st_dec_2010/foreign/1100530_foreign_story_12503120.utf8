          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi , May 29: Nepals Maoists might be back in the race for power after last nights hard-fought bargain in Kathmandu which extended the life of the Constituent Assembly (CA) by a year but also called on Prime Minister Madhav Nepal to make way for a new government of national consensus as soon as possible.         
	Nepal has been pulled back from the brink of a constitutional vacuum --- the two-year term of the CA ended last night --- but it is widely feared that a new phase of political uncertainty has been inaugurated in which the main contenders for power --- the Maoists, the Nepali Congress and the United Marxist-Leninist Party of Madhav Nepal --- will begin intense jockeying.         
	A new government will have to take over soon, said an observer, but nobody has a clue to who it could be. The confusion is such, it even encourages the outgoing Madhav Nepal to believe he will retain premiership as a consensus choice.         
	The Maoists had made Nepals resignation a pre-condition to extending the life of the CA in backdoor negotiations leading up to last nights emergency CA session. Their hope is that they will return at the head of the new government of consensus because they remain the largest party in the CA.         
	But that may be easier said than done. Maoist boss Prachanda, who has set his eyes on the premiership, faces stiff opposition from elements in the Nepali Congress and the UML. Baburam Bhattarai, the Maoist ideologue, is a more acceptable face, but Prachanda is opposed to Bhattarais candidacy. Besides, as one senior Nepali Congress leader said, the Maoists claim for leadership of the consensus government was made weaker by continuing lack of clarity over the key issue of rehabilitation of their military cadres.         
	The Nepali Congress has its own set of contenders in acting president Sushil Koirala, former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, and veteran Ramchandra Poudel. Each one is said to be lobbying for support with other parties in the CA. At one level we have overcome a crisis, said the editor of a leading Kathmandu daily, But at another, we have reopened the gates of more political chaos with each party, and several individual contenders, competing for the top job. The political class has earned a years fresh lease, but it is unlikely it will be able to use that time to write a new constitution, which was the main job of the CA.

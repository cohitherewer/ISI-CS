The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Strikes hit Paris, London travel
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Strikes hit Paris, London travel

	Paris, Sept. 7: France was gripped today by a major strike and protests against President Nicolas Sarkozys plan to raise the retirement age to 62 from 60.        
	Also, a subway strike in London led the government to make available additional boats and buses and to encourage commuters to cycle to work. Subway, suburban rail and bus traffic in Paris was sharply curtailed, though LCI television reported that subway disruptions were not as bad as expected. With many teachers striking across the country, parents of small children had no choice but to stay home.        
	The RER B rail link to Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports was effectively halted. And because some air traffic controllers were on strike, the French civil aviation authority limited the number of flights landing and taking off. Air France-KLM said it expected to maintain all its long-haul flights and 90 per cent of short- and medium-haul flights from Charles de Gaulle, and 50 per cent of its and medium-haul flights from Orly.        
	The SNCF rail network said travellers could expect 40 per cent of TGV fast trains to run, and 80 per cent of Thalys trains to Belgium and the Netherlands would not be affected, new agencies reported. Eurostar trains to Britain are expected to run normally. In London, two unions began a 24-hour job action during the evening rush yesterday. Workers there oppose a plan by the Underground operator, transport for London, to lay off 800 employees.        
	Sarkozy, who has been weakened in the polls by a scandal involving his labour minister, ric Woerth, has vowed to push through an overhaul of the national pension plan. The government argues that people must work longer if the system is to remain solvent.         
	But many French people fear that a move to raise the minimum retirement age will be but the first step in a series of moves to whittle away at their cherished entitlements.        
	Union leaders were hoping for a turnout of two million demonstrators. Bernard Thibault, secretary general of the CGT labour union, told Europe 1 radio that the mobilisation of demonstrators today would be the largest in several years.        
	On Sunday, Claude Guant, Sarkozys chief of staff, said some compromises were possible, but that ultimately reform was necessary and the overhaul would go through largely as planned. France has hung on to a top AAA credit rating throughout the financial crisis, but some economists warn that the pressure of an ageing population will make that difficult to maintain without reform.

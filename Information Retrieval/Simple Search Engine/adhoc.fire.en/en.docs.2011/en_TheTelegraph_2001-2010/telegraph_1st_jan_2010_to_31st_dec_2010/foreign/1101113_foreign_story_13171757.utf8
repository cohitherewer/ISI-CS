	Dog traps lion    
	 Colman (South Dakota), Nov. 12 (AP): A 68-kg mountain lion was no match for a squirrel-chasing terrier.      
	Jack the Jack Russell weighs only 8kg, and yet he managed to trap the cougar up a tree on Tuesday on a farm in the north-central state of South Dakota.      
	 Jacks owner, Chad Strenge, told The Argus Leader that the dog trees cats all the time, and that the plucky terrier probably figured it was just a cat.      
	Prof. Jonathan Jenks, who tracks cougar migration patterns, says hunters usually need two or three hounds to chase a lion up a tree. He says the cat probably wasnt hungry enough to attack Jack.

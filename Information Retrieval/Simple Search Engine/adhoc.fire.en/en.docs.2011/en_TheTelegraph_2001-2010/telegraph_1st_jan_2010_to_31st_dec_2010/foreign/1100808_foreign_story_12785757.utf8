The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | HP boss sacked for fudging expenses
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      HP boss sacked for fudging expenses
          ASHLEY VANCE                          Mark V. Hurd                                  
	New York, Aug. 7: Mark V. Hurd, who turned Hewlett- Packard into the worlds largest technology company on the back of fierce fiscal discipline, has been ousted from his post for the lowliest of corporate offences  fudging his expenses.        
	HPs board stunned Silicon Valley and Wall Street yesterday by announcing Hurds resignation as chairman and chief executive of the computing and printing giant, involving what it said was a close personal relationship with a contractor who helped with the companys marketing.        
	The womans lawyer had contacted the company in late June, charging sexual harassment. While the directors were investigating that charge, they found inaccurate expense reports that covered payments made to the woman. The directors said, however, that the sexual harassment charge was unsubstantiated.        
	The board charged that Hurd, 53, had failed to disclose his use of company funds. It urged Hurd to resign, but he baulked and offered to compensate the company for the disputed funds, said to range from $1,000 to $20,000, according to a person close to Hurd who was briefed on the situation but was not authorised to speak publicly.        
	The board, however, insisted. This was a necessary decision, said Marc L. Andreessen, a venture capitalist and a director.        
	Hurds actions showed a profound lack of judgment, said Michael Holston, executive vice-president and general counsel whom Hurd had brought into the company in 2006 after he investigated a boardroom scandal involving the company spying on board members, employees and journalists. That investigation ended with the resignation of the companys chairman and the elevation of Hurd.        
	Holston also said Hurd had used inaccurate expense reports to conceal the relationship with the woman. Hurd, who is married, has denied having a sexual relationship with the woman, according to the person briefed on the situation. Hurd declined comment.        
	Gloria Allred, the celebrity lawyer who has agreed to represent the woman, said: We want to make clear that there was no affair and no intimate sexual relationship between our client and Mr Hurd.        
	She declined to make the woman available for an interview or to identify her.        
	The companys stock plummeted almost 10 per cent yesterday on the news of Hurd, known for his straight-talking and analytical approach to business. Hurd rewired HP through layoffs, acquisitions and relentless cost-cutting measures.        
	The woman had worked for HP between the autumn of 2007 and the autumn of 2009, having been hired by the office of the chief executive, the company said. Sources close to the company and familiar with the situation said that over a number of months, the contractor attended events for HP in Asia, Europe and the US, and often dined alone with Hurd after the events.        
	The contractors fees ranged from $1,000 to $5,000 for events in the US and up to $10,000 for overseas ventures.         
	Even though the same contractor was present, Hurd said he had dined alone or with a different person on his expense reports, these people said.        
	A person briefed on this situation said Hurd had described the situation as surreal and bizarre.        
	Hurd has denied any romantic context in the relationship with the contractor and talked about the board being swayed by the potential public relations problems that would follow accusations of sexual harassment.        
	Hurd, who was in the midst of contract negotiations with the board, did not file his own expenses, this person said. HPs board and Hurd had, over the past month, been negotiating a new contract that would have had him earning $100 million over the next three years, according to a person briefed on the meetings.        
	The news of his resignation stunned many in Silicon Valley. I am shocked and surprised, said Jonathan I. Schwartz, former chief executive of Sun Microsystems, a long-time rival to HP. That is not the Mark Hurd I worked with.        
	Hurd had taken over a bumbling HP in early 2005 and turned it into one of the most consistent performers in the technology industry. In that time, the price of the companys stock doubled. Under Hurd, HP surged past IBM as the largest technology power with its sales increasing to $115 billion a year from $80 billion. Hurd made several major acquisitions to strengthen the company, including Electronic Data Systems and Palm.

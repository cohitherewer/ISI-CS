	Material Madonna    
	 Los Angeles, Aug. 21 (Reuters): Madonna has been hit with a lawsuit over her new Material Girl fashion line for teenagers by a California clothing company that says it has been using the name since 1997.      
	LA Triumph filed a lawsuit against the pop superstar in a California court on Thursday, just two weeks after the Madonna line went on sale in US department store chain Macys.      
	The company said in its suit that it has been continually selling similar clothes in similar retail outlets at similar price points under their Material Girl brand since at least 1997, and Madonna and her newfound company do not have the right to trade in the same space under this brand.

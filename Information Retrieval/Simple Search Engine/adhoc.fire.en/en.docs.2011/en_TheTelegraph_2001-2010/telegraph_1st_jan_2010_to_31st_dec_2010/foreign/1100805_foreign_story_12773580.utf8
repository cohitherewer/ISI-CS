          JULIE BOSMAN                          UP FOR GRABS: A window sign on a Barnes amp; Noble store in Florida. (AFP)                                  
	New York, Aug. 4: Mega-chain Barnes amp; Noble has announced that its board was putting the company up for sale in what might be the latest sign of trouble for brick-and-mortar bookstores.        
	The news surprised analysts and alarmed publishers, who have watched as the book business has increasingly shifted to online retailers and e-book sales, leaving both chains and independent sellers struggling.        
	Barnes amp; Noble, Americas largest book chain with 720 stores, said that its board believed the stock was significantly undervalued and that it had set up a special committee to review its options.        
	Barnes amp; Noble has an iconic brand and unique competitive advantages we believe will position the company to succeed over time in a rapidly changing market, the board said in a statement. The board has enlisted Lazard as its financial adviser and Morris, Nichols, Arsht amp; Tunnell as its legal adviser.        
	One possible bidder could be Leonard Riggio, the companys founder, working with private equity, according to a person briefed on the matter. Riggio, 69, is the largest stockholder in Barnes amp; Noble, owning nearly 30 per cent of the company.        
	Regardless of whether I participate in an investment group that buys the company, I, as well as the entire senior management team, am willing and eager to remain with the company and see it through the challenging years ahead, Riggio said in a statement.        
	Riggio has been under pressure recently from the billionaire investor Ronald W. Burkle, who last year increased his ownership stake in the company to about 18 per cent.         
	Burkle has argued for changes in Barnes amp; Nobles corporate governance and has said that his Yucaipa Companies should be allowed to buy up to 30 per cent of Barnes amp; Noble stock, though Burkle testified in court last month that he did not want to buy the company.        
	For years, Barnes amp; Noble has been battered by large shifts in the publishing industry and the retail environment. Book sales have moved towards big-box stores like Costco, Wal-Mart and Target, and away from mall-based stores like B. Dalton, which Barnes amp; Noble acquired in the late 1980s.        
	Theres been a long series of pressures, said David Schick, managing director at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. The market has not been kind to bookstores, and its for new reasons like competition with Apple and Amazon, and its for old reasons, like what we believe has been a decline in reading for the last 20 years.

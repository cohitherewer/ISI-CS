	New York, Jan. 16: They feel her pain.         
	At the Spence School and Greenwich High and Fullerton Union High and Nyack High and Narragansett High, teenagers and near-teenagers, hundreds of them, are waving a virtual flag for Tess Chapin, a 15-year-old from Sunnyside, Queens, who has been grounded for five weeks.         
	A few days after founding the Facebook group  1000 to get tess ungrounded  Tess had nearly reached her stated goal, with 806 members by yesterday morning. After this article about her quest was posted on nytimes.com, she surpassed it.        
	This is teenage rebellion, electronic style  peaceful, organised and, apparently, contagious.         
	So basically, Tess explains on her group page, she made an honest late-night mistake. Her parents flipped, and they grounded her for five weeks  thats my childhood right there, she wrote. please join so I can convice them to unground me. please please please. On Monday, the official start of what Tess calls her groundation, she circulated a petition during sixth period and after school at Millennium High School in Lower Manhattan, where she is a sophomore. At a friends suggestion, once she got home, Tess put the petition online by starting the Facebook group, which she categorised under Organisations: Advocacy. The group promptly took off, proving that no adolescent experience, in the age of social networking, is too small to start a movement.        
	Tess was grounded for what all parties confirmed was a first offence of drinking at a party and missing her 11.30 curfew by an hour. Why five weeks? Her dad wanted to give her three months, said her mother, Jennifer Iselin Chapin, a fund-raiser for the Natural Resources Defence Council, an environmental group.         
	I wanted a month. This was a compromise. For the duration, there will be no parties for Tess, no sleepovers, no Sweet 16s, no hanging out at a friends, and certainly no hanging out at a party where there is no parent present and possibly alcohol served.         
	Tess originally invited around 1,000 people to join her group, and by Tuesday, 500 of them or their friends had signed up. By yesterday morning, the number had surpassed 800, and Tess said that she recognised only about 35 per cent of the names. Have never met u but I pledge to make a statement so I hope this works, wrote a young New Yorker named Ethan Bloom, in a typical sentiment of support displayed on the Facebook groups wall, a public space for messages.        
	There are, of course, dissenters. A range of parenting philosophies have emerged on the wall, turning it into a mini-forum on child rearing, 2010. If your parents didnt care, pointed out a sophomore at Ithaca College, they would have just let you rot. Someone agreed with Tess that parents can be stupid. A friend of a friend expressed hope that she and her parents would take something grand away from the experience.

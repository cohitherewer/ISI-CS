	Moscow, March 31: Two bomb attacks aimed at the police killed at least 12 people in the volatile North Caucasus region of Russia today, according to the Russian prosecutors office.        
	It further heightens security concerns two days after deadly suicide bombings struck the Moscow subway.        
	Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said he did not rule out that todays attacks in Dagestan, near the border with Chechnya, could have been organised by the same group behind the Moscow subway bombings. Dmitri A. Medvedev, Russias President, called the two sets of attacks links of the same chain.        
	All this is the manifestation of the same terrorist activity which has recently started to resurface in the Caucasus, Medvedev said. Neither leader offered any evidence of a connection between the attacks in Moscow and Dagestan.        
	Law enforcement agencies throughout Russia have been on heightened alert since Monday, when two women set off explosions in the Moscow subway during the morning rush, killing 39 people in attacks that that shattered a sense that Muscovites were isolated from the continued terrorist violence in Russias south.        
	Although no one has claimed responsibility for any of the attacks, the North Caucasus region has been marked for particular scrutiny.        
	Russian officials have said the two suicide bombers on Monday likely came from Chechnya or a neighbouring region in the North Caucasus.        
	Today, the first of the bombs exploded in a parked car, killing two police officers who had pulled up beside it in their vehicle, according to a statement on the website of the prosecutors investigative wing.        
	As rescue workers and police officials gathered at the scene, a man wearing a police uniform walked up and set off his explosives, killing several more people, including the police chief of Kizlyar, the town where the attacks occurred.         
	Channel 1 television showed what appeared to be a mobile phone video of police and firefighters wandering amid the wreckage of the first explosion when the second blast occurred, sending up a fireball and plume of smoke.        
	Such attacks, which are not uncommon in the region, are typically aimed at police and government officials, though civilians are often injured and killed.

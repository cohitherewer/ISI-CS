          MATT RICHTEL                          Beauty of language lost                                  
	San Francisco, Dec. 21: Signs youre an old fogey: You still watch movies on a VCR, listen to vinyl records and shoot photos on film.        
	And you enjoy using email.        
	Young people, of course, much prefer online chats and text messages. These have been on the rise for years but are now threatening to eclipse email, much as they have already superseded phone calls.        
	Major Internet companies like Facebook are responding with message services that are focused on immediate gratification.        
	The problem with email, young people say, is that it involves a boringly long process of signing into an account, typing out a subject line and then sending a message that might not be received or answered for hours. And sign-offs like sincerely  seriously? Lena Jenny, 17, a high school senior in Cupertino, California, said texting was so quick that I sometimes have an answer before I even shut my phone. Email, she added, is so lame.        
	Facebook is trying to appeal to the Lenas of the world. It is rolling out a revamped messaging service that is intended to feel less like email and more like texting.        
	The company decided to eliminate the subject line on messages after its research showed that it was most commonly left blank or used for an uninformative hi or yo.        
	Facebook also killed the cc and bcc lines. And hitting the enter key can immediately fire off the message,  la instant messaging, instead of creating a new paragraph. The changes, company executives say, leave behind time-consuming formalities that separate users from what they crave: instant conversation.        
	The future of messaging is more real time, more conversational and more casual, said Andrew Bosworth, director of engineering at Facebook, where he oversees communications tools.         
	The medium isnt the message. The message is the message.        
	The numbers testify to the trend. The number of total unique visitors in the US to major email sites like Yahoo and Hotmail is now in steady decline, according to the research company comScore.         
	Such visits peaked in November 2009 and have since slid 6 per cent; visits among 12- to 17-year-olds fell around 18 per cent.        
	The slide in email does not reflect a drop in digital communication; people have just gravitated to instant messaging, texting and Facebook (four billion messages daily).        
	James E. Katz, the director for the Center for Mobile Communications Studies at Rutgers University, said this was not the death of email but more of a downgrade, thanks to greater choice and nuance among communications tools.        
	Its painful for them, he said of the younger generation and email. It doesnt suit their social intensity.        
	Some, predictably, turn up their noses at the informality and the abbreviated spellings that are rampant in bite-size, phone-based transmissions.         
	Judith Kallos, who writes a blog and books about email etiquette, complains that the looser, briefer and less grammatical the writing, the less deep the thoughts and emotions behind it.        
	Were going down a road where were losing our skills to communicate with the written word, Kallos said.        
	Mary Bird, 65, of San Leandro, California, is another traditionalist, if a reluctant one. I dont want to be one of those elders who castigate young peoples form of communication, she said.         
	But the art of language, the beauty of language, is being lost.        
	Birds daughter, Katie Bird Hunter, 26, is on the other side of the digital communications divide and finds her parents to be out of touch. They still use AOL, she says, implying with her tone that she finds this totally gross. Hunter says she seeks to reach friends first by text, then by instant message, then with a phone call, and then by email. And then, while Id probably never do this last one, showing up at their house.        
	Like a lot of younger people, Hunter, who works in construction management in San Francisco, says email has its place  namely work and other serious business, like online shopping. She and others say they still regularly check email, in part because parents, teachers and bosses use it.

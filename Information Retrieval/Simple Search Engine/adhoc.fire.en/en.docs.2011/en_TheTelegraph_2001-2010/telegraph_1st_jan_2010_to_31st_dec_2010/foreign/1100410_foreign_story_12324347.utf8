                              Rajapaksa with a supporter in Hambantota, Lanka. (AP)                            
	Colombo, April 9 (AP): President Mahinda Rajapaksas ruling coalition has won Sri Lankas first post-war parliamentary elections further consolidating his political dominance after the battlefield defeat of the Tamil Tigers last year.        
	Todays victory follows Rajapaksas re-election in the presidential polls three months ago. Despite Opposition allegations the President wants to monopolise power, he is a hero to many of the countrys Sinhalese majority hoping for a new era of development and reconciliation.        
	The election department said Rajapaksas United Peoples Freedom Alliance so far has won 117 of the 225 seats contested in yesterdays polls. Its tally was expected to rise.        
	A party must win 113 seats to get a simple majority and form a government.        
	Rajapaksa called the results a triumph of democrac. It is a clear restatement of the confidence the people placed in me, he said.        
	It remains unclear whether Rajapaksas coalition can secure the two-thirds majority needed to change the Constitution  which could open the way for an amendment to allow the President to serve beyond the end of his second term in 2017.        
	The closest rival, the United National Front, has so far won 46 seats.        
	Its a personal victory for the President, Jehan Perera of National Peace Council activist group said of the election result. Its a very big majority ... What it means is that the voters have given the government a blank cheque.        
	Another Opposition party led by defeated presidential candidate and former army chief Sarath Fonseka  who is currently under detention awaiting court-martial  has won five seats. A party official said Fonseka won one of the seats.        
	A party of the ethnic Tamil minority received 12 seats from its stronghold in the northeast, the department said. So far, results for only 180 seats have been declared.         
	The department suspended releasing results for 16 seats after it annulled votes from 38 voting stations in two districts and called for a revote. A date for the revote is yet to be announced.        
	 Another 29 seats are allocated according to the percentage of the vote each party gets.        
	Rajapaksas coalition held 128 seats in the outgoing 225-member parliament. United National Front official Tissa Attanayake cried foul over the elections but acknowledged his party had suffered a setback.

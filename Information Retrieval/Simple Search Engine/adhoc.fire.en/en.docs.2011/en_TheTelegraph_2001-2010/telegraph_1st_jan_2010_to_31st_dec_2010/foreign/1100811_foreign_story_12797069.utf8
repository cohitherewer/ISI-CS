The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Facebook close to saturation point in UK
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Facebook close to saturation point in UK
          EMMA BARNETT                          Dip in growth                                  
	London, Aug. 10: Facebooks growth in the UK has waned over the last six months, suggesting that the social network is nearing saturation point, according to new statistics.        
	Despite signing up its 500 millionth member last month, the average amount of time spent on Facebook by a Briton has decreased from 30 minutes in December 2009, to 27.36 minutes during June and July 2010.        
	The figures, collated by Web-analytics firm Hitwise, show that Facebook is still the second most visited site in the UK, after Google, and that it accounts for one in every six Web pages accessed in Britain. However, Robin Goad, Hitwises research director, believes that the figures show that Facebook is nearing saturation point in the UK.        
	Facebooks market share of UK page views has trebled over the last five years, but growth has slowed significantly over the last six months. Last month there was a slight decline in share, but this may well be down to seasonality  the August to September back-to-school/college/university period is significant for Facebook, he explained.        
	Goad added: Facebook has a very high average session time  almost half an hour  but this has also stabilised over the last six months after increasing rapidly during the sites ascendancy. More than 25 million Britons, or one in three of the entire population, now have Facebook accounts.

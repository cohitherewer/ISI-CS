                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Beckham ambushed by blonde
                            
	Rome, Jan. 21: David Beckham has become the latest victim of Italys best known satirical television show after a female reporter ambushed him in Milan and tweaked his groin.        
	The former England captain was giving an interview outside a hotel when Elena Di Cioccio bent down and squeezed him between the legs.        
	The stunt was a test to see whether the football star measured up to his photo in Armani billboards, in which he shows off his impressive physique in a pair of tight-fitting underpants. Beckham looked shocked and immediately backed away after being touched by the blonde-haired TV reporter, a star of the satirical show Le Iene (The Hyenas).                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

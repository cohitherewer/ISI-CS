The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama breaks protocol
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama breaks protocol
                              NO PRESS PLEASE                            
	Washington, April 10 (AP): President Barack Obama quietly breached years of protocol this morning by leaving the White House without the press corps.        
	About an hour before reporters were supposed to be in position to leave with the President, Obama left the grounds of the White House. Members of the press were told he was attending one of his daughters soccer games in northwest Washington, DC.        
	The White House press corps traditionally travels with the President anywhere he goes, inside or outside the country, to report on the Presidents activities for the benefit of informing the public and for historical record.        
	After Obama left, an aide hastily gathered members of the press who happened to be at the White House early.

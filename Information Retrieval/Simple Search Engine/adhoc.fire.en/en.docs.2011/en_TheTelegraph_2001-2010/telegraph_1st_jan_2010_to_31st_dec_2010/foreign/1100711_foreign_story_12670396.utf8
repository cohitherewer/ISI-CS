The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Veil ban: Europe for, US against
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Veil ban: Europe for, US against
                            
	Paris, July 10 (AP): Most Americans oppose banning face-covering Islamic veils, but most western Europeans questioned in a new global poll say the garments should be forbidden  especially in France, where a ban may soon be a reality.        
	Several European countries have been considering bans on such veils, with special attention on France, home to western Europes largest Muslim community and a strongly secular government.        
	The lower house of Frances Parliament is expected to approve a divisive bill on Tuesday that would make it illegal to wear full-face veils in public. The government says such veils oppress women. Only a very small minority of French Muslim women wear veils such as the niqab or burqa, and many French Muslims fear a ban would stigmatise the whole Islamic community.        
	A survey by the Pew Global Attitudes Project found that an overwhelming 82 per cent of French respondents support a ban. The poll found 71 per cent support in Germany, 62 per cent in Britain and 59 per cent in Spain.        
	In the US, 28 percent of those questioned said they would approve a ban.        
	The pollsters questioned more than 4,000 people by telephone in the five countries as part of a larger poll on global attitudes conducted in April and May. The margin of error was plus or minus 4 or 5 percentage points for the countries asked about the veil.         
	In the US and Europe, respondents to the poll who were over 55 were more likely to support a ban than those age 18 to 34.        
	Those on the political right were more likely to support a ban than those on the left, except in Spain.        
	The pollsters said there was no variation along gender lines in any of the five countries and little variation depending on income and education levels.        
	The French governments proposed veil ban is widely expected to become law after Tuesdays lower house vote and a vote in the Senate in September.        
	The government has insisted that the bill is not about religion but has called it a way to promote equality between the sexes, to protect oppressed women or to ensure security in public places.

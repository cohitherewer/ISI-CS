	Boston, Oct. 20 (PTI): After Apple CEO Steve Jobs remarked that his company had sold more iPhones than Research in Motion had sold BlackBerrys, RIM hit back yesterday saying customers were getting tired of being told what to think by Apple, reports The Wall Street Journal.        
	 Steve Jobs, who was on a conference call to discuss Apples quarterly earnings on Monday, said: We have now passed RIM, and I dont see them catching up with us in the foreseeable future.         
	I think it is going to be a challenge for them to convince developers to create apps for yet a third platform after Apple and Androids app store.        
	Jobs said Apple had sold 14.1 million iPhones last quarter compared to RIMs 12.1 million BlackBerrys.         
	RIM co-CEO Jim Balsillie fired back in an email message: We think many customers are getting tired of being told what to think by Apple.         
	Jobs also criticised the seven-inch tablet computer PlayBook manufactured by RIM. This size isnt sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion, Jobs said.         
	To this Balsillie said: For those of us who live outside of Apples distortion field, we know that 7-(inch) tablets will actually be a big portion of the market and we know that Adobe Flash support actually matters to customers who want a real Web experience, he said.        
	We also know that while Apples attempt to control the ecosystem and maintain a closed platform may be good for Apple, developers want more options, he added.

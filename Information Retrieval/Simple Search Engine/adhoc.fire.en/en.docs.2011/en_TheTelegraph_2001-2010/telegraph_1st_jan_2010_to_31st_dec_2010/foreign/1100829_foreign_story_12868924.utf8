	Reporter Lohan    
	 London, Aug. 28 (PTI): Lindsay Lohan has got a new job. She is now a fashion reporter for the BlackBook magazine.       
	The 24-year-old actress was released from rehab recently, just 22 days into treatment and after serving only 13 days of her 90-day sentence for violating probation. Her release coincides with the publication of a fashion piece she has written for BlackBook, in which she talks about and her love of shopping.

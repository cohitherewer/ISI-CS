	Seoul, June 21 (AP): Abnormally high radiation levels were detected near the border between the two Koreas days after North Korea claimed to have mastered a complex technology key to manufacturing a hydrogen bomb, Seoul said.         
	The science ministry said its investigation ruled out a nuclear test by North Korea, but failed to determine the source of the radiation. It said there was no evidence of a strong earthquake, which follows an atomic explosion.         
	On May 12, North Korea claimed its scientists succeeded in creating a nuclear fusion reaction  a technology necessary to manufacture a hydrogen bomb.

          HENRY CHU                          Cameron with his wife Samantha in Peasemore for the wedding of his sister on Saturday. (Reuters)                                  
	Peasemore (Berkshire), April 25: In a nation where class issues often determine how people vote, David Cameron is campaigning for Prime Minister as an ordinary bloke.        
	The man who may be Britains next leader grew up in a spacious country home in this village of thatched roofs, green fields and classic red phone boxes, playing tennis on the family court and joining the occasional foxhunt.         
	He got his university degree from Oxford, where he belonged to an exclusive club of young men with a reputation for wearing tails and drinking to excess. His closest political ally is the son of a baronet, and Queen Elizabeth is a distant cousin.        
	Cameron, 43, is a strong contender to become the first Conservative Prime Minister since 1997. Out on the campaign trail, he cheerfully promises to usher in a modern, compassionate conservatism.        
	What Cameron cant help, though, is his privileged upbringing  and the fact that, even in 21st century Britain, after the free-market revolution of Margaret Thatcher and the Cool Britannia of Tony Blair, questions of class still infuse this society like tea in water.        
	Thats one reason why Liam Didsbury cant imagine voting Conservative, no matter how hard Cameron may try to downplay his past and sell himself as an ordinary bloke.        
	British people dont like to see posh people pretend not to be who they are, said Didsbury, a Labour Party supporter.        
	Didsbury described Cameron as a blue-blooded Tory whos been to Eton  Britains toniest prep school  and went to Oxford.        
	And not just him. His front bench, the fellow Tories who would form his cabinet if Cameron becomes Prime Minister, is stacked with other privately educated individuals from wealthy, even aristocratic, backgrounds.        
	Such facts dont go unnoticed in Britain, even if class divisions arent as rigid as they once were in a nation still peopled with dukes, earls, countesses, knights and dames. Experts say class remains one of the strongest determinants of how voters cast their ballots.        
	That explains why Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the Labour Party trumpets himself as a product and champion of the middle class. And why Nick Clegg, the head of the Liberal Democrats, skates lightly over his education at an expensive prep school and Cambridge.        
	The preoccupation with class turned a spoof campaign poster of Brown challenging Cameron to step outside, posh boy, into an instant hit. Another takeoff paired Camerons tanned and smiling face with the statement, some of my best friends are poor.        
	Cameron makes no apology for his background and denies that its any handicap to his electability.        
	The British public are totally beyond that. They think what matters is where youre going to, not where you come from, he told the Financial Times. They also think that this sort of class-war politics is completely outdated, divisive and wrong.        
	When pressed by another interviewer to say whether he was middle or upper class, Cameron chose neither, tactfully calling himself well-off instead.        
	On the stump, he projects a casual, sleeves-rolled-up, can-do air. He likes being called Dave, or so he tells supporters in the rounded, well-bred tones of someone brought up in the affluent home counties of southern England.        
	But his attempts to come across as more of a regular chap have been undermined by some missteps.        
	Cameron famously described his wife, Samantha, the daughter of Reginald Adrian Berkeley Sheffield, 8th Baronet, as unconventional because she didnt attend boarding school. His much-publicised willingness to bike to work at the House of Commons also seemed a little less down-home when a photographer shot his chauffeured Limousine carrying his briefcase behind him.        
	The problem isnt Camerons extreme privilege  it is that he has never tried to see beyond it, Johann Hari of the Independent newspaper wrote recently. He keeps accidentally revealing how warped his view of Britain is, and how little of it he understands.                    THE LOS ANGELES TIMES

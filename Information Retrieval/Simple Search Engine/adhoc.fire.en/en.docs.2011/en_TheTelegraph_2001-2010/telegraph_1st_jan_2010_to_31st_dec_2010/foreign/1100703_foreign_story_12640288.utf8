The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pakistanis blame US for shrine bombings
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pakistanis blame US for shrine bombings

	Lahore, July 2 (AP): Pakistanis lashed out today at the US, blaming its alliance with their government and its presence in Afghanistan for spurring two suicide bombers to kill 42 people at the countrys most important Sufi shrine.        
	Thousands of people had gathered late yesterday at the green-domed Data Darbar shrine in Lahore when bombs went off minutes apart. The blasts ripped concrete from the walls and left the white marble floor awash with blood. There was no claim of responsibility, but Islamist extremists consider Sufism to be heretical.        
	But today, few Pakistanis interviewed saw militants at the root of the problem.        
	America is killing Muslims in Afghanistan and in our tribal areas (with missile strikes), and militants are attacking Pakistan to express anger against the government for supporting America, said Zahid Umar, 25, who frequently visits the shrine.        
	Pakistanis are suffering because of American policies and aggression in the region, said Mohammed Asif, 34, who runs an auto workshop in Lahore. He and others said the attacks would end if the US would pull out of Afghanistan.        
	Several other Pakistanis interviewed blamed the Ahmadis, a minority sect. On May 28 in Lahore, gunmen and a suicide squad targeted two Ahmadi mosques, massacring at least 93 people, and some Pakistanis claimed the sect must have been seeking revenge.        
	Others cast about for additional villains  though Americas hand was seen there, too. Washington is encouraging Indians and Jews to carry out attacks in Pakistan, said Arifa Moen, 32, a teacher in Multan. Pakistani officials condemned the bombings, using language they have frequently used to try to convince the population that the fight against militancy is not one they can ignore.

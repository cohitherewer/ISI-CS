The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hathaway, Franco to host Oscars
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hathaway, Franco to host Oscars
          BROOKS BARNES                          Hathaway, Franco                                  
	Los Angeles, Nov. 30: Out with the old, in with the young: James Franco and Anne Hathaway will co-host the 83rd Academy Awards in February, an apparent bid to attract younger viewers to the telecast.         
	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made the announcement yesterday morning, with the producers of this years show, Bruce Cohen and Don Mischer, noting in a joint statement that the two actors personify the next generation of Hollywood icons  fresh, exciting and multi-talented.         
	 Making the choice more unusual, both Franco and Hathaway are part of this years Oscar race. Franco has a very good shot at a best actor nomination for his stomach-churning turn in 127 Hours as a hiker who severs his own arm after an accident. Hathaway is more of a longshot in the best actress race but still part of the conversation for playing an early-onset Parkinsons victim in Love and Other Drugs.        
	Last year, Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin co-hosted the ceremony ; more than 41 million people tuned in, the best showing since 2005.

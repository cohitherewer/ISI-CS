The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Privacy breach slur hits Google in UK
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Privacy breach slur hits Google in UK
          DAVID BARRETT                              
	London, Oct. 24: Computer passwords and entire emails from households across Britain have been copied by Google, the Internet search giant, in a major privacy breach.         
	The company has admitted it downloaded personal data from wireless networks when its fleet of vehicles drove down residential roads taking photographs for its controversial Street View project. Millions of Internet users have potentially been affected.         
	One privacy campaigner described the intrusion as absolutely scandalous and called on Google to launch a full inquiry into the affair.         
	The information commissioners office (ICO), the privacy watchdog, said it would be looking into Googles admission.         
	Images for Street View were gathered by vehicle-mounted panoramic cameras starting in 2008.         
	In May this year, Google confessed the vehicles had also been gathering information about the location of wireless networks, the devices which connect computers to the telecommunications network via radio waves.         
	Now, the California-based company has revealed that far more information was harvested than was previously thought, after privacy regulators in seven countries analysed the data.         
	Its clear from those inspections that while most of the data is fragmentary, in some instances entire emails and URLs (web addresses) were captured, as well as passwords, said Alan Eustace, Googles vice-president of engineering and research.         
	We want to delete this data as soon as possible, and I would like to apologise again for the fact that we collected it in the first place.         
	The company archived all the material it had gathered, which included emails being sent by private individuals, the web pages they were viewing and passwords they may have entered as the Street View vehicle passed their homes.         
	It is believed that only wireless networks that were not password-protected were affected.         
	Google is facing prosecution in France and a class action in the US, with similar lawsuits pending in other countries.         
	Street View, which allows Internet users to examine photos of street scenes and view close-up images of almost every property, attracted controversy from the moment it was launched in Britain in March last year.         
	A Google spokesperson said the wireless data was gathered so the company could amass details of Wi-Fi hot spots that could help provide location-based web services.         
	Collection of the additional data was a mistake resulting from a piece of computer code from an experimental project being accidentally included in the Street View cars software, he added.                     THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

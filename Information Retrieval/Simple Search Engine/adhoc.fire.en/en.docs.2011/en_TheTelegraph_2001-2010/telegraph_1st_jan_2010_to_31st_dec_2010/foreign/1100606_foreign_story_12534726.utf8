	June 5: A 34-year-old man, who had eluded Los Angeles police for six weeks after a daring getaway downtown, was charged yesterday on felony weapons charges and ordered held on $1-million bail.        
	A not guilty plea was entered for Brian Alexik, whose alleged tactics have drawn comparisons to the fictional secret agent Jason Bourne. A preliminary hearing was set for June 17. Initially, investigators believed that Alexik may have fled the country after his hasty exit down a fire escape. On Thursday, he was arrested just a mile away from the loft in a small downtown hotel room near Little Tokyo.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak moves to strip Zardari of key powers
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pak moves to strip Zardari of key powers
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, April 2: Pakistans ruling coalition government on Friday tabled a historic package of constitutional reforms in the parliament to strip President Asif Ali Zardari of sweeping powers and transfer them to Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.        
	The package, which is called the 18th Amedment Bill, reverses infamous changes made in the constitution by former military dictator Pervez Musharraf in 2003.        
	Under the new package, the president will no longer have the powers to dismiss a democratically elected government and dissolve the National Assembly.        
	Unveiling the package in the National Assembly, chairman of constitutional reforms committee, Mian Raza Rabbani said that the 18th amendment proposes transferring of powers to appoint chiefs of the armed forces to the Prime Minister from the President.        
	The committee, which also had members from the oppositions Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), Pakistan Muslim League(Q), a former ally of Musharraf and other parties in the parliament finalized the package with consensus.        
	President Zardari will formally announce surrendering these powers in favour of Prime Minister, when he addresses joint session of parliament comprising National Assembly and Senate, on March 5.         
	The 18th amendment bill has been tabled in the parliament at a time when President Zardaris Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government is already under tremendous pressure from the Supreme Court to re-open money laundering cases against him in Switzerland under its December 2009 verdict which struck down controversial National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO), granting amnesty to thousands of politicians including Zardari from graft charges.        
	Musharraf had promulgated the ordinance in 2007 as part of a power sharing deal with former premier Benazir Bhutto, who was killed in a gun and suicide attack during an election rally in the garrison town of Rawalpindi on December 27 same year.        
	The apex court on Thursday directed the government to submit to it a progress report on April 5 abour re-opening of Swiss cases.        
	Swiss government shelved a probe into alleged money laundering against Zardari and his late wife, Benazir Bhutto more than two years ago after the then attorney general Malik Mohammad Qayyum sent a formal request in this regard.        
	Bhutto and Zardari allegedly used Swiss bank accounts to launder about 12 million dollars in bribes paid by different companies seeking contracts for customs inspection in Pakistan in the 1990s.        
	Political analysts believe that the 18th amendment bill would subside pressure on the PPP government as Zardaris status will reduce merely to a figure head.        
	The package also proposed that suspending the constitution or holding it in abeyance by any one should be included in the constitution as an act of high treason.        
	It has also been recommended to re-name the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) as Khyber PakhtoonKhwa, a long standing demand of the people of province, rife with Taliban and Al-Qaeda-linked militancy.        
	It is a historic day in the history of Pakistan, Prime Minister Gilani told the National Assembly.        
	It is a gift of democratically elected government to the people of Pakistan, Gilani said and added that it was a step forward to strengthen democracy and institutions and to promote good governance.

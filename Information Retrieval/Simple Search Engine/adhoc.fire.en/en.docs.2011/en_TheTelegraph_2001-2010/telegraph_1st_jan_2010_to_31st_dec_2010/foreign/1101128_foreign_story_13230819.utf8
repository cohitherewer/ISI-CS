                              LESS OF A PUZZLE                            
	Los Angeles, Nov. 27 (PTI): Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has admitted he found the script of Inception so confusing that he had to ask director Christopher Nolan to explain the films complex plot.        
	DiCaprio struggled to comprehend the complicated twists and turns of the movie and spent hours talking with Nolan about his character Dominic Cobb, a thief who steals information from his unconscious victims while they dream, reports the Hollywood Reporter.        
	I needed to know implicitly where we were. It got incredibly confusing at certain points in the beginning, but the more we talked, the more I understood, said DiCaprio.        
	Inception producer Emma Thomas, Nolans wife, has praised the DiCaprio, 36, for making the movie more accessible for fans, adding: The work (Leo) did on his character with Chris made the movie less of a puzzle and more of a story of a character audiences could relate to.

	London, Dec. 8 (AP): Prince William and fiancee Kate Middleton have another chore on their must-do pre-wedding list: sit down with priests to think about the vows they will make.        
	The couple are expected to meet Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and Bishop of London Richard Chartres before they marry on April 29, palace officials said today. Both clergy will be involved in the wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey.        
	Its customary for a priest to meet the couple before their wedding, said Maria Papworth, Williams spokeswoman. These marriage preparation sessions include discussions on how to handle marital disagreements and how to prepare for the changes brought on by parenthood.

          TIM WALKER                          Warm praise                                  
	London, Feb. 1: Demonstrating that he has a sense of humour, Pervez Musharraf, the former Pakistani dictator, went to see Jihad! The Musical at the Jermyn Street Theatre in London over the weekend.        
	He came with one police officer, his wife, and three friends, says James Seabright, the producer of the controversial show which features such songs as Building A Bomb Today and I Wanna Be Like Osama.         
	We had been contacted by Special Branch about his visit on Friday. All they required was that one of their officers should be sitting beside him. After the show, the general stayed on to congratulate the cast. He was warm and generous in his praise.        
	Ben Scheuer, the co-writer of the musical, did not regard it as remarkable that Musharraf should have wanted to see it. The show makes fun of extremists, not Muslims, he said.        
	After relinquishing the presidency of Pakistan, Musharraf moved to a 1.4million penthouse close to Edgware Road where he is guarded by eight special protection officers from Scotland Yard and his own team of retired Pakistani commandos.

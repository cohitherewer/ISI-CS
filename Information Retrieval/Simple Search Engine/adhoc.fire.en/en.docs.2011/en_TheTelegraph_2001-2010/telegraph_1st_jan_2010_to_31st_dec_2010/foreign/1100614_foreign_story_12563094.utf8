  - Charge of genocide as 75000 Uzbeks flee                             A burnt car on an empty street in Jalalabad on Sunday. (AP)                                  
	Osh, Kyrgyzstan, June 13 (Agencies): Ethnic Uzbeks said Kyrgyz gangs were reportedly carrying out genocide on Sunday in besieged neighbourhoods of the countrys second city Osh, burning residents out of their homes and shooting them as they fled.        
	Around 75,000 Uzbeks have fled Osh for the border with Uzbekistan to escape gangs armed with assault rifles, machetes and iron bars.        
	The Uzbek emergencies ministry said it had started setting up refugee camps in several areas. Most of the Uzbek refugees were elderly people, women and children, and many had gunshot wounds, the ministry said in a statement carried by Russias RIA Novosti news agency.         
	Those Uzbeks who remain have blockaded the entrances to their neighbourhoods with trucks. We are standing at the barricade waiting for them to attack again, said Bakhram Magrafimov, 45, a taxi driver in the mainly Uzbek area of Pyanny Bazar.         
	Residents complained their hunting rifles were no match for the automatic weapons of their enemies. They said: Go back to Uzbekistan. They are attacking our women and children, said Magrafimov.        
	But residents said armed troops had refused to escort Uzbeks to the border, only 10km away in a region where the borders drawn by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin intertwine the two countries in the volatile Fergana valley.        
	Kholbek, an ethnic Uzbek who gave only his first name, said residents were afraid to leave: There are snipers out there.        
	Kyrgyzstans worst ethnic clashes in two decades have spread across the south of the impoverished Central Asian state, which hosts US and Russian military bases.        
	At least 97 people have been killed and more than 1,200 wounded in three days of violence.        
	The interim government of Kyrgyzstan, which assumed power in April after a popular revolt toppled the president, has ordered a shoot-to-kill policy for its troops in the south.        
	But Roza Otunbayevas government has only limited control in the south, which is separated by mountains from the capital Bishkek, about 300km away. Otunbayeva has accused the ousted President, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, of stoking ethnic violence in his southern stronghold. Bakiyev, exiled in Belarus, has denied this.        
	Several witnesses said that the military was also shooting at Uzbeks. Takhir Maksitov of human rights group Citizens Against Corruption, barricaded into his home, said he believed there could be a political dimension to the slaughter.        
	This is genocide, because there are many Uzbeks here and if we were to create our own party and go to the polls... He did not finish the sentence. Send in the peacekeepers, Russia, the UN, whoever. The most important thing is to the stop the slaughter, he said.

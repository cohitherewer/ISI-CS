The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mobiles dirtier than toilet handles: Study
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Mobiles dirtier than toilet handles: Study
                              Home for bacteria                            
	July 28: Mobile phones are covered with up to 18 times more living bacteria than the flush handle on a mens lavatory, research suggests.        
	Swabs and analysis of 30 mobile handsets found that seven had high or warning levels of environmental bacteria, according to consumer group Which?. One contained such an intense concentration of bacteria, including faecal coliforms, that anyone using it could have faced a serious stomach upset.         
	Which? said the findings suggest millions of UK mobiles would exceed the recommended acceptable levels of bacteria.        
	While not immediately harmful, elevated levels of bacteria indicate poor hygiene and can act as a breeding ground for more serious germs. Hygiene expert Jim Francis told Which?: The levels of potentially harmful bacteria on one mobile were off the scale. That phone needs sterilising.        
	The tests showed how easily bacteria could linger on the surface of a phone, which could be passed on to other people if they held the handset to look at photos or other applications.        
	 Which? advises that phones can be cleaned with an alcohol wipe.        
	TVC, or Total Viable Count, gives a quantitative idea about the presence of microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast and mould in a sample. Elevated levels of TVC act as a breeding ground for other bugs.        
	According to the findings, the most unhygienic phone had more than ten times the acceptable level of TVC, while the worst handset had 39 times the safe level of enterobacteria  a group of bacteria that live in the lower intestines of humans and animals and include bugs such as Salmonella.

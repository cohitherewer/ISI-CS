	June 28: Commanders do not allow sexual intercourse on the International Space Station, it has been disclosed.        
	We are a group of professionals, said Alan Poindexter, a Nasa commander, during a visit to Tokyo, when asked about the consequences if astronauts boldly went where no others have been.        
	We treat each other with respect and we have a great working relationship. Personal relationships are not ... an issue, said Poindexter. We dont have them and we wont. Poindexter was in Tokyo to talk about their two-week mission to the station.

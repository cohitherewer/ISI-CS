	Los Angeles, Sept. 18 (PTI): Popstar Lady Gaga has spoken out against a US legislation that forces gay and lesbian servicemen and women to work in secrecy in the army or risk being discharged.         
	Lady Gaga, a gay rights activist, posted a video on Twitter asking her 6 million followers to urge the US Senate to overturn the 1993 legislation by contacting their local senators personally.         
	In the seven-and-a-half minute clip, the 24-year-old sat in front of an American flag, dressed in a black suit and tie. She followed the clip with a tweet professing her love for Senate leader Harry Reid.

	June 19: Its surely the social networking equivalent of the old playground chant: Youre not my friend any more.        
	 A survey by Facebook has revealed a sharp spike in the number of cases of defriending  when a person revokes someone elses friendship status on their social networking site.        
	The surge in defriending appears to be linked to attempts by social network users to control more strictly who has access to their personal pages, updates and photographs online.        
	In-house research carried out at Facebook shows that almost half of its 450 million users have now defriended someone. It appears that users become more circumspect about their friendships following the initial excitement of joining, during which they connect with as many people as possible. Facebook friends can look through each others profiles, giving them an insight into each others lives.

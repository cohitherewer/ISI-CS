The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fed-up steward in sliding exit
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fed-up steward in sliding exit
          ANDY NEWMAN AND RAY RIVERA                          A JetBlue plane at John F. Kennedy airport in New York. (AP)                                  
	New York, Aug. 10: It has been a long time since flight attendant was a glamorous job title. The hours are long. Passengers with feelings of entitlement bump up against new no-frills policies. Babies scream. Security precautions grate but must be enforced.         
	Airlines demand lightning-quick turnarounds, so attendants herd passengers and collect trash with the grim speed of a racing crew. Everyone, it seems, is in a bad mood.        
	Yesterday, on the tarmac at Kennedy International Airport, a JetBlue attendant named Steven Slater decided he had had enough, the authorities said.        
	After a dispute with a passenger who stood to fetch luggage too soon on a full flight just in from Pittsburgh, Slater, 38 and a career flight attendant, got on the public-address intercom and let loose a string of expletives.        
	Then, the authorities said, he pulled the lever that activates the emergency-evacuation chute and slid down, making a dramatic exit not only from the plane but, one imagines, also from his airline career.        
	On his way out the door, he paused to grab a beer from the beverage cart. Then he ran to the employee parking lot and drove off, the authorities said.        
	He was arrested at his home in Belle Harbour, Queens, a few miles from the airport, and charged with felony counts of criminal mischief and reckless endangerment.        
	When they hit that emergency chute, it drops down quickly within seconds, a law enforcement official said. If someone was on the ground and it came down without warning, someone could be injured or killed.        
	In a statement, JetBlue said it was working with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to investigate the episode. At no time was the security or safety of our customers or crew members at risk, the company said.        
	According to his online profiles, Slater has been the leader of JetBlues uniform redesign committee and a member of the airlines in-flight values committee. Neighbours in California, where Slater grew up, said he had recently been caring for his dying mother, a retired flight attendant, and had done the same for his father, a pilot.        
	The contretemps yesterday unfolded as JetBlue Flight 1052, a regional Embraer 190 jet, landed at Kennedy around noon  on time  with 100 passengers aboard and pulled up to the gate, said another law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing.

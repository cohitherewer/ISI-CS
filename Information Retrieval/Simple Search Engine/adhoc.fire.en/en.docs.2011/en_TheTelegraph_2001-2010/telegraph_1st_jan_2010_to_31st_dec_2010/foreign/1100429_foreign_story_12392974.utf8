The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | African urges ban on racist Tintin book

	April 28: A Congolese man is trying to get controversial cartoon book Tintin in Congo banned in Belgium over its racist and offensive depiction of Africans.        
	Bienvenue Mbutu, a Congolese national living in Belgium, has asked the Belgian courts to ban the book, but has said he would accept a ruling that the book must display a warning about its content. Mbutu has also tried to have the book banned in France.        
	Tintins little (black) helper is seen as stupid and without qualities. It makes people think that blacks have not evolved, he has been quoted as saying.        
	A court in Belgium, home to the books author Herg, is due to rule on the matter later, the BBC reports.        
	The book has attracted strong criticism for its crude racial stereotypes in recent years.        
	Three years ago the UKs Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be banned, saying it contained imagery and words of hideous racial prejudice.        
	In the book, a black woman bows to Tintin and says: White man very great. White mister is big juju man! Written in the late 1920s, it was the second Tintin adventure created by Herg, who later said it was a youthful sin which reflected the prejudices of the time.        
	Now UK editions are sold alongside adult books and bear a band of paper around the outside, warning the content is offensive.         
	Several other adventures of Tintin, his faithful dog Snowy, the identical non-twin detectives Thomson and Thompson and the foul-mouthed Captain Haddock (always in English, Herg said, because it was the name of a sad English fish) have hit the rocks of contemporary sensibilities and politics.

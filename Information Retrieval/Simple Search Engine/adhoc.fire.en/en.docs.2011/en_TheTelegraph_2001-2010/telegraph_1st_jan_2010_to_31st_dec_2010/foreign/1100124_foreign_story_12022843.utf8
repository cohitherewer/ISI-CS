	Paltrow fortress    
	 London, Jan. 23 (PTI): Actress Gwyneth Paltrow and her singer husband Chris Martins plan to turn their north London house into a fortress has angered the neighbours.       
	The couple are planning to build a 10-foot steel fence for security concerns to the dismay of the neighbours. As neighbours, we have had years of their building works. Now the fence is just going to look ridiculous... they are turning a Victorian house into a fortress, one irate house owner said.

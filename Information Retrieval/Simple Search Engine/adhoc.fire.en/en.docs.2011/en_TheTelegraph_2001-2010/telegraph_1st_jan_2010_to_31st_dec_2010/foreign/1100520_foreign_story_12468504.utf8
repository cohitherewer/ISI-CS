	Bangkok, May 19 (AP): Downtown Bangkok became a flaming battleground today as an army assault forced anti-government protest leaders to surrender, enraging followers who shot grenades and set fire to landmark buildings, cloaking the skyline in black smoke.        
	Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva tried tonight to reassure the country that the government would restore calm but fires spread through the capital. His government declared a nighttime curfew, and he said in his televised address troops had been given the go-ahead to shoot at suspected arsonists.        
	 The troops had moved earlier in the day against thousands of so-called Red Shirt protesters, mostly rural poor, who had camped behind barricades in the capitals premier shopping and residential district for weeks, demanding Abhisit call immediate elections.        
	The army used live ammunition to disperse them, drawing fire from militant Red Shirts. Officials confirmed five protesters and an Italian news photographer were confirmed killed and about 60 wounded.        
	Witnesses said that six to eight additional dead lay in the temple where hundreds of protesters, including women and children, had sought sanctuary.         
	Mark MacKinnon, a journalist for Canadas Globe and Mail newspaper who was with the refuge seekers, said the situation remained dangerous at Wat Pathum Vanaram, next to the abandoned protest site despite a ceasefire that allowed health workers to evacuate several injured, including a British journalist.        
	After Red Shirt leaders gave themselves up to police this afternoon, rioters set fires at the Stock Exchange, several banks, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Electricity Authority, Central World  one of Asias biggest shopping malls  and a cinema that burned to ground. There were reports of looting.        
	Firefighters retreated after protesters shot at them, and thick smoke drifted across the sky of this city of 10 million people. The chaos in Bangkok after the two-month protest will deepen the impact on the economy and tourism industry of Thailand, a key US ally and long considered one of the more stable countries in southeast Asia.        
	A 10-hour curfew came into force in Bangkok and 23 other provinces at 8pm, and the government said army operations would continue through the night in the Thai capital.        
	It is the first time that Bangkok has been put under curfew since 1992, when the army killed dozens of pro-democracy demonstrators seeking the ouster of a military-backed government.        
	The government also imposed a partial media blackout on local TV stations, saying all of them will have to air government-prepared bulletins.        
	Protesters had already turned their rage on the local media, which they have accused of pro-government coverage. They attacked the offices of state-run Channel 3, setting fire to cars outside and puncturing water pipes that flooded the building.        
	At Channel 3 need urgent help from police, soldiers!!! tweeted news anchor Patcharasri Benjamasa. News cars were smashed and they are about to invade the building. Hours later its building was on fire. Its executives were evacuated by helicopter.

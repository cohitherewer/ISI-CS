The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Daily baths, shampoo polluting environment

          RICHARD ALLEYNE                                    
	London, March 25: Showers and baths are polluting water supplies partly due to growth in shampoos, gels and skin products, new research claims.        
	Researchers have detected substances in water supplies that have come from prescription drugs and toiletries. In the past, environmental concerns had focused on sewage as it was thought that antibiotics and the active ingredients of pills are flushed down the lavatory.        
	But now the new research by the US Environment Protection Agency suggests that waste from showers and baths should also be looked at.        
	Ilene Ruhoy, who coauthored the study reported at the American Chemical Societys annual meeting, said scientists have long known that bathrooms are a portal for release of so-called active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into the environment.        
	An active ingredient in a pill is the medicine, usually combined with binders to hold the pill together.         
	However, scientists and pollution control officials had previously assumed that lavatories were the main culprit, with APIs excreted in urine and faeces and flushed into sewers.

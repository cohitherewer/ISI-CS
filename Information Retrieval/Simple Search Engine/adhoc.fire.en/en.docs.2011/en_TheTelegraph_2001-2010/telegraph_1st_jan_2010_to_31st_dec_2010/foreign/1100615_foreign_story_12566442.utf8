	June 14: Two Somali football fans have been killed by Islamic militants after being caught watching World Cup matches.        
	The deaths took place on Saturday near the capital Mogadishu when members of the Hizbul Islam group stormed a house where people were watching Nigeria play Argentina. A further 10 people were arrested by the group, which has imposed a strict version of Islam in the areas they control in Somalia.        
	The following night, another 30 people, including a 15-year-old boy, were arrested as they watched the Germany-Australia game in two private homes in the town of Afgoye.        
	A spokesman for the group said the rest of Somalia should respect their ban on the World Cup and focus instead on pursuing holy jihad.         
	We are warning all the youth of Somalia not to dare watch these World Cup matches. It is a waste of money and time and they will not benefit anything or get any experience by watching mad men jumping up and down, he said.

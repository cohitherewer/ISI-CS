	New York, May 2: On a typical warm weekend night, Times Square teems with visitors: theatre fans taking a post-show stroll down Broadway; tourists staying in high-rise hotels; suburban teenagers who gather to gawk at the jumbo-sized neon signs that fill the square with light.         
	But when police noticed white smoke billowing from a dark-green Nissan Pathfinder on 45th Street near Seventh Avenue, and then discovered the makings of a crude car bomb inside, the normal hubbub was replaced by a different sort of spectacle.        
	Twelve blocks, from West 43rd Street to West 48th Street between Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue, were cordoned off with metal barricades. The streets and pedestrian malls were filled with ambulances, fire trucks and cars and vans full of police officers.        
	Teams of officers wearing helmets and carrying automatic rifles stood on corners. The bomb squad showed up with a remote-controlled robot and officers wearing blast-proof suits.        
	Onlookers assembled, leaning against the barricade, posing for pictures and asking one another what was going on. The neon lights still flickered, competing with the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles. Tourists still showed up for a glimpse of the square.        
	But for a few hours in the dead of night, with traffic diverted and throngs dispersed, the centre of Times Square was quiet. Well, almost quiet.        
	Outside the sealed-off zone, plenty of travellers were second-guessing their decision to book a room in Times Square. Many people staying there spent the better part of the night waiting to hear when they would be permitted to return to their rooms.        
	Then there were those who willingly lingered, captivated by the drama playing out in front of them. Christina Paiva, from Carle Place, on Long Island, spent her 17th birthday glued to the barricades with a group of friends.        
	 Its very upsetting, Paiva said.         
	But why had the group chosen to stay?         
	Its scary, Sabrina Papez, 17, clarified. But its also intriguing.        
	Around 2 am, a group of friends from Walled Lake, Michigan, arrived, eager to see Times Square.        
	I expected it to be overwhelmingly crowded, said Erica Mitchell, 23.        
	Her friend, Chelsea Gaunt, agreed.         
	I never knew a city could be this quiet, she said.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

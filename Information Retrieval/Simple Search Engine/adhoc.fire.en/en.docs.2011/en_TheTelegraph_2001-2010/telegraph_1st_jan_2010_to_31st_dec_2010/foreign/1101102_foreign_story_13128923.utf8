The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kennedys ask-not adviser dead

          TIM WEINER                          Theodore Sorensen                                  
	Nov. 1: Theodore C. Sorensen, one of the last links to John F. Kennedys administration, a writer and counsellor who did much to shape the Presidents narrative, image and legacy, died yesterday in Manhattan. He was 82.        
	His death, at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, was from complications of a stroke he suffered a week ago, his wife, Gillian Sorensen, said.        
	Sorensen once said he suspected that the headline on his obituary would read Theodore Sorenson, Kennedy Speechwriter, misspelling his name and misjudging his work, but he was much more. He was a political strategist and a trusted adviser on everything from election tactics to foreign policy.        
	You need a mind like Sorensens around you thats clicking and clicking all the time, Kennedys arch-rival, Richard M. Nixon, said in 1962. He said Sorensen had a rare gift: the knack of finding phrases that penetrated the American psyche.        
	He was best known for working with Kennedy on passages of soaring rhetoric, including the 1961 inaugural address proclaiming that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans and challenging citizens: Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. Sorensen drew on the Bible, the Gettysburg Address and the words of Thomas Jefferson and Winston Churchill as he helped hone and polish that speech.        
	First hired as a researcher by Kennedy, a newly elected senator from Massachusetts who took office in 1953, Sorensen collaborated closely  more closely than most knew  on Profiles in Courage, the 1956 book that won Kennedy a Pulitzer Prize and a national audience.        
	After the Presidents assassination, Sorensen practiced law and politics. But in the public mind, his name was forever joined to the man he had served; his first task after leaving the White House was to recount the abridged administrations story in a 783-page bestseller simply titled Kennedy. He held the title of special counsel, but Washington reporters of the era labelled him the presidents intellectual alter ago.

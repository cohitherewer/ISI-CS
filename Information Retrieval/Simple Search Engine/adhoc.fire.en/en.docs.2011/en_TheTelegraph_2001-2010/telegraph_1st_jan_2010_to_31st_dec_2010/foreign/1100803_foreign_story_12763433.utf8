	Kandahar, Aug. 2 (AP): A suicide car bomber blew himself up next to a police truck bringing a southern Afghan official to work early today, killing six children nearby, officials said.        
	The blast went off at about 9am (local time) near a market area in Dand district to the west of Kandahar city, according to the official, district government chief Ahmadullah Nazak.        
	The interior ministry originally said five children were killed in the blast, and Nazak said a sixth had died by early afternoon.

	London, Aug. 18 (AP): Literary critic Frank Kermode, a British academic who inspired the founding of the London Review of Books, has died. He was 90.         
	The London Review of Books, for whom he wrote around 200 pieces, announced his death today, saying he died in Cambridge a day earlier.        
	His publisher, Alan Samson of Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson, said Kermode will be remembered not only for his influential book, The Sense of an Ending, but for his openness to contemporary literature. He was also the author of Romantic Image. He was the Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English Literature at University College London.

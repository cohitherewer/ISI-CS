	Curvy Carey    
	 London, Feb. 25 (PTI): Popstar Mariah Carey may have admitted gaining a few pounds since her marriage to Nick Cannon, but she is not ashamed of her curvy physique.       
	Performing in Los Angeles last night, Carey showed off her figure in a figure-hugging gold dress, reports the Daily Mail.The dress started as a billowing ball gown before a section was whipped off to reveal a ruffled mini, appeared too small for her.

                              Abby Sunderland                            
	Canberra, June 11 (Reuters): A 16-year-old California girl trying to sail solo around the world is safe and well after a massive search and rescue was launched in the Indian Ocean when she triggered distress signals, her parents and Australian authorities said today.        
	Her parents had lost contact with teenage adventurer Abby Sunderland on Thursday as her yacht Wild Eyes was pounded by huge waves in the remote southern Indian Ocean, but an Australian plane flew over her today and made contact with the girl, Australian authorities said.        
	The young American, who began her trip in January, her parents said. The search for Sunderland involved Australia, US and French rescue authorities sending ships and a commercial airliner.

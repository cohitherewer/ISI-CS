The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Scrabble noun rule changed
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Scrabble noun rule changed

	London, April 6: Traditionalists will be quaking (21 points) with fury (10 points)  because the makers of Scrabble are to allow players to use proper nouns for the first time.        
	For decades family arguments have raged furiously over whether words like Quzhou (a city in southern China, 27 points) and Zuma (15 points) are eligible. At least to date the rules have been clear  place names, peoples names and the names of companies or brands dont count.         
	 But now Mattel has posed a new problem for squabbling siblings and over-competitive parents sitting around the table on a wet bank holiday weekend: which rules to play by.         
	The games company said it would be introducing the rule change to enable younger players to get involved.         
	This could cause a power shift between the generations, with those possessing a keen knowledge of the top 40 singles chart legitimately able to cite such high-scoring examples as singers N-Dubz (17 points) and Jay-Z (23 points).        
	A Mattel spokesman said: The layout, the colours of the board, the rules and the game itself have all remained unchanged for over 60 years. These changes are the biggest news for Scrabble lovers in the history of the game and will provide a great new twist on the old formula. We believe that people who are already fans of the game will enjoy the changes and they will also enable families to get involved.

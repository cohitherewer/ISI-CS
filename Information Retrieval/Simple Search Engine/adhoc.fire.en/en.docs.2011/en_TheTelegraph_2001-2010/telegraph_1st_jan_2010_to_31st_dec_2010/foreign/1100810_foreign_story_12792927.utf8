                              Mia Farrow at the court in The Hague. (AP)                            
	The Hague, Aug. 9 (Reuters): The actress, Mia Farrow, told a war crimes court today that she had heard supermodel Naomi Campbell say she had been given a huge diamond by Charles Taylor when he was Liberias President.        
	Campbell told the Special Court for Sierra Leone last week she had been given dirty looking pebbles after a 1997 dinner in South Africa, but did not know if they were diamonds from Taylor, on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity.        
	In court today, Farrow said the British model had joined a group of guests at breakfast after the charity dinner, hosted by South African President Nelson Mandela, and had started relating something that had happened overnight.        
	She said in the night she had been awakened by men knocking at her door and they had been sent to her by Charles Taylor, and they had given her a huge diamond, Farrow told the court, adding that Campbell had beenquite excited about it.        
	Farrow said Campbell had then said she intended to give the diamond to the Nelson Mandela Childrens Fund, adding that it was a sort of an unforgettable moment.

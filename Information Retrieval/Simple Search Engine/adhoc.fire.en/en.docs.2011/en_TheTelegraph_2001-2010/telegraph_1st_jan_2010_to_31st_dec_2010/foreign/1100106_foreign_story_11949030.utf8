The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Google rolls out Nexus to take on iPhone
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Google rolls out Nexus to take on iPhone

	Mountain View (California), Jan. 5: Google stepped up its attack on the wireless industry today, unveiling a new touchscreen phone called Nexus One to compete with the iPhone.        
	The device, which was built by HTC, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, has a 3.7-inch screen and runs the latest version of Googles Android operating system.         
	It is just 11.5mm thin, or about the thickness of a pencil, and weighs 130 grams, or no more than a small Swiss Army knife, said Erick Tseng, a senior product manager. It has a 5-megapixel camera and an LED flash and can shoot both still images and video.        
	The Nexus One is an exemplar of what is possible with Android on mobile phones, Mario Queiroz, a vice-president for product management at Google, said during a news conference at Googles headquarters here.        
	Querioz said that while Google was pleased with the success of Android so far, Google had worked closely with HTC to push the envelope on what is possible on a device.        
	He announced that Verizon Wireless in the US and Vodafone have agreed to join Googles mobile phone. He said the Nexus One would be available in the spring on Verizon.        
	Google also announced that it would sell Nexus One directly in an online store. Consumers will be able to buy it unlocked or with a 2-year calling plan from TMobile.         
	The company said it hoped to add other devices and carriers to the direct to consumer programme.        
	The phone will cost $529 unlocked, or $179 with a two-year plan from TMobile.        
	The Nexus One has a high-speed processor from Qualcomm, which keeps multiple applications running quickly, Tseng said.

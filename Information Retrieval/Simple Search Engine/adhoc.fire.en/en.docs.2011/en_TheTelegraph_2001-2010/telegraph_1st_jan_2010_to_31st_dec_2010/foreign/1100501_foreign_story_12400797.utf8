	April 30: A blind boy has learnt how to see again after being taught a technique used by dolphins to detect where objects are.        
	Jamie Aspland uses an echo location technique, uttering high-pitch clicks with the sound then rebounding off surfaces to help guide him round obstacles.        
	The four-year-old, who was born without his sight, was taught the technique as part of a revolutionary new scheme in the US to help the blind.         
	His mother Deborah, 39, hailed the treatment after her son was able to walk unaided to the park for the first time and steered himself around a fence.         
	Speaking after just three sessions of the therapy, she said: Its changed our lives. The therapy has been a revelation. Since learning the skill we can walk to the park and Jamie no longer has to hold my hand.              
	 He even clicks to find out where the handrails are on our staircase before walking down unaided  its amazing.        
	Jamie, from Ashford in Kent, has just completed his third session with US-based guru Daniel Kish  who lost his sight when he was just 13 months old.        
	As president of World Access for the Blind, Kish has developed a system based on animal sonar to help humans form mental maps of their surroundings.        
	He copied the technique dolphins use to navigate their way through the murky depths  using high pitch clicks to penetrate objects and reflect off their internal structure. Jamie is able to mirror that behaviour  which complements his use of a cane  by flicking his tongue against the roof of his mouth.

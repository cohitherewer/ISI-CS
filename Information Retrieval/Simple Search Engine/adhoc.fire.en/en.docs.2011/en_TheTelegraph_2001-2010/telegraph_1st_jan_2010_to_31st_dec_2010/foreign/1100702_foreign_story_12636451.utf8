The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Militant group with Lal Masjid ties emerges
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Militant group with Lal Masjid ties emerges
                                  
	Islamabad, July 1 (AP): Pakistani authorities now believe a dangerous new militant group, out to avenge a deadly army assault on the Lal Masjid in Islamabad three years ago, has carried out several major bombings in the capital previously blamed on the Taliban.        
	The emergence of the Ghazi Force was part of the outrage among many deeply religious Pakistani Muslims over the July 2007 attack by security forces against the Lal Masjid, a stronghold of Islamic militants.        
	The fierce attack, in which scores of young, heavily armed religious students died, inspired a new generation of militants. These Pakistanis have turned against a government they felt has betrayed them and, to their dismay, backed the US role in Afghanistan.        
	The brief but bloody history of the Ghazi Force illustrates the unintended results of Pakistans policy of promoting Islamic extremists to fight India in Kashmir. That policy  which Pakistan denies it pursues  now threatens regional stability as the US and Pakistans other western partners pour billions of dollars into the country to stop the rise of Islamic militancy.        
	The new group is made up of relatives of students who died in the Lal masjid assault. It is named after the students leader, Maulana Abdul Rashid Ghazi, who was also killed. The mosques adjacent madarsa had been a sanctuary for militants.        
	Private television stations broadcast vivid scenes of the assault  commandos in black fatigues rapelling down ropes, the crackle of gunfire, bodies of black-shrouded girls carried out through the smouldering gates.

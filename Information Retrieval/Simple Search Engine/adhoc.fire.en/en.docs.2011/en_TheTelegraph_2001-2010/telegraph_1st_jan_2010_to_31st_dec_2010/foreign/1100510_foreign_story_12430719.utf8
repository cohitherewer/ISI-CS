	Islamabad, May 9: The Barack Obama administration has delivered stiff warnings to Pakistan after the failed Times Square car bombing that it must urgently move against the nexus of Islamic militancy in the countrys lawless tribal regions.         
	We are saying, Sorry, if there is a successful attack, we will have to act within Pakistan, a US official said.         
	The disclosure was followed by an assertion by US attorney-general Eric Holder that the Pakistani Taliban was behind the Times Square car plot.        
	The pressure from Washington is a sharp turnaround from the relatively polite encouragement adopted by the Obama administration in recent months.         
	It comes amid increasing debate within the administration about how to expand the US militarys influence  and even a boots-on-the-ground presence  on Pakistani soil.         
	Pakistani officials, alarmed by the increase in US drone aircraft attacks against militants, have been extremely sensitive about any hint that American ground troops could become involved.        
	The American military commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, met the Pakistani military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, in Islamabad on Friday and urged Pakistan to move more quickly in beginning a military offensive against the Taliban and al Qaida in North Waziristan.        
	The Pakistani-American who admitted to the Times Square attack, Faisal Shahzad, 30, told American investigators he had received training in North Waziristan, the main base for the Pakistani Taliban and al Qaida.        
	Gen. Kayani, with whom Gen. McChrystal has forged a positive relationship, was essentially told, You cant pretend any longer that this is not going on, another American official said. We are saying you have got to go into North Waziristan.         
	The American ambassador to Pakistan, Anne Patterson, met President Asif Ali Zardari after the failed bombing and used forceful language to convey the American point that the Pakistanis had to move more assertively against the militants, a Pakistani official said.         
	The element of threat is definitely different from the last few months, said Tariq Fatemi, a former Pakistani envoy.

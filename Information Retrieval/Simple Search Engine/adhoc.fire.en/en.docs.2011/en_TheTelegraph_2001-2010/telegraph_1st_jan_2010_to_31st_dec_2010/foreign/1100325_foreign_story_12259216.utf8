The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Biden F-bomb on open mike
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Biden F-bomb on open mike

	Washington, March 24: Vice-President Biden has become the latest public figure to get caught cursing on an open microphone.        
	After introducing President Obama yesterday to a group of whooping Democratic lawmakers at the health care bill signing, Biden was heard telling his boss: This is a big f****** deal!        
	Fox News tweeted out the comment, MSNBC played it over the air, and officials at the White House got a good chuckle over the whole thing.        
	And, believe it or not, you can already buy a T-shirt featuring Bidens now-immortal phrase.        
	Given the landmark nature of the health care law, the comment is likely to join the open mike Hall of Fame. (Uttering the f-bomb in mike range used to be the biggest non-golf thing for which Tiger Woods was known.)        
	And remember this political classic from 2000? Candidate George W. Bush spoke to running mate Dick Cheney about a critical reporter, calling him a major league a*******, to which Cheney responded: Big time.        
	Obama administration officials did not seem too concerned about Bidens latest entry.        
	White House spokesman Robert Gibbs tweeted: And yes, Mr Vice-President, youre right.                    USATODAY

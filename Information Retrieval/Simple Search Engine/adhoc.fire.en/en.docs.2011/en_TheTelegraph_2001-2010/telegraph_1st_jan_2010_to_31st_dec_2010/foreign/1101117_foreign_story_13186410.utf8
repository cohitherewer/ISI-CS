	Yangon, Nov. 16 (AP): Myanmar pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has gone on a legal offensive, filing a document with the countrys High Court to have her political party reinstated after the ruling generals disbanded it earlier this year.        
	Suu Kyis trip to the court today was her first visit downtown since being released from house arrest on Saturday. She had been detained continuously for more than seven years.        
	 Since her release Suu Kyi has shuttled between her lakeside home and the headquarters of her National League for Democracy party. She filed an affidavit with the court as part of an effort to overturn the partys dissolution.        
	It was disbanded for failing to re-register after choosing not to take part in a November 7 general election, complaining conditions set by the junta were unfair and undemocratic.        
	Full results from this months elections have yet to be released, but figures so far give the main military-backed party a solid majority in both houses of parliament.         
	On Sunday, Suu Kyi told thousands of wildly cheering supporters at her party headquarters she would continue to fight for human rights and the rule of law in the military-controlled nation. She has held meetings with party executives and other members to discuss strategy. In press interviews, she has spoken more of reconciliation than justice.        
	In an interview posted today on the Washington Post website, Suu Kyi said she would consider recognising the newly elected parliament  though she has also said she will investigate and expose possible election fraud. She has also said she would like to talk to junta leader Senior Gen. Than Shwe, with whom she has not spoken since 2002.        
	We have got to be able to talk to each other, Suu Kyi told the Post. I think, firstly, we have to start talking affably  real genuine talks, not just have some more tea or this or that. Nyan Win, who is Suu Kyis lawyer, said the court will hold a hearing on Thursday.

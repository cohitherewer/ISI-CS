The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | War on drugs, beyond usual beauty bites
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      War on drugs, beyond usual beauty bites
          MARTIN AROSTEGUI                          Jessica Anne Jordan Burton                                  
	Santa Cruz, June 28: Political inexperience is no bar to success, says Jessica Anne Jordan Burton, a former Miss Bolivia who is now her Presidents special envoy.        
	Rare is the international beauty contestant who does not speak of an enthusiasm for seeing the world and doing good works. Jessica Anne Jordan Burton, however, has taken it a step further: the British-born beauty queen has swapped her crown as Miss Bolivia for a new and somewhat more dangerous job pitted against drug traffickers and paramilitaries.        
	Jordan, 26, who takes her surname from her English father, has caught the eye not just of the beauty judges but of Bolovias firebrand President, Evo Morales, who has hand-picked her to be his personal representative in one of his fiefs most hostile regions.         
	As the new development chief for the border province of Beni, a restive jungle backwater plagued with Right-wing separatists, ethnic Indian militants, and Colombian narco-traffickers, she will be tasked with lavishing cash on the region in a bid to boost her bosss popularity.         
	It is, however, a job, that may attract attention for a rather different reason: as Morales special envoy, she admits she will be at risk of assassination from his political enemies.        
	I dont fear for my safety although my family is afraid of what might happen, said Jordan, who represented Bolivia in the 2006 Miss Universe contest, and who will now be managing a budget of $700 million to build highways, shools, hospitals and sanitation.         
	I feel that the people want to work with me that they have confidence in me. I feel like Im in my place. Its my destiny.        
	Not everyone approves of Jordans appointment to the post of director for development of frontier zones and Macroregions.         
	It comes on the heels of her narrow defeat in a local race for governor, and critics say the new post has been deliberately created to usurp the power of her elected rival.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

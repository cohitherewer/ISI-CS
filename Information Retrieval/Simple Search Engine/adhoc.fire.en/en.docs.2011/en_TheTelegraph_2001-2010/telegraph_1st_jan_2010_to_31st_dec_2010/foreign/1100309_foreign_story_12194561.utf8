The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hurt blows up Avatar, floors Up in the Air
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hurt blows up Avatar, floors Up in the Air
                                        
	Los Angeles, March 8 (Reuters): Twelve years ago, James Cameron declared he was king of the world when Titanic won the Oscar for best picture.        
	But last night, his hopes for a repeat with the 3D blockbuster Avatar were blown up by The Hurt Locker, directed by Kathryn Bigelow.        
	The two films led the field with nine nominations each, including best picture and director. The Hurt Locker won both those races and four other prizes. Avatar ended up with just three awards, all in technical categories.        
	Cameron, personally nominated in three categories, went home empty-handed. The other big loser was Up in the Air, once considered an Oscar front-runner. Its nominated star, George Clooney, made no attempt to hide his morose expression as the light drama was snubbed in all six of its categories.        
	The film was also on the wrong end of one of the nights biggest surprises.        
	 Director Jason Reitman and playwright Sheldon Turner lost the adapted screenplay category to Geoffrey Fletcher for Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire.        
	Reitman and Turner, who did not meet until after the film was finished, awkwardly shared the awards-season spotlight after Turner gained a co-writing credit through Writers Guild arbitration.

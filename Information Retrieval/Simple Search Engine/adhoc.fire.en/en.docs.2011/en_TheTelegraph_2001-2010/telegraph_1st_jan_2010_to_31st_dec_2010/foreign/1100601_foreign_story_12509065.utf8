	Jerusalem, May 31 (Reuters): Israeli marines stormed a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza today and 10 pro-Palestinian activists were killed, triggering a profound diplomatic crisis.        
	Israels allies in Europe, as well as the UN and Turkey, voiced shock and outrage at the bloody end to a bid by international campaigners to break Israels blockade of the Gaza Strip. Its navy stopped six ships ferrying 700 people and 10,000 tonnes of supplies towards the Islamist-run Palestinian enclave.        
	The UN Security Council was summoned for an emergency session in New York. In Washington, however, the US, Israels most vital ally, said only that it regretted the loss of life and was looking into the tragedy.        
	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in Canada and expressed full support for the navy operation, cut short a visit to North America that was to have ended tomorrow with a meeting at the White House with President Barack Obama.        
	That meeting had seemed intended to soothe US-Israel ties, which have been strained by differences over recently revived peace talks with the Palestinians.         
	As the captured foreign vessels were escorted into Israels port of Ashdod, accounts remained sketchy of the pre-dawn interception out in the Mediterranean, in which marines stormed aboard from dinghies and rappelled down from helicopters.        
	Senior Israeli defence officials said 10 activists died on the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish cruise ship carrying 581 people, after commandos came under fire, including with weapons that the activists had snatched from the boarding party. Seven of the troops and 20 protesters were injured, the military said.        
	Israel imposed a communications blackout on those aboard the convoy and other accounts of events were not available. Consular officials were at Ashdod seeking access to detained foreigners.        
	Some Israeli media cited death tolls as high as 19, but an army spokesman later said he was certain of only 9 deaths.        
	It was unclear who the casualties were. A senior Israeli naval officer said most of the dead were Turks. But the convoy also featured Americans, Israelis, Palestinians and many Europeans. The bloodshed sparked street protests and government ire in Turkey, long Israels lone Muslim ally in the region, which had backed the convoy.         
	Ankara cancelled joint military exercises and recalled its ambassador. Turkish President Abdullah Gul demanded the troops be punished while Israel said they fired in self-defence.        
	Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, whose Islamist views and outreach to Iran and other Israeli enemies are blamed by many in Israel for souring relations, cut short a trip to Latin America.        
	A minister admitted that plans to maintain its blockade on Hamas, the Islamist group that rules Gaza, while avoiding an international incident had backfired in spectacular fashion: Its going to be a big scandal, no doubt about it, trade minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said: What Israel has committed on board the Freedom Flotilla was a massacre.         
	He declared three days of official mourning for the dead.        
	Israels deputy foreign minister, Danny Ayalon, blamed the activists for the violence and branded them allies of Israels Islamist enemies Hamas and al Qaida. Had they got through, he said, they would have opened an arms smuggling route to Gaza.        
	There was no question of easing the blockade, he said.        
	Video from the convoy apparently showed a commando shinning down a rope and clashing with a man wielding a stick. The man later appeared to try to stab the marine.         
	One commando told reporters that he came under fire and was attacked with metal bars and knives as he came down onto a ship from a helicopter around 0100 GMT.

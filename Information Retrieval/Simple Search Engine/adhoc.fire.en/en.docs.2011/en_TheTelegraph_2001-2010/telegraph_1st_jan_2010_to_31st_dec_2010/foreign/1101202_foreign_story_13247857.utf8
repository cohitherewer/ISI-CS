	Seoul, Dec. 1 (Reuters): North Korea is highly likely to attack South Korea again, the Souths spy chief said today, as a flotilla of American warships led by an aircraft carrier left South Korean waters after a deadly attack.        
	There is a high possibility that the North will make an additional attack, Won Sei-hoon, director of the National Intelligence Service, told a parliamentary committee meeting.        
	The Souths defence minister, Kim Tae-young, has also warned there was an ample possibility the North might stage another provocation once a US-South Korea exercise ended today.        
	Won said wire-taps in August indicated Pyongyang was preparing for an attack off the west coast designed to smooth the way for Kim Jong-ils son to take over as leader, Yonhap news agency reported.        
	In August this year, we confirmed North Koreas plan to attack five islands in the West Sea through wiretapping, he said. We didnt expect the (Norths) shelling on civilians, as North Korea has often made threatening remarks.        
	Last week, North Korea fired a barrage of artillery rounds at Yeonpyeong island in the first such attack on civilians on South Korean soil since the end of the 1950-53 Korean war.

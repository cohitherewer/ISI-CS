	Cupertino (California), May 3 (AP): Apple Inc today said that it has sold 1 million of its new iPad tablet computers in the month after its launch, meaning its been selling more than twice as fast as the iPhone did when it was new.        
	Apple said it reached the milestone on Friday, when the new 3G model of the iPad was delivered to its first buyers. That model can access AT amp;Ts cellular broadband network in the US. The first models had only Wi-Fi access.        
	One million iPads in 28 days  thats less than half of the 74 days it took to achieve this milestone with iPhone, said CEO Steve Jobs. Demand keeps exceeding supply for the tablet, he added.         
	The iPad went on sale in the US on April 3 and Apple will start taking orders from international buyers on May 10.

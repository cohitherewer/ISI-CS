	Buenos Aires, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Former Argentine President Nestor Kirchner, the current Presidents husband and a contender to succeed her in next years election, died from a heart attack today.        
	Kirchner, 60, was credited by many Argentines with putting South Americas No. 2 economy back on its feet after a devastating 2001/02 economic crisis.        
	It was a sudden death, Kirchners doctor, Luis Buonomo, said.

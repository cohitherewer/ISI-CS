	Kathmandu, Sept. 17: Maoist chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda today announced that he would pull out of the eighth round of elections on September 26 and pave the way for a consensus on the stalemate.         
	His announcement came after his party, the Unified CPN-Maoist, and the CPN-UML reached an agreement to forge a consensus over the Prime Ministerial candidate. A joint statement issued by the parties said the failure to elect a Prime Minister has raised concerns over the future of the peace process.

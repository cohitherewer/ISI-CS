                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Man kills self after US college shooting
                                  
	Austin (Texas), Sept. 28 (AP): A man wearing dark clothes and a ski mask opened fire with an assault rifle today inside a University of Texas library, then fatally shot himself. Police were hunting for a possible second suspect.        
	The 50,000-student campus  the site of one of the countrys deadliest shooting rampages four decades ago  was on lockdown as officers with bomb-sniffing dogs carried out a building-by-building manhunt.        
	Campus police spokeswoman Rhonda Weldon said a man fired an automatic weapon on the sixth floor of the Perry-Castaneda Library then shot himself dead. Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo said the gunman fired an AK-47. Acevedo told a news conference that police are investigating what he described as a second crime scene outside the library where shots also were fired.        
	Texas campus police chief Robert Dahlstrom said the suspect wore dark clothes and a ski mask.        
	Randall Wilhite, an adjunct law professor at the university, said he was driving to class when he saw students start scrambling behind wastebaskets, trees and monuments, and then a young man carrying an assault rifle sprinting along the street.        
	He was running right in front of me ... and he shot what I thought were three more shots ... not at me. In my direction, but not at me, clearly not at me, Wilhite said. The professor said the gunman had the opportunity to shoot several students and Wilhite, but he did not.        
	Police were patrolling nearby buildings with bomb-sniffing dogs to hunt for the possible second suspect and make sure no explosives had been left behind.        
	What were doing right now is being methodical to eliminate the second suspect, Acevedo said.         
	The university cancelled classes for the day. Police and university officials locked down the campus for several hours and early afternoon started to allow students to leave.        
	In an email alert to students and staff, the university said police were searching for possible second shooter.        
	On August 1, 1966, Charles Whitman went to the 28th floor observation deck at the UT clock tower in the middle of campus and began shooting at people below. He killed 16 people and wounded nearly three dozen before police killed him about 90 minutes after the siege began.

                              Separated                            
	London, March 15 (AP): Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet has split from her film director husband Sam Mendes, a British law firm said today.        
	The 34-year-old star separated from Mendes at an unspecified point earlier this year, Shillings law firm said. It was not clear whether divorce proceedings have begun. The pair have been married since 2003 and have two children.        
	In a statement emailed to journalists, the law firm said the split was entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement. Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children.

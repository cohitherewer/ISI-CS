	New York, Sept. 12: The ninth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, was marked on Saturday by the memorials and prayer services of the past, but also by events hard to envision just a year ago  heated demonstrations blocks from ground zero, political and religious tensions and an unmistakable sense that a once-unifying day was now replete with division.         
	The names of nearly 3,000 victims were read under crisp blue skies in Lower Manhattan after the bells of the citys houses of worship tolled at the exact moment  8.46am  that the first plane struck the north tower of the World Trade Center.         
	The familiar rituals at ground zero  the reciting of names, the occasionally cracking voice of a reader, the silences  had a new element. The posters and photographs that the victims relatives held aloft bluntly injected politics into New York Citys annual ceremony, addressing the debate over plans to build a Muslim community centre and mosque near ground zero.         
	Two posters commemorated the victims James V. DeBlase and Joon Koo Kang. One read, Where are our rights? The other: We love you!! Islam mosque right next to ground zero??? We should stop this!!         
	During the ceremony, knots of protesters wandered the area, sometimes arguing. In the afternoon, a few blocks away, police officers and barricades separated demonstrations, both for and against the Muslim centre, that each drew about 2,000 people.         
	At the Pentagon, in a memorial honouring the nearly 200 victims of the attack there, President Barack Obama said that those responsible had sought to divide the country. They may seek to spark conflict between different faiths, but as Americans we are not  and never will be  at war with Islam, Obama said.        
	It was a September 11 starkly different in tone and emotion from those past. For the first time, the anniversary of the worst attack on American soil and New Yorks deadliest disaster served almost as a backdrop to politics. The rancour of a ground zero riven by clashing views on Islam and the US contrasted with the heartbreak of the place.

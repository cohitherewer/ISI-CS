	Pink Iran protest    
	 London, July 30 (PTI): Rock band Pink Floyds hit song Brick in the Wall has become a new anthem for Irans resistance movement.      
	The 1979 song, which was released in the same year as the Islamic Revolution, has been reworked by two exiled Iranian brothers living in Canada.       
	Roger Waters, a founding member of Pink Floyd, gave the rights to the brothers to remake the classic under the title Another Brick in the Wall (Hey Ayatollah, Leave Those Kids Alone).      
	The video features images of Ayatollah Khamenei and footage of street violence following Irans disputed elections last year.

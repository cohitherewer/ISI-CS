	London, Dec. 11: The adopted son of multi-millionaire Pink Floyd rock star Dave Gilmour, pictured desecrating the Cenotaph in Whitehall during the student riots, should be charged with outraging public decency, MPs said last night.        
	Charlie Gilmour, 21, an undergraduate at Cambridge University, was seen swinging from a Union Flag on the war memorial.        
	His actions caused deep anger among members of the public already shocked by scenes of rioting and vandalism across the capital. Gilmour, who is studying history at Girton College, was yesterday forced to apologise for his actions, claiming he had been overtaken in a moment of idiocy.        
	But leading politicians and military figures last night said his apology was not enough and called for the student to be prosecuted or at least made to take part in the clean-up operation.        
	A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: Whenever a demonstration is planned, an appropriate policing plan will be put into action.        
	A spokeswoman for the royal family declined to comment.        
	David Burrowes, the MP for Enfield Southgate, who has campaigned for stiffer penalties for those who desecrate war memorials said: Mr Gilmour should certainly be prosecuted for outraging public decency because his disgraceful actions have outraged an enormous number of people.        
	The actions of wanton vandalism, such as daubing paint on the statue of the defender of freedom, Winston Churchill were bad enough.        
	But to deliberately target the Cenotaph, so soon after Remembrance Sunday when veterans and the families of those who have laid down their lives for the country, were there paying their respects is disgraceful.        
	It is also deeply ironic that these individuals have targeted monuments to the very people who fought to allow them the freedom to protest. Mr Gilmour should be brought before the courts and held to account for his actions.

	Paris/Marseille, May 22 (Reuters): France has asked Interpol for help in tracking down five paintings stolen in a 100 million euro ($125 million) art heist at a Paris museum, suggesting the artworks have already left the country.        
	Interpol said today it had alerted its 188 member countries about the major theft from the Musee dArt Moderne in Paris and added the works to its stolen art database.        
	Museum officials discovered the paintings, which included works by Spanish master Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Amedeo Modigliani, missing on Thursday after noticing a smashed window pane.

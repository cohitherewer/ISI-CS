                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Stone: Streep looks like an unmade bed
          ANITA SINGH                              Stone (top) and Streep: Woman we can all relate to				                                 
	London, Dec. 7: Sharon Stone has described fellow Hollywood actress Meryl Streep as looking like an unmade bed.        
	In what could be mistaken for a backhanded compliment, the Basic Instinct star said women can relate to Streep because she looks so ordinary.        
	I think thats why Meryl Streep is working so much, because she looks like a woman we can all relate to, Stone told Tatler magazine.        
	I look at her and I think: Im chasing my kids, Ive moved my parents in with me, Im coping with food spills  that looks like me in real life.        
	Meryl looks like an unmade bed, and thats what I look like. To me, that looks true.        
	Streep, 60, is currently on the big screen in the romantic comedy Its Complicated, and is tipped to pick up her 14th Oscar nomination next month for Julie amp; Julia.        
	Stone, 51, insisted that her own glamorous good looks are entirely natural, and that she looks fantastic at 51 thanks to exercise and good genes. She is currently the face of Diors anti-ageing skincare range.        
	I have had zero, nothing done to myself: no lifting, no Botox, no injectables, she said. I did try something once and I saw myself in a movie and didnt like the way I looked. I thought I looked like I had a giant balloon head, and I felt it wasnt for me.        
	I think everyone here [in LA] looks like everyone else. Its goldfish number one, two and three, and I didnt want to be goldfish number four. Im not saying I might not do a little something later on but its just not me now.        
	Instead, she prefers to maintain her looks the old-fashioned way  to go to the gym and take care of your internal life. It might take more effort but you get something nicer to give back to the world. She went on: Im not one of those ladies who wont say their age. Im very grateful for it. We get different faces as we go through our lives. If you try to hang on to the face you had when you were younger, you end up desperate.         
	Im happy with the way I am now, with this 51-year-old person.        
	Stone is a UK size 6-8 but said she never diets. I have to watch not getting too skinny. Im a mover. Im not one of those people who can survive on salad. I love a big steak dinner and Im obsessed with finding the perfect hamburger.

	Vienna, June 22 (Reuters): Austrian kidnap victim Natascha Kampusch will tell the story of her eight years imprisoned in an underground cell in memoirs to be published in September, a newspaper reported today.        
	The 220-page book, called 3096 Days will be published in German on September 8 according to Austrian daily Oesterreich and a listing on the online bookseller Amazon.        
	Kampusch, now 22, made headlines around the world after she escaped from her captor Wolfgang Priklopil in 2006. He killed himself hours later.        
	It is true that Kampusch is working on her autobiography, this is her main focus at the moment, her spokesman Wolfgang Brunner told the newspaper.        
	Kampusch, who has chaired her own talk show and made several media appearances since her ordeal, is also working on a film of her story which is set for release in 2012.

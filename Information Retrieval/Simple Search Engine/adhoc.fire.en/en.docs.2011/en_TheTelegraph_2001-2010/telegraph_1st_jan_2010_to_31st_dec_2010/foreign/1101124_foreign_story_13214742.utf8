	Seoul, Nov. 23: North and South Korea exchanged artillery fire today after dozens of shells fired from the North struck a South Korean island near the countries disputed maritime border, South Korean military officials said.         
	Two South Korean soldiers were killed, 15 were wounded and three civilians were injured, said Kiyheon Kwon, an official at the defence ministry. The South Korean military went to crisis status, and fighter planes were put on alert but did not take off.        
	South Korean artillery units returned fire after the Norths shells struck South Koreas Yeonpyeong Island at 2.34pm, said Kwon, adding that the North also fired numerous rounds into the Yellow Sea. Television footage showed large plumes of black smoke spiralLing from the island, and news reports said dozens of houses were on fire.        
	The official North Korean news agency said in a brief statement tonight that the South had started the fight when it recklessly fired into our sea area.        
	The South Korean deputy minister of defence, Lee Yong-geul, acknowledged that artillery units had been firing test shots this afternoon close to the North Korean coast, from a battery on the South Korean island of Paeknyeongdo.         
	But he denied Pyongyangs charge that the shots had crossed the sea border.While skirmishes between the two countries have not been uncommon in recent years, the clash appeared to have been the most serious in decades and came amid heightened tensions over the Norths nuclear programme.        
	 An American nuclear scientist who recently visited the North said he had been shown a secret and modern enrichment facility.        
	A spokesman for President Lee Myung-bak said Lee gathered his security-related ministers and senior aides at a crisis meeting in the underground situation room at the Blue House, the presidential office and residence.        
	We will not in any way tolerate this, Lees chief spokesman, Hong Sang-pyo, said after the meeting. Any further provocation will get an immediate and strong response and the South Korean military will strongly retaliate if there is anything further.        
	The US condemned the attack and called on North Korea to halt its belligerent action, the White House said.        
	The attack on the island came as 70,000 South Korean troops were beginning an annual nationwide military drill called Safeguarding the Nation. The exercise has been sharply criticised by Pyongyang as simulating an invasion of the North and a means to provoke a war. The drill includes some US forces, but a defence official said no American military personnel were on the island when it was hit.        
	A spokeswoman for the unification ministry in Seoul said tonight that the South Korean Red Cross had indefinitely postponed a Thursday meeting with North Korean officials on further reunions between family members separated since the Korean War.         
	She also said the ministry was reviewing the security situation for several hundred South Korean workers at the Kaesong Industrial Park, a jointly operated facility in North Korea.        
	Yeonpyeong Island sits just two miles from the Northern Limit Line, the disputed sea border which the North does not recognise, and only eight miles from the North Korean coast.         
	The island houses a garrison of about 1,000 South Korean marines, and the navy has deployed its newest class of patrol killer guided-missile ships in the Western Sea, as the Yellow Sea is also known.        
	About 1,600 civilians also live on the island, mostly fishermen, and local news reports said by late afternoon that some residents had fled the island on fishing boats.        
	In March, a South Korean naval vessel, the Cheonan, was sunk in the area and 46 sailors died. The incident badly frayed inter-Korean relations and Seoul blamed the sinking on a North Korean torpedo attack. The North has denied any role in incident.        
	In August, North Korea fired 110 artillery rounds near Yeonpyeong and another South Korean island, the office of joint chiefs of staff in Seoul said at the time. Three weeks ago, the South Korean Navy fired warning shots at a North Korean fishing boat after the vessel strayed across the Northern Limit Line. The North Korean boat then reportedly retreated.        
	Reaction from governments involved in the six-party talks on disarmament to the escalation of violence was swift. The Russian foreign ministry urged restraint and a non-military resolution, while the British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the unprovoked attack and urged Pyongyang to refrain from hostilities.

	Rome, Dec. 21 (AP): A suspicious package full of wires and powder was found today in a subway car in Rome, prompting a terror scare during the Christmas season.         
	However, the citys mayor said the device was a fake that could not have exploded. The device was found at around 0900GMT inside a train at the Rebibbia station, on the outskirts of Italian capital. The train was at the end of the line and empty when the package was found, said Atac, which runs the Rome subway.        
	Bomb-disposal experts checked the powder and concluded the device could not have exploded, Rome mayor Gianni Alemanno was quoted as saying by the Ansa news agency.        
	He told reporters the device was a fake, even if it looked threatening. It wasnt clear what type of powder was involved. Bomb disposal experts were analysing it, Atac said.        
	Various Italian agencies joined the investigation, but there was no indication they had any concrete clues of who left the device. Atac said in a statement the train was in an area beyond the platform that is used for manoeuvring when the device was found.        
	Spokeswoman Diana Formaggio said the package contained powder and wires. She said the station was never closed and the service was not interrupted.

	London, Jan. 7: Witch doctors in Uganda have admitted their part in human sacrifice amid concerns that the practice is spreading in the African country.        
	One man said he had clients who had captured children and taken their blood and body parts to his shrine, while another confessed to killing at least 70 people including his own son. The latter has now given up the ritual and is campaigning to stamp it out, according to BBC News.        
	The African countrys government claimed human sacrifice was on the increase.According to officials trying to tackle it, the crime is directly linked to rising levels of development and prosperity  and an increasing belief that witchcraft can help people get rich quickly.        
	The BBC team witnessed anti-sacrifice campaigners torching the shrine of a witch-doctor in Uganda, who agreed to give up the practice.                           The Daily Telegraph

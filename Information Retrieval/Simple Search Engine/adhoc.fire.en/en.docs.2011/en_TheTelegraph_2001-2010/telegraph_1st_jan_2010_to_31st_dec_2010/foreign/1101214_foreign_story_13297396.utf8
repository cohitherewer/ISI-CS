	Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (PTI): They are two of Hollywoods hottest stars but the presence of Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp could not salvage The Tourist, which has now bombed at the box-office after getting panned by critics.        
	Despite the pulling power of Jolie and Depp, the romantic thriller set in Venice, Italy, failed to attract moviegoers and is set to take less than $20 million on its opening weekend.         
	The film was the first time the two Hollywood stars got together on screen, but despite the hype, movie experts predict that it will be pulled from US theatres in a matter of weeks with Hollywood studio Sony hoping it performs better overseas, according to the Hollywood Reporter.         
	The pairing of Depp and Jolie failed to work with critics panning their on-screen chemistry.         
	Star power can cover up a multitude of shortcomings in a film. Turns out stupidity isnt one of them. Nor is a lack of chemistry when those stars are tossed into the same orbit, said the New York Times review.

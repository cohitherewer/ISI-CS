The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bangla pleas rejected
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bangla pleas rejected
                            
	Dhaka, Jan. 18 (PTI): The Bangladesh President, Zillur Rahman, today rejected the mercy petitions of three of the five former army officers facing the death penalty for the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.         
	A senior presidential palace official said the decision was taken after the petitions of former lieutenant colonels A.K.M. Mohiuddin and Mohiuddin Ahmed and former major Bazlul Huda reached the palace from the Prime Ministers office last evening.         
	Two other officers, former lieutenant colonels Syed Faruq Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Khan, are yet to file their petitions.        
	Their lawyers said they might consider seeking presidential clemency only after they have explored all legal avenues.        
	Despite the rejection, the apex court is set to hear the final review petitions of the accused against its earlier verdict that confirmed the death penalty of 12 former army officers.         
	Five of the 12 are in jail while six are still on the run and one has already died abroad. Chief prosecution counsel Anisul Huq said there was no bar for Faruq and Khan to seek presidential clemency within seven days after the end of the review process.         
	However, the prosecution lawyers said the countdown has begun for the execution of the verdict as the jail code demands that death warrants be carried out between the 21st and the 28th day from the date the warrants had been signed.         
	The original trial court issued the warrants on January 3.

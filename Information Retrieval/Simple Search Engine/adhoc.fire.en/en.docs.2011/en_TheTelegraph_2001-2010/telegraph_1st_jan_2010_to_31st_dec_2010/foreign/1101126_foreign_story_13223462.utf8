The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Korea defence chief quits amid criticism
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Korea defence chief quits amid criticism
          MARK MCDONALD                          Kim Tae-young                                  
	Seoul, Nov. 25: President Lee Myung-bak accepted the resignation of defence minister Kim Tae-young today amid intense criticism over the Souths response to an artillery attack by North Korea two days earlier and the sinking of a warship in March.        
	There was a need to revamp the military landscape, a senior government official said tonight. It was time.        
	The government official said Kim offered his resignation on May 1, after a South Korean Navy vessel, the Cheonan, was sunk off the coast of North Korea in the Yellow Sea. Lee deferred the resignation and asked Kim to stay on. It was expected that his replacement would be named tomorrow.        
	Earlier today, , the government said it would bolster its island defences in the Yellow Sea and make its rules of engagement more muscular. Lee held a security meeting this morning at the Blue House, the presidential compound in Seoul, where the new strategies were drafted.        
	Seoul also said it would press China to use its considerable diplomatic leverage with the North to avoid an escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula.        
	Kims departure followed one of the most violent clashes as the North and South exchanged artillery barrages on Tuesday afternoon. The battle killed two marines and two civilians on the small South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, about nine miles off the North Korean coast.        
	A commentary in the conservative South Korean daily Chosun Ilbo assailed Kim, saying the military had been outgunned and underprepared.        
	The minister practically admitted that the military failed to respond to a new type of North Korean threat in the Yellow Sea, the newspaper said, charging that the military has been implementing reforms that weaken defence capabilities on the islands.        
	Beijings response has so far been muted, and a senior government official in Seoul said privately today that South Korea was going to pull out all the stops and make every diplomatic effort with China.        
	It was unclear whether the arrival of a US aircraft carrier group off North Koreas coast would be seen as a provocation. The carrier George Washington  with 5,700 personnel and about 85 fighter planes  was headed yesterday to the Yellow Sea. The carrier group will join with South Korean forces for a four-day series of military exercises that are scheduled to start Sunday.        
	A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said today that China had expressed its concern over the exercises and would be paying close attention to American naval movements.        
	The spokesman also reiterated that China supported resumption of the so-called six-party talks on the dismantling of North Koreas nuclear programmes. The talks involve the two Koreas, China, Russia, Japan and the US. They broke down when North Korea withdrew last year, although in recent months Pyongyang has sought to renew the process.        
	The American general who heads the UN Command in South Korea, Gen. Walter L. Sharp, has called for military talks with senior officers of the North Korean Peoples Army in order to initiate an exchange of information and de-escalate the situation. The North rejected that idea today.        
	Through its official news agency, Pyongyang also warned of further military retaliation if provoked by South Korea. At the Blue House meeting, Lee said: We should not drop our guard in preparation for the possibility of another provocation by North Korea, according to his chief spokesman, Hong Sang-pyo. A provocation like this can recur any time.        
	South Korean defences on its five coastal islands in the Yellow Sea had been set up primarily to guard against possible amphibious landings by North Korean troops.         
	Critics said today that the military had not anticipated the possibility of an attack by North Korean artillery batteries, which are reportedly situated in caves along the Norths coastline.        
	Now an artillery battle has become the new threat, so were reassessing the need to strengthen defences, Kim told lawmakers. The new measures he outlined include doubling the number of howitzers and upgrading other weaponry. New rules of engagement will be based on whether military or civilian targets are targeted, said Hong, the presidential spokesman.

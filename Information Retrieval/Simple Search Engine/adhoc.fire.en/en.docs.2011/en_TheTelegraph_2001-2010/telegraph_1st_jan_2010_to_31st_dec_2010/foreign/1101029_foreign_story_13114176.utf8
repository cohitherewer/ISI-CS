	Los Angeles, Oct. 28: James Cameron has set his return trip to Pandora.        
	Fox announced yesterday morning that Avatar 2 and Avatar 3, the sequels to last years science-fiction blockbuster, will be James Camerons next films, with the director beginning work on the scripts in early 2011. Production on Avatar 2 could begin as soon as late 2011, with the movie likely in theatres in December 2014, according to Fox.        
	Although it was widely believed that Cameron had many ideas for Avatar 2 and wanted to begin work on it shortly, the fact that it would be his priority  and that the studio was planning on a third film as well  represents a major development. With his heavily developed story lines and intensive use of new technology, Cameron can often take a decade or longer between films.        
	Fox said in its announcement that Cameron has not made a decision about whether to shoot the two films back to back but that he well could, which would allow Avatar 3 to come out as early as December 2015.        
	There was little detail about the plot for the new movies. Avatar ended with Jake (Sam Worthington) joining the Naavi and fighting off the invasion of human armed forces led by Col. Quaritch (Stephen Lang).        
	Cameron did say in a statement that the movies will be self-contained stories that also fulfill a greater story arc.

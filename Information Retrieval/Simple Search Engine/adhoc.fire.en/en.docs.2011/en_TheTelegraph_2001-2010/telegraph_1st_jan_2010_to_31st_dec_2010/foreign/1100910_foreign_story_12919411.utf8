                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Clint refused Superman, 007 roles
                                  
	Los Angeles, Sept. 9 (PTI): Actor and director Clint Eastwood says that he was offered the roles of James Bond and Superman in his younger days.         
	However, he refused to wear Bonds tuxedo and Supermans red cape.         
	Eastwood, 80, said he was asked to take over as 007 after Sean Connery walked out on the role in 1967. At the time Eastwood was playing cowboys in spaghetti westerns such as The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. Eastwood said his then lawyer also represented the Broccolis, who produce the Bond franchise.         
	He came and said: They would love to have you. I was offered pretty good money to do James Bond if I would take on the role. But to me, well, that was somebody elses gig. Thats Seans deal. It didnt feel right for me to be doing it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Amazons new Kindle faster, lighter, cheaper 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Amazons new Kindle faster, lighter, cheaper 
          EDWARD C. BAIG                          Amazons new Kindle e-book reader. (Reuters)                                  
	July 29: Amazon.com will unveil its answer to Apples iPad and other devices seeking to replace its Kindle as the premier digital book reader.        
	Its a third-generation Kindle that is lighter, smaller and faster than the current model  and also has a sharper display, longer battery life and twice the storage.        
	Amazon has added Wi-Fi reception for those who want to use a speedy Internet service to download e-books.         
	The model, which starts shipping on August 27, will be priced at $189, same as the current Kindle.        
	But Amazon hopes to rattle rivals by offering a version that just uses Wi-Fi for wireless connections which will sell for $139. That is about $10 below the least-expensive versions of Barnes amp; Nobles Nook and the Sony Reader.        
	At these prices, people are going to buy multiple Kindles for the household, CEO Jeff Bezos told USA TODAY. Remember: 33 months ago, Kindle was $399.        
	Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey agrees: Anyone who said: I dont want to get (a Kindle) because theyre too expensive, will look at $139, and say: Its time to become a digital reader.        
	Amazon has sold about 4 million Kindles in the US and will top 6 million by the years end, McQuivey estimates. It has two-thirds of the e-reader market. Yet, in 2012, multimedia tablet PCs, led by the iPad, will outsell dedicated e-readers, he says.        
	That is not all bad for Amazon. Owners of such devices can read e-books from Amazon using its free Kindle app. The US Kindle store has more than 630,000 titles. Still, Bezos is betting that lots of people will still want a dedicated e-reader.

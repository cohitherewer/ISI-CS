                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Carter hospitalised
                              Upset stomach                            
	Washington, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Former President Jimmy Carter was hospitalized in Cleveland this morning after developing an upset stomach while flying there, according to the Carter Center.        
	He is resting comfortably and is expected to resume his book tour this week, a statement from the Atlanta-based Center said.        
	Carter, 85, who served as President from 1977 to 1981, was flying to Cleveland for a book-signing session.        
	NewsChannel 5 in Cleveland said on its website that an ambulance was called to meet the commercial flight on which Carter flew to the Ohio city late in the morning, and took him to MetroHealth Medical Center. Since leaving the presidency, Carter has been active in international diplomacy, particularly in intervening on behalf of Americans detained abroad and as an observer of foreign elections.        
	Just last month, he went to North Korea to secure the release of an American who had been convicted of illegally entering the country. Carter left Pyongyang with Aijalon Mahli Gomes, who was arrested in January and sentenced to eight years of hard labour.

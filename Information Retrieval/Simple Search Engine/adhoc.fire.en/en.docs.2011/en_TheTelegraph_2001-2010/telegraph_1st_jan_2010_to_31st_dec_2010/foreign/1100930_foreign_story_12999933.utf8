The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Little Ed in charge, big brother Dave bows out
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Little Ed in charge, big brother Dave bows out
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Sept. 29: The two Miliband brothers today became the equivalent of Indias Mukesh and Anil Ambani after David, the elder by five years, announced he would not serve under 40-year-old Ed Miliband who beat him to the Labour Party leadership with hard Left trade union help by 1.3 per cent.        
	The split was announced today in diplomatic language with David saying that this is now Eds party to lead and he needs to be able to do so as free as possible from distraction.        
	The news that David, currently shadow foreign foreign secretary having held this senior ministerial post under Gordon Brown, will not be seeking election to the new shadow cabinet was received without fuss by Ed, who has surprised onlookers with his ruthlessness.        
	Ed called Davids decision thoughtful and gracious and added: He is my brother and I am very clear that, as leader of this party, my door is always open for him to serve in the future, either in opposition or back in government.        
	Just when the leadership of the Labour Party and possibly the job of Prime Minister appeared within his reach, it has been snatched away by his younger brother who became an MP only in 2005.        
	The brothers will probably put a brave face on their differences but the relationship between Davids US-born wife, Louise Shackelton, a professional violinist with the London Symphony Orchestra, and Eds partner, Justine Thornton, a Cambridge-educated barrister, now appears to be turning into a feud.        
	Justine, who is said to be furious with Justine, was seen weeping when a vanquished David addressed the Labour Party conference at the weekend. As one paper remarked, with typical British understatement: Justine wont be on Louises Christmas card list.        
	The political differences between the brothers are also deep. Yesterday, when Ed told the party conference that the Iraq war was wrong, David, who had backed Tony Blairs military invasion, sat impassively. He even upbraided a senior cheering colleague who had, like him, supported attacking Iraq.        
	David is to remain on the backbenches. The best he can hope for is that if Prime Minister David Cameron beats Ed at the next election, the Labour Party will turn to him. But most analysts say David Milibands time has come  and gone.

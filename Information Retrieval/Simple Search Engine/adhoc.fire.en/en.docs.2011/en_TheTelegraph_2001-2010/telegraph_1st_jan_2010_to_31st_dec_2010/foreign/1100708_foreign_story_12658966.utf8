                          Mikhail Pletnev                    
	Pattaya, July 7 (AP): Internationally acclaimed Russian pianist and conductor Mikhail Vasillievich Pletnev has been charged with raping a 14-year-old boy at a Thai beach resort, police said today.        
	Pletnev, whose arrest is one of the most prominent cases to date in a country known as a sex tourist haven, said the charges were the result of a misunderstanding.        
	Pletnev, the founder of the Russian National Orchestra, was arrested on Monday evening at a restaurant in Pattaya and brought to court on Tuesday to face rape charges, said police Lt. Col. Omsin Sukkanka. He was released on a 300,000 baht ($9,000) bail, ordered to report to the court every 12 days and banned from contacting witnesses in the case. He could face up to 20 years in jail and a fine of up to 40,000 baht ($1,200) if found guilty.        
	He described what happened to him as a misunderstanding. I have no idea how the charges came about. But I more or less know where they came from.         
	A business associate said Pletnev was a victim of blackmail, but did not elaborate.         
	Police said he was detained following a tip from Traipob Boonmasong, a Thai national who was charged with child rape for alleged involvement in a prostitution ring.The boy said he had lived in Traipobs house for a year and was raped by Pletnev twice. The first time was in the middle of last year and the second early this year, Omsin said.

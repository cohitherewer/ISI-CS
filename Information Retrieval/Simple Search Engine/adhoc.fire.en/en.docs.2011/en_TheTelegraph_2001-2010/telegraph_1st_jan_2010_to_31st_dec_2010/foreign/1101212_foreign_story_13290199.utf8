	London, Dec. 11: Two new official engagement pictures of Prince William and Kate Middleton, which are being released on Sunday morning, have been taken by Peruvian-born photographer, Mario Testino, who became famous after taking iconic images of Princess Diana a year before her death in 1997.        
	 The pictures come as real worries mount over whether anarchists from far and wide will gather in London on April 29, the day of the royal wedding at Westminster Abbey, in another effort to trash the area around the Palace of Westminster.        
	 Scotland Yard has been given the all clear by David Cameron to begin a massive hunt for the protestors who attacked the Rolls-Royce carrying Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, on Thursday night, in Regent Street.        
	 The prime minister has signalled the attackers should feel the full force of the law.        
	 Video footage, photographs, witness statements and CCTV will all be used to track down the attackers and give them heavy prison sentences.        
	 Visit Britain, the official tourist agency, is using April 29 to try and attract visitors from all over the world, especially India from where an extra 100,000 people are expected though perhaps not at the same time.        
	 Early birds can take up positions around Westminster if they wish to catch the full flavour of the wedding but this will also be the area most under surveillance by anti-terrorist police.                   Mario Testino      
	According to todays Daily Express, gangs of anarchists are plotting to wreck the Westminster Abbey wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. Police intelligence reports reveal how anti-capitalist thugs around the world are being urged to descend on London for the wedding. There are genuine fears anarchists will attempt to destroy the couples big day by sparking riots across the capital.  
	 The paper reports: Security experts say the capital will be a favoured venue for yobs bent on violence due to continuing protests over tuition fees and cuts in public services. An internet campaign is already building to amass a mob and stage a major demonstration on the Princes wedding day.        
	 It quotes a website: Royal Wedding marks the beginning of the end of capitalism. Monarchies are dead and the English one is merely just a Euro Disney re-creation.        
	 A senior police source informed the paper: The events of Thursday show how these people are capable of carrying out sickening levels of violence. They also used the internet and social networking sites to mobilise their supporters and get them out on the streets in pretty cold weather. The threat to disrupt the Royal Wedding next year is being taken seriously.        
	 The chances are that popular opinion will ensure the day passes without incident but Scotland Yard, seriously embarrassed on Thursday, will deploy all its resources for the royal wedding when Britain goes on show to the world.        
	 Kate and William, both 28, are, meanwhile, projecting a happier aspect of life in Britain.        
	 Testino photographed them on November 25, 2010, in the Council Chamber in the State Apartment in St Jamess Palace, which was built by Henry VIII in the 16th century.        
	 William and Kate studied the photographs before picking the two they liked best.        
	 In the formal picture, Kate is seen wearing a white Reiss dress, Links earrings and her engagement ring that once belonged to Diana. The prince is dressed in a smart outfit by Turnbull and Asser  dark suit, blue tie and a white shirt.        
	 The informal image shows the couple smiling and embracing, with William wrapping his arms around Kate while she puts her left hand on his chest as their heads touch.        
	 Kate is wearing jeans and a white Whistles blouse while her fiance also in jeans, has on a white Turnbull and Asser shirt, and a brown Brunello Cucinelli jumper supplied by Testino.        
	 I am very happy to have been asked to cover this historic moment that the whole world was waiting for, Testino commented. They are in their prime and brimming with happiness. I have never felt so much joy as when I see them together.        
	 A Clarence House spokesperson said: Prince William has worked with Mario Testino on many occasions before, and so the couple decided that he was the right choice for such an important portrait.        
	 Incidentally, Testino is not the only Peruvian photographer in town. Andres Reynaga, a gifted Peruvian-origin photographer specialising in fashion, has taken many equally fetching photographs of his wife, cookery writer Mallika Basu, granddaughter of the late Bengal chief minister, Jyoti Basu.

	Dhaka, June 15 (Reuters): Bangladesh power authorities have asked shops and shopping malls in the capital Dhaka to shut each evening so that fans can watch the World Cup on television without overloading the supply.        
	They had already made a similar request to 5,000 mills and factories after angry viewers attacked several power distribution centres and vandalised at least 20 vehicles on Saturday following a loss in the transmission from South Africa.        
	The state-run power supply companies gave the latest directive on the eve of todays match between Brazil and North Korea, both teams having millions of supporters in Bangladesh. The companies also asked subscribers to switch off air conditioners, water pumps, micro-ovens and other home appliances during the tournament.        
	Notice has been served to obey the instructions to manage frequency of load-shedding increased in the city due to the World Cup, said Mohammad Afrazur Rahman, spokesman of the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources. Although Bangladesh, ranked 157th in the world, lost 6-1 to Tajikistan in a two-legged first round Asian zone qualifier for this years finals, the 150 million population have a large proportion of avid soccer fans.

	Landslides triggered by heavy rain in southeast Bangladesh buried dozens of houses and an army camp today, killing at least 58 people, officials said. The landslides hit villages in the Coxs Bazar hill and resort district.

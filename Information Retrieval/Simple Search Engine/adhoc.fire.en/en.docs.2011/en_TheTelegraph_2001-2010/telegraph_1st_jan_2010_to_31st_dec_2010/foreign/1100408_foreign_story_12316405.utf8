	Moscow, April 7: Large-scale protests appeared to overthrow the government of Kyrgyzstan today and its President fled before an outbreak of mayhem and violence in the capital Bishkek and elsewhere in the country.              
	While the Opposition declared that it was forming its own government, President Kurmanbek Bakiyev left Bishkek in the presidential plane. However, it was not clear whether he was leaving the country or heading to another Kyrgyz city.         
	Earlier in the day, the police used live ammunition, tear gas and stun grenades against a crowd of thousands that massed in front of the presidential office in Bishkek, according to witness accounts.        
	Dinara Saginbayeva, a Kyrgyz health official, said in a telephone interview that at least 41 people had been killed, but it could end up being much more. She said more than 350 people had been wounded in Bishkek alone, with scores of others wounded in protests around the country.        
	Opposition leaders said the toll could be as high as 100 people. The upheaval raised questions about the future of an important American air base that operates in Kyrgyzstan in support of the Nato mission in nearby Afghanistan.

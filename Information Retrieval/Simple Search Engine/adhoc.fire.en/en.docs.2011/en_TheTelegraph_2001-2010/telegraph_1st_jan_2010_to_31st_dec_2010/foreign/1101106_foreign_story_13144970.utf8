	Nov. 5: The controversial Chinese artist Ai Wei Wei, whose Sunflower Seeds is currently exhibiting at the Tate Modern, has been put under house arrest after trying to hold a party to protest at the demolition of his new art studio.        
	Ai, who had planned to travel to Shanghai today with his entourage to host the wake, said that police officers had come to his studio in Beijing to inform him that he was no longer allowed to go.        
	I am under house arrest, Ai told The Daily Telegraph by telephone. They asked me not to go and to tell everyone the party was off, but I said I couldnt do that and theyd have to stop me. So now they talked their superiors and came back to say Im officially under house arrest.        
	As many as a thousand people were expected at the party at Ais 750,000 art studio in Shanghai which was served with a demolition notice earlier this week.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	April 10: Lech Kaczynski, the President of Poland, who died in western Russia, was elected President in 2005 as his twin brother, Jaroslaw, was swept into power as leader of the nationalist-conservative Law and Justice government.         
	This unique constellation of power, led by identical twins, often put Poland on a collision course with its EU partners and Russia.        
	As soon as he took office in the presidential headquarters in the centre of Warsaw, Kaczynski, 60, forged very close relations with Ukraine and Georgia, determined to bring them closer to Nato and eventually have them admitted to the American-led military organisation.        
	But his staunch defence of these two countries often upset leading members of the EU, especially Germany, which was concerned that an expanded Nato would threaten Russia, or lead to new East-West tensions.        
	Kaczynski, however, believed passionately that a strong Nato would prevent Russia from reasserting its influence over eastern and central Europe. When Poland joined Nato in 1999, becoming with Hungary and the Czech Republic part of the first bloc of former communist countries to join the alliance, the move increased Polands sense of security.        
	It was obvious to us that this was the only tough security structure there was in the world and that the membership of Nato would only mean benefits for Poland, Kaczynski told the International Herald Tribune in an interview.        
	But Kaczynski said that did not mean that Russias leaders had abandoned their ideas to regain influence, like using natural resources, natural gas as a weapon and trying to influence politicians. Indeed, back in the early 1990s, my impression was that Polands entry into Nato would finally resolve those questions. And here I must admit I was wrong.        
	Kaczynskis deeply ingrained suspicion of Russia, and of Germanys close relationship with it, often created tensions among Warsaw, Berlin and Moscow. He lobbied hard for the US to deploy part of its controversial anti-ballistic missile shield in Poland, believing it would add to Polands security vis--vis Russia. Such plans, supported by President George W. Bush, were scaled back by President Obama.        
	Kaczynski was also much more comfortable dealing with the US than the EU, which Poland joined in 2004. Indeed, he was regarded as a sceptic of the union.        
	The deaths were not expected to directly affect the functioning of the Polish government: Polands President is commander-in-chief of its armed forces but the positions domestic duties are chiefly symbolic.

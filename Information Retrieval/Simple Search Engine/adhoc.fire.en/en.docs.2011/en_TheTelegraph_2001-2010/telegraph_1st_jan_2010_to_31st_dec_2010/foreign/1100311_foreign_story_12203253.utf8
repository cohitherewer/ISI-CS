	Islamabad, March 10 (Reuters): The Pakistan Prime Minister has extended the term of the ISI chief by a year in a move expected to preserve continuity in the fight against Islamist militancy.        
	Lieutenant General Ahmad Shuja Pasha, the ISI director general, was supposed to retire this month but will remain in office for another year, Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilanis office said in a statement.        
	Pasha, a former head of military operations, was appointed head of the ISI in September 2008, months after US officials questioned the reliability of the spy agency in the campaign against Islamist militancy. The ISI oversees efforts in combating militants.

	Sukku (Pakistan), Aug. 11 (Reuters): The UN appealed today for $460 million in aid for flood-hit Pakistan, warning of a second wave of death among sick, hungry survivors unless help arrived quickly.        
	Roiling floods triggered by unusually heavy monsoon rain have scoured Pakistans Indus river basin, killing more than 1,600 people, forcing 2 million from their homes and disrupting the lives of about 14 million people, or 8 per cent of the population.        
	Aid agencies have complained of a lacklustre donor response to the crisis while a UN spokesman said help was needed soon.        
	If we do not respond soon enough to the urgent needs of the population, if we do not provide life-saving assistance as soon as is necessary, there may be a second wave of death caused by diseases and food shortages, said UN humanitarian operations the spokesman Maurizio Giuliano.        
	Giuliano said he was optimistic aid would arrive and $150 million had already been pledged. The UN World Food Programme needs $150 million to feed six million people for three months.        
	Hundreds of roads and bridges have been destroyed from northern mountains to the plains of the southern province of Sindh, where the waters have not yet crested, meaning the situation could get worse.        
	Countless villages and farms have been inundated, crops destroyed and livestock lost. In some places, families are huddled on tiny patches of water-logged land with their animals surrounded by an inland sea.        
	On the outskirts of the city of Sukkur, in Sindh, hundreds of people waited for food supplies at a tent camp. I cant find my 12-year-old son. Ive been to my village with soldiers on a boat but there was no sign of him, said farmer Mohammad Hassan.        
	Im so worried. I dont know what to do. Should I take care my family here or go and look for my son? Hassan, a father of 10, told Reuters before rushing into a throng jostling around a truck that arrived with rations of cooked rice.        
	The IMF has warned of major economic harm and the finance ministry said the country would miss this years 4.5 per cent gross domestic product growth target though it was not clear by how much.

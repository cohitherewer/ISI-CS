	Julia pounds    
	 London, July 16 (PTI): Actress Julia Roberts piled on extra pounds while shooting for her latest film Eat, Pray, Love in Italy as she refused to spit out food when the director called cut.      
	Based on the memoirs of author Elizabeth Gilbert, Roberts, 42, plays a woman who goes on a year-long cultural and spiritual trip to India, Italy and Bali and admits she could not resist tucking in to hearty plates of pizza and pasta during scenes shot in Rome.      
	Ive always been a friend of food. I probably put on about seven pounds in Rome when we were shooting. I ate a lot of pizzas in Naples. It was just great. But it was hard on take 10 on a giant plate of pasta, Roberts said.      
	 It is a challenge and I love a good meal. Someone suggested I had a spit bucket but I cant do that because it makes me gag. It just grosses me out, she added.

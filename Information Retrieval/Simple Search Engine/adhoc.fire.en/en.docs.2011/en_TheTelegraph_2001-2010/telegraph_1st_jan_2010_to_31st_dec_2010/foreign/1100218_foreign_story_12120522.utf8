	Studio sale    
	 London, Feb. 17 (PTI): Former Beatle Paul McCartney hopes the Abbey Road recording studio can be saved after it was put up for sale by record label giant EMI.       
	The studio in northwest London became synonymous with the Beatles with the band even naming their 1969 album after the building. The records cover featured the Beatles crossing the road outside.       
	Bosses at EMI, who own the studios, have decided to try and recoup money lost in recent years by selling the property.       
	There are a few people who have been associated with the studio for a long time who were talking about mounting some bid to save it. I sympathise with them, McCartney said.

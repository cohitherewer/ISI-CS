The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cyberworm aimed at high-profile Iran targets

	Sept. 23: Security experts have identified malicious software, thought to be aimed at nuclear power stations and water plants in Iran.        
	The complexity of the Stuxnet worm has led some experts to speculate that it could be an act of cyber terrorism, a virus written and sanctioned by one country with the aim of impacting the infrastructure of another. Stuxnet can be used to reprogramme software to force a computer to carry out different commands. Some experts believe the worm was targeted at high value infrastructure in Iran.        
	The fact that we see so many more infections in Iran than anywhere else in the world makes us think this threat was targeted at Iran and that there was something in Iran that was of very, very high value to whoever wrote it, Liam Murchu, an expert at Symantec, told the BBC.        
	The Stuxnet worm first came to light in June, and has been monitored by experts ever since. It is transferred between machines by a USB memory stick, which means that even computers that are not connected to the Internet are still susceptible to it.

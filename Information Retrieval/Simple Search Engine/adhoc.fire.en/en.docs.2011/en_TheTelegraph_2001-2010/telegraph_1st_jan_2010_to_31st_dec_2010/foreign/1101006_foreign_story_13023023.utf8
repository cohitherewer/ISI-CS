	Los Angeles, Oct. 5 (PTI): Actor Bruce Willis paid truibute to his muse, none other than pop star Lady Gaga, by wearing a toupee made of beef for a TV appearance.        
	Willis, who has been sporting a bald pate for years, wore the bright red hairpiece for an appearance on The David Letterman Show.        
	The Die Hard actor said that the headgear was made from 100 per cent pure beef.        
	This is all natural. Its a meat hairpiece inspired by that crazy lady...Lady Gaga!, said Willis on the show.        
	Let me tell you, this took hours to get ready. Its 100 per cent ground beef sirloin. Top shelf, organic. Showering? Not a problem. I took a shower a couple of hours ago... lather, rinse, repeat. Tenderise, he joked.        
	Not stopping at this, the star added salt and pepper to flavour the meat on the toupee before inviting Letterman to take a spoonful, which he did and spat out promptly.        
	After a hearty laugh from the studio audience, Willis took the hairpiece off and threw it on the floor as he carried on with the interview.        
	Music sensation Lady Gaga drew everyones attention in September by wearing a controversial ensemble made out of meat to the MTV Video Music Awards.

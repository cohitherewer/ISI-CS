	Los Angeles, Dec. 27: A message in a bottle sent to a Confederate general during the Siege of Vicksburg, one of the key turning points of the American Civil War, has finally been deciphered after 147 years.         
	The glass vial stopped with a cork contained a coded missive to Lt Gen. John C. Pemberton, who was besieged in the Mississippi city by Union forces led by Ulysses S Grant.         
	After nearly six weeks, people in Vicksburg had resorted to eating cats, dogs and leather, and making soup from wallpaper paste.         
	The encrypted, six line message was dated July 4, 1863, the date of Pembertons surrender, and would have offered no hope to him. It said: You can expect no help from this side of the river. The source of the message is thought to have been Maj. Gen. John G. Walker, of the Texas Division.         
	The bottle also contained a bullet, which was thought to have been to weigh it down if the messenger was caught and had to throw it in a river.         
	It had been kept in the museum since 1896 before being opened. The message initially appeared to be a random collection of letters but was deciphered after several weeks by David Gaddy, a retired CIA code breaker. It had been drawn up using the Vigenere cipher.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Europe travel delays ease
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Europe travel delays ease
          SARAH LYALL                          Planes prepare for departure at Heathrow airport on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	London, Dec. 22: Things were looking up today at delay-plagued Heathrow airport, where some 70 per cent of scheduled flights were operating following days of weather-related chaos. Even then, no one was allowed to enter the airport without a ticket on a confirmed flight, and hundreds of people were left outside in the cold.         
	A spokesman for BAA, which owns and operates the airport, said that he hoped to be able to return to a normal schedule tomorrow in order to get people back home for Christmas.         
	Other transportation hubs around Europe similarly took advantage of a brief respite in the bad weather that has descended on the region this month to try to clear huge backlogs of passengers stranded by snow and ice.         
	But airport officials warned that there is more snow to come, and that it may be some time before they can restore full service or even get all their airplanes where they ought to be. Every day that service is curtailed means the number of thwarted passengers grows.         
	 Eurostar, which also suffered massive disruptions from the freezing weather, was operating most of its services, subject to delays, today. But national train lines around Britain were not doing so well, delaying and cancelling services up and down the east coast and into Scotland.         
	Western European transportation has been near chaos since Saturday, setting back holiday voyagers in the midst of the years busiest travel week.         
	In France, the possibility of another round of bad weather threatened to thwart the authorities attempts to restore normal service. Mt-France, the French weather service, issued a winter storm advisory, saying a snowstorm would begin hitting northern France this evening.         
	Its British counterpart, the Met Office, issued severe weather warnings and said that ice and snow was likely to develop in the north and move south.

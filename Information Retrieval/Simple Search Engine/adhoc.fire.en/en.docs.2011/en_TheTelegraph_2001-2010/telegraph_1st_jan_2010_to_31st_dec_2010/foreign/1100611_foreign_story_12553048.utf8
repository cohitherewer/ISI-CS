The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Empire State Building turns off Mother lights
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Empire State Building turns off Mother lights
                                  Mother Teresa and the Empire State Building in New York				                           
	New York, June 10 (AP): When the Empire State Building lights up, reaching 102 stories into the Manhattan sky, people lift their eyes and guess what that nights colours might mean  a holiday, a charitable cause, maybe a New York Yankees win or a birthday.        
	But sometimes, colour turns to controversy.        
	Tens of thousands of people are in an uproar about the building owners refusal to light New York citys tallest skyscraper in blue and white to honour Mother Teresa in August on what would be her 100th birthday.        
	The Empire State Building celebrates many cultures and causes in the world community with iconic lightings, and has a tradition of lightings for the religious holidays of Easter, Id-ul-Fitr, Hanukkah, and Christmas, owner Anthony E.Malkin said in a statement yesterday.        
	But the real estate mogul said the building has a specific policy against any other lighting for religious figures or requests by religions and religious organisations.         
	The lay advocacy group Catholic League, which requested the lights for Mother Teresa, countered that individual religious figures have, in fact, been posthumously honoured at the Empire State Building: Cardinal John Connor in 2000, with the red and white colours of his position; Pope John Paul II in 2005, with the tower lights symbolically extinguished; and famed Baptist preacher Martin Luther King Jr. with red, black and green.        
	An email sent to Malkin spokesman Daniel Hernandez Lyon asking about religious figures being honoured was not answered yesterday.        
	The League first asked for the lights in February and was denied.        
	Anyone can apply to have the building illuminated for what is dear to them. But the privately owned landmark considers selection a privilege, not an entitlement, according to the website with the application form.        
	Applications are evaluated by the Empire State Building Co., which says online that decisions are made at the sole discretion of the ownership and management.        
	More than 40,000 people have signed a petition in support of the special lights for Mother Teresa.        
	Yesterday afternoon, New York City Council members voiced their disagreement with what they see as a snub of the ethnic Albanian nun who worked for the poor and the sick while living in Calcutta. She died in 1997 and was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church.        
	I just think its a really wrong-headed decision that (Malkin) has made, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said. I dont think this is about religion, Quinn said. Mother Teresa was a nun, obviously, but she was much more than that; she was a Nobel Prize winner ... who inspired people of all religions.        
	Quinn was backed by City Councilman Peter Vallone Jr, who said the only person who could forgive the Empire State Building for this boneheaded decision would be Mother Teresa.

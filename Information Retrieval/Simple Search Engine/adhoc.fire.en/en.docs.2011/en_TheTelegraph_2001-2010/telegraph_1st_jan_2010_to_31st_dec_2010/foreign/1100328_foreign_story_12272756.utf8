	Paris, March 27 (Reuters): Catholic churches in Europe rallied behind Pope Benedict yesterday, rejecting claims he had covered up child sex abuse by priests and praising him as a leader determined to combat scandals challenging the Church.        
	Frances bishops conference, the archbishop of London and the Munich archdiocese that Benedict once headed all rejected allegations from the media a day after the Vatican angrily accused its critics of an ignoble attempt to smear him.        
	Also yesterday, Bishop Adrianus van Luyn, head of the Dutch bishops conference, admitted he knew three decades ago about abuse cases there revealed last month. More than 1,100 people have since reported claims to an abuse hotline.        
	In Rome, an influential order of priests, whose late founder Rev. Marcial Maciel was found to be a molester and had fathered at least one child, apologised to abuse victims.        
	Very Holy Father ... we send you a cordial message of support in this difficult period our Church is going through, the French bishops said in a statement that referred to a campaign to attack your person and your service to the Church. Archbishop Vincent Nichols said Benedict made important changes in Church law to fight child abuse when he was the Vaticans top doctrinal official.

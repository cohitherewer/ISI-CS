	Avatar peak    
	 Beijing, Jan. 25 (Reuters): A craggy peak in a scenic part of southern China has been renamed after floating mountains featured in Hollywood blockbuster Avatar.      
	The Southern Sky Column in Zhangjiajie in southern Hunan province formally had its name changed to Avatar Hallelujah Mountain in a ceremony today, according to the Zhangjiajie governments official website (www.zjj.gov.cn).      
	The government said the floating Hallelujah Mountains in the movie were inspired by the Southern Sky Column as a Hollywood photographer spent time shooting there in 2008.      
	Many pictures he took then become prototypes for various elements in the Avatar movie, including the Hallelujah Mountains, quot; the website said.      
	Avatar has so far made around $80 million in China, and has become the countrys most popular film ever.

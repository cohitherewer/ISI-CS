                              Bloody stone                            
	Amsterdam, July 1 (Reuters): British supermodel Naomi Campbell can be called to give evidence over a blood diamond prosecutors say she was given by former Liberian President Charles Taylor, the Sierra Leone war crimes court has ruled.        
	Prosecutors at the Special Court for Sierra Leone sought in May to call Campbell, who has so far refused to testify, saying she can provide material evidence to rebut Taylors claims that he never possessed rough diamonds.        
	In a ruling, the court directed the prosecution to call testimony from Campbell, modelling agent Carole White and US actress Mia Farrow and indicated that subpoenas for them to appear would be approved.        
	The court said the three should appear as soon as possible, before the close of the defences case. This was expected to be in August or September.        
	In January, prosecutors said that during a visit to South Africa in 1997 Taylor gave Campbell a large rough cut diamond following a dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela. Prosecutors say White heard Taylor say he was going to give Campbell some diamonds and was there when Campbell received them, while Farrow attended the reception where Campbell met Taylor.

          ROB CRILLY                          Trial threat                                  
	Lahore, April 28: Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf is plotting a return from exile in London to launch a new political party despite threats that he will face a criminal trial.        
	Musharraf seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 and stood down as President after losing elections nine years later.        
	His planned return will draw comparisons to the return of Benazir Bhutto, the countrys former Prime Minister who ended her own self-imposed exile in 2008 only to be killed in a suicide attack weeks later as she left a rally in Rawalpindi.        
	A close aide in Islamabad said supporters had begun the process of registering a new political party, the All Pakistan Muslim League.        
	Mohammad Ali Saif, a lawyer who served as a minister under the military ruler, said he would act as leader of the party until Musharraf, 67, was ready to return.        
	When he decides to come back he will come back. We are already working on his behalf. He left voluntarily so he can come back any time he chooses, said Saif.        
	The government of Asif Ali Zardari, Bhuttos widower, says it wants to question the former dictator over her death. Pakistan police have also registered a case against Musharraf that could see him tried for detaining judges in 2007 as he tried to cling to power.

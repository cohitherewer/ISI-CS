The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Al Qaida suspects held in Norway 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Al Qaida suspects held in Norway 
                            
	Oslo, July 8 (Reuters): Norwegian police have arrested three men suspected of planning attacks and having links to al Qaida as well as to people under investigation in the US and Britain.        
	The arrests were brought forward by fears that details of the investigation would appear in public, police said.        
	We were afraid evidence would be destroyed, because we knew that an international media organisation was about to publish details of the case. That made it urgent to make the arrests, said Janne Kristiansen, head of the Police Security Service.        
	The police chief earlier told a news conference the three were arrested for planning a terrorist strike.        
	We believe this group has had links to people abroad who can be linked to al Qaida, and to people who are involved in investigations in other countries, among others the United States and Britain, she said.        
	Norwegian police said two of the men were arrested in the Oslo region while a third one was arrested in Germany in co-operation with German police.

	Dec. 23: Skype has apologised after an outage prevented millions of people from using the popular Internet phone service.         
	 Users across the world were unable to use the service for several hours yesterday in what was the companys first major breakdown since 2007.         
	Tony Bates, Skypes chief executive officer, said the outage had stopped approximately 10 million calls  half the normal call volume for that time of day. He told BBC News: We take outages like this really seriously and apologise for the inconvenience users are having.         
	Right now it looks like clients are coming on and offline and sometimes they are crashing in the middle of calls. We are deep in the middle of investigating the cause of the problem and have teams working hard to remedy the situation. He did not rule out the possibility that Skype had been the victim of a cyber attack and said the company was exploring all possibilities.         
	In a blog post, Skype explained that computers known as supernodes had been taken offline by an unspecified problem affecting some versions of Skype. Under normal circumstances, there are a large number of supernodes available, Skype said. Our engineers are creating new mega-supernodes as fast as they can. This may take a few hours, and we sincerely apologise for the disruption to your conversations, Skype said. Some features, like group video calling, may take longer to return to normal. Skype, which was founded in 2003, bypasses the standard telephone network by channelling voice, video and text conversations over the Internet.

	Twitter awful    
	 Los Angeles, Feb. 15 (PTI): British actress Emily Blunt has vowed never to join the celebrity social networking craze on Twitter because she refuses to bore her fans with useless updates about her everyday life.       
	The Devil Wears Prada star cant understand why anyone would want to know about her daily routine and insists the micro-blogging site is simply awful.      
	Twitter (is) literally the most awful thing. Its mind-numbingly boring to hear about peoples adventures at the petrol station. I couldnt care less, she said.    
	007 on hold    
	 London (PTI): Actor Daniel Craig has reportedly put the filming of his next James Bond movie, Bond 23, on hold as he has to finish filming Dream House. Director Sam Mendes was signed on, but Craigs commitment to House has forced the producers to stop the shooting.

          NICHOLAS WADE                          Policemen on guard in front of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet. (Reuters)                                  
	July 2: Tibetans live at altitudes of 13,000 feet, breathing air that has 40 per cent less oxygen than is available at sea level, yet suffer very little mountain sickness.         
	The reason, according to a team of biologists in China, is human evolution, in what may be the most recent and fastest instance detected so far.        
	Comparing the genomes of Tibetans and Han Chinese, the majority ethnic group in China, the biologists found that at least 30 genes had undergone evolutionary change in the Tibetans as they adapted to life on the high plateau. Tibetans and Han Chinese split apart as recently as 3,000 years ago, say the biologists, a group at the Beijing Genomics Institute led by Xin Yi and Jian Wang. The report appears in todays issue of Science.        
	If confirmed, this would be the most recent known example of human evolutionary change. Until now, the most recent such change was the spread of lactose tolerance  the ability to digest milk in adulthood  among northern Europeans about 7,500 years ago.         
	But archaeologists say that the Tibetan plateau was inhabited much earlier than 3,000 years ago and that the geneticists date is incorrect.        
	When lowlanders try to live at high altitudes, their blood thickens as the body tries to counteract the low oxygen levels by churning out more red blood cells. This overproduction of red blood cells leads to chronic mountain sickness and to lesser fertility  Han Chinese living in Tibet have three times the infant mortality of Tibetans.        
	The Beijing team analysed the 3 per cent of the human genome in which known genes lie in 50 Tibetans from two villages at an altitude of 14,000 feet and in 40 Han Chinese from Beijing, which is 160 feet above sea level. Many genes exist in a population in alternative versions.         
	The biologists found about 30 genes in which a version rare among the Han had become common among the Tibetans. The most striking instance was a version of a gene possessed by 9 per cent of Han but 87 per cent of Tibetans.        
	Such an enormous difference indicates that the version typical among Tibetans is being strongly favoured by natural selection. In other words, its owners are evidently leaving more children than those with different versions of the gene.        
	The gene in question is known as hypoxia-inducible factor 2-alpha, or HIF2a, and the Tibetans with the favoured version have fewer red blood cells and hence less haemoglobin in their blood.        
	The finding explains why Tibetans do not get mountain sickness but raises the question of how they compensate for the lack of oxygen if not by making extra red blood cells.        
	Two other studies of Tibetans adaptation to high altitude have also identified this gene as a target of selection. A team led by Tatum S. Simonson of the University of Utah and RiLi Ge of Qinghai University in China scanned the genomes of 31 Tibetans and reported in Science in May that HIF2a and other genes involved in red blood cell production bore the stamp of natural selection.        
	Independently, a group led by Cynthia M. Beall, an anthropologist at Case Western Reserve University, and Yong-Tang Zheng of the Kunming Institute of Zoology in China has detected a genetic change in the same gene in Tibetans and found that it correlated with having less haemoglobin in the blood. Their report was published in the June 22 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.        
	Human adaptation to high altitude is a field of obvious interest, but another reason for the appearance of three studies on the same subject in matter of a few weeks may be that the technology to assess which parts of the genome are under selection has only recently become available.        
	The three new reports agree in finding the Tibetans version of the gene has been favoured by natural selection. But the Beijing Genome Institutes calculation that the Tibetan and Han populations split apart only 3,000 years ago is less likely to be accepted.

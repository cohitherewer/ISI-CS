	New York, June 10 (AP): Barack Obama slept here  and you can too, for $1,899 a month.        
	A Craigslist ad appeared today for a New York apartment where the President lived when he attended Columbia University in the early 1980s. YES, LIVE WHERE PRESIDENT OBAMA LIVED !!! the listing reads. TRUE STORY.        
	According to the listing, the third-floor walk-up near Columbias campus in the Morningside Heights neighbourhood has great light, big windows as well as new kitchen appliances.        
	Obama was in New York from 1981 to 1985, attending Columbia and then working. He lived in several apartments in Manhattan and Brooklyn during that time. According to The Bridge, a recent book about Obama by New Yorker editor David Remnick, the West 109th Street apartment was a dump.

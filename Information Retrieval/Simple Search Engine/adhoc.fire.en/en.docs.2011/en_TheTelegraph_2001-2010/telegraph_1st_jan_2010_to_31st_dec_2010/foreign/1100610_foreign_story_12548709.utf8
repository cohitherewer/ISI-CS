	Islamabad, June 9 (Reuters): Suspected Taliban gunmen in Pakistan set fire to more than 50 trucks carrying supplies for western forces in Afghanistan, killing at least seven people in the first such attack near the capital, police said today.        
	The Taliban have previously attacked trucks carrying supplies for US-led foreign forces in Pakistans volatile northwest and southwest bordering Afghanistan, but this raid, less than 30 minutes drive from Islamabad late yesterday, was unprecedented.        
	At least 10 gunmen arrived on motorbikes and small pickup trucks at a depot near Tarnol village, killing drivers and workers. The militants escaped, leaving the shells of supply trucks in flames.        
	Seven people were killed and more than 50 trucks were set on fire, police official Ghulam Mustafa said. The trucks were supposed to carry fuel, food and other supplies to Afghanistan. They do not usually carry arms. The assault underscores growing insecurity in Pakistan over the Talibans wave of violence.

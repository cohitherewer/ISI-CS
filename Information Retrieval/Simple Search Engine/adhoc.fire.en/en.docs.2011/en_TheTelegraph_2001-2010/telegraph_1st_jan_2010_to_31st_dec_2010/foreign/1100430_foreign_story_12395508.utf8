The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Man stabs 28 children in China
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Man stabs 28 children in China
                            
	Beijing, April 29 (Reuters): A knife-wielding man injured 28 children, two teachers and a security guard in a kindergarten in eastern China, state media reported today, the fourth such stabbing case in recent weeks.        
	Xu Yuyuan, 47, an unemployed local man, broke into a classroom in Taixing city of eastern Jiangsu province this morning, attacking the children with a 20cm long knife, the official Xinhua news agency said. The injured children were all about four years old, and five are in critical condition, it added.        
	Xu has been jobless since he was fired from a local insurance company in 2001, and then took part in pyramid selling schemes, Xinhua added.        
	The attack is the fourth reported school stabbing in China in recent weeks, and the rash of violence has prompted public calls for more measures to protect students in a country where many couples only have one child.

	Sarobi (Afghanistan), Feb. 8: Even in a nation beset by war and suicide bombings, you would be hard-pressed to find anything as reliably terrifying as the national highway through the Kabul Gorge.         
	The 40-mile stretch, a breathtaking chasm of mountains and cliffs between Kabul and Jalalabad, claims so many lives so regularly that most people stopped counting long ago. Cars flip and flatten. Trucks soar to the valley floor. Buses play chicken; buses collide.         
	The mayhem unfolds on one of the most bewitching stretches of scenery on earth. The gorge, in some places no more than a few hundred yards wide, is framed by vertical rock cliffs that soar more than 2,000 feet above the Kabul River. Most people die, and most cars crash, while zooming around one of the impossible turns that offer impossible views of the crevasses.         
	Indeed, driving on the Kabul Gorge seems a uniquely Afghan experience, a complicated dance of beauty and death.         
	I sit right here and watch people crash all day long, said Mohammed Nabi, who fries fresh fish in stall along the road. The course of history has proved that the Afghan people are bullies. This is why we cannot drive safely.         
	Last week, 13 accidents unfolded on the road in a mere two hours, all of them catastrophic, nearly all of them fatal. At one scene, a bloodied family grieved for their kin trapped in a flattened car. At another, a minibus lay crushed beneath the hulk of a jackknifed truck. At still another, the bottom of a ravine was filled with a cars twisted remains.        
	And yet even as those accidents spread themselves across the roadway, the cars sailed heedlessly past. Taxis and buses weaved and passed one another at bone-chilling speeds, with only millimetres separating them from catastrophe.         
	The fighting with the Taliban lasts only for a day or two, but the crashes are every day, said Juma Gul, who owns a shop in Sarobi that looks directly out onto the highway. Its a kind of theatre. Sometimes, a car will fly by in the air.         
	The lethality of the roadway stems from the unique mix of geography, the road itself and the drivers disregard for the laws of physics.         
	The two-lane highway is barely wide enough for two cars to pass. On the inside lane, less than a yard outside your window, stands a wall of treeless rock that climbs upward in a nearly perpendicular line. A foot-high ledge guards the outside lane, behind which lies a valley floor as far as 1,000 feet down.         
	For the drivers, that means there is virtually no margin for error. The only note of caution is provided by children, who live in the impoverished villages nearby. Often as young as 4 or 5, they stand bedraggled at the bends, using flattened green bottles as flags, waving the drivers through when the way is clear.         
	Under the circumstances, you might imagine that drivers in the Kabul Gorge would proceed slowly. In fact, for most of history, they did.        
	Over the centuries, countless invading forces passed through or near the gorge on their way to the Khyber Pass. Among them were a group of 17,000 British troops and civilians, who were massacred as they beat a retreat from Kabul at the end of the first Anglo-Afghan War in 1842.         
	The Kabul-to-Jalalabad road was paved for the first time by the West German government in 1960. In the 1980s, it was almost entirely obliterated during the insurrection against the Soviet invasion. In the decade that followed, when the Taliban fought to control the country, the road was a blasted moonscape.         
	It was a tough road, and it had its own dangers, but speed was not among them. That changed in 2006, when a European Union-backed project finally smoothed the road all the way through. Now Afghans could finally drive as fast as they wanted.

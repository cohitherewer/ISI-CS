The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Zardari returns to fury
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Zardari returns to fury

	Sukkur (Pakistan), Aug. 10 (Reuters): President Asif Ali Zardari returned home today from official foreign visits to a chorus of criticism over his governments response to the countrys worst flooding in 80 years.        
	The floods, triggered by unusually heavy monsoon rain over the upper Indus river basin that started nearly two weeks ago, have ploughed a swathe of destruction more than 1,000km long from northern Pakistan to the south, killing more than 1,600 people.         
	Poor weather has grounded relief helicopters and fresh rains have compounded the misery of more than 13 million people  about 8 per cent of the population  whose lives have been disrupted by the floods, including two million homeless. Zardari enraged his critics by going ahead with state visits to Britain and France as the catastrophe was unfolding.        
	The military has taken the lead in relief efforts while the government is under fire for perceived neglect. But while the crisis has reinforced the faith Pakistanis have in the ability of their military, analysts say the armed forces would not try to take over the country, as they have vowed to stay out of politics and are busy fighting militants.         
	A government official said he was expected to visit the flood-hit areas within days, but for many Pakistanis, his trip is too little, too late. All that I can say about Zardari is that our houses are collapsing and his government is not even bothered, said Daraz Gul, a salesman.

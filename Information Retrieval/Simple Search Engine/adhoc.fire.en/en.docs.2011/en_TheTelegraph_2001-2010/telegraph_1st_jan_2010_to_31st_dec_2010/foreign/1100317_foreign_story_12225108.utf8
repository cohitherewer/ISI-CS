                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fonseka trial begins
                            
	Colombo, March 16 (Reuters): Former Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka appeared before a military court today on charges of engaging in politics while in uniform, officials said, as hundreds of his supporters protested near the capital.        
	The court martial held at the navy headquarters in Colombo was adjourned until next month after lawyers for the army commander challenged the legitimacy of the court and opposed the choice of the members of the tribunal.        
	Fonseka, who lost a presidential election to incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa, was arrested last month following allegations that he was plotting a coup against the government. He has denied the allegations.

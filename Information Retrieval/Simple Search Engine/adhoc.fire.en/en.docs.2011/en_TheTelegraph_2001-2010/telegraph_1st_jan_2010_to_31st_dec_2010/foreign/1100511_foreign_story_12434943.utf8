The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Man held over wires in shoes
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Man held over wires in shoes
                            
	Karachi, May 10 (Reuters): A Pakistani man arrested at Karachi airport with batteries and electrical circuits in his shoes was most likely wearing therapy shoes and his detention could be a false alarm, officials said today.        
	The man, identified as Faiz Mohammad, 30, was about to board a Thai Airways flight to Muscat late yesterday when the devices were found during a routine security check.        
	He was not carrying any explosives nor were any other suspicious items found on him or in his luggage.        
	Senior police investigator Niaz Khoso said the suspect had told the police that the shoes were used for massage purposes. We have seen such shoes for the first time and have sent them for analysis to verify his claims, Khoso said.        
	To be honest, we did not know that such shoes are available in the market but we are checking. We have not released him yet but if if he is found innocent, we will let him go for sure, he said. Mohammad was wearing the Good Vibrations shoes, described on a website as designed to massage away the aches and pains.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Larry King to end talk show as ratings plunge
          GARY LEVIN                          File picture of Larry King hosting his TV show. (AP)                                  
	June 30: CNNs Larry King yesterday said that its time to hang up my nightly suspenders after hosting a talk show for 25 years.        
	After weeks of speculation triggered by the 25th anniversary of the show and sharply declining ratings, Kings move  on his own terms, CNN says  ends his storied run on the struggling news networks signature show this autumn.        
	At the top of yesterdays broadcast, King, 76, told viewers he talked to the guys here at CNN, and I told them I would like to end Larry King Live, the nightly show, this autumn and CNN has graciously accepted, giving me more time for my wife, and I to get to the kids Little League games. But he promised regular news specials.        
	CNN chief Jonathan Klein credits King with putting cable on the map as a star interviewer, though the host never really acted like the star. He showed the power of individual personality in cable, and on nascent CNN he made it safe for viewers to venture into channels they had never explored before.        
	In 53 years on TV and radio, King has conducted about 50,000 interviews Among them: Paul McCartney, Bette Davis, Martin Luther King Jr, Eleanor Roosevelt, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando, Madonna and Malcolm X.        
	Klein is mum on plans for his replacement but denies a report by The Daily Telegraph of a deal with Piers Morgan, a former British talk-show host.         
	Piers is a very talented guy, but weve not negotiated with him. Theres a number of talented people who could do an excellent job, but we wanted to wait to hatch our plans until Larry decided what he wants to do.        
	Kings exit will wait until after a show with former New York governor Eliot Spitzer launches in September in the hour before Kings show.        
	Amid a downturn in CNNs ratings  the network ranks third in prime time behind Fox News and MSNBC  Kings ratings dropped about 40 per cent in the past year. But Klein says ratings were not a factor. A recent ratings tick after 25 years of TV history did not fall into anyones decision, least of all Larrys.        
	Kings personal life has made news lately: His seventh wife, Shawn, was hospitalised after an apparent drug overdose in late May; the couple later filed for divorce but have since reconciled. Im tired of the nightly grind, King told the AP yesterday. I do want to do other things, but I want to stay at CNN in some way. (Theres) great mixed emotions.        
	He said he began thinking about stepping down after his 25th anniversary week, during which he interviewed basketball star LeBron James, Bill Gates, President Obama and Lady Gaga  an apt example of the mix that he always sought on his show. I said: I cant top this.        
	He told his staff in a conference call yesterday, which he described as one of the saddest 10 minutes of my life.        
	King began his career as a journalist and radio broadcaster in Florida before being wooed by CNN to host the nightly TV talk show in 1985.        
	He said his first interview was then-New York Governor Mario Cuomo. One of his biggest scoops was in 1992, when Texas billionaire Ross Perot came on the show to announce a presidential run.

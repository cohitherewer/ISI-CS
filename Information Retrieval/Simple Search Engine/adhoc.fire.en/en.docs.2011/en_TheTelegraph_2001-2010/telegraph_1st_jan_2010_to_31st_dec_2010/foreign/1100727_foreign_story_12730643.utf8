The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Khmer jail warden sentenced

          SETH MYDANS                          Kaing Guek Eav in Phnom Penh. (AFP)                                  
	Phnom Penh (Cambodia), July 26: A UN-backed tribunal today found a 67-year-old former prison warden of the Khmer Rouge guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes for overseeing the torture and killing of more than 14,000 prisoners.         
	He was the first major figure to be tried in the murderous regime since it was toppled 30 years ago.        
	But in a sentence that was likely to be considered shockingly lenient here, the court sentenced him to serve 19 years in prison  35 years minus 16 years for time already served. Prosecutors had sought 40 years. There is no death penalty in Cambodia.        
	The defendant, Kaing Guek Eav, commonly known as Duch, had admitted in an eight-month trial to many of the accusations against him. He oversaw a system that came to symbolise a regime responsible for the deaths of 1.7 million people from 1975 to 1979.        
	Dressed in a blue button-down shirt, sipping sometimes from a glass of water and carrying what appeared to be a Bible, he listened impassively as a judge read out the charges and verdict against him. The packed courtroom included some survivors of the prison he ran  three of whom had testified about the torture inflicted upon them.        
	The tribunal, which began work in 2006, now moves to Case Two, for which four high-ranking Khmer Rouge officials are in custody awaiting trial sometime next year. The Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998.        
	Duchs own plea was unclear. On the final day of the trial, in November, he unexpectedly asked to be set free, seeming to contradict a carefully constructed defence in which his lawyers sought to minimise his sentence through admissions of guilt.        
	I am accountable to the entire Cambodian population for the souls that perished, he said at one point. I am deeply remorseful and regret such a mind-boggling scale of death.        
	But he added: I ended up serving a criminal organisation. I could not withdraw from it. I was like a cog in a machine. I regret and humbly apologize to the dead souls.

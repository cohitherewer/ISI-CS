	Concert for dogs    
	 Sydney, June 5 (Reuters): Its a dogs life. Well, it was today when the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House came alive with the sound of high pitched music and howling dogs at the worlds first concert performed for dogs.      
	The concert was the brain child of acclaimed US music artist Laurie Anderson and her rock legend husband Lou Reed.      
	Anderson wrote the 20-minute piece Music for Dogs describing it as an inter-species social gathering on a scale never seen before in Australia.      
	It was really so fantastic. All the dogs were really grooving on the music. They really seemed to enjoy themself, Anderson said.      
	Big dogs, small dogs, dogs dressed up for the occasion and even a 15-year-old arthritic dog, whose owner pushed him in a makeshift dog wheelchair, attended the worlds first ever outdoor performance.

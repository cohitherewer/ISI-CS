          ANITA SINGH                      Howard Jacobson                          
	London, Oct. 13: He once dismissed the Man Booker Prize as an absolute abomination, but Howard Jacobson ate his words last night when he was unveiled as this years winner.         
	The writer and broadcaster won the 50,000 award for The Finkler Question despite being the 10/1 rank outsider. He won with his 11th novel and said he was truly flabbergasted. I was beginning to look like I was the novelist that never, ever won the Booker Prize, said Jacobson, 68, who refers to himself as the Jewish Jane Austen.         
	He beat favourites Tom McCarthy and Emma Donoghue.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

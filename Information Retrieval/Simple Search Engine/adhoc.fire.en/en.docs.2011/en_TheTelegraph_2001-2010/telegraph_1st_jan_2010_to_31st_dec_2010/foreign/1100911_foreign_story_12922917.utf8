The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Burning on hold
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Burning on hold
                            
	Washington, Sept. 10 (Reuters): The pastor of a small Florida church said today he did not plan to burn copies of the Quran on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks.        
	But Pastor Terry Jones appeared to leave open the possibility he could change his mind if a proposed meeting fails to take place tomorrow in New York with Muslim leaders planning to build an Islamic centre and mosque near the site of the September 11 attacks. Right now we have plans not to do it (burn the Quran), Jones said. He added that a Florida imam had promised him a meeting with the New York imam in exchange for cancelling the Quran-burning.         
	However, the New York imam said today he has no meeting planned with the Florida pastor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sexual slur on Gore 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Sexual slur on Gore 
                              Al Gore                            
	Portland, June 24 (AP): A Portland massage therapist accused former US vice-president Al Gore of unwanted sexual contact at a hotel during an October 2006 visit, but no charges were filed because of lack of evidence, law officials have said.        
	An attorney representing the woman contacted police in late 2006, said Multnomah county district attorney Michael Schrunk. He said the woman  who has not been identified  refused to be interviewed by detectives and did not want the investigation to proceed.        
	The woman, however, contacted police in January 2009 and gave a statement, saying Gore tried to have sex with her during an appointment at the upscale downtown Hotel Lucia, where Gore was reportedly registered as Mr. Stone.        
	The National Enquirer first reported the allegations on Wednesday, identifying the accuser as a 54-year-old woman.        
	Gore family spokeswoman Kalee Kreider said the former vice-president had no comment. Gore and his wife, considered a role-model couple, announced on June 1 they were separating.        
	A police report prepared in 2007 said the alleged incident occurred on October 24, 2006. Gore was in Portland to deliver a speech on climate change.        
	 The woman, according to the report, cancelled appointments with detectives on December 21 and 26 of that year. Her attorney cancelled another meeting scheduled for January 4 and said the matter would be handled civilly.        
	The case reopened in January 2009. Detectives interviewed the woman but determined there was insufficient evidence to support the allegations, Portland police said in a news release.        
	In a transcript of the interview released by police, the massage therapist said she had an appointment with Mr. Stone at 10.30pm but the hotels front desk told her he wouldnt be available until 11pm. When she knocked on the door, Al Gore opened it, and when she asked what she should call him, he replied to Call me Al.        
	 She said she was doing requested abdominal work on Gore when he started to moan and demanded she go lower.        
	 I was shocked, and I did not massage beyond what is considered a safe, non-sexual area of the abdomen, she said. He further insisted and acted angry, becoming verbally sharp and loud. I went into much deeper shock as I realised it appeared he was demanding sexual favours or sexual behaviours.        
	The woman said Gore grabbed her hand and shoved it toward his pubic area. She alleged he later tried to have sex with her and began caressing her before she squirmed out of his grasp.        
	I did not immediately call the police as I feared being made into a public spectacle and my reputation being destroyed, she said.         
	Portland police said the woman contacted detectives this month, asked for a copy of her statement and said she planned to take her case to the media.

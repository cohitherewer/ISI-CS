The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Return Razzie, Sandra told
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Return Razzie, Sandra told
          ANDREW HOUGH                          Rare honour                                  
	April 17: Sandra Bullock, the Hollywood actress, has been asked to return her worst actress Razzie Award after she accidentally walked away with the priceless original.        
	The 45 year-old actress collected the dubious honour for her romantic flop comedy All About Steve a night before winning an Academy Award.        
	She won the Best Actress Oscar for her role as a suburban mother who takes in a homeless black teen and guides him to a football career in The Blind Side.        
	 As a result of her Oscar win, she made history by becoming the first person to win an Oscar and a Razzie over the same weekend.        
	Normally the winners of the Razzie are given a cheap replica costing just $4.79 of a raspberry on top of a film reel spray-painted golden.        
	But Bullock was inadvertently given the 30-year-old original award, which are worth thousands as a rare collectors item.        
	We are ready to take the unprecedented step of asking a winner to return a Razzie, said John Wilson, the awards co-founder. As Sandra was in such a rush after winning Worst Actress she ran off with the original handmade prototype which has been present at ceremonies since the 1980s.        
	Wilson said he had not yet asked Bullock personally for the award because he wanted to respect her privacy after her husband, Jesse Jamess, alleged infidelity threw her five-year-marriage into turmoil.        
	Her husband is said to be a a broken man and is hoping that rehab and some privacy will help him recover and save his marriage.        
	Sandra has our full permission to give the Razzie to her dirt-bag of a husband, he said.        
	Shes a lovely person and it saddens me that somebody that good-hearted has been through what she has. However nothing stops All About Steve from being a stinker of movie. I wouldnt say she was the worst actress of the year though. I mean  did anyone actually see Megan Fox in Transformers 2?

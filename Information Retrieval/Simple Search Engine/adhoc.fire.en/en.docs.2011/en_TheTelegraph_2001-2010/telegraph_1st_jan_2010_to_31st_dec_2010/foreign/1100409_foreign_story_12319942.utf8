	Colombo, April 8 (Reuters): Sri Lankans voted today in an election likely to further entrench President Mahinda Rajapaksas political dominance, the first parliamentary poll since last years end of a quarter-century of war.        
	Nearly 80,000 police and soldiers guarded polling stations across the Indian Ocean island, where voters were deciding among 7,620 candidates for the 225-member parliament.        
	Election monitors reported turnout of about 30 per cent, and a handful of minor incidents of violence.        
	Rajapaksa has already parlayed last Mays victory over the Tamil Tiger separatists into a new six-year term. Now he is banking on a resurgent economy and political momentum to give his United Peoples Freedom Alliance a legislative majority.        
	The end of the electoral uncertainty is expected to bring some stability to Sri Lankas post-war landscape.

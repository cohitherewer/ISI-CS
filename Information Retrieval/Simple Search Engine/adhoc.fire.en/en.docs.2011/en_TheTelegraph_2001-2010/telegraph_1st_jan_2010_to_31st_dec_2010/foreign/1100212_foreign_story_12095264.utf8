                              Charlie Wilson                            
	Houston, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Former US Representative Charlie Wilson, the swashbuckling Texan chronicled in film for helping secure billions of dollars to fund covert US operations against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s, died yesterday of cardiac arrest. He was 76.        
	Wilson, a Democrat, served 12 consecutive terms in the House of Representatives. He had complained of chest pains yesterday and was pronounced dead when he arrived at Memorial Health System of East Texas in Lufkin, the hospital said.        
	In the 2007 movie Charlie Wilsons War, actor Tom Hanks portrayed Wilson as a boozy womaniser who found his lifes cause in helping mujahideen in Afghanistan fight and eventually repel occupying Soviet forces.        
	As a long-time member of the House Appropriations Committee, Wilson quietly helped steer billions of dollars to the Central Intelligence Agency, which distributed the funds to buy the Afghan mujahideen high-tech weapons like Stinger missiles used to shoot down Soviet helicopter gunships.

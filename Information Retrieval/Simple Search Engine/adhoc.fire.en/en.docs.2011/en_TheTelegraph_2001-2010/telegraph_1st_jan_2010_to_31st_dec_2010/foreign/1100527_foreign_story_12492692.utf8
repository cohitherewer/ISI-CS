	Suri aid for Tom    
	 Los Angeles, May 26 (PTI): Actor Tom Cruise takes career advice from his four-year-old daughter Suri by discussing his movie projects.      
	Cruise, 47, who is married to actress Katie Holmes, describes the story in his scripts to Suri and then listens to her questions because he thinks it makes him a better actor, reports Esquire magazine.      
	Ill put Suri on a swing and tell her stories when Im working on a script. Ill start with the beginning of the movie and take her through the story beat by beat. Of course, I make it age-appropriate. Shes four years old. But she asks all the right questions: Why does that happen? Those are the bad guys? Youre the good guy, right?, Cruise said.

	Frog flood    
	 Thessaloniki, Greece (AP): Greek officials say a horde of frogs has forced the closure of a key northern highway for two hours. Thessaloniki traffic police chief Giorgos Thanoglou says millions of the amphibians covered the tarmac on Wednesday near the town of Langadas, some 19km east of Thessaloniki. There was a carpet of frogs, he said. Authorities closed the highway after three car drivers skidded off the road trying to dodge the frogs.

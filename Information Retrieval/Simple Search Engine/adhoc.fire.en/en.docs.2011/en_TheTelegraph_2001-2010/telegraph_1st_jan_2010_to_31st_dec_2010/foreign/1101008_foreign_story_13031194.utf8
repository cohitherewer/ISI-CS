          ANITA SINGH                          Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath in Paris in August 1956                                  
	Oct. 7: An unseen poem by Ted Hughes, in which he recounts the tragedy of Sylvia Plaths suicide, has been published for the first time.        
	The poem provides crucial insight into one of the most controversial episodes in 20th century literary history. It is the first poem in which Hughes directly addresses Plaths death.        
	Hughes recalls his final meeting with his estranged wife two days before she killed herself, and writes of the devastating aftermath of her death.        
	What happened that night? Your final night? he asks in the opening lines of the Last Letter. And he recounts the moment that he was told of her death: Then a voice like a selected weapon Or a measured injection,        
	Coolly delivered its four words        
	Deep into my ear: Your wife is dead.        
	The 150-line poem was not included in Birthday Letters, the volume published by Hughes in 1998 and believed to be his final word on Plaths death.         
	The couple met at Cambridge University  she the daughter of New England intellectuals, he a working class boy from Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire  and their relationship was tempestuous, due to Hughess infidelity and Plaths emotional fragility.        
	By the time of their death, they were separated and Plath was living in Primrose Hill, north London, with their two young children.        
	Their last meeting, recalled in the poem, was on a Friday in February 1963. According to Hughes, Plath sent him a letter intended to arrive after news of her death. It was delivered early, and Hughes went to the house to see her.         
	Two days later, she placed her head in the oven and gassed herself, carefully taping up her childrens bedroom door to protect them and leaving milk and biscuits at their bedside. She was 30.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

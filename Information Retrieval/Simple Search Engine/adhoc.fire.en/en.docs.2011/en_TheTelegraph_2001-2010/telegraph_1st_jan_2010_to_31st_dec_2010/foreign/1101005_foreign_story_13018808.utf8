The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US teens use more condoms
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US teens use more condoms
                              Not reckless                            
	Chicago, Oct. 4 (Reuters): US teens are not as reckless as some people might think when it comes to sex, and they are much more likely to use condoms than people over 40, according to a survey released today that could help guide public health policy.        
	The study from sex researchers at Indiana University and paid for by Trojan condom maker Church amp; Dwight Co is the most comprehensive look at sex behaviours in the US in the past 20 years.        
	Some findings heartened public health officials  one in four acts of vaginal intercourse involve condom use. And among people who are single, that figure is one in three.        
	Condom use is higher among black and Hispanic Americans than among whites, and is lowest among people over 40, the nationally representative Internet survey of 5,865 Americans aged 14 to 94 found.        
	The results, presented in nine peer-reviewed studies in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, debunked stereotypes about teens being reckless when it comes to sex.        
	Only 14 per cent of 14-year-old boys reported any kind of sexual interaction with a partner in the prior three months, but almost 40 per cent of 17-year-old males did, Indiana University researcher Dr Dennis Fortenberry told a media briefing. He said many teens reach age 18 with no sexual experience, and for those who do have sex, condom use is routine.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lufthansa pilots begin walkout
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lufthansa pilots begin walkout
                            
	Feb. 22: Air travellers braced for chaos today as pilots for Lufthansa, Europes largest airline, began a four-day walkout that was expected to force the cancellation of thousands of flights.        
	The German flag carrier was operating a sharply reduced schedule that involved scrubbing roughly 800 out of 1,800 scheduled flights per day for the duration of the strike.         
	A spokeswoman for the carrier said today that the number of flights cancelled was likely to rise as some pilots that had been scheduled to work through the strike were not showing up. We have already had a few additional cancellations this morning, said the spokeswoman, Stefanie Stotz.        
	The airline said most of the cancelled flights were on domestic German routes. For European and intercontinental flights, the carrier said it was re-booking passengers whenever possible with its partners within the Star Alliance.

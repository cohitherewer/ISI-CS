	Washington, Jan. 21 (PTI): An Indian-American woman executive was today indicted by a federal grand jury in Wisconsin on charges of defrauding her company of $31 million.         
	US attorney for the eastern district of Wisconsin James Santelle announced that a grand jury sitting in a Milwaukee court returned a six-count indictment charging Sujata Sachdeva, 46, also known as Sue, with six counts of wire fraud.         
	Sachdeva is the former vice-president of finance at Koss Corporation.         
	This is one of the largest embezzlement cases ever brought in this district and demonstrates the ongoing commitment of this office and the FBI to investigate and prosecute white collar offencses, Santelle said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | German singer sorry for HIV sex
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      German singer sorry for HIV sex
                              Nadja Benaissa                            
	Darmstadt (Germany), Aug. 16 (AP): A German singer facing accusations that she infected a man with the virus that causes AIDS acknowledged in court today that she had unprotected sex despite knowing she was HIV-positive.        
	The 28-year-old Nadja Benaissa, a member of German girl band No Angels, is charged with grievous bodily harm for allegedly infecting a partner with the virus in 2004 and also faces charges of attempted bodily harm for having unprotected sex with two other men.        
	I am sorry from my heart, she said in a statement read by her lawyer to the Darmstadt administrative court. No way did I want my partner to be infected.        
	The man who claims Benaissa infected him says they had a three-month relationship at the beginning of 2004, and that he got tested after Benaissas aunt asked him in 2007 whether he was aware that the singer was HIV-positive.        
	Prosecutors say Benaissa had known she was HIV-positive since 1999.        
	Benaissa was arrested in April 2009 and kept in custody for 10 days  a move that a German AIDS awareness group criticised as disproportionate. The Deutsche AIDS-Hilfe group argued that the question of whether her partners also carried a share of the responsibility had been neglected.        
	 Benaissa joined No Angels in 2000 through the TV casting show Popstars. The group sold more than 5 million albums before breaking up in 2003.        
	Benaissa helped reform the group in 2007 with three other members. The group represented Germany in the 2008 Eurovision song contest.

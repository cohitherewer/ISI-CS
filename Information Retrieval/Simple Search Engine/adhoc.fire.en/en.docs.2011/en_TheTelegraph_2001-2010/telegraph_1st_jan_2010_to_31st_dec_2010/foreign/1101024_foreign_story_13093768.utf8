	Dhaka, Oct. 23 (PTI): Thirty people were injured in clashes between villagers and the army today over acquisition of land for a military housing scheme in Bangladeshs Naraynganj district, forcing the authorities to use helicopters to evacuate the troops.        
	Police and witnesses said several hundred villagers attacked a makeshift army camp at Rupganj sub-division to re-occupy the land the government had earlier acquired for a project for army officers, prompting the troops to fire at the protesters.         
	They said several policemen were injured when police in riot gear intervened.

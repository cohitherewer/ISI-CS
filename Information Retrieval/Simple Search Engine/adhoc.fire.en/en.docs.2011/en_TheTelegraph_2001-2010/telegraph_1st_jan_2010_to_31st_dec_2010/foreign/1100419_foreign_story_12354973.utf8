The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thailand punish threat
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Thailand punish threat
                            
	Bangkok, April 18 (Reuters): Thailands military vowed today to punish anti-government protesters if they march on Bangkoks central business district, raising fears of further violence after bloody clashes killed 24 people a week ago.        
	Red-shirted supporters of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra said yesterday they could take their protest to the financial district, two blocks away from their main downtown protest base, on Tuesday in defiance of an emergency decree.        
	We wont let them go anywhere further, army spokesperson Sansern Kaewkamnerd said.        
	Sansern stopped short of using the word crackdown but said action would be taken against protesters occupying the plush shopping and hotel district for a 16th day.        
	Lets say that we are left with no choice but to enforce the law, Sansern told TNN television. Those who do wrong will get their punishment. Taking back the area along with other measures are included in enforcing the law. All this must be done.        
	Sansern said uniformed and armed security forces would be sent to secure high-rises around the demonstration area to prevent the third hand, whom the government has blamed for the killings, from launching attacks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran starts first nuke power plant

	Bushehr (Iran), Aug. 21 (Reuters): Iran began fuelling its first nuclear power plant today, a potent symbol of its growing regional sway and rejection of international sanctions designed to prevent it building a nuclear bomb.        
	Iranian television showed live pictures of Irans nuclear chief Ali Akbar Salehi and his Russian counterpart watching a fuel rod assembly being prepared for insertion into the reactor near the Gulf city of Bushehr.        
	Despite all the pressures, sanctions and hardships imposed by western nations, we are now witnessing the start-up of the largest symbol of Irans peaceful nuclear activities, Salehi told a news conference afterwards. Iranian officials said it would take two to three months before the plant starts producing electricity and would generate 1,000 megawatts once it reaches full power.        
	Russia designed, built and will supply fuel for Bushehr, taking back spent rods which could be used to make weapons-grade plutonium in order to ease nuclear proliferation concerns. Todays ceremony comes after decades of delays building the plant, work on which was initially started by German company Siemens in the 1970s, before Irans Islamic Revolution.        
	The US criticised Moscow earlier this year for pushing ahead with Bushehr given persistent Iranian defiance over its nuclear programme.        
	Moscow supported a fourth UN Security Council resolution in June which imposed new sanctions and called for Iran to stop uranium enrichment which could lead it to obtain nuclear weapons.        
	The construction of the nuclear plant at Bushehr is a clear example showing that any country, if it abides by existing international legislation and provides effective, open interaction with the International Atomic Energy Agency, should have the opportunity to access peaceful use of the atom, Sergei Kiriyenko, head of Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom, told the news conference.

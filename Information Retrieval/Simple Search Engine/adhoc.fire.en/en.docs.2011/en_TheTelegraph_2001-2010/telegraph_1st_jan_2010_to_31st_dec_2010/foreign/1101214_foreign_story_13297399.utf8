The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Assange wined, dined at US embassy
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Assange wined, dined at US embassy
          ANDREW GILLIGAN                          Assange: Bit of a prank                                  
	Dec. 13: Julian Assange was a guest at a US embassy cocktail party less than a year ago.        
	To the US, Julian Assange may now be Public Enemy Number One. Some American politicians have even called for his execution. But less than a year ago, the founder of WikiLeaks was officially entertained at a US embassy cocktail party by one of the very diplomats whose secrets he would soon spill to the world.        
	At the reception, held at the US ambassadors residence in Reykjavik, Iceland, Assange chatted with Sam Watson, the embassys deputy chief of mission.        
	He was already sitting on dozens of Watsons classified cables at the time of the December party, including embarrassing details about Americas and Britains role following the collapse of Icelands banks which were later published to widespread outrage in the local media.        
	He certainly had fun at the party, said Birgitta Jonsdottir, an Icelandic MP and former activist in WikiLeaks. He went as my guest. I said it would be a bit of a prank to take him and see if they knew who he was. I dont think they had any idea.        
	Assanges site had already published dozens of leaks embarrassing to the US, including secret Guantanamo Bay detainee handling manuals and the full emails of Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate. The US state department condemned the manuals publication as a criminal act.        
	Assange went straight to the party from WikiLeaks Icelandic base, known as the bunker, where he was working on the release of a top-secret US Army video showing an attack on civilians in Iraq.        
	By the time of the party, WikiLeaks had also already taken delivery of around 600,000 classified US Army logs from the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, released earlier this year, plus the 250,000 secret US embassy cables which it is releasing now.        
	I thought it would be a bit boring to go on my own, said Jonsdottir.         
	But the irony was that I went to collect him from his guesthouse and couldnt find him, so just went back to work and didnt even go myself. I found out later hed just decided to go on his own and got in by saying he was my guest. He said hed spent a long time talking to Watson.        
	A confidential cable written by Watson, published by WikiLeaks, detailed discussions between him and Ian Whiting, the British ambassador to Reykjavik.        
	Whiting wanted to block a proposal to hold a referendum on whether Iceland should repay the British government after many Britons lost money in the collapse of the Reykjavik bank Icesave.        
	After the collapse, the British government refunded individual savers in Icesave from its own deposit protection scheme.         
	However, institutional savers, including many local authorities, have not been repaid, and Britain continues to seek full repayment from Iceland for them and for its own expenditure on individual savers.        
	The US embassy in Reykjavik declined to comment on Assanges invitation.        
	The former deputy to Assange is vowing to launch a rival site soon that he says will be more transparent than the original.               
	DubbedOpenleaks (www.openleaks.org) and run by Assanges former number two at WikiLeaks Daniel Domscheit-Berg, the site has no content on it at the moment apart from a logo and the messageComing soon!        
	In an interview with the OWNI technology website, Domscheit-Berg declined to go into the details of his dispute with Wikileaks but suggested it had strayed from its mission.        
	In these last months, the organisation has not been open any more, it lost its open-source promise, he said, adding that Openleaks plans to provide the means for leaked information to be published, without itself being a publisher.

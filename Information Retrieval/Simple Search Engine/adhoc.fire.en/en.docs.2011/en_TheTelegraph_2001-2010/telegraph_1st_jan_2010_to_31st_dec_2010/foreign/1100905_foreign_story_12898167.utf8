The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK airline boss says stewardesses can fly jets
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      UK airline boss says stewardesses can fly jets
                                  
	Sept. 4: The boss of the budget airline Ryanair has called for co-pilots to be removed from the flight deck to save money and suggested that air stewardesses could land planes in an emergency.        
	Michael Leary claimed that air stewardesses could instead be trained to land an aircraft in the event of an emergency. In an interview with BusinessWeek magazine, Leary, who has previously suggested that planes could fly with standing-only areas for passengers, said: Why does every plane have two pilots?         
	Really, you only need one pilot. Lets take out the second pilot. Let the b----- computer fly it.        
	When asked what would happen if the single pilot fell ill while flying a plane, he said: If the pilot has an emergency, he rings the bell, he calls her in. She could take over. The idea has been ridiculed by pilots, who questioned Learys commitment to passenger safety. Patrick Smith, an experienced pilot, described the idea as beyond preposterous. He added: Even in routine operations its important to have a second person there.        
	Jim McAuslan, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said: Are there no lengths to which he will not go to get publicity? His suggestion is unwise.        
	Leary also previously raised the idea of charging passengers to use the aircraft lavatories. Earlier this year, he introduced an extra baggage charge during the summer holiday season, which vastly increased the cost of checking in luggage for a journey. Kate Hanni, the founder of FlyersRights.org said: He insults the dignity of the flying public every time he opens his mouth.

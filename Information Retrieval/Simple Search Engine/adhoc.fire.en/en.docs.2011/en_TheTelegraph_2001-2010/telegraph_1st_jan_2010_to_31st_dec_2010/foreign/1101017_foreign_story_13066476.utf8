The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Privacy vs cyber security
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Privacy vs cyber security
                            
	Washington, Oct. 16 (AP): The US government is reviewing an Australian program that will allow Internet service providers to alert customers if their computers are taken over by hackers and could limit online access if people dont fix the problem.        
	Obama administration officials have been meeting with industry leaders and experts to find ways to increase online safety, as they try to strike a balance between securing the Internet and guarding Americans privacy and civil liberties.        
	Cyber experts and US officials are interested in portions of the plan, slated to go into effect in Australia in December. But any move toward Internet regulation or monitoring by the US government or industry could trigger fierce opposition from the public.        
	The discussions come as private, corporate and government computers across the US are increasingly being taken over and exploited by hackers and other computer criminals.        
	White House cyber co-ordinator Howard Schmidt said the US is looking at a number of voluntary ways to help the public and small businesses better protect themselves online.        
	Possibilities include provisions in the Australia plan that enable customers to get warnings from their Internet providers if their computer gets taken over by hackers through a botnet.        
	A botnet is a network of infected computers that can number in the thousands, and that network is usually controlled by hackers through a small number of scattered PCs. Computer owners are often unaware that their machine is linked to a botnet and is being used to shut down targeted websites, distribute malicious code or spread spam.        
	Without security you have no privacy. And many of us that care deeply about our privacy look to make sure our systems are secure, Schmidt said in an interview. Internet service providers, he added, can help make sure our systems are cleaned up if theyre infected and keep them clean.        
	But officials are stopping short of advocating an option in the Australian plan that allows Internet providers to wall off or limit online usage by customers who fail to clean their infected computers, saying this would be technically difficult and likely run into opposition.        
	In Australia, Internet providers will be able to take a range of actions to limit the damage from infected computers, from issuing warnings to restricting outbound e-mail.

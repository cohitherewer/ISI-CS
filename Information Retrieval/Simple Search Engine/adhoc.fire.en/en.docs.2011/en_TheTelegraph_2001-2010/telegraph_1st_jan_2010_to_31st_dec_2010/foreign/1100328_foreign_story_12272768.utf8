	London, March 27: Stephen Hawking has announced he will not retire from Cambridge University before he reaches 70, and intends to carry on for many years after if he is able.        
	 The news that he will stay in his post as director of research in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics quashes rumours he is planning a move to Canada.              
	The former Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, 67, stepped down from the prestigious post, once held by Isaac Newton, in October last year.

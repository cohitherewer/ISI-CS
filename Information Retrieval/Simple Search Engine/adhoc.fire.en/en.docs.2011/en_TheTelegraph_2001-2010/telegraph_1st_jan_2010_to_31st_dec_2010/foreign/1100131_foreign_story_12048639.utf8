The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Too many phone apps overwhelm users
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Too many phone apps overwhelm users
          KATIE HAFNER                          Fewer choices                                  
	New York, Jan. 30: If Caroline Cuas iPhone looked anything like her closet, where she keeps her dozens of pairs of shoes, she would have screen after screen of applications.        
	But instead her iPhone is nearly empty. Since she bought it nearly a year ago, Cua, 27, who works for a transportation service in San Francisco, has downloaded precisely five programmes. And though she uses four of those apps religiously, she says, the ones she favours  Pandora, the Internet radio service, and Shazam, the music identifier  are your basic black pumps.        
	And thats just fine with her, until she finds herself among friends whose iPhones are studded with icons. When a fellow iPhone owner asked recently to see her apps, she grew self-conscious. I said to him, OK, now Im feeling like a loser, she recalled.        
	Cua is not an exception. She is the rule. The average iPhone or iPod Touch owner uses 5 to 10 apps regularly, according to Flurry, a research firm that studies mobile trends. This despite the surfeit of available apps: some 140,000 and counting.        
	Last weeks announcement of the Apple iPad, a tablet device that runs iPhone applications and will not be available until March, has already spurred the development of more, including a version of a drawing app called Brushes; Nova, a shooter game; and Apples own app called iBooks.        
	But that doesnt mean that people will change their habits. Actually, it may just make them feel a tad more overwhelmed. The next generation of gadget users might prove different, but for now it is clear that people prefer fewer choices, and that they gravitate consistently toward the same small number of things that they like.         
	Owners of iPhones are no different from cable TV subscribers with hundreds of channels to choose from who end up watching the same half-dozen.        
	So, for every zealous owner whose iPhone is loaded with little-known programmes that predict asteroid fly-bys, there are many more Caroline Cuas, who seldom venture outside the predictable. Most say theyre too busy, too lazy or just plain flummoxed by the choices.        
	I think Im supposed to want more of them than I have, said Julie Graham, a psychotherapist in San Francisco who echoed Cuas vague anxiety.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran foreign minister sacked

	Tehran, Dec. 13: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad fired Irans foreign minister today, a move that caught many here by surprise and appeared to reflect a strengthening of the Presidents power.        
	Ahmadinejad said in a presidential order that he had dismissed the minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, a career diplomat who has for many years been Irans face to the West. Mottaki was on an official trip to Senegal today and did not immediately react to the news, which appeared to catch even the state-run Iranian news media by surprise.        
	The sacking of Mottaki seemed to represent a victory for Ahmadinejad, who has been embroiled in a power struggle with a faction of moderate politicians centered in the Parliament, headed by the speaker, Ari Larijani. Political insiders say that after the 2005 presidential election, Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, forced the newly elected Ahmadinejad to accept Mottaki as foreign minister, even though Mottaki had backed Larijanis campaign.         
	They say Khamenei has until now blocked the Presidents efforts to replace him.        
	Lawmakers loyal to Ahmadinejad had recently been threatening to seek his dismissal if the UN approved more sanctions over Irans nuclear programme, though he is not involved in nuclear negotiations. However, Ahmadinejads choice for acting foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, is the head of Irans nuclear programme.

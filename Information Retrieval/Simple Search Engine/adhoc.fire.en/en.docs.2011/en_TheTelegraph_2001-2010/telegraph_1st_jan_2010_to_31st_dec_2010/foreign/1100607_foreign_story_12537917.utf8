                              GOGGLES ON?                            
	London, June 6 (PTI): Its official. Beer goggles really exist.         
	Scientists have finally proven that strangers indeed look sexier to people when they booze.        
	The phenomenon, when less attractive people suddenly become more appealing when the onlooker has consumed copious amounts of alcohol, is well known in pubs and clubs. Until now, though, no one really knew why.         
	Now, a new study has found that drunk students were up to 10 per cent more likely to fall for less attractive people than those who were sober. It showed the more they drank, the less likely they were to recognise finer details on peoples faces, the Daily Mail has reported.        
	In their study, a team of behavioural psychologists got hold of 64 students of varying levels of drunkenness in bars at Roehampton University, London.         
	They were asked to judge 20 pairs of photographs of men and women aged between 18 and 25 years. One face in each pair was digitally enhanced to make it more symmetrical, and therefore more attractive.        
	Thirty-six of the students who were sober (those who had drunk less than four units of alcohol) had a 67 per cent success rate in choosing the symmetrical face. But 28 intoxicated students (those who had drunk 10 or more units) chose the more symmetrical face in just 58 per cent of cases.         
	Lewis Halsey, who led the joint study with Stirling University in Scotland, was quoted by the British newspaper as saying: Drunk students were less good at noticing symmetrical faces and cared less about the defects.

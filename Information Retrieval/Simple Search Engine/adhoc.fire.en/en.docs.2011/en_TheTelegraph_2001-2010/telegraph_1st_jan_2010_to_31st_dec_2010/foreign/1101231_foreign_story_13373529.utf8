                              Bobby Farrell: Daddy Cool                            
	Moscow, Dec. 30 (Reuters): Boney M frontman Bobby Farrell was found dead in his hotel room in St Petersburg today, the day after a performance in the city where the band rose to stardom in the Soviet era, his agent said today.        
	He did a show last night as part of Bobby Farrells Boney M and they found him this morning dead in his hotel room, agent John Seine told Reuters by telephone from the Netherlands. Farrell was 61.        
	He did not feel well last night, and was having problems with his breathing, but he did the show anyway, he added. The cause of his death was not immediately clear, said Sergei Kapitanov, representative of St Petersburgs branch of Russias investigative committee.        
	Farrell was famous for dancing and lip synching for the disco band that rose to prominence in Europe, the US and the Soviet Union with songs like Ma Baker, Rivers of Babylon and Rasputin.        
	Boney M was put together by German singer-songwriter Frank Farian who also produced most of the vocals for the group, which stormed to the top of the charts in the late 1970s.

	Depp stunned    
	 London, Dec. 1 (PTI): Actor Johnny Depp was caught unawares by co-star Angelina Jolies dark sense of humour while filming The Tourist.      
	Depp, 47, and Jolie were acting together for the first time and he was initially wary as he was not sure what she would be like.      
	Meeting her and getting to know her was a real pleasant surprise. You dont know what she might be like  if she has any sense of humour at all. I was so pleased to find that she is incredibly normal, and has a wonderfully kind of dark, perverse sense of humour, said the actor.     
	Tom star    
	London (PTI): Actor Tom Hanks is all set to star in the sequel to Kathryn Bigelows Oscar-winning movie The Hurt Locker. The Kathryn Bigelow film is set on the border zone between Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil, a base for organised crime.

	Los Angeles, Jan. 27: James Camerons science-fiction epic Avatar has passed his Titanic to become historys highest-grossing film, with a sizeable boost from higher-priced tickets for 3-D and Imax showings.        
	Avatar, like other contemporary films, has also benefited from the steady inflation of ticket prices  todays average is $7.46, up from $4.69 in 1998 when Titanic was in theatres  meaning that Titanic had to sell many more tickets to reach box-office totals like Avatars. But Avatar remains poised to keep going for weeks if not months.        
	Till Monday, its ticket sales around the world reached $1.86 billion, edging past the $1.84 billion in sales posted by Titanic, which came out in December 1997, according to figures released on Tuesday by 20th Century Fox. Fox released Avatar around the world; it split the distribution of Titanic with Paramount Pictures.        
	Till Monday, Avatar took in about $554.9 million in domestic theatres, placing it just behind Titanic, with sales of $600.8 million, in the domestic box-office rankings, and just ahead of The Dark Knight.

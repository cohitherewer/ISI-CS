	Girl, 9, mother    
	 Shanghai, Feb. 3: A nine-year-old schoolgirl has become one of the worlds youngest mothers after giving birth to a 6-pound baby by caesarian section, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The baby was delivered on January 27 at a hospital in Changchun, in the northeastern province of Jilin, when the girl was eight-and-a-half months pregnant, according to a local newspaper.      
	The City Evening News reported that the girl and her child were both well, but that her parents have lodged a complaint to the police. Under Chinese law, intercourse with a child under the age of 14 is statutory rape. It was unclear how she had become pregnant.    
	Clooney bat    
	 Los Angeles (Reuters): Actor George Clooneys latest movie Up In The Air grabbed five Oscar nominations yesterday but there is one film about which he may not be so proud  Batman and Robin. The 1997 movie starring Clooney as the caped crusader came top in an online survey by film magazine Empire to find the most disastrous film ever made. The magazine said it did not just come top in voters rankings but got almost three times as many votes as the next entry  John Travoltas Battlefield Earth.

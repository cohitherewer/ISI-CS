The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Seoul takes fear in stride
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Seoul takes fear in stride
          MARK MCDONALD                              
	Seoul, Nov. 24: The forests on distant Yeonpyeong Island were ablaze today, one day after a ferocious artillery exchange between North and South Korean military units.         
	But to many residents of Seoul, the violent attack on the tiny island seemed largely contained and unthreatening. I was talking with a friend this morning and we wondered why we werent more concerned, a Seoul restaurant owner, Pyun Sung-ja, said today. I guess its because the area of the shelling is so far from here. It feels like it happened in another country.        
	The artillery exchange that lasted for about an hour yesterday afternoon killed two South Korean marines and two civilians who lived on the island. The Souths military went on high alert, fighter-bombers were ready on the tarmac and the President plotted strategy with his advisers in the underground Situation Room in Seoul.         
	Residents of Seoul, however, seemed to display only a mild anxiety today, caught somewhere between calm and dread, and maybe breathing a collective sigh of relief that things had not escalated. John Delury, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, said he heard strong reactions this afternoon to the news that two dead civilians had been found on the island earlier in the day, their burned bodies discovered as damage from the shelling was being cleared away. This is extremely serious, he said. In all my conversations today, the first thing people are saying is: We dont want war. On any level  human, economic, political  theres just no appetite for it.

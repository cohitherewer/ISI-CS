	July 30: The Ellen DeGeneres era on American Idol is over.        
	After deciding Idol didnt feel like the right fit, the first-year judge and popular talk-show host has decided not to come back for a second season of the top-rated TV show. In a statement, she cited time commitments and the discomfort of hurting contestants feelings.        
	It was a difficult decision to make, but my work schedule became more than I bargained for. I also realised this season that while I love discovering, supporting and nurturing young talent, it was hard for me to judge people and sometimes hurt their feelings, DeGeneres said.        
	I loved the experience working on Idol and I am very grateful for the year I had. I am a huge fan of the show and will continue to be. Idol already is searching for a replacement for Simon Cowell on its four-judge panel.              
	 No announcement has been made on that front, and Fox         
	did not make any additional comment on whether it would have three or four judges next         
	season. Auditions already have started for Idols 10th season.

	Idol remains TVs top-rated show, with its Tuesday and Wednesday episodes heading the         
	Nielsen charts, but its audience has been slipping in recent years. Mays ninth-season         
	finale, which featured the crowning of Lee DeWyze, drew 24.2 million viewers, down from 28.8         
	million the previous year.              
	In the statement, DeGeneres said she told producers a couple of months ago of her feelings         
	but that she wouldnt leave them in a bind and would hold off on doing anything until they         
	decided on what they planned to do next.              
	Idol producers and Fox executives praised DeGeneres, who was halfway through a two-year         
	contract.              
	 quot;I loved Ellens passion for the artists and her nurturing skills, quot; Idol creator Simon         
	Fuller says. quot;She brought honesty and optimism to our judging panel, and I will miss her         
	greatly. quot;              USA TODAY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 117 die in Dhaka fire fuelled by chemicals
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      117 die in Dhaka fire fuelled by chemicals

	Dhaka, June 4 (Reuters): At least 117 people were killed in a fire that razed a crowded, centuries-old Dhaka neighbourhood overnight as rescue workers scrambled today to pull bodies, many charred beyond recognition, from smouldering debris.        
	The death toll in the densely populated Nimtali area rose to 117 with recovery of more bodies and deaths of the wounded in hospitals as rescue operations continued at the scene, officials said.         
	The confirmed death toll from the fire is now 117 and may rise, Muhibul Haque, district commissioner of Dhaka, told Reuters. He said more than 40 people were being treated for burns in hospital, with 12 in critical condition. Fuelling the flames, which some witnesses said rose up to six-storeys high, were chemicals from illegal, home-based factories in the Kayettuli neighbourhood, one of the most densely populated in Dhaka and in the heart of the city.        
	It seemed like hell broke loose, said a wailing woman, looking for her daughter and son in what remained of the area, home to several multi-storey blocks and tin-roofed dwellings. Some had been turned into chemical factories despite a law banning their presence in residential areas.        
	Burning chemicals from stores within or beside the living quarters spewed on the streets like lava from a volcano. There was hardly any safe place to step out, added one survivor. Television channels put the death toll at up to 150.        
	The countrys police chief, Nur Mohammad, said it was difficult to give an exact casualty toll until search and rescue operations were finished.        
	Some families lost up to eight members, witnesses said, and many residents were trapped trying to rush out of buildings. Flames leapt up to the sixth floor of buildings. It was a huge inferno, said a Reuters witness. The blaze, believed to have been caused by an explosion at an electrical transformer, was the worst in the capital since 1971.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lohans bracelet really works
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lohans bracelet really works
          JOHN ELIGON                          sobering thought                                  
	New York, May 31: Christopher Nelson would hardly be considered the Hollywood type. He is a beer-drinking construction worker who lives in Seattle and speaks in a carefree tone.        
	But Nelson, 35, could be just the adviser that Lindsay Lohan needs right about now.        
	About two years ago, Nelson completed six sober months wearing an ankle bracelet that monitors alcohol consumption  the same device that a judge in Los Angeles ordered Lohan to strap on last week.        
	Nelson got his bracelet after he was arrested for drunken driving in Queens, New York, about two years ago. It was his second drunken-driving arrest, Nelson said, so his sentence included a treatment programme and six months wearing the bracelet. While he wore it, he said, it was always on his mind, he said.        
	I would still go to bars, but I would just eat and drink soda, Nelson said. It just wasnt worth having a beer and then dealing with whatever the repercussions would have been.        
	While celebrities are apt to create a buzz when they are ordered to wear a monitoring device  Lohan, Tracy Morgan, Jayson Williams and the singer Eve come to mind  the truth is that the devices are primarily used on ordinary people like Nelson.        
	He was sceptical of Lohans ability to resist temptation. I havent seen a movie shes been in, but you see all the tabloids, he said.        
	Lohan will have to wear the device, a Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitoring, or Scram, bracelet, at least until her next court date, on July 6.        
	There have been reports that Lohan is already back on the party scene, bulky anklet and all.         
	More than 330 defendants have been ordered to wear Scram bracelets in New York City, the majority of them in Queens, according to Kathleen Brown, a spokeswoman for Alcohol Monitoring Systems, the company that develops and monitors the devices. The court in Queens that handles drunken-driving cases, the Queens Treatment Court, requires those who are convicted and some defendants to wear the device for at least 90 days.        
	Justice Marcia P. Hirsch, who presides over the Queens Treatment Court, said defendants tend to be male, from their early 20s to mid-60s, are usually employed and essentially have been functional drunks for a long time.        
	The bracelet has a pump that sucks in what is known as insensible perspiration every 30 minutes, Brown said. The box attached to the bracelet contains the same mechanism as a Breathalyser, she said, and the data it collects is uploaded through a modem and analysed by monitors.        
	When someone is unsuccessful in a treatment program, a bracelet could be a better option than jail, which can disrupt the persons life and lead to job loss, said Judge Michael J. Yavinsky, who presides over most misdemeanour drunken-driving cases in Manhattan.        
	Can we somehow keep them out, monitor them and force them to be sober? Judge Yavinsky said. If we can do that in combination with treatment, and the person remains productive and employable and stays off the road and sober, then maybe everybody makes out better in the long run.

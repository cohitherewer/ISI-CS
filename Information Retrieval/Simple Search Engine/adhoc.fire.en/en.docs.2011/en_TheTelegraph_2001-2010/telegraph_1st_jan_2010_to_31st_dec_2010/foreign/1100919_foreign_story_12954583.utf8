                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lohan fails test, faces jail
          PHILIP SHERWELL                          WORKING HARD                                  
	New York, Sept. 18: Lindsay Lohan appears certain to be heading back to prison after the troubled actress and pop singer confirmed she had failed a court-ordered drug test.        
	The violation  reported by the entertainment website TMZ to involve cocaine use  would breach the terms of the 24-year-olds probation in the US. The news came as it was revealed that the socialite Paris Hilton, Lohans fellow gossip page regular, has agreed to a plea deal that avoids jail after she was arrested in Las Vegas last month for cocaine possession.        
	Lohan recently served two weeks in jail and 23 days in an inpatient rehab treatment in Los Angeles after violating her probation for drug and driving charges that followed two arrests in 2007.        
	In July, she was sentenced to three months in jail followed by three months in rehab, only to be released on probation. But the judge told her she faced at least 30 days in jail for any breach of her probation terms.        
	The star used her Twitter page to confirm reports that she had failed a mandatory drug screening test. In a series of messages posted late yesterday, she said: Regrettably, I did in fact fail my most recent drug test and if I am asked, I am prepared to appear before judge Fox next week as a result.        
	Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesnt go away over night. I am working hard to overcome it.

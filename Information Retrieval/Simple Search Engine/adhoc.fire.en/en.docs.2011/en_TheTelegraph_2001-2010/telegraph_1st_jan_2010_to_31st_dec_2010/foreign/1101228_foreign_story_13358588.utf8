	Karachi, Dec. 27: Dinner at Rabia Sultanas house is now served over a cold silence. Her family has not spoken to her since May, when Sultana, 21, swapped her home life for a cashiers job at McDonalds.         
	Her conservative brother berated Sultana for damaging the familys honour by taking a job in which she interacts with men  and especially one that requires her to shed her burqa in favour of a short-sleeved McDonalds uniform.         
	Then he confiscated her uniform, slapped her across the face and threatened to break her legs if he saw her outside the home.         
	Her family may be outraged, but they are also in need. Sultana donates her $100 monthly salary to supplement the household budget for expenses that the men in her family can no longer pay for, including school fees for her younger sisters.         
	Sultana is part of a small but growing generation of lower-class young women here who are entering service-sector jobs to support their families, and by extension, pitting their religious and cultural traditions against economic desperation.         
	The women are pressed into the work force not by nascent feminism but by inflation, which has spiked to 12.7 per cent from 1.4 per cent in the past seven years. As a result, one salary  the mans salary  can no longer feed a family.         
	Its not just the economic need, but need of the nation, said Rafiq Rangoonwala, the chief executive officer of KFC Pakistan, who has challenged his managers to double the number of women in his work force by next year.         
	Otherwise, Pakistan will never progress. Well always remain a third-world country because 15 per cent of the people cannot feed 85 per cent of the population.         
	Female employment at KFC in Pakistan has risen 125 per cent in the past five years.         
	Several chains like McDonalds and the supermarket behemoth Makro, where the number of women has quadrupled since 2006, have introduced free transit services for female employees to protect them from harassment and to help persuade them take jobs where they may face hostility.         
	Were a society in transition, said Zeenat Hisam, a senior researcher at the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research. Men in Pakistan havent changed, and theyre not changing as fast as our women. Men want to keep their power in their hand.         
	The majority of the people here believe in the traditional interpretation of Islam, and they get very upset because religious leaders tell them its not proper for women to go out and to work and to serve strange men.         
	More than 100 young women who recently entered service jobs told of continual harassment.         
	At work, some women spend more time deflecting abuse from customers than serving them. On the way home, they are heckled in buses and condemned by neighbours. It is so common for brothers to confiscate their uniforms that McDonalds provides women with three sets.         
	If I leave this job, everything would be OK at home, Sultana said. But then thered be a huge impact on our house. I want to make something of myself, and for my sisters, who are at home and dont know anything about the outside world.         
	So far, the movement of women into the service sector has been largely limited to Karachi. Elsewhere across Pakistan, women are still mostly relegated to their homes, or they take jobs in traditional labour settings like women-only stitching factories or girls schools, where salaries can be half of those in the service industry.         
	Even the most trailblazing of companies, like KFC, still employ 90 per cent men.         
	Pakistan ranked 133rd out of the 134 countries on the 2010 Global Gender Gap Reports list of womens economic participation.         
	While there is no reliable data on the number of women who specifically enter the service sector, Pakistans female work force hovers around 20 per cent, among the lowest of any Muslim country.         
	Some women, like Saima, 22, are forced to lead secret lives to earn $175 a month. Her fathers shopkeepers salary does not cover the familys expenses. Without a university degree, the only job Saima could find was at a call centre of a major restaurants delivery department. But she impressed the manger so much that he offered her a higher-paying waitress job at a branch near her home.         
	She reluctantly agreed, but pleaded to be sent to a restaurant two hours away so she would not be spotted by family members and neighbours.         
	After three years, her family still thinks she works in the basement of a call centre. On several occasions, she served old friends who did not recognise her without a head scarf. Her confidence has soared, but she is overwhelmed with guilt.         
	Ive completely changed myself here, she said in the corner booth of her restaurant before her co-workers arrived. But honestly, Im not happy with what Im doing.         
	The women interviewed said they had to battle stereotypes that suggested that women who work were sexually promiscuous.         
	Sometimes men misinterpret simple acts of customer service, like a smile. Fauzia, who works as a cashier at KFC, said that last year a customer was so taken with her smile that he followed her out the door and tried to force her into his car before she escaped.

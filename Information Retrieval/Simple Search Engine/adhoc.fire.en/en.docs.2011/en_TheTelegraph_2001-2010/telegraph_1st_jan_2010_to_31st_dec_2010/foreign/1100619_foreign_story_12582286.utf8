                              Gardner                            
	Denver, June 18: A five-member firing squad at the Utah State Prison took aim and fired .30-calibre bullets at a target pinned on the chest of Ronnie Lee Gardner, a convicted murderer, just after midnight today. He was pronounced dead at 12:20am local time.        
	Gardner spent almost 25 years on death row, and several months as the centre of international attention focused not so much on crime as his punishment.        
	It was the third firing squad execution in Utah  the only state actively practicing that form of punishment  since 1976, when the death penalty was restored by the US Supreme Court. The execution warrant for Mr Gardner has been served, the Utah Department of Corrections said.

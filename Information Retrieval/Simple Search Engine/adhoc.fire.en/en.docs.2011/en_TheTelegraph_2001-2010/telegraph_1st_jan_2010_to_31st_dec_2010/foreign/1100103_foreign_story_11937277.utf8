The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Blast-hit Pak villagers vow to defy Taliban
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Blast-hit Pak villagers vow to defy Taliban
                            
	Shah Hasan Khel (Pakistan), Jan. 2 (AP): Tribal elders in a Pakistani village where a suicide car bomber killed nearly 100 people insisted today that residents would keep defying the Taliban.        
	Their defiance comes as the bloodshed laid bare the risks facing the citizens militias that make up a key piece of Pakistans arsenal against extremism.        
	The New Years Day attack on the northwest village of Shah Hasan Khel was one of the deadliest in a surge of bombings that has killed more than 600 across Pakistan since October. Police believe the attacker meant to detonate his 250kg of explosives at a meeting of tribesmen who supervise an anti-Taliban militia. Instead, the blast went off at a nearby outdoor volleyball court, killing at least 96 people.        
	The explosion levelled some three dozen mud-brick homes and covered the village with dust, smoke and the smell of burning flesh.        
	Today, numerous homes received visitors offering condolences, and funeral prayers were held. Many of the residents in the village of 5,000 but others were defiant.        
	The people are in severe grief and fear  it is a demoralising thing, said Raham Dil Khan, a rifle-toting, 70-something member of the tribal council. We want the government to provide security, but one thing is very clear: The committee will stand against every type of terrorism and despite this great loss we will continue our work. None of the elders were killed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UN shuts mission in Kandahar
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      UN shuts mission in Kandahar
                            
	Kandahar, April 27 (Reuters): The UN has shut its mission in Kandahar and evacuated many foreign staff from the southern Afghan city, it said today, a sign of worsening security ahead of a major US offensive.        
	The UN pullout further alarmed residents as thousands of US troops plan to launch the biggest operation of the nearly nine-year-old war in the coming weeks.        
	UN spokeswoman Susan Manuel said all Afghan staff in Kandahar had been told to stay home, and some foreign staff had been moved to Kabul for their safety a day earlier.        
	She would not say how many international staff had stayed behind. The security situation has got to the point where we needed to withdraw them yesterday, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Grazed knee? Good for kids
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Grazed knee? Good for kids
  - guidelines encourage children to take risks                                  
	London, Oct. 9: New guidelines say children should be allowed to take risks while councils have been warned not to pander to over-anxious parents in a move which has been hailed as a victory of common sense.         
	A report issued by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Play England says organisations designing play areas should allow for a few grazed knees or bruised elbows if children gain from the experience, for example learning how to ride a bike on rough ground or use a climbing frame.         
	Mick Conway, of Play England, said 17,000 guides have already been ordered by local authorities and schools hoping to build modern play areas.         
	He emphasised that the guide still insisted the play area is as safe as reasonably possible and protects against major injuries. But if children can benefit from challenges like climbing, running or trying new stills then it allows for minor injuries.         
	We do assess risk and hazard but we look at the benefits to children too and take a balanced approach, he said.         
	There has been too much of a cotton wool culture. People accept that children need more challenges while staying safe and that a bumps and scrapes are part of growing up.         
	The guide warns that if playgrounds fail to stimulate children then the more risk-taking youngsters will seek challenges in more dangerous settings.         
	The report said health and safety was no longer about creating a risk-free society.         
	Barry Baker, principal inspector at (HSE), endorsed the new approach. HSE recognises the importance of play in childrens lives and for opportunities to learn about risk.         
	Its application of risk-benefit assessments is a sensible approach to the health and safety management of play provision, he said.         
	David Cameron, the Prime Minister, has pledged to bring about wider reform of the health and safety rules governing teachers, nurses and police to enable them to make common sense decisions.

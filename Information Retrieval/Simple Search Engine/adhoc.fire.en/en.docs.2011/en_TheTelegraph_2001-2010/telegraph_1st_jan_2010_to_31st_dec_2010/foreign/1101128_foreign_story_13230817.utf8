The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palin defends slip of the tongue
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Palin defends slip of the tongue
                              UNFAIR                            
	Nov. 27: Sarah Palin has accused critics of unfairly singling her out, after a slip of the tongue rekindled questions about her credibility.        
	After mistakenly telling a radio interviewer that Americans need to stand with our North Korean allies, the former vice-presidential candidate, who looks increasingly likely to run for the White House in 2012, protested that President Barack Obama had made similar slips and not been singled out.        
	They couldnt resist the temptation to turn a simple one word slip-of-the-tongue of mine into a major political headline, Palin wrote on her Facebook page late on Thursday. The former governor pointed to instances in which Obama had mistakenly said there were 57 US states, instead of 50, and claimed the country was founded 20 centuries ago  without, she said, stirring up the same kind of criticism.        
	If you cant remember hearing about them, thats because for the most part the media didnt consider them newsworthy. Palin has staked her popularity on conservative views and an unorthodox approach to politics.

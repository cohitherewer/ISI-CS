                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Republican leaders get Obama dinner invite
                              not a photo-op                            
	Washington, Nov. 4 (Reuters): President Barack Obama said today he invited Democratic and Republican congressional leaders to the White House on November 18 to discuss issues that could be tackled in what remains of this years congressional term.        
	Obama said he called John Boehner, who is expected to be the next Speaker of the House of Representatives after Republicans gained a majority in Tuesdays election, as well as the current Speaker, Democrat Nancy Pelosi. He also invited Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat.        
	This is going to be a meeting in which I want us to talk substantively about how we can move the American peoples agenda forward, he told reporters at the White House while meeting with his top Cabinet officials and advisers.        
	Its not just going to be a photo-op. Hopefully it may spill over into dinner, he said.        
	Obama said the focus of the meeting would be what to get done during the lame duck congressional session that goes through the end of this year. A lame-duck period is the time between a congressional election in November and the start of the new Congress in January.         
	During that time, Congress operates, but with many lawmakers who have just been voted out of office and with no newly elected members, except victorious incumbents.        
	We have to act in order to assure that middle class families dont see a big tax spike because of how the Bush tax cuts have been structured. It is very important that we extend those middle class tax provisions, he said.        
	Obama said he told cabinet leaders to absorb the message of Tuesdays election, which swept Republicans to power in the House and in legislatures across the country.

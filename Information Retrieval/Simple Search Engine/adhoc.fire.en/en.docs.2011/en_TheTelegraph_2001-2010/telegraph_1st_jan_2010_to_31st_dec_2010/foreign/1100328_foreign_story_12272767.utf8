The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Uncertainty after ex-PM in wafer-thin Iraq win

          TIMOTHY WILLIAMS AND ROD NORDLAND                          Allawi in Baghdad. (AP)                                  
	Baghdad, March 27: The secular party of Ayad Allawi, a former interim Prime Minister once derided as an American puppet, won a wafer-thin victory in Iraqs election, setting the stage for a protracted period of political uncertainty that could threaten plans to withdraw American troops.        
	The outcome, announced yesterday, was immediately challenged by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and his supporters in the State of Law coalition, who hurled accusations of fraud and made vague references to the Prime Ministers power as commander-in- chief.        
	Several parties have cried fraud as their fortunes waxed or waned in the slow vote count, an ominous reminder of an Iraqi political culture where winning is everything and compromise elusive.         
	Western observers and an independent election commission said they saw no signs of widespread fraud. Allawi galvanised the votes of millions of Sunnis  who boycotted the last parliamentary elections in 2005  to build his edge of 91 to 89 seats over his nearest rival, Maliki. That falls far short of the majority of 163 of the 325 seats in Parliament that he needs to form a government.        
	Iraqi political experts interviewed yesterday doubted that Allawi would succeed in assembling a governing coalition. But even if he did, they said it would take at least until July, possibly even longer, a potentially destabilising stretch in which a disgruntled Maliki would serve as caretaker Prime Minister of the nation.        
	In a statement that seemed to reflect American concerns about the potential for violence, US ambassador Christopher R. Hill and Gen. Ray Odierno, the top American military commander in Iraq, praised the overall integrity of the election and called on political parties to refrain from inflammatory rhetoric or action.        
	 There had been hope that the election would spell an end to Iraqs sectarian politics. And though the balloting shattered the sectarian political template that brought Maliki to power in 2005, when an alliance of Shia parties dominated the election, the outcome re-emphasised the countrys sectarian and regional divides.

	Berry body    
	 London, July 21 (PTI): She was once voted the sexiest Bond girl ever and Halle Berry showed the world why as she stepped out on the beach in a bikini.      
	The Oscar-winning actress, who will turn 44 next month, walked hand-in-hand with her 2-year-old daughter, Nahla Ariela, on the beach in Malibu.      
	Dressed in a grey sequinned bikini with matching hot pants, the actress drew admiring glances as she played with her daughter, reports the Daily Mail. Back in 2002, Berry played Giacinta Jinx Johnson in the hit 007 film Die Another Day.     
	Dog ice    
	 London (Reuters): The worlds first ice cream van for dogs will open for business at a pet party in Londons Regents Park on Saturday. The van will serve canine-friendly flavours such as Dog Eat Hog World  a chicken and gammon sorbet  and Canine Cookie Crunch, a traditional vanilla ice cream, albeit sprinkled with dog biscuits.

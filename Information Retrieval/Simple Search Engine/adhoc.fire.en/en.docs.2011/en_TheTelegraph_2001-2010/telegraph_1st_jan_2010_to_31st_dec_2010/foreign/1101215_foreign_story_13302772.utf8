   A giant: Obama
          ROBERT D. MCFADDEN                                          
	New York, Dec. 14: Richard C. Holbrooke, the Obama administrations special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan since 2009 and a diplomatic troubleshooter who worked for every Democratic President since the late 1960s and oversaw the negotiations that ended the war in Bosnia, died last evening in Washington.         
	Holbrooke was hospitalised on Friday afternoon after becoming ill while meeting secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton in her Washington office. Doctors found a tear to his aorta, and he underwent a 21-hour operation. Holbrooke had additional surgery on Sunday and remained in very critical condition until his death.         
	Holbrookes signal accomplishment in a distinguished career that involved diplomacy in Asia, Europe and West Asia was his role as chief architect of the 1995 Dayton peace accords, which ended the war in Bosnia.         
	It was a coup preceded and followed by his peacekeeping missions to the tinderbox of ethnic, religious and regional conflicts that was formerly Yugoslavia.         
	More recently, Holbrooke wrestled with the stunning complexity of Afghanistan and Pakistan. One of his main tasks was to press President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan to take responsibility for security in his country and to confront the corruption that imperils the American mission there. At times, Karzai refused to see him, but Holbrooke was undeterred.         
	Hes an enormously tough customer, Holbrooke said during one of the periodic breakfasts he had with reporters who covered his diplomatic exploits. As youve heard, he added with a smile, so am I.         
	A brilliant, sometimes abrasive infighter, he used a formidable arsenal of facts, bluffs, whispers, implied threats and, when necessary, pyrotechnic fits of anger to press his positions. Obama, who praised Holbrooke yesterday afternoon at the state department as simply one of the giants of American foreign policy, was sometimes driven to distraction by his lectures.         
	But Holbrooke dazzled and often intimidated opponents and colleagues around a negotiating table. Some called him a bully, and he looked the part: the big chin thrust out, the broad shoulders, the tight smile that might mean anything. To admirers, however, including generations of state department protgs and the Presidents he served, his peacemaking efforts were extraordinary.         
	When he named Holbrooke to represent the US at the UN, President Bill Clinton said: His remarkable diplomacy in Bosnia helped to stop the bloodshed, and at the talks in Dayton the force of his determination was the key to securing peace, restoring hope and saving lives. Others said his work in Bosnia deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.         
	Few diplomats could boast of his career accomplishments.         
	Foreign policy was his life. Even during Republican administrations, when he was not in government, he was deeply engaged, undertaking missions as a private citizen travelling through the war-weary Balkans and the backwaters of Africa and Asia.        
	He wrote his own widely acclaimed memoir, To End a War, about his Bosnia service. Holbrooke also made millions as an investment banker on Wall Street. In the early 1980s, he was a co-founder of a Washington consulting firm, Public Strategies, which was later sold to Lehman Brothers. At various times he was a managing director of Lehman Brothers, vice chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston and a director of the American International Group.         
	In 1964, Holbrooke married the first of his three wives, Larrine Sullivan, a lawyer. His marriage to Blythe Babyak, a television producer, also ended in divorce. In 1995, he married Kati Marton, an author, journalist and human rights advocate who had been married to the ABC anchorman Peter Jennings.

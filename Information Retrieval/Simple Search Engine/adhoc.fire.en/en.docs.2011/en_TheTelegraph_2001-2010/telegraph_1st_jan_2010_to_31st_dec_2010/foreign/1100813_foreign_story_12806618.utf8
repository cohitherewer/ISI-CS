The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hollywoods formula: cram films with stars
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hollywoods formula: cram films with stars
          MICHAEL CIEPLY                          Julia Roberts in a scene from Eat Pray Love. (AP)                                  
	Los Angeles, Aug. 12: Julia Roberts, set to open in the romance Eat Pray Love from Sony Pictures tomorrow, may not be outclassed. But she is definitely outnumbered.        
	Roberts is squared off against more than two dozen stars, including the governor of California, who are jammed into a pair of competing movies. Those are The Expendables, from Lionsgate, and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, from Universal Pictures, both also set for release tomorrow.        
	It might be coincidence. Or maybe it is a trend.        
	Either way, Hollywood has been serving up its leading men, leading ladies and principal supporting players in sizeable clumps of late.        
	Red, an action picture from Summit Entertainment; New Years Eve, a romantic collage from New Line Cinema; and The Avengers, which collects superheroes from Marvel, are examples of group enterprises on tap for the future.         
	Sonys Grown Ups and New Lines Valentines Day showed the power of ensemble in months past.        
	In recent years series like Twilight and Harry Potter have been thick with cast and characters, in sharp contrast to the lone wolves and duos who carried films like Die Hard and Lethal Weapon.        
	For Robert J. Thompson, the founding director of the Bleier Centre for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, the multiplicity is no accident. Theres a much larger thing going on here, Thompson said. He theorises that feature film is reaching towards the complex, multicharacter scenarios that have made hits of sophisticated television series like Mad Men and The Sopranos.        
	Others are less sure.        
	I dont know that anything is changing in terms of storytelling patterns, said Marc Platt, a producer of the cast-heavy Scott Pilgrim.        
	That film, he noted, just happened to be based on a comic book story that required Pilgrim to defeat his girlfriends seven evil exes. So seven villains the movie got, led by Jason Schwartzman (Funny People). The line on the bus posters: So many bad guys. So little time.        
	Even so, Platt said in a telephone interview, falling star salaries and a declining number of films have made it easier to round up an ensemble. A lot of actors want to go to work, he said.        
	That was apparent at the Comic-Con International pop culture convention last month in San Diego, where Edgar Wright, the director of Scott Pilgrim, introduced a panel that included no fewer than 13 cast members, among them Schwartzman and Anna Kendrick (Up in the Air).         
	At a panel earlier that same day Sylvester Stallone, who directed The Expendables, had only about half of his outsize cast in tow. Eric Roberts, Jet Li and the California governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, didnt show, but those on hand included Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Bruce Willis.

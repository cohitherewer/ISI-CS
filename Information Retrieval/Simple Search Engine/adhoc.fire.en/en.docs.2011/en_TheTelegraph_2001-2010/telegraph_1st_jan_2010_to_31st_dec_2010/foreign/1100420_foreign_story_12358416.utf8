	Peshawar, April 19 (Reuters): A suicide bomber attacked Pakistani police guarding a protest rally against power cuts in Peshawar today killing 23 people, police and government officials said.        
	The blast went off in the old city as the protest against power cuts organised by the Jamaat-i-Islami was breaking up, officials said.        
	A man blew himself up when policemen were sitting in their vehicles after the rally, said provincial information minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain. Several Jamaat officials were among the dead, said members of the party. The police said 23 people had been killed.

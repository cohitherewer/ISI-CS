The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 8-year-olds on pages of Facebook
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      8-year-olds on pages of Facebook
                            
	London, March 27: Children as young as eight have Facebook pages and use other social media websites, ignoring the age restrictions, according to an official report.        
	Ofcom, the media watchdog, said that one in five children, 19 per cent, between eight and 12 years old use social media sites such as Facebook, Bebo or MySpace. This is despite these sites officially having an age limit of 13. One in six parents didnt know their children are on social networks.        
	The report included internet audience data that showed that 37 per cent of home internet users aged between five and seven visited Facebook in October 2009. But it did not examine how many had profiles on the site. The figures are likely to once again spark a debate about how Facebook and other sites police the age of their users.

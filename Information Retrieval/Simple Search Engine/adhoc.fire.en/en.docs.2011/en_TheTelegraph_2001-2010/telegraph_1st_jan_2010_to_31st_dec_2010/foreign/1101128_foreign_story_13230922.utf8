The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | The Vanity Fair of al Qaida
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      The Vanity Fair of al Qaida
          BOB DROGIN                          The front cover of Inspire magazine                                  
	Washington, Nov. 27: As provocative headlines go, the editors of Inspire magazine chose a doozy for their inaugural issue last summer.        
	Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom, it promised. The author of the crude how-to guide was identified only as The AQ Chef. Thats AQ as in al Qaida.        
	The terrorist network long has exploited gory YouTube videos, fiery Facebook pages, hate-filled chat rooms, and other incendiary Internet websites to radicalise recruits and gloat over mass murder.        
	Now the media wing of al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, an offshoot group based in Yemen, is producing an online propaganda periodical that gives pop culture a lethal twist. Colour photos and glitzy graphics flank interviews of celebrity jihadists and reader-friendly stories, such as What to Expect in Jihad, complete with a packing list.        
	The slick English-language magazine, which posted its third issue this week, may appear like an Onion parody. But FBI and other counter-terror experts say it is no joke. The extremist rhetoric and blood-soaked Islamic imagery appears consistent with al Qaidas cult of death, and they believe it is authentic.        
	Its like the Vanity Fair of jihadi publications, said Bruce Hoffman, director of security studies at Georgetown University. Its glossy and snarky, and is designed to appeal to Generation Z.        
	Its Madison Avenue, terrorist style, agreed Yonah Alexander, terrorism specialist at the nonpartisan Potomac Institute for Policy Studies in Arlington, Virginia. Its much more sophisticated than what weve seen before.        
	The target audience, experts say, appears to be disaffected Muslims in the English-speaking world. The message: Embrace the mythology of martyrdom and take up arms against the infidel West.        
	Theyre not looking to outdo the readership of the Economist or Time magazine, said Bruce Riedel, a former senior CIA officer now at the nonpartisan Saban Center for Middle East Policy in the Brookings Institution. They only need to inspire one or two people to blow something up in the right place and theyll meet their start-up costs.        
	After Inspire first appeared in July, the FBI and the department of homeland securitys intelligence and analysis office warned in a report that it could appeal to certain western individuals and could inspire them to conduct attacks in the US in the future.        
	Al Qaida sees fertile ground for recruitment in Europe and North America, said Edward Turzanski, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. Thats where the jihad retains vibrancy.        
	But Andy Johnson, former chief of staff for the Senate intelligence committee, thinks the magazine mostly preaches to the converted. Does this really sell violent extremism and murderous plots to unsympathetic minds? he asked. I dont think so.        
	Inspire traces its lineage to a now-defunct Arabic-language magazine, called Al Jihad, that Osama bin Laden published in the 1980s before he gained infamy. But the chatty style and colloquial English of the new version suggests an American editor.        
	US intelligence officials suspect Samir Khan, a 24-year-old Pakistani American. A shy youth with a stutter, Khan ran a rabidly pro-al Qaida blog and website from his parentss home in Charlotte, North Carolina, after 2003.        
	Khan moved to Yemen last year and his byline is atop a first-person feature in Inspires second issue, published last month. Under the lurid headline I am proud to be a traitor to America, he described himself as al Qaida to the core.        
	US officials say the journal reflects the growing influence of Yemen-based Anwar Awlaki, a radical Muslim imam who was born in America and now seeks its violent destruction. The charismatic cleric is quoted at length in Inspires first two issues. US authorities have accused Awlaki of aiding in last years slaughter of 13 soldiers and civilians at Fort Hood, Texas, the botched Christmas Day bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner, and other deadly plots around the world.                             LOS ANGELES TIMES

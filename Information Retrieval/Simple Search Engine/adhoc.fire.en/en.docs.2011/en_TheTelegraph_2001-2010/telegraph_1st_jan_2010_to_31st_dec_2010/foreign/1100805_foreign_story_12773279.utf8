The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ahmadinejad survives bomb attack
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Ahmadinejad survives bomb attack

	Tehran, Aug. 4 (Reuters): Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was unharmed by an attack with a homemade explosive device on his motorcade during a visit to the western city of Hamadan today, a source in his office said.        
	He said Ahmadinejads convoy was targeted as he was travelling from Hamadans airport to give a speech in a local sports arena. The President was unhurt but others had been injured in the blast.         
	There was an attack this morning. Nothing happened to the Presidents car, the source told Reuters. Investigations continue ... to find out who was behind it.        
	But state media said only a firecracker had been set off by an young man excited to see the President and a police chief called news of an attack a big lie spread by foreign media.        
	Ahmadinejad, who has cracked down on the Opposition since a disputed June 2009 presidential election, appeared on live Iranian television at the sports stadium in Hamadan. He was apparently well and made no mention of any assault. The populist, hardline Ahmadinejad has accumulated enemies in conservative and reformist circles in the Islamic Republic as well as abroad.         
	Al Arabiya television said an attacker had thrown a bomb at Ahmadinejads convoy before being detained. Dubai-based Al Arabiya cited its own sources as saying the bomb had hit a car carrying journalists and presidential staff. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.        
	On Monday, during a speech to a conference of expatriate Iranians in Tehran, Ahmadinejad said he believed he was the target of an assassination plot by Israel. The stupid Zionists have hired mercenaries to assassinate me, he said.                  
	Ahmadinejads government is facing economic pain as new foreign sanctions imposed over Irans disputed nuclear energy programme bite on the worlds fifth biggest oil exporter.        
	One of Ahmadinejads trademarks has been constant travel around his vast country to deliver provocative speeches before outwardly adoring crowds who shout death to Irans foes.        
	The oil market initially reacted calmly to reports of the attempted attack.         
	I expect that any backlash there might be from Ahmadinejad will be far more important to the oil market than the initial attack itself, said Paul Harris, head of natural resources risk management at Bank of Ireland.         
	You would expect the oil market to react if there is any attempt to link the attack to the current tensions with the West and the ramping up of sanctions.        
	Baqer Moin, a London-based Iran expert, said Hamadan was a stable area without any notable ethnic or local tension.        
	Lets wait and see who they accuse, an internal or an external enemy, Moin said.        
	Several armed groups opposed to the government are active in Iran, mostly fighting in the name of ethnic Kurds in the northwest, Baluch in the southeast and Arabs in the southwest.        
	The banned Mujahideen Khalq, listed by the US as a terrorist group, carried out several anti-government attacks after the 1979 Islamic revolution. It was blamed for two 1981 bombings that killed dozens of senior officials in Tehran, including the President and Prime Minister.        
	Shahin Gobadi, French-based spokesman for the Mujahideen, now part of an Opposition coalition known as National Council of Resistance of Iran, denied involvement.        
	Asked if his group was behind the attack, he said: Absolutely not, absolutely not. It has nothing to do with us. I dont know what happened but it has nothing to do with us.        
	Ahmadinejad recently sought to isolate rival political factions by declaring that the regime has only one party, which is the velayat  a reference to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

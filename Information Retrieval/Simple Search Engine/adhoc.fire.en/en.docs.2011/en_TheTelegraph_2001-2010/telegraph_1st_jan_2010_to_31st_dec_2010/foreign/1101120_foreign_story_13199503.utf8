	Rome, Nov. 20 (AP): Italys culture ministry today defended Premier Silvio Berlusconi for giving ancient marble statues in his office replacement body parts.        
	The ministry, which is led by a close ally of the premier, said in a statement theres no cause for alarm: The hand added to Venus and the penis added to Mars are attached by magnets and can be removed without damage.        
	For decades, restorers have widely agreed that missing parts of ancient statues should not be recreated.        
	 Rome daily La Repubblica quoted Vatican Museums director Antonio Paolucci as saying that its a pity restorers didnt say no to Berlusconis request to add parts to the 2nd century statues in Chigi Palace, the premiers office. But Berlusconis personal architect insisted that the restoration of the missing parts was based of scans of other works with similar poses.

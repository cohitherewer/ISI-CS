The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama trip
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama trip
                            
	Jakarta, Nov. 8 (Reuters): President Barack Obamas twice-postponed visit to Indonesia looked on track today after flights to the capital returned to normal following a weekend of disruptions caused by a deadly volcano.        
	Mount Merapi in central Java began spewing lava, superheated gas and deadly clouds of ash two weeks ago, and has so far killed over 130 people and forced the evacuation of nearly 300,000. Dozens of flights to and from the capital Jakarta, around 600km from the volcano, were cancelled over the weekend after the volcano belched fresh clouds of volcanic ash 6,000 metres into the atmosphere.        
	Indonesian authorities said conditions were safe, but international airlines scrapped scores of flights.        
	By this afternoon normal service had mostly resumed, though Filipino budget airline Cebu Air Inc said it had cancelled its 1330 GMT flight to Jakarta. All have returned to normal, said Andang Santoso, a spokesman for the operator of Jakartas Sukarno-Hatta airport. They trust us that there is no impact of Merapi here, so they can fly here. Authorities did, however, order the closure of the airport at Yogyakarta, the historic cultural city closest to the volcano.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Oil from spill oozes ashore in Louisiana
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Oil from spill oozes ashore in Louisiana

	Mouth of the Mississippi River, April 30 (AP): Oil from a massive spill was oozing ashore in the US today and rough seas could push it even faster into fragile wetlands as officials worked frantically to try to contain what could become the worst US environmental disaster in decades.        
	About 795,000 litres of oil a day was spewing from a well drilled by the BP-operated rig the Deepwater Horizon, which exploded in flames April 20 and sank two days later off the Louisiana coast.        
	As the oil began to come ashore in Louisiana late yesterday, the National Weather Service predicted winds, high tides and waves tomorrow that could push oil deep into the inlets, ponds and lakes that line the states southeast. Seas of about 2 metres were pushing tides several feet above normal towards the coast, compounded by thunderstorms expected in the area later.        
	By today, rescue crews had begun cleaning the first bird found coated with oil. Workers with Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research said they found the young northern gannet offshore, not on the shoreline. Oil clumps seabirds feathers, leaving them without insulation  and when they preen, they swallow it.        
	The oil sheen measured about 113km by 210km as of yesterday, and officials expected to update that figure today.        
	The Coast Guard was working with BP to deploy floating booms, skimmers and chemical dispersants, and set controlled fires to burn the oil off the waters surface. The Pentagon approved the use of two Air Force planes to dump chemicals on the oil spill, which civilian planes have already been doing.                    
	President Barack Obama today directed that no new offshore oil drilling leases be issued unless rigs have new safeguards to prevent a repeat of the explosion that unleashed the massive spill threatening the Gulf Coast with major environmental damage.        
	Obamas declaration was not expected to have any immediate impact. Under the expanded leasing plan Obama announced a month ago, the first offshore leases would be issued off the Virginia coast in 2012 at the earliest. Adviser David Axelrod said earlier today no additional drilling has been authorised and none will until we find out what has happened here.        
	Faint fingers of oily sheen began reaching the Mississippi river delta late yesterday, lapping the Louisiana shoreline in long, thin lines. Thicker oil was farther offshore. Officials have said they would do everything to keep the busy Mississippi river  the largest US river, running up the countrys middle  open to traffic. The well about 65km offshore is leaking at such a pace that it could eclipse the worst oil spill in US history  the 42 million litres that leaked from the grounded tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaskas Prince William Sound in 1989.         
	It could take three months to drill a relief well and plug the gushing well 1,500 metres underwater, and the tapped well has the potential to produce much more oil than a single tanker like the Valdez.        
	Coast Guard Rear Adm. Sally Brice-Hara faced questions on all three network television morning shows today about whether the government has done enough to push BP to plug the underwater leak and protect the coast.         
	Brice-Hara said the federal response led by the Coast Guard has been rapid, sustained and has adapted as the threat grew since a drill rig exploded and sank last week, causing the seafloor spill. Eleven workers were missing and presumed dead.         
	The oil slick imperils hundreds of species of fish, birds and other wildlife along the Gulf Coast, one of the worlds richest seafood grounds, teeming with shrimp, oysters and other marine life.        
	Wildlife officials said they had set up protective boom around some of the most vulnerable areas.        
	It is of grave concern, David Kennedy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press about the spill. I am frightened. This is a very, very big thing. And the efforts that are going to be required to do anything about it, especially if it continues on, are just mind-boggling.        
	 The leak from the ocean floor proved to be far bigger than initially reported, contributing to a growing sense among some in Louisiana that the government failed them again, just as it did during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. President Obama dispatched cabinet officials to deal with the crisis.

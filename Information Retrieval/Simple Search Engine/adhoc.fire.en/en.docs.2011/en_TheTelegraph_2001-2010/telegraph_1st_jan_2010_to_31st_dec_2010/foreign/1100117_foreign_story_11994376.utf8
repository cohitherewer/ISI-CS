The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Haiti gives US airport control
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Haiti gives US airport control
                                  
	Washington, Jan. 16 (Reuters): Haiti gave the US control of its main airport yesterday to bring order in the skies to aid flights from around the world and speed relief to the quake-traumatised Caribbean nation, the Obama administration said.        
	US state department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters that Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive signed a memorandum of understanding formally transferring operations at Toussaint LOuverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. Obviously we will assume this responsibility as long as its appropriate and to the point where the Haitian government is able and ready to resume that capability, Crowley said.        
	The modest airport became a bottleneck almost immediately after Tuesdays devastation as the world rushed help to the impoverished nation. Regional authorities believe as many as 200,000 people were killed in the quake. Waves of military and civilian planes loaded with food and water, medicine, and rescue crews poured into the small Haitian air space but many flights circled for hours before landing or were diverted.        
	While a 9,000-foot runway can handle the biggest jetliners arriving heavy with cargo and the tarmac escaped serious damage, the Port-au-Prince airport was compromised by a severely damaged control tower and limited facilities. The US Air Force landed on Wednesday and immediately worked with Haitian authorities.

	Aug. 11: Scientists claim to have discovered the secret of what makes something funny.        
	For generations psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud thought that humour stemmed from a release of tension, or from a feeling of superiority or incongruity.        
	But new research from the University of Colorado suggests that humour stems from a benign violation of the way the world ought to be.        
	Psychoanalysts said previous theories such as superiority fell short because if someone accidentally killed their spouse it was not funny.        
	They set out to prove their theory that the social abnormality had to be harmless by asking volunteers to act out a series of scenarios. In one, a US sausage magnate hired a rabbi to promote new pork products, and in another, he hired a farmer as the spokesman.        
	Because the rabbi presented a moral violation, it was seen as out of place and more likely to make the reader laugh. A psychological distance from a moral violation is also more likely to result in the audience being amused, according to the study published in the journal Psychological Science.        
	A separate scenario saw a church and a credit union raffling off an Sport Utility Vehicle to attract new members. The church raffle was seen as a violation of the norm, but non-churchgoers were more likely to see it as funny.

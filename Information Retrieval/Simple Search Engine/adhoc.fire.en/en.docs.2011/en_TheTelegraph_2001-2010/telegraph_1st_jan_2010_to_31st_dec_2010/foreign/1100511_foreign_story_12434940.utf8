The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BA crew plan 20-day strike
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      BA crew plan 20-day strike

	London, May 10 (Reuters): British Airways cabin crew are to hold 20 days of strike action in a long-running industrial dispute over pay and working conditions, the Unite union said today.        
	The first action, the third wave of strikes by BA staff this year, will begin on May 18 and run until May 22. There will be further strikes on May 24 to 28, May 30 to June 3 and June 5 to 9.        
	Passengers and investors alike will be dismayed that British Airways management rejected an approach by the union over the weekend, after their offer had been comprehensively turned down by their own employees, Unites joint general secretaries Derek Simpson and Tony Woodley said in a statement.        
	Cabin crew are left with no choice but to take further strike action, they said, adding the seven days until the first strike gave BA bosses sufficient time to reopen negotiations.        
	Unite said it would also hold a further ballot of BA cabin crew for industrial action over issues arising from the companys conduct during the dispute. The union, which represents about 90 per cent of BAs 12,000 cabin crew, said 81 per cent of those balloted had voted against BAs latest offer last week.         
	BA, which last month sealed its long-awaited merger with Spains Iberia, is aiming to save $97 million a year to counter falling demand, volatile fuel prices and greater competition.         
	It has estimated the seven days of walkouts in March cost it 45 million in cancelled flights and contingency provisions, including hiring other aircraft complete with staff.        
	Last months volcano ash-related disruption cost it around 20 million a day in revenue.

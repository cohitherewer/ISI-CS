The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tight deadline for new Speaker
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Tight deadline for new Speaker

	Nov. 3: In leading his party to mid-term triumph, Representative John A. Boehner, the next Speaker of the House, is not at the endgame. He is at the beginning of the next and harder fight.        
	Relying on his decades of experience with the inner workings of the House, Boehner, of Ohio, now has less than two years to show that the Republican Party is the antidote to what ails Washington, with a discordant caucus, a stagnant economy, a hostile White House with veto power and the long shadow of 1994 all looming before him.        
	His promises on behalf of the new House majority  reducing the size of government, creating jobs and fundamentally altering the way the Congress conducts its business  are mostly as lofty as they are unspecific. His efforts to legislate them into reality must be done with ambitious upstarts within his own party and a fresh crop of Tea Partiers.        
	The demands on Boehner from voters are many and not all consistent. There is a craving, polling shows, to see the current system upended, but preferably without gridlock or rancour. Voters want federal spending curtailed, but jealously guard costly entitlements.

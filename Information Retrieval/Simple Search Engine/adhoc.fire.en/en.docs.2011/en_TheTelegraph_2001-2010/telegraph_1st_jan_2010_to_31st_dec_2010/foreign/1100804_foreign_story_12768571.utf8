	Hong Kong, Aug. 3 (Reuters): Teenagers who spend excessive amounts of time on the Internet are one and a half times more likely to develop depression than moderate Web users, a study in China has found.        
	Researcher Lawrence Lam described some of the signs of excessive use spending at least five to more than 10 hours a day on the Web, agitation when the teens are not in front of the computer and loss of interest in social inter- action.        
	Some spend more than 10 hours a day, they are really problematic users and they show signs and symptoms of addictive behaviour ... browsing the Internet, playing games, said Lam, co-author of the paper which was published today. They cant get their minds off the Internet, they feel agitated if they dont get back on after a short period of being away, the psychologist at Sydneys University of Notre Dames School of Medicine said in an interview.

	London, March 26 (Reuters): Swedish supergroup Abba may perform again nearly 30 years after they split, the former male members of the band hinted today.        
	 Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus said an intimate one-off performance that could be screened around the world could be a possibility. Yeah, why not? said Andersson. I dont know if the girls sing anything any more, he added.

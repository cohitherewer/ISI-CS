The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | EU warns Italy as trash piles up in Naples
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      EU warns Italy as trash piles up in Naples

	Rome, Nov. 22 (Reuters): EU inspectors touring the rubbish-strewn streets of Naples said today that Italy had failed to make good on pledges to solve the citys chronic garbage crisis and warned EU funds would be frozen until it did.        
	More than 10,000 tonnes of trash has piled up in and around Italys third biggest city as available dumps are near saturation point, and the only existing incinerator is still not working at full capacity.        
	Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis government was forced to scrap plans for a new landfill near Naples without an alternative solution after a month-long protest by residents complaining an existing site had led to a foul stench and toxic waste being dumped near their houses.        
	Berlusconi pledged last month to solve the latest emergency within days, but TV images of Neapolitans holding their noses or covering their faces as they walk past shoulder-high mounds of trash provide stark evidence the crisis has grown worse.        
	Two years on (from the latest crisis) the situation has not changed much. Garbage is in the streets, and there is no plan for separate waste collection and disposal, said Pia Bucella, head of a team of European Union inspectors visiting the city.

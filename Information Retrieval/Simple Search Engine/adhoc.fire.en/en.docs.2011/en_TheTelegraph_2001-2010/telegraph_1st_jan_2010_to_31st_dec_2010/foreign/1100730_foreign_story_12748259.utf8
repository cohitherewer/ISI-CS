	San Francisco, July 29: Another woman has claimed that she was raped by the film director Roman Polanski.        
	Edith Vogelhut, a former model, said that she went to Jack Nicholsons house with Polanski after a dinner party in 1974. They had a drink before Polanski gave her an Ecstasy pill, handcuffed her and anally raped her repeatedly, she claimed.        
	She has filed a report with the Los Angeles district attorney, prompted by allegations from the British actress Charlotte Lewis, who claimed in May that Polanski assaulted her when she was 16.        
	Vogelhut, a magazine editor, was 21 at the time of the alleged crime. She is writing a book about her life as a model, with a chapter devoted to the alleged rape. She told the celebrity website RadarOnline: I kept quiet for many reasons. I was humiliated, I had absolutely no one to tell.

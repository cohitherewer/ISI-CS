The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Craig wants another shot at Bond
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Craig wants another shot at Bond
                            
	Aug. 14: Daniel Craig is in Western wear these days on the New Mexico set of Cowboys and Aliens, but he cant help but wonder whether he will ever don James Bonds tuxedo again.         
	Its out of my hands, the British actor said during a break from shooting. Im ready and willing, and if I get the call, Ill be there.        
	Its not clear when  or even if  that call will come. The fiscal crisis at MGM has suspended the cinema spys license to kill and, as Steven Zeitchik has reported, there may also be some discord among the current creative team about the direction of the next film.        
	 Craig is eager to tie up the loose ends in the plot with a third film, but he seemed to have more questions than answers about the topic. You probably know more than I do, Craig said. It is what it is. Unless MGM can sort themselves out, we cant make a movie.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Toyota settles with crash family
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Toyota settles with crash family
          NICK BUNKLEY                      A Lexus Sedan                          
	New York, Sept. 19: Toyota has reached an out-of-court settlement with relatives of a family killed when the Lexus sedan they were driving sped out of control and crashed, an accident that put a national spotlight on the sudden acceleration problems that later prompted the automaker to recall millions of vehicles.         
	Toyota confirmed the settlement on Saturday in a statement but did not provide the amount of the settlement or any other details.         
	Through mutual respect and co-operation we were able to resolve this matter without the need for litigation, the statement said.         
	The crash, which happened in August 2009 near San Diego, California, was documented with gripping evidence that drew nationwide attention. A backseat passenger called emergency telephone number 911 to say that the driver, an off-duty highway patrol officer named Mark Saylor, was unable to stop the 2009 Lexus E350, which went as fast as 120 miles per hour on a freeway before hitting another vehicle and landing in a ravine.         
	Saylor, 45, his wife, Cleofe, 45, and their 13-year-old daughter Mahala died, along with Cleofe Saylors brother, Chris Lastrella, 39. It was Lastrella who told the 911 operator that the cars pedal was stuck and ended the call by saying: Hold on and pray. The car was on loan from the nearby Bob Baker Lexus dealership while Saylors car was being repaired.         
	The settlement, according to Toyotas statement, resolves product liability claims by the Saylor and Lastrella families against Toyota and the dealership. The families have separate claims against the dealership that were not covered.         
	Two months after the crash, Toyota began a recall that eventually covered 5.4 million vehicles globally in which the automaker said the driver-side floor mat could trap the accelerator pedal. It later recalled 4.5 million vehicles in which the pedals themselves were determined to be defective. Some vehicles were covered by both recalls, for a total of about eight million vehicles.         
	In February this year, Toyotas chief executive, Akio Toyoda, apologised to Congress and to the Saylors family, saying he would do everything in my power to ensure such a tragedy never happens again.         
	The recalls hurt Toyotas sales and damaged its reputation for building high-quality, reliable vehicles. Thousands of complaints poured in to federal regulators from drivers who said their Toyota-made vehicles accelerated suddenly. In April, the government fined Toyota a record $16.4 million for waiting too long to initiate a recall. The complaints are tied to at least 93 deaths.         
	Toyota is continuing to defend itself against class-action lawsuits filed by Toyota owners and relatives of people who died in crashes alleged to have resulted from sudden acceleration. The company could face billions of dollars in liabilities if it loses the cases.         
	Preliminary results released in August from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations investigation into the sudden-acceleration complaints revealed that in many of the crashes the vehicles on-board data recorders showed no evidence that the drivers had used the brakes. The findings suggest that some drivers were mistakenly pressing on the accelerator pedal instead of the brake.

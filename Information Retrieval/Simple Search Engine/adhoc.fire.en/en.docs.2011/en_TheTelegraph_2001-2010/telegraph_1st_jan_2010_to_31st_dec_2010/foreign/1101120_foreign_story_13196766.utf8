                              ONE ENTITY                            
	London, Nov. 19 (PTI): Theirs is one of the longest surviving marriages of tinseltown and David and Victoria Beckham have turned to yoga to keep the flame burning in their 11-year-long marriage.         
	The football star and the former Spice Girl take power yoga classes together at a Beverly Hills centre to get in tune with each other.        
	Victoria and David do power yoga classes for couples, for an hour about twice a week. They started taking the classes about a year ago. Its a very intimate experience. You have to learn to become one entity entirely. You stretch, breathe and move as one, said a source close to the couple.         
	The couple who have three sons together, Brooklyn, 11, Romeo, 8, and five-year-old Cruz, also incorporate other spiritual techniques which they believe brings them closer.         
	Theres also meditation and reiki healing involved, which is an ancient hands-on energy technique. They also chant mantras together added the source.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Child labour slur on Philip Morris
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Child labour slur on Philip Morris

	Moscow, July 14: One woman said children as young as 10 working in the fields developed red rashes on their stomachs and necks as they harvested tobacco for use in cigarettes made by Philip Morris.        
	Another migrant labourer working in the tobacco fields in Kazakhstan said a farmer confiscated her identification papers and withheld pay to force her to continue working despite dismal conditions.        
	Human Rights Watch, the group best known for documenting governmental abuse and war crimes, plans to release a report showing that child and forced labour is widespread on farms that supply a cigarette factory owned by Philip Morris International in Kazakhstan, in Central Asia.        
	While child labour should be condemned in any setting, the report said, employing children on tobacco farms is particularly hazardous because tobacco field labourers are exposed to high levels of nicotine while doing their jobs.        
	Only a tiny fraction of Philip Morriss global tobacco purchases are made in the country, and no tobacco raised on the farms employing child labour went into cigarettes sold outside former Soviet countries. Philip Morris, after being provided with an advance copy of the report, said it agreed to sweeping changes in its purchasing policies in Kazakhstan.        
	Philip Morris International is firmly opposed to child labour, Peter Nixon, a spokesman, said in a telephone interview from the companys office in Lausanne.        
	Although child labour is widespread in agriculture in Central Asia, Human Rights Watch said, the particularly harmful environment on the Kazakh tobacco farms warranted special attention. The report cited conditions it said were dangerous to children and adults alike. Lacking easy access to potable water, for example, labourers had resorted to drinking from irrigation channels contaminated with pesticides, the report said.        
	The group interviewed 68 tobacco farm employees in one district of Kazakhstan during the harvest last autumn, identifying them only by their first names and initials.        
	All, including the children, were migrant labourers from neighbouring Central Asian countries, mostly from impoverished Kyrgyzstan. The report also documented violations of basic farm safety rules, like labourers wearing open-toed shoes while working with sharp hoes. Human Rights Watch researchers documented 72 instances of children working in the Kazakh tobacco fields, which employ about a thousand migrants each season. Many are paid on a piecework basis, by the ton of harvested tobacco.         
	The group said this was an inducement for parents to bring their children into the fields at harvest time. A company like Philip Morris certainly has the resources to put an end to these practices, Jane Buchanan, a senior Human Rights Watch researcher, said in an interview.

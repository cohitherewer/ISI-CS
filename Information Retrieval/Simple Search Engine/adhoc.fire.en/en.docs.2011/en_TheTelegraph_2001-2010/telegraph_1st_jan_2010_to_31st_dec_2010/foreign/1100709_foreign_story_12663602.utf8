	Los Angeles, July 8 (AP): A slew of Lindsay Lohans recent drug tests were clean, but her fingernails definitely are not.        
	The day after the actress was sentenced to serve 90 days in jail began with news outlets focused on the four-letter message painted on Lohans middle fingers, which she prominently displayed during Wednesdays court hearing.        
	The day ended with the release of a court filing that detailed whats in Lohans medicine cabinet  a mix of legally prescribed anti-depressants, a powerful painkiller and heartburn medication.        
	Photos taken by a courtroom photographer of the expletives stencilled on Lohans fingers left many to question the stars attitude and the sincerity of her apology to the judge on Tuesday.        
	Lohan insisted in a Twitter posting on Wednesday afternoon that the message wasnt meant for the judge doling out the punishment. It had nothing to do w/court, Lohan wrote. Its an airbrush design from a stencil.        
	Regardless of why it got there, the message is unlikely to have any impact on Lohans court case when she turns herself in on July 20.        
	Inscribing fingernails with messages is an emerging trend with the younger set, said celebrity manicurist Jenna Hipp, adding that she wrote a secret message beneath Gabourey Sidibes manicure when the Precious star was preparing for the Oscars.        
	Kids are just starting to play a little bit more with their fingernails, Hipp said. Now with Lindsay doing it, of course, its going to go crazy.        
	Amid all the nail-gazing on Wednesday, Lohan did receive a bit of a reprieve. Another judge agreed to delay an upcoming civil trial that stems from one of the actresss 2007 arrests until after she is out of jail.        
	There are no signs the case is going to settle, which leaves Lohan one more reminder of two turbulent months in 2007 that saw her arrested twice and three years later, is keeping her in the spotlight.        
	Neither Lohans manicure nor her medicines led to her return to jail, but both revelations are hints of the intense scrutiny facing the starlet in the coming months.        
	In addition to jail time, Lohan will also have to check into an inpatient rehab programme for three months and continue seeing a probation officer after that.        
	She will also have to continue random drug and alcohol testing similar to the six screenings Lohan has undergone since missing a court date in late May.        
	The results of those tests found no illicit drugs or alcohol, according to a probation officers report released on Wednesday. The screenings detected traces of the Adderall, which is used to treat attention hyperactivity disorder, and the powerful painkiller Dilaudid, which the report indicated was for Lohans dental pain.        
	It did not indicate how often Lohan is taking the medications but it stated she had valid prescriptions for all of them. She told the officer she has been taking the medications for as long as she can remember.        
	Lohans medicines will be getting a closer look too. The judge assigned two doctors to evaluate Lohan and report back whether alcohol has any adverse reactions with the medications.        
	The actress has been co-operative and had a positive attitude when showing up for the tests and hoped to put the nearly three-year-old criminal case behind her, the report stated.

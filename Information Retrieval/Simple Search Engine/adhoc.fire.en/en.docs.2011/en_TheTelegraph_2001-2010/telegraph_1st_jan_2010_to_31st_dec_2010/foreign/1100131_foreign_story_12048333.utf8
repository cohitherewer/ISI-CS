The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China threatens sanctions on US firms
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China threatens sanctions on US firms

	Beijing, Jan. 30 (Reuters): China threatened to impose sanctions on US arms firms and cut cooperation with Washington unless it cancels a $6.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan, in an unprecedented move signalling Beijings growing global power.        
	China today bitterly denounced the Obama administrations announcement a day earlier that it planned to sell the package of weapons to Taiwan, a self-ruled island that Beijing views as an illegitimate breakaway province.        
	The dispute deepens the rifts between Beijing and Washington, also at odds over trade, currency, Tibet and the Internet.        
	Beijing said it would sanction US companies that sold arms to Taiwan, a break with past practice. Chinas commercial reprisals have in the past been informal.        
	The US will shoulder responsibility for the serious repercussions if it does not immediately reverse the mistaken decision to sell weapons to Taiwan, Chinese vice-foreign minister He Yafei told US ambassador to China Jon Huntsman in comments reported on the foreign ministrys website (www.mfa.gov.cn).        
	The dispute threatens to damage broader diplomacy between the two permanent members of the UN Security Council. Washington has sought Chinas backing in pressuring Iran and North Korea and in fighting climate change, and is preparing for a world summit on nuclear weapons in April.        
	It will be unavoidable that cooperation between China and the US over important international and regional issues will also be affected, the Chinese foreign ministry said, without specifying those issues.        
	Chinas defence ministry said military exchanges would be put on hold and Beijing postponed vice-ministerial-level talks on security, arms control and non-proliferation.        
	The military freeze could rule out a visit to China by US defence secretary Robert Gates. Military contacts between the two powers are limited and were last suspended by China in 2008 over US arms sales to Taiwan.        
	China will certainly make the US pay for its weapon sales to Taiwan more than before, said Jin Canrong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing. China might test new weapons to underscore its anger, he added.        
	The Obama administration told the US Congress yesterday of the proposed sales, which include Black Hawk helicopters, Patriot Advanced Capability-3 anti-missile missiles and two refurbished Osprey-class mine-hunting ships. The Black Hawk is built by Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp. The Patriot missile is built by Lockheed Martin Corp.        
	China will also impose corresponding sanctions on US companies that engage in weapons sales to Taiwan, the foreign ministry said. There have been no signs Beijing will try to use its huge pile of US dollar assets to pressure Washington.

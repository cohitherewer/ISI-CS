	Tehran, Oct. 26: Iran said today that it had begun loading the first of 163 fuel rods into the core of its first nuclear reactor, set to go into operation early next year, and vowed to pursue nuclear activities in other areas.        
	Irans nuclear programme has spread deep concerns in the West because governments, including the US, do not accept Tehrans insistence that it has no ambitions to build a nuclear weapon.        
	Ramin Mehmanparast, a foreign ministry spokesman, said today: Political pressure and sanctions have not prevented Iran from proceeding with its peaceful nuclear activities according to schedule.        
	The Bushehr power plant is a major project which will help us to take one step towards future alternative energy supplies, he said, according to the semiofficial Irna news agency. We will also pursue our peaceful nuclear activities in other areas. He did not give details.        
	The loading of fuel at the Russian-built Bushehr plant in the south of the country was initially supposed to begin soon after fuel was transported to the reactor in August, but was delayed by a leak. Iranian officials have denied that the delay was caused by a computer virus on the laptops of several employees at Bushehr.        
	Speaking to workers at the plant, the head of Irans Atomic Energy Organisation, Ali Akbar Salehi, said the Bushehr facility is the most exceptional power plant in the world and it is right now at the critical stage of transferring fuel into the core of the reactor which is the last stage of the process.        
	Salehi said that the plant would begin to feed the national power grid within three months.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

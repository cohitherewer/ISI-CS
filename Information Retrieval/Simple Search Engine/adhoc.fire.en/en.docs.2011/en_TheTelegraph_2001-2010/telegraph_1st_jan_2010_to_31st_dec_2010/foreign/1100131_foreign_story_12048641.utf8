The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Facebook profile can damage job prospects
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Facebook profile can damage job prospects
          ANDY BLOXHAM                              
	London, Jan. 30: Jobseekers have been warned that their Facebook profile could damage their employment prospects, after a study found that seven in 10 employers now research candidates online.        
	 According to new figures released by Microsoft, the computer firm, Facebook and Twitter checks are now as important in the job selection process as a CV or interview.        
	The survey, which questioned human resource managers at the top 100 companies in the UK, US, Germany and France, found that 70 per cent admitted to rejecting a candidate because of their online behaviour.        
	 But HR bosses also said that a strong image online could actually help job hunters to land their dream job.        
	Peter Cullen, of Microsoft, said: Your online reputation is not something to be scared of, its something to be proactively managed.        
	These days, its essential that Web-users cultivate the kind of online reputation that they would want an employer to see.        
	Facebook faux pas include drunken photographs, bad language, and messages complaining about worklife.        
	Farhan Yasin, of online recruitment network Careerbuilder.co.uk, said: Social networking is a great way to make connections with job opportunities in 2010 and promote your personal brand across the Internet.        
	People really need to make sure they are using this resource to their advantage, by conveying a professional image.        
	But Yasin cautioned job seekers to be aware of their online image even after landing the perfect job, after their own research found that 28 per cent of employers had fired staff for content found on their social networking profile.        
	He added: A huge number of employers have taken action against staff for writing negative comments about the company or another employee on their social networking page.

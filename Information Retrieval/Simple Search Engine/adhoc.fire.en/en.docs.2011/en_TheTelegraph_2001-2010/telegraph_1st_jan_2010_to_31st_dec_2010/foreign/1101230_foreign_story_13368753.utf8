The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pakistan ruling party in crisis talks
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pakistan ruling party in crisis talks
                              Under pressure                            
	Islamabad, Dec. 29 (AP): Pakistans US-allied ruling party scrambled today to keep its fragile coalition government in power as its senior leaders met two dissident political partners, urging them to rejoin the cabinet.        
	A leader of one of the disgruntled parties, however, reiterated demands that the Prime Minister quit or be fired.        
	The political turmoil threatens to distract Pakistani lawmakers from tackling the nations serious challenges, including a struggling economy and an Islamist insurgency that is also affecting a US-led war in neighbouring Afghanistan.        
	The Pakistan Peoples Party-led government faces a crisis with the secular Muttahida Qaumi Movement party quitting its two cabinet posts but remaining in the ruling coalition for now, while the Islamist Jamiat Ulema Islam party said it would defect to the Opposition benches.        
	If the MQM decides to follow the JUI into the Opposition, it could cost Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani the parliamentary majority he needs to continue his almost three-year-old government.        
	 In an effort to forestall a possible collapse, interior minister Rehman Malik, a senior PPP lawmaker and envoy of President Asif Ali Zardari, held crisis meetings with MQM and JUI leaders yesterday, urging them to support an increasingly unpopular government and to remain part of the policy-making cabinet.        
	Information minister Qamar Zaman Kaira said yesterday the PPP was close to resolving its differences with both junior coalition partners.        
	We will give you good news soon, Kaira told The Associated Press. He also extended an olive branch to the MQM, saying: We promise that we will address their genuine concerns.        
	 Kaira did not elaborate on those concerns, although MQM chief Altaf Hussain has publicly complained that the PPP has failed to consult on major policy decisions and has failed to curb corruption, which is endemic in Pakistans public and private sectors. JUI leader Maulana Fazlur Rehmans aide, Hafiz Hussain Ahmad, however, said their party would only return to the government if Zardari sacked Gilani, explaining that the premier must be punished for stirring up tensions when he dumped a JUI lawmaker from his cabinet.        
	The JUI has refused an offer to nominate a replacement minister from its ranks.        
	We will only consider working with the ruling party if President Asif Ali Zardari sacks Gilani, Ahmad said yesterday following Rehmans meeting with Malik in the capital Islamabad.        
	 Kaira suggested that Gilanis leadership remained solid, saying he had been elected Prime Minister in 2008 unopposed by any challenger.        
	Kaira also suggested that JUI did not want to force an early election by bringing down the government, saying the party would not take a decision that harmed democracy. Pakistans parliaments have rarely last a full five-year term. Neither Malik nor an MQM spokesman were available for comment yesterday.

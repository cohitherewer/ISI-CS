The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thailand extends emergency 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Thailand extends emergency 
                            
	Bangkok, July 6 (Reuters): Thailand today extended a state of emergency imposed in about a third of the country during recent bloody political protests, saying anti-government elements continued to pose a threat.        
	The protests, mainly involving supporters of an ousted Prime Minister, turned violent in April and May. Ninety people were killed and almost 2,000 wounded, raising fears for stability in Southeast Asias second-biggest economy.        
	Calm has been restored but the government says some in the red shirt movement may attempt to provoke further trouble. We have been informed there are people who continue to try to spread false information to spur hatred and instigate unrest, said Ongart Klampaiboon, minister to the Prime Ministers office.        
	Ongart, speaking after a cabinet meeting, said the state of emergency would be lifted in five provinces that have seen little political activism but would continue in Bangkok and 18 of the countrys 76 provinces for another three months.        
	Critics say that while the government calls for reconciliation between deeply divided political blocs, it is stifling opposition with arrests, censorship and emergency rule.        
	Businesses, tour operators and rights groups have called for the special law to be dropped. The government could justify it in times of violence but now that it is over, civil rights should be restored. Threats should be dealt with using normal law, Niran Pithakwatchara of the National Human Rights Commission told Reuters.

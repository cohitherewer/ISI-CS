The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gillard brings back ousted Kevin Rudd
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Gillard brings back ousted Kevin Rudd
                                Julia Gillard, Kevin Rudd                           
	Sydney, Sept. 11 (AP): Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was named today as Australias new foreign minister, a high-profile and coveted posting that will be seen as a consolation prize for being ousted from the leadership.        
	Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who narrowly won elections last month just weeks after toppling Rudd in an internal Labour Party insurrection, made the appointment as part of several changes to her cabinet.        
	Rudd, 53, is well qualified for the foreign minister post. Before entering politics he was a senior diplomat and spent years working and studying in China  one of Australias most important trade and diplomatic partners. He speaks fluent Mandarin.        
	He replaces Stephen Smith who was foreign minister for three years while Rudd was Prime Minister. Smith was named defence minister in todays shuffling of posts.        
	Gillard was Rudds deputy until June, when she unseated him in an internal party vote, saying she believed the government had lost its way. She announced a handful of major policy changes, then called elections that resulted in an almost drawn result with the conservative coalition.        
	Gillard last week completed a deal with independents and minor party lawmakers that allowed her to lead Australias first minority government in almost 70 years.        
	Gillard publicly promised Rudd a senior post in her government if it were re-elected.        
	After initially being blamed for a series of leaks that damaged Labour during the election campaign, Rudd campaigned heavily for Gillard, helping to stem a strong swing in votes away from the government in his home state of Queensland.        
	Gillard announced the cabinet changes in a statement today that listed Rudd as foreign minister but did not otherwise mention him.        
	Rudd said he was honoured to be made foreign minister and played down the potential for differences with Gillard. There are national interests in this country which extend far beyond the personal interests of any individual, that applies to me as well, Rudd said.

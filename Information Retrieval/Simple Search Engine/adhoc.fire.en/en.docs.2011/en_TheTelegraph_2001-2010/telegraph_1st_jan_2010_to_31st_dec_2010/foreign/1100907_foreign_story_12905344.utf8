The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Labour calls for hacking probe
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Labour calls for hacking probe

	London, Sept. 6: Senior Opposition politicians are calling on the government to respond to renewed accusations that Downing Streets chief communications officer, Andy Coulson, encouraged reporters to illegally intercept messages from the mobile phones of public figures when he was editor of The News of the World.        
	At the same time, a number of people whose phone messages may have been intercepted by the tabloid during Coulsons tenure are accusing the Metropolitan Police of failing to fully examine all the evidence in its criminal investigation in 2006 and 2007.        
	Lord Prescott, a Labour politician who was the deputy Prime Minister under Tony Blair and who has been named as one of hundreds of people whose phones may have been hacked, said the police had never provided him with a sufficient explanation of what happened.        
	I have been far from satisfied with the Metropolitan Polices procedure in dealing with my requests to uncover the truth about this case, Lord Prescott told The Observer newspaper.         
	Today, Coulson said he would be happy to speak to the police if they wanted to pursue the allegations. Police have said they will consider any new evidence and home secretary Theresa May said that was the right approach.        
	Alan Johnson, a Labour MP and a former home secretary, announced that he would review the home office papers relating to the case to see whether the matter should be brought to the Inspectorate of Constabulary, which monitors the police..        
	Lord Prescott was responding to an article published by The New York Times magazine on Wednesday and in print yesterday about the scandal. In 2007, The News of the Worlds royal editor, Clive Goodman, and an investigator employed by tabloid, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed after pleading guilty to having illegally intercepted voice mail messages of Prince William and Prince Harry and their chief royal aides.        
	Coulson, who was appointed editor of The News of the World in 2003, said that he had no knowledge of the hacking and that it was an isolated case, but resigned from the paper in January 2007.        
	Last year, The Guardian newspaper printed an article saying that hundreds of people might have been singled out by the tabloid and providing details about some of them, including Gordon Taylor, former chief executive of the Professional Footballers Association, who reached a settlement of 700,000 with the tabloid over the hacking of his mobile phone.        
	The Times Magazine article provided new details, quoting a former reporter, Sean Hoare as saying that Coulson was fully aware of the hacking.                                   NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

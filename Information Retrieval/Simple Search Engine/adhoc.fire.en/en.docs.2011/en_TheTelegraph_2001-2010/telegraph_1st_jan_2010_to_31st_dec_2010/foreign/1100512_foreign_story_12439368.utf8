	Mirren double    
	London, May 11: Dame Helen Mirren was introduced to her waxwork double at Madame Tussauds  and reckoned her husband wanted to marry it, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The respected actress said her director husband Taylor Hackford was taken with the silent lookalike, unveiled in London. She said: My husband wants to marry her; Im much more argumentative than she is.      
	The 150,000 model has been dressed in one of Dame Helens floor-length black dresses.

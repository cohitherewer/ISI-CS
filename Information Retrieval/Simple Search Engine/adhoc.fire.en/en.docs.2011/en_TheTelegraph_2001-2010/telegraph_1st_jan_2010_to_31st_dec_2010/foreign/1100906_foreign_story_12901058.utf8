	New York, Sept. 5: Craigslist, the classified advertisement website, has blocked access to its adult services section and replaced the link with a black label showing the word censored.         
	The issue touches upon one of the most prominent controversies in the debate over free speech on the web, where anyone can easily and anonymously post anything: just how much responsibility does a website have for what is posted by its users, or for potential criminal activity that results from the posts?         
	Law-enforcement officials and groups opposed to human trafficking have been critical of Craigslist, saying that the adult ads helped facilitate prostitution and the selling of women against their will.         
	Craigslist, which is based in San Francisco, did not respond to requests for comment, and it was unclear whether the block represented a permanent shift in policy or a temporary protest against the outside pressure on the company, which has lasted for years.         
	Last month the attorneys general from 17 states sent a letter to Craigslists chief executive, Jim Buckmaster, and its founder, Newmark, asking the company to immediately remove the adult services section.         
	The company, while promising to provide more rigorous oversight of the ads, has defended its right to run them and says it is protected under federal law, a position that judges and legal experts have generally backed.         
	They can absolutely keep it up. The law is pretty crystal clear on this, said M. Ryan Calo, a senior research fellow at the Stanford Law Schools Center for Internet amp; Society. Whats happened here is the states attorneys general, having failed to win in court and in litigation, have decided to revisit this in the court of public opinion, and in the court of public opinion, they have been much more successful.         
	Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general who helped lead the effort against Craigslist, said by phone that these prostitution ads did not promote a victimless crime. There is human trafficking in children, assaults on women.         
	He said he was pleased that Craigslist appeared to be doing the right thing voluntarily but added that his office would continue to monitor the site and was trying to determine if Craigslist was closing the section permanently.         
	The ads in the adult section, which cost $10 to post and $5 to repost, are a big revenue source, analysts say. Adult ads are expected to bring the company $45 million in revenue this year.        
	Some Internet law analysts said Craigslist could be sending more than one signal  that it was both capitulating to law enforcement and thumbing its nose at it.         
	There are multiple ways in which to censor speech  one is directly through the courts, and the other is through a form of protest that says, even if you can do this, stop doing it, said Thomas R. Burke, a lawyer at Davis Wright Tremaine who specialises in Internet law and is not involved with Craigslist. Maybe their point in saying they were censored is that people need to understand the law better.         
	Craigslist has taken steps to appease critics before. But criticism has continued, fuelled by prominent cases like that of Philip Markoff, a Boston medical student who was charged with murdering a woman he had met on Craigslist. He pleaded not guilty, and he died in jail last month in an apparent suicide.

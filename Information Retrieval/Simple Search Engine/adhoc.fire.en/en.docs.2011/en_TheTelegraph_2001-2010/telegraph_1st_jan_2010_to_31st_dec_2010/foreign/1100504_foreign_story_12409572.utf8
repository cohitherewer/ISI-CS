	Berry mystery    
	 London, May 3 (PTI): Just a day after her split with model Gabriel Aubry, Halle Berry made a public appearance with a new mystery man.      
	Berry, 43, was seen holding hands with an unknown man while leaving the Broadway play Fences which stars Denzel Washington, reports the Daily Mail. It comes a day after Aubry, who has a daughter Nahla, 2, with the actress, confirmed the end of their relationship.

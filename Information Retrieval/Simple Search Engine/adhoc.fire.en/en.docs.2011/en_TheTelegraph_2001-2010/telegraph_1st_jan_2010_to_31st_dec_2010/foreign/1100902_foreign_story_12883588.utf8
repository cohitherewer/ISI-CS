The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Diana was a manipulator like me, says ex-PM
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Diana was a manipulator like me, says ex-PM

	Sept. 1: When Diana, the Peoples Princess died, Tony Blair felt a duty to protect the monarchy from itself.        
	Diana, Princess of Wales was down to earth, charming and intelligent, but also stubborn and prone to be over-emotional, says Blair. He recalls meeting the princess at Chequers in July 1997, the month before she died, saying he felt an uneasiness about her relationship with Dodi Fayed but could not put his finger on why.         
	We were both, in our own way, manipulators  good at grasping the feelings of others and instinctively playing on them.        
	Giving his first account of what happened on the night she died, Blair says he was woken at 2am on August 31, 1997, by a police officer at the end of his bed, who told him that Diana had been badly injured.        
	He knew from the beginning that her chances of survival were poor, and was told of her death at 4am. Blair says that, without wishing to sound callous, he wanted to manage the situation and shape the public grief that would follow. It was difficult because there were no conventions for the death of a person such as the Princess of Wales. He prepared his now famous Peoples Princess speech on the back of an envelope with the help of Alastair Campbell.        
	 He felt that the royal familys lack of response to the princesss death was dangerous for them in the face of a massive outpouring of public grief and felt a duty to protect the monarchy from itself.        
	He says he did his best, even though some members of the establishment did not like who he was and what he represented. Blair felt that he could not be direct with the Queen about the gravity of the situation so he spoke to the Prince of Wales, who agreed with him and said he would tell the Queen that Blair thought that she should make a public statement. She agreed. He spent a lot of time alone with the Queen and says it was hard for her to accept the public perception that he was telling her what to do. He did not know the Queen well then and they were both ill at ease with one another.

	Rome, June 17: Michelangelo concealed anatomical sketches in the robes and faces of the figures he painted on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in a coded attack on the churchs disdain for science, researchers believe.        
	The cleverly disguised drawing of a human brain, which has remained unnoticed for 500 years, may have been a coded reference to the clash between science and religion.        
	The Renaissance master, who painted the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel between 1508 and 1512, would have been familiar with what a brain looked like  he was an accomplished anatomist who is known to have dissected many corpses.        
	According to two American neuroscientists, the image of the brain is ingeniously hidden in the depiction of Gods neck and chin in Separation of Light From Darkness, which depicts the first act performed by God in the creation of the universe.        
	It is one of nine panels on the Sistine Chapels ceiling based on scenes from the Book of Genesis.        
	Art historians have long speculated that the strange, lumpy appearance of the figures neck may represent a goiter. But Ian Suk and Rafael Tamargo, of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, believe instead that it bears a striking resemblance to the crevices and creases of a human brain.        
	Stunningly, following Michelangelos outline, one can draw into Gods neck and beard an anatomically correct ventral depiction of the brain, they write in the scientific journal Neurosurgery.        
	We propose that Michelangelo, a deeply religious man and an accomplished anatomist, intended to enhance the meaning of this ... panel and possibly document his anatomic accomplishments by concealing this sophisticated neuro-anatomic rendering within the image of God.        
	They also believe that an odd-looking, vertical fold in the crimson robe worn by the figure of God represents the spinal cord, and that a mysterious Y-shaped fold at his waist may be an optic nerve.        
	Leonardo da Vinci had produced a detailed study of optic nerves 20 years previously in 1487, a study which Michelangelo may well have seen when the two worked in Florence at the same time.        
	The new thesis may explain something that has puzzled art critics for centuries  the peculiar lighting of Gods neck. Most of the fresco is illuminated from the lower left of the panel, but the neck is lit head-on and slightly from the right, casting different shadows. Suk and Tamargo argue that, far from being a clumsy error by Michelangelo, the peculiar angle deliberately enhanced the anatomical components of the brain.

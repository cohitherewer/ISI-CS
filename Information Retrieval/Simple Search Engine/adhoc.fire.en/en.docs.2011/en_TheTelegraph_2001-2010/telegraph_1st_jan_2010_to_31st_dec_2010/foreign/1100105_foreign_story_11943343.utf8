	London, Jan. 4: A vaccine for leukaemia is about to be tested on human patients for the first time, in a breakthrough which could offer hope to thousands.        
	British researchers have developed a treatment that can be used to stop the disease returning after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplant. Eventually it is hoped the drug, which activates the bodys own immune system against the leukaemia, could be used to treat other types of cancers.         
	The first patients will be treated in the New Year as part of a small clinical trial at Kings College London. The patients in the trial have the form known as Acute myeloid leukaemia, the most common form in adults. Even with aggressive treatment half would usually find the disease returns.        
	The idea behind cancer vaccines is not necessarily to prevent the disease. Instead, once a patient has been diagnosed, the vaccine programmes the immune system to hunt down cancer cells and destroy them. The vaccine then prompts the immune system to recognise leukaemia cells if they return which prevents a relapse of the disease. The vaccine is created by removing cells from the patients blood and manipulating them in the laboratory. The cells are given two genes which act as flags to help identify the leukaemia. It effectively focuses and boosts the immune systems ability to seek out and destroy cancer cells.        
	The research is due to be published in the Journal of Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy shortly. Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells and bone marrow.

	Seoul, May 27: North Korea said today that it was cutting off a naval hot line used to prevent clashes on its disputed sea border with South Korea, even as Seoul conducted a large naval drill in a show of force after the apparent sinking of one of its ships by a North Korean submarine.        
	Cutting the phone line, installed after deadly skirmishes in 1999 and 2002, raises the chances of an armed clash in tense western waters  something the North has said could happen any time. The two sides have disagreed on the line for a western sea border since the 1950-53 Korean War.         
	Today, North Koreas military said it would completely nullify a 2004 inter-Korean accord aimed at preventing accidental armed skirmishes along the disputed western sea border  a scene of three bloody maritime battles in the past decade. The agreement called for both navies to communicate through a common radio frequency and maintain a phone line to handle emergencies.        
	We will immediately deliver a physical strike at anyone intruding across our maritime demarcation line, the Norths state-run news agency KCNA quoted a senior military official as saying, referring to the Norths self-proclaimed sea border, which juts deeply into South Korean-held waters.        
	Tension on the divided peninsula has escalated since a team of international investigators said last week that a North Korean submarine torpedoed the Cheonan, a South Korean navy corvette, killing 46 sailors, in waters south of a western sea border drawn unilaterally by the UN after the war.         
	The South defends the border, but the North rejects it.        
	The Norths warnings today came as a fleet of 10 South Korean warships, including a 3,500-ton destroyer, conducted an exercise far below the disputed waters. Shells pounded the sea and columns of water erupted as anti-submarine depth charges exploded during the one-day exercise.

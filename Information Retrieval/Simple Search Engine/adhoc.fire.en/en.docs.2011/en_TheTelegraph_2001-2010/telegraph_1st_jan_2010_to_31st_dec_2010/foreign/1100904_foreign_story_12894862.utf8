	Islamabad, Sept. 3: A blast ripped through a Shia protest in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta today killing at least 60 people and wounding 100, police and rescue officials said.        
	It came just two days after three suicide bombers struck a Shia procession in Lahore, killing 31 people and setting off violent demonstrations by infuriated survivors.        
	It was not immediately clear whether the bomb was detonated by a suicide bomber or a remote-controlled device. A Pakistani Taliban commander told The Associated Press that his group carried out the attack.        
	The attack was aimed at a procession of Shias who were part of nationwide marches to mark Al Quds Day, an annual protest to express solidarity with Palestinians and to condemn Israel.        
	Today, the demonstrators were passing through a commercial neighbourhood of Quetta when the blast occurred.         
	The Pakistani news network GEO broadcast a video that showed people falling to the ground and scrambling for cover immediately after the explosion. A few people were shown firing into the smoke-filled air. The explosion led to further protests as grieving mourners went on rampage, clashing with the police and setting fire to vehicles and motorcycles parked nearby.        
	The wounded were immediately ferried to Combined Military Hospital, Quetta District Hospital and Civil Hospital for treatment.        
	The deliberate targeting of innocent Pakistanis and worshippers during the holy month of Ramazan, and while the country is recovering from the terrible monsoon flooding, makes these acts particularly vicious, the US embassy in Islamabad said in a statement. Moreover, attacks on minority communities are attack on the foundation of democracy itself.        
	The floods have complicated the fight against militants. Islamic charities, some with suspected links to militants, were quicker to deliver relief to flood victims.        
	Militants are intensifying their violent attacks to pressure a government that has been struggling to cope with devastating monsoon-driven floods, described as the worst in the countrys history.        
	Shia leader Allama Abbas Kumaili said the attacks were a result of government failure and appealed to participants to remain peaceful despite anger that led to local unrest after the bombing. We understand these are attempts to set Sunni and Shiite sects against each other, he said.

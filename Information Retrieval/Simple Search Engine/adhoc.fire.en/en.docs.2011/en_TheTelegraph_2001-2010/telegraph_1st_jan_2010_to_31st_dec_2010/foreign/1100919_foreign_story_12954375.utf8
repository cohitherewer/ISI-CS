	London, Sept. 18: Greatest Briton will be tweeting, the former Prime Ministers estate has announced.        
	The estate of Sir Winston Churchill has launched its own iPhone app and is to use social media to bring the former Prime Ministers wit and wisdom to a wider audience, it has been announced. Facebook and Twitter profiles have been set up, and an iPhone app will go on sale for 1.19, with all proceeds going to the Churchill Estate.        
	Randolph Churchill, Sir Winstons great-grandson, said that the application was the first accurate guide to the best of his sayings. It shows just how relevant his thoughts remain.        
	 The new forays into social media are based on the work of historian and Churchill expert Richard Langworth. There is not a day when Sir Winston is not quoted in one way or another, whether by Presidents, Prime Ministers, or by people in their everyday lives, said Churchill.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pressure on Pentagon to trim budget
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pressure on Pentagon to trim budget
          THOM SHANKER AND CHRISTOPHER DREW                          The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia                                  
	Washington, July 23: After nearly a decade of rapid increases in military spending, the Pentagon is facing intensifying political and economic pressures to restrain its budget.        
	It set up the first serious debate since the terrorist attacks of 2001 about the size and cost of the armed services.        
	Lawmakers, administration officials and analysts said the combination of big budget deficits, the winding down of the war in Iraq and President Obamas pledge to begin pulling troops from Afghanistan next year were leading Congress to contemplate reductions in Pentagon financing requests. Defence secretary Robert M. Gates has sought to contain the budget-cutting demands by showing Congress and the White House that he can squeeze more efficiency from the Pentagons bureaucracy and weapons programmes and use the savings to maintain fighting forces.        
	But the increased pressure is already showing up in efforts by Democrats in Congress to move more quickly than senior Pentagon officials had expected in trimming the administrations budget request for next year.        
	And in the longer term, with concern mounting about the governments $13 trillion debt, a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission is warning that cuts in military spending could be needed to help the nation dig out of its financial hole.        
	Were going to have to take a hard look at defence if we are going to be serious about deficit reduction, said Erskine B. Bowles, a chief of staff to President Bill Clinton who is a co-chairman of the deficit commission. Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire who is also on the debt commission, said that if the panel pushes for cuts in discretionary spending, defence should be looked at, perhaps through another base-closing commission.        
	 Gates is calling for the Pentagons budget to keep growing in the long run at 1 per cent a year after inflation, plus the costs of the war. It has averaged an inflation-adjusted growth rate of 7 per cent a year over the last decade (nearly 12 per cent a year without adjusting for inflation).         
	So far, Obama has asked Congress for an increase in total spending next year of 2.2 per cent, to $708 billion  6.1 per cent higher than the peak under the Bush administration. Gates is arguing that if the Pentagon budget is allowed to keep growing by 1 per cent a year, he can find 2 per cent or 3 per cent in savings in the departments bureaucracy to re-invest in the military  and that will be sufficient money to meet security needs.         
	In one of the paradoxes of Washington budget battles, Gates, even as he tries to forestall deeper cuts, is trying to kill weapons programmes he says the military does not need over the objections of members of Congress who want to protect jobs.        
	Gates enjoys bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and has considerable sway within the administration. But while he may hold the line against major cuts for now, analysts say support for military spending could erode quickly once the Pentagon withdraws a substantial number of troops from Afghanistan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 26/11-style blitz cloud hangs over Europe
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      26/11-style blitz cloud hangs over Europe

	London, Sept. 29: Intelligence officials in London last night revealed they had foiled a Mumbai-style attack by Pakistan-based terror groups.        
	In Paris, the Eiffel Tower was evacuated following a bomb threat amid reports that al Qaida and associated groups were planning a co-ordinated blitz on European cities.        
	The terror threat in the UK remains at substantial which means British security services believe an attack is a strong possibility. But they stopped short of raising the threat level to severe which would have been the case had they feared an attack is highly likely.        
	The CIA apparently took pre-emptive action killing some of the ringleaders allegedly involved in a number of terror plots, using 20 drone strikes in Pakistans Federally Administered Tribal Areas that neighbours Afghanistan.         
	It is hard to connect all these events but it is being suggested that some of the people who were targeted were planning the attacks in London, Paris and other western cities along the lines of the 26/11 terror strikes in Mumbai.        
	A British official would not confirm the Mumbai-style attack plot was al Qaida inspired but confirmed there was an Islamist connection and that the plots were at an early stage.         
	French police yesterday closed off surroundings to the Eiffel Tower. Bomb experts combed through the 324-metre tower and found nothing unusual and tourists were let back in about two hours. This is the second time in a fortnight that the monument has been evacuated.        
	Last week, French authorities said they had uncovered a suicide-bombing plot to attack the Paris subway linked to al Qaidas north African affiliate. They said the threat might be connected to Frances recent vote to ban the wearing of burqas .        
	However, German officials yesterday denied that they had intercepted similar threats, saying there has been no change to the countrys threat level.        
	Security expert and former CIA officer Robert Baer said he believed the latest threat to the West may be linked to the US-led attacks on Haqqani insurgents, allies of the Taliban in Waziristan.        
	Last week, the US secretary for homeland security Janet Napolitano warned there was increased activity by a more diverse set of groups and a more diverse set of threats... directed at the West generally.        
	According to analysts, the disclosure that the security authorities in London and Paris have taken pre-emptive action is both good and bad for India: good because the ability of the terror groups to undertake operations has been undermined but this could force them to seek softer targets nearer home.

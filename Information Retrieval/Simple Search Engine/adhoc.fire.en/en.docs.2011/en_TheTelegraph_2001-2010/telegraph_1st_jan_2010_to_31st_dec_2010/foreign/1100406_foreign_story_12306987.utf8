The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Priest accused of US abuse still in India
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Priest accused of US abuse still in India
                                  
	New Delhi, April 5 (AP): A Catholic priest charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Minnesota is working in his home diocese in India and has no plans to return to the US to face the courts, he and his bishop told The Associated Press today.        
	Church documents obtained by the AP show the Vatican was alerted to the accusations against the Rev. Joseph Palanivel Jeyapaul more than three years ago but, according to the bishop, the Most Rev. A. Almaraj, did not take any part in disciplining him.        
	The priest has received only a minor punishment and is currently working in his bishops office processing teacher appointments for a dozen church schools in the diocese of Ootacamund in southern India.        
	We cannot simply throw out the priest, so he is just staying in the bishops house, and he is helping me with the appointment of teachers, said Almaraj, the bishop of Ootacamund. He says he is innocent, and these are only allegations.... I dont know what else to do.        
	Almaraj emphasised that Jeyapaul was engaged in only paperwork, nothing to do with the children or anything.        
	The main group of clerical abuse victims in the US has scheduled a news conference fin St Paul, Minnesota, to draw attention to the Jeyapaul case and demand he be suspended and returned to face justice in the US.        
	The group, Survivors Network for those Abused by Priests, has been campaigning recently to draw attention to what it considers the Vaticans complicity in cases of abusive priests being moved around dioceses to avoid criminal prosecution.        
	The Vatican has denounced such accusations and has blamed the media for what it calls a smear campaign against the pope.        
	The Vatican has insisted Pope Benedict XVI takes such accusations seriously and cracked down on abuse in 2001 by ordering dioceses to inform the Vatican of all such cases.         
	Jeyapaul is currently wanted on two counts of criminal sexual conduct stemming from accusations he assaulted a young, female parishioner in the autumn of 2004 at the Blessed Sacrament Church in Greenbush, Minnesota, where he was working. Each charge carries a sentence of up to 30 years.        
	According to the criminal complaint, the teenage girl accused Jeyapaul of threatening to kill her family if she did not come into the rectory, where he then forced her to perform oral sex on him and groped her in the autumn of 2004. In a telephone call with The Associated Press, Jeyapaul denied the charges.        
	It is a false accusation against me, he said. I do not know that girl at all.        
	He said he had no intention of facing the charges, and Almaraj said the church had never discussed asking him to return to the US to appear in court. No steps were taken. Nobody talked about that. Nobody asked about that, Almaraj said.        
	At the time the accusations against Jeyapaul first surfaced in 2005, the priest had returned home to visit his ailing mother and officials in Minnesotas Crookston diocese told him he should stay in India, Jeyapaul said.        
	On December 21, 2006, Monsignor Victor Balke, the-then bishop of the Crookston diocese, wrote about the accusations against Jeyapaul to both Cardinal William Levada, prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and the Most Rev. Pietro Sambi, Apostolic Nuncio, the Vaticans ambassador, to the US. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is the Vatican office that handles all abuse cases.        
	I hope that for the good of the Church you are able to reach a speedy resolution to this case, he wrote to Levada.

                              Prachanda: Cornered                            
	Kathmandu, Nov 12 (PTI): Maoist leaders have accused party chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, of promoting corruption and blamed him for a lack of transparency in financial matters.         
	In separate documents submitted to the party ahead of the Unified Communist Party of Nepal-Maoists extended central committee meeting on November 21, the vice-chairman, Mohan Vaidya, and deputy, Baburam Bhattarai, said a neo-feudal group has emerged within the party because of protection given to smugglers and illegal traders by party leaders.        
	They said the former Prime Minister has accumulated crores of rupees through corrupt practices, the Nepali Nagarik daily said.         
	The paper added that Vaidya and Bhattarais allegations were submitted to the party headquarters three months ago as they refused to endorse the document presented by Prachanda.         
	A negative message has spread among the party cadre because of the allegation of horse trading (during the Prime Ministers election) and the lack of transparency in the partys accounting system, the Nagarik quoted Bhattarai as saying.

	London, Oct. 2: A British Airways jumbo jet was forced to make an emergency landing minutes after taking off from Heathrow airport.        
	The Boeing 747 flight from London to New York, with 296 people on board, was grounded after a warning light in the cockpit indicated one of the doors was not completely closed. The aeroplane returned to the airport after the fault was noticed at 9.20am today, and made a full emergency landing.        
	People living in Wimbledon, in southwest London, reported seeing a low-flying aircraft as flight BA117 turned in the air and returned back to west London. It landed after a total of 11 minutes in the air. All the passengers walked free from the plane.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | EU sanctions on Iran
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      EU sanctions on Iran
                            
	Brussels, July 26 (Reuters): The EU imposed tighter sanctions on Iran over its disputed nuclear programme today, approving measures to block oil and gas investment and curtail Tehrans refining and natural gas capability.        
	The restrictions go well beyond sanctions imposed by the UN last month and mirror steps taken by the US this month to apply extra pressure on Tehran to return to talks.

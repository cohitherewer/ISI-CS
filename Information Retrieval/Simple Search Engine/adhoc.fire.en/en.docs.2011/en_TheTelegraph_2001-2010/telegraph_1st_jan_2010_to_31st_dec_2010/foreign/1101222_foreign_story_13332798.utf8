	Fat Anne    
	London (PTI): Actress Anne Hathaway has no qualms in piling up pounds for a role if the script demands her character to be bigger. The Oscar-nominated actress, who played the role of a Parkinsonspatientin Love amp; Other Drugs, lost some weight for her part to showcase the effects of medication, but would have easily have put on the pounds if the role required. When it came time to decide how the character would look I did a lot of research into the side-effects Parkinsons medication would have on the human body and I actually found that in the majority of the cases it would cause people to lose weight so that was kind of the jumping off point for how she would look in the film.     
	Moss jinx    
	 London (PTI): Supermodel Kate Moss is looking for a new home after moving out of her $15 million mansion because she believes it to be jinxed. Moss, 36, had spent a considerable amount of money on repairing the accident-prone seven-bedroom house in the Highgate area, reports The Sun. Kate spent big money giving her old place a makeover after it was burgled, then flooded. But she still never quite felt at home there and called it her jinxed house, a source said.

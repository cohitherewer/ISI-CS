The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Last US combat brigade rolls out of Iraq
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Last US combat brigade rolls out of Iraq

	Khabari Crossing (Kuwait), Aug. 19 (AP): A line of heavily armoured American military vehicles, their headlights twinkling in the pre-dawn desert, lumbered past the barbed wire and metal gates marking the border between Iraq and Kuwait early today and rolled into history.        
	For the troops of the 4th Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, it was a moment of relief fraught with symbolism but lightened by the whoops and cheers of soldiers one step closer to going home.        
	Seven years and five months after the US-led invasion, the last American combat brigade was leaving Iraq, well ahead of President Barack Obamas August 31 deadline for ending US combat operations there.        
	When 18-year-old Specialist Luke Dill first rolled into Iraq as part of the US invasion, his Humvee was so vulnerable to bombs that the troops lined its floor with flak jackets.        
	Now 25 and a staff sergeant after two tours of duty, he rode out of Iraq this week in a Stryker, an eight-wheeled behemoth encrusted with armour and add-ons to ward off grenades and other projectiles.        
	Its something Im going to be proud of for the rest of my life  the fact that I came in on the initial push and now Im leaving with the last of the combat units, he said.        
	He remembered three straight days of mortar attacks outside the city of Najaf in 2003, so noisy that after the firing ended, the silence kept him awake at night.         
	He recalled the night skies over the northern city of Mosul being lit up by tracer bullets from almost every direction.        
	Now, waiting for him back in Olympia, Washington, is the Big Boy Harley-Davidson he purchased from one of the motorcycle companys dealerships at US bases in Iraq  a vivid illustration of how embedded the American presence has become since the invasion of March 20, 2003.        
	 That presence is far from over. Scatterings of troops still await departure, and some 56,000 will stay another year in what is designated as a noncombat role. They will carry weapons to defend themselves and accompany Iraqi troops on missions (but only if asked). Special forces will continue to help Iraqis hunt for terrorists.        
	So the US death toll  at least 4,415 by Pentagon count as of yesterday  may not yet be final.        
	The Stryker brigade, based in Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state and named for the vehicle that delivers troops into and out of battle, has lost 34 troops in Iraq. It was at the forefront of many of the fiercest battles, including operations in eastern Baghdad and Diyala province, an epicentre of the insurgency, during the surge of 2007. It evacuated troops at the battle of Tarmiyah, an outpost where 28 out of 34 soldiers were wounded holding off insurgents.        
	The US military kept a tight lid on security, restricting the media embedded with the US troops from reporting on the brigades movements until they were almost to the border.

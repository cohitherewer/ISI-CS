The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 16 years in US and a jolt 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      16 years in US and a jolt 
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Saad (left) with his friends in the US                                  
	Dhaka, Aug. 8: Saad Nabeel, a 19-year-old brought up in the US for the past 16 years, is now holed up in a flat in Dhaka, trying to make sense of an alien home and a blur of events that put him on a flight to Bangladesh despite being chosen for a green card.        
	The right and wrong involved in Saads case are too complex to be separated easily.         
	The Bangladeshi boy, who had lived in the US since the age of three, was deported to Dhaka as an illegal immigrant on January 4. Two months earlier, he was told that his familys application for green cards had been approved.        
	Saad cannot go back because before his deportation, he was made to sign what the teen said was a document that made him acknowledge the fact that he could not return to America for 10 years.        
	If I refused to sign, (US immigration officials said) I would be criminally charged and kept in prison, the engineering student of the University of Texas told The Telegraph in his heavy American accent in his first comments to the mainstream media since his deportation.        
	For the past seven months, Saad, whose parents too have been deported, has hardly stepped out of his Dhaka flat provided by his mothers relatives, suffering bouts of depression in a country whose culture and language are Greek to him.        
	He still calls America home, and says a special someone is waiting for him there, though he has begun to believe that a long-distance relationship is tough to work out.        
	I came to Dhaka with just a bag of clothes. I hardly ever go out; I have nowhere to go to. I listen to music and chat with friends (in America) online, which I cant do too often because of frequent power outages, he said.        
	How did the mix-up take place, with one arm of the US government chucking him out while the other was shaping into an embrace?        
	The problem in the US is that immigration officials here make their own rules depending on which side of the bed they have got up in the mornings, said Ralph Isenberg, an immigration activist based in Dallas, Saads home state, who is trying to help the teenager.        
	Each state has a different rule. It was unfortunate for Saad that he lived in Dallas. If he were in Illinois, he and his family would have still been in the US. The Dallas immigration office is the worst  they take pleasure in causing foreign nationals pain.        
	There could be an irony here. After Saads father Mohammad Tarique, who had fled to America in 1994 with his wife and then three-year-old son fearing political persecution, was denied asylum in 2002, he had shifted home to avoid being deported, moving to the Dallas suburb of Frisco from Los Angeles, California.        
	Saad would not even reveal his Dhaka address to this newspaper, saying the threat of persecution was still real.        
	At one time my father was involved in politics. Since his party isnt in power, the threat is still there.        
	Tarique, who was the CEO of a German garment company in Bangladesh before fleeing to the US, had sought political asylum citing a threat to his life from the then government in Dhaka.        
	After eight years of filing appeals, the family was finally told there would be no asylum. But Saads young age, 11, perhaps saved the family from immediate deportation or imprisonment.        
	Under US law, the boy had the right to remain in the country till he turned 18, and the government had the discretion of allowing his parents to stay on to look after him. Tarique applied for green cards, which would grant the family the status of permanent residents, and moved to Dallas.        
	We were told by family and friends to keep off the (governments) radar, Saad said.        
	The boy enjoyed a normal life like any American his age, receiving his high school diploma and a full scholarship from the University of Texas, Arlington, to study electrical engineering. He lived on campus and made friends.        
	In 2008, my father was taken away by immigration officials and kept in jail for 42 days and released with an ankle monitor (which sends signals about a persons location and movements).        
	Saad turned 18 on January 21, 2009. He could have been deported any day after that but seems to have been overlooked, perhaps because of the immigration backlog in the US.        
	In November, good news came from the immigration authorities: the green cards had been approved. (We were told the green cards) would reach us by January 2010 we would be fine, Saad said.        
	Then Tarique made what appears in hindsight to have been a mistake. He drew attention to the family by asking the authorities for an extension of the permission to live in the US and informing them the green cards were due in January. But the 2002 deportation order was still alive.        
	He was arrested and a notice was issued to deport us. They said we had already taken too many extensions (three), Saad said.        
	Now these green cards can be issued only when the family gets the 10-year ban waived.        
	Saad has one hope  an error that he says the US officials made while deporting him. I am trying to get the 10 year bar removed as, under the law, it was never supposed to be applied to me, he said.

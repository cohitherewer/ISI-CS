	New tattoo    
	London (PTI): David Beckham has added another tattoo, a black and white image of Jesus Christ, to his huge collection of body art. Beckham, 34, already has 17 tattoos on his body but decided to get the latest one to pay a tribute to his grandfather Joe West, who died recently. The new image, drawn on Beckhams lower right abdomen, is based on a painting called The Man Of Sorrows by Catholic artist Matthew R Brooks.

	Pirate forever    
	 London, March 5 (PTI): Actor Johnny Depp says he will be happy to reprise his Pirates of the Caribbean role forever because he just loves his character, Captain Jack Sparrow.       
	Depp does not want to stop making pirate films and is amazed he is able to work on something he loves so much, reports Parade magazine.      
	I cant wait to get back in costume. Some people will say: Aha, Depp sold out by doing the sequels. But it was never an issue for me. I love Captain Jack so much Id do Pirates 7 if they asked me, Depp said.    
	Keira stage    
	 London (PTI): Actress Keira Knightleys stint in the West End production, The Misanthrope, may have got a mixed response from critics, but the star is keen to spend more time on stage. Knightley says she enjoys working in the theatre as she gets more time to embrace her character than she does when she shoots a film, reports the Daily Express.    
	Nicole loss    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Teen star Selena Gomez has replaced actress Nicole Kidman in Monte Carlo after producers decided to give the script a more youthful spin. Kidman, 42, was set to star in the film in 2005, which originally followed the novels plot more closely.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez starts his own party
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pervez starts his own party
          AMIT ROY                      Musharraf in London (AP)                          
	 London, Oct 1: The former President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, today formally announced he has set up a new political party  the All Pakistan Muslim League.        
	 Though as a former army general he has been more secular than, say, his predecessor, Gen Zia-ul Haq, he has felt it necessary to include the word Muslim in the name of his party.        
	 According to analysts, the use of League suggests he wants to project himself as a latter day Jinnah to the beleaguered people of Pakistan who have been suffering in his absence.        
	 Musharraf, who led Pakistan for nine years from 1999 after taking power in a military coup and now lives in exile in London, accused Britain and America today of a failure of leadership over pressure to bring troops back from Afghanistan.        
	 He argued that the Taliban could be defeated, but only if western troops were not pulled out because political leaders feared unpopularity.        
	 He denied he faced charges of treason if he returned to his country and said he intended to do so, although he said he risked assassination.        
	 Musharraf told the BBC Radio 4s Today programme: There is a failure of leadership. Nobody is educating the people who are demanding their soldiers (should) come back that this would be the worst decision. This will be a blunder. People here or in the United States think you are fighting someone elses war.        
	 He went on: When the leaders do not tell the masses for political reasons, the mass appeal is to get your soldiers back, but that is not the right think to do.        
	Asked if he believed the Taliban could be defeated, he replied: Yes indeed. I think they can be defeated.        
	The general, who is guarded in London apparently at the expense of the UK government, vowed he would return to Pakistan: There is no charge against me. There are other dangers. I will take the risk but I will take the risk at the right time.        
	 Asked if the risk was assassination, he replied: A possibility, yes.        
	 In other words, love of country was greater than any possible ambition.        
	 Among those who might well back Musharraf is the former Pakistani High Commissioner in London, Maleeha Lodhi, who has come out against President Asif Ali Zardari though his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, was once one of her closest friends.

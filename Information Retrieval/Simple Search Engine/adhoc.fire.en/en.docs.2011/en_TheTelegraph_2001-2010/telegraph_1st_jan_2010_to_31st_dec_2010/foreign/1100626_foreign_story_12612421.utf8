The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak pursue Afghan foothold
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pak pursue Afghan foothold
          JANE PERLEZ, ERIC SCHMITT AND CARLOTTA GALL                          Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani                                  
	Islamabad, June 25: Pakistan is exploiting the troubled US military effort in Afghanistan to drive home a political settlement with Afghanistan that would give Pakistan important influence there but is likely to undermine US interests, Pakistani and American officials said.        
	The dismissal of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal will almost certainly embolden the Pakistanis in their plan as they detect increasing American uncertainty, Pakistani officials said.         
	The Pakistani Army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, preferred McChrystal to his successor, Gen. David H. Petraeus, whom he considers more of a politician than a military strategist, said people who had spoken recently with Kayani.        
	Pakistan is presenting itself as the new viable partner for Afghanistan to President Hamid Karzai, who has soured on the Americans. Pakistani officials say they can deliver the network of Sirajuddin Haqqani, an al Qaida ally who runs a major part of the insurgency in Afghanistan, into a power-sharing arrangement.        
	In addition, Afghan officials say, the Pakistanis are pushing various other proxies, with Kayani personally offering to broker a deal with the Taliban leadership.        
	Washington has watched with some nervousness as Kayani and Pakistans ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, shuttle between Islamabad and Kabul, telling Karzai that they agree with his assessment that the US cannot win in Afghanistan, and that a post-war Afghanistan should incorporate the Haqqani network, a longtime Pakistani asset.         
	In a sign of the shift in momentum, the two Pakistani officials were next scheduled to visit Kabul on Monday, according to Afghan TV.        
	Despite McChrystals 11 visits to Kayani in Islamabad in the past year, the Pakistanis have not been altogether forthcoming on details of the conversations in the last two months, making the Pakistani moves even more worrisome for the US, said an American official involved in the administrations Afghanistan and Pakistan deliberations.        
	They know this creates a bigger breach between us and Karzai, the American official said.        
	Though encouraged by Washington, the thaw heightens the risk that the US will find itself cut out of what amounts to a separate peace between the Afghans and Pakistanis, and one that does not necessarily guarantee Washingtons prime objective in the war: denying al Qaida a haven.        
	It also provides another indication of how Pakistan, ostensibly an American ally, has worked many opposing sides in the war to safeguard its ultimate interest in having an Afghanistan that is pliable and free of the influence of India.        
	The Haqqani network has long been Pakistans crucial anti-India asset and has remained virtually untouched by Pakistani forces in their redoubt inside Pakistan, in the tribal areas on the Afghan border, even as the Americans have pressed Pakistan for an offensive against it.        
	Kayani has resisted the American pleas, saying his troops are too busy fighting the Pakistani Taliban in other parts of the tribal areas.        
	But there have long been suspicions among Afghan, American and other western officials that the Pakistanis were holding the Haqqanis in reserve for just such a moment, as a lever to shape the outcome of the war in its favour.

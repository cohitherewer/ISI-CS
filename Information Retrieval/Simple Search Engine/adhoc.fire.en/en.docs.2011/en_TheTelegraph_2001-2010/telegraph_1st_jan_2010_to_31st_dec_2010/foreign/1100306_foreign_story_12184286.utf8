	Washington, March 5: Two police officers at the Pentagon were wounded last evening when a man walked up to the entrance of the complexs subway station and, without a word, opened fire on them, Pentagon officials said.        
	Police officers quickly returned fire, fatally injuring the gunman after hitting him once in the head and once in the shoulder. The gunman was identified as John Patrick Bedell, 36, according to a police official here assisting with the investigation.        
	The injured police officers, whose names were not released, were wearing ballistic vests and were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, according to Richard S. Keevill, the Pentagon police chief.         
	In a news conference this morning, officials said one of the officers had been struck in the shoulder and one in the thigh, and that both had been released from the hospital.        
	Pentagon officials said that the motive for the shooting remained unclear, but said the gunman appeared to have acted alone. It appears to be a single individual who had issues, Chief Keevill said this morning.        
	A police official said the gunman was seen on a surveillance video near the Pentagon talking to another man. But the official added that district police were informed almost immediately after the shooting that there was only one suspect.        
	The shooting took place at about 6.40pm at the entrance to the subway station across the street from the Pentagon building, which was the site of one of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.        
	Officials said the gunman approached the two officers at a security screening area outside the complex and reached into his pocket, pulling out what the officers thought would be a Pentagon pass. Instead, the man took out a handgun and started shooting at them, prompting the officers to fire back.        
	They said he walked up very cool, like there was no distress, Keevill said last night, quoting the officers. He had no real emotion in his face. Witnesses told news stations that they heard gunshots and saw people screaming and scrambling to get out of the area.        
	Investigators have found no immediate connection to terrorism, and the attack appears to be a case of a single individual who had issues, Keevill said.        
	He described Bedell as very well-educated and well-dressed, saying Bedell was wearing a suit when he showed up at the Pentagon entrance. Bedell was concealing two 9mm semi-automatic weapons and many magazines of ammunition.

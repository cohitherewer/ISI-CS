The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Canada visa row resolved
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Canada visa row resolved
          K.P. NAYAR                                    
	Washington, May 28: India and Canada today took swift ministerial action to prevent a row over visa denial to members of New Delhis security establishment from escalating into a crisis before Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs planned trip to Toronto next month.        
	Canadas citizenship and immigration minister Jason Kenney issued a statement in Ottawa which said his government deeply regrets the recent incident in which letters drafted by public service officials during routine visa refusals to Indian nationals cast false aspersions on the legitimacy of work carried out by Indian defence and security institutions, which operate under the framework of democratic processes and the rule of law.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna, who was in Karnataka engaged in a passport reform project across his home state, reciprocated without waiting to return to South Block and said the Canadians have expressed high regard for India. They have deeply regretted the recent letter drafted by low level officials on routine visa applications casting aspersions on security forces. We should consider the chapter closed.        
	Canada has made no promise to change its deliberately broad legislation or policy on admitting aliens who have served in military, militia, civil defence units, intelligence organisations or police forces of foreign countries.        
	However, Kenney has promised to review the admissibility policy within the legislation and admitted that letters issued by its officials explaining the reasons for visa refusals to Indian nationals cast false aspersions on the legitimacy of work carried out by Indian... institutions.        
	What this means is that those who were associated with Indias paramilitary forces or intelligence agencies may continue to be denied entry into Canada. However, the letters explaining the reasons for refusing visas will in no way question Indian institutions which operate under the rule of law and within a democratic framework.        
	In other words, if Fateh Singh Pandher, whose visa refusal triggered the current controversy, were to apply for permission to travel to Canada all over again, he may still be refused a visa, but the letter issued to him by the Canadians will no longer allege that Pandhers former employer, the Border Security Force, is a notoriously violent force responsible for systematic torture.         
	Kenneys statement insisted that as to the decision process itself, decisions on visa applications are made on a case-by-case basis by non-partisan public servants following an independent process based on Canadas immigration law as it currently stands. quot; This will continue to be the case.        
	The ministry of external affairs had raised the stakes in the dispute when foreign secretary Nirupama Rao intervened in the issue on Tuesday and said: quot;The matter, when it was brought to the attention of the ministry of external affairs, was taken up immediately and appropriately with the Canadian High Commission and, of course, the Canadian Government. We take this matter very seriously. quot;        
	Krishna then told reporters yesterday: quot;We have conveyed to the Canadian government that the letter issued by the Canadian High Commission to serving or retired officers of our security forces and other agencies, who had applied for the Canadian visa, are unacceptable quot;.        
	The Canadian ministers statement meets the benchmarks set by South Block for resolving the issue before serious damage was done to Indo-Canaddian relations which are finally on the mend after several false starts since the nuclear tests on 1998 forced Canada to temprarily withdraw its high commissioner in New Delhi.        
	Kenney pointed out that quot;each year, Canada welcomes about 131,000 Indian residents on both a temporary and permanent basis, including many individuals from the various Indian security forces. quot;

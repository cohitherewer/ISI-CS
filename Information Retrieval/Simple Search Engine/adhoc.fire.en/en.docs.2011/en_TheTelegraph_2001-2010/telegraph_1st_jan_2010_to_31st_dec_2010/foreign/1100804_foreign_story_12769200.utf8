	Islamabad, Aug. 3: A fresh wave of political violence has erupted in Pakistans port city of Karachi killing at least 37 people, most of them ordinary citizens following assassination of a provincial lawmaker belonging to Mutahida Qaumi Movement (MQM).        
	The angry protestors torched dozens of cars, motorbikes and shops in different localities of the countrys commercial hub, which has been the hotbed of sectarian and ethnic violence for years before returning to normalcy in 1990s.        
	However, targetted killing of activists belonging to different political parties including MQM and the Pashtoon Awami National Party (ANP) began early this year heightening political tensions and making situation difficult for the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, which has both MQM and ANP as coalition partners at the centre.        
	According to senior MQM leaders Faisal Sabzwari and Babur Ghauri, Raza Haider was gunned down in a dirve-by shooting while he was going to attend a funeral.        
	The assassination triggered violence in the city with workers of MQM, which represents Urdu speaking people, who migrated to Pakistan from India in 1947, blaming ANP for the killing.        
	At least 37 people have been killed in the fresh violence in different parts of Karachi since Monday night, a security official told The Telegraph.        
	He said that the government had issued orders to paramilitary Rangers to shoot on sight to prevent more targetted killings and incidents of arson in the city, where life came to a standstill and educational institutions were closed following the unrest.        
	The fresh violence gripped Karachi at a time when the government is engaged in grappling with a difficult situation arising out of the worst floods in Pakistans history, displacing more than 2.5 million people and killing up to 1,500, mostly in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.        
	Interior minister Rehman Malik blamed the assassination of the banned anti-Shiite outfit Sipah-e-Sihaba (SSP) and said the government would not take the incident lightly, adding that this is a very serious incident and the government is committed to unearth those involved in the attack.        
	Recent bombings in the city including the one on the mourning procession of Shias in January set off ripples among security officials who fear that some militant groups including Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have now established their strong presence in the city to strike terror        
	 quot;It is conspiracy to destabilise Karachi, quot; he told reporters in Islamabad, referring to assassination of Raza Haider.        
	He added that destabilising Karachi meant destabilising Pakistan. According to local government officials, more than 70 people have died in targetted killings since early this year.

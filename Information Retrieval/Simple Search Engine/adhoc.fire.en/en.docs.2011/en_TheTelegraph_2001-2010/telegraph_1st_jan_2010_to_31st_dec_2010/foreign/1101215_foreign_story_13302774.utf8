	Kathmandu, Dec. 14 (Reuters): Nepals former Crown Prince Paras, notorious for nightclub brawls and drink-driving antics while heir to the throne, was questioned by police today over accusations he fired a gun during an argument at the weekend.        
	Paras, who was unpopular due to his lavish lifestyle, was quizzed after allegedly firing the weapon during a row with a relative of the deputy Prime Minister at a forest resort, local media said.         
	No one was wounded in the shooting, but the countrys caretaker government is under pressure to arrest Paras due to widespread media coverage of the incident.         
	Police questioned Paras in the tourist town of Pokhara, 125km west of Kathmandu, after the incident in Chitwan, where the former prince was vacationing, Nepali television channels reported.         
	We have started investigations and action against him, police spokesman Bigyan Raj Sharma said without elaborating. Parass father, former King Gyanendra, took over absolute power in 2005.

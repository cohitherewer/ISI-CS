The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama in Kabul to prod Karzai

	Kabul, March 28 (Reuters): US President Barack Obama arrived in Afghanistan on an unannounced visit today during which he would press President Hamid Karzai to crack down on corruption and battle drug trafficking.        
	It was Obamas first trip to the country since he became President 14 months ago.        
	The brief trip was expected to include a one-on-one meeting with Karzai, an expanded meeting with the Afghan Presidents cabinet and US officials, and a speech to American military personnel.        
	White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, speaking before the trip, said Obama wanted to get an on the ground update about the war from General Stanley McChrystal, the US and Nato commander, as well as Karl Eikenberry, the American ambassador.        
	Obama will press Karzai in face-to-face meetings to crack down on corruption and battle drug trafficking as the US military expands its presence in the country and battles the Taliban insurgency.        
	We plan to engage President Karzai as were going to begin, to make him understand that there are certain things he has to do as the President of his country to battle the things that have not been paid attention to almost since day one, US national security adviser General James Jones told reporters.        
	Jones declined to say Karzai was falling short in meeting commitments he had made to reform.        
	In December last year, Obama ordered the deployment of an extra 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan and set a mid-2011 target to begin withdrawal.         
	The trip allows Obama to see the early results of his troop-increase strategy, show support for military personnel and counter critics who say his focus on passing healthcare legislation has diverted attention from foreign policy.

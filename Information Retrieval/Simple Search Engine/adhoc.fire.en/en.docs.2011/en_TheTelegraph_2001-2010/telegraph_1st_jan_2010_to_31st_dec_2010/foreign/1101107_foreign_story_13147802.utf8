The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palin is unqualified, says Bush
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Palin is unqualified, says Bush
                            
	Nov. 6: Former President George W. Bush believes Sarah Palin spoiled the Republican partys 2008 election campaign, according to reports.        
	Naming Palin makes Bush think less of McCain as a man, a Republican official close to Bush told the New York Daily News. He thinks McCain ran a lousy campaign with an unqualified running mate and destroyed any chance of winning by picking Palin. Bush has allegedly been disparaging about Palin.        
	Matt Latimer, former special assistant to Bush, wrote in a book released last year: Im trying to remember if Ive met her before. Im sure I must have. [Bushs] eyes twinkled, then he asked: What is she, the governor of Guam?

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Leaked photos show iPhone 4G
                            
	London, April 17: Pictures have appeared online purporting to show the next Apple iPhone, complete with an aluminium backplate.        
	The images show a sleek-looking iPhone with an aluminium back that is more reminiscent of the first-generation iPhone and new iPad computer than the glossy-backed iPhone 3G and 3GS handsets.        
	Apple has refused to confirm whether the device in the images is a prototype of its new device. Gadget fans are well known for creating mock ups of supposed Apple devices, and then seeding them around the Internet.        
	 There are rumours that the new iPhone will be unveiled in June, and will feature an eight megapixel camera with flash, more storage and a front-mounted camera. The iPhone 4.0 software update, which was revealed by Apple last week, will also add multi-touch capabilities to the device.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Quran case stirs questions on media role
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Quran case stirs questions on media role
          BRIAN STELTER                          Pastor Terry Jones in Gainesville, Florida. (AP)                                  
	Sept. 10: A renegade pastor and his tiny flock set fire to a Quran on a street corner, and made sure to capture it on film. And they were ignored.        
	That stunt took place in 2008, involving members of the Westboro Baptist Church from Topeka, Kansas, an almost universally condemned group of fundamentalists who also protest at military funerals.        
	But plans for a similar stunt by another fringe pastor, Terry Jones, has attracted worldwide news media attention this summer, attention that peaked yesterday when he announced he was cancelling  and later, that he had only suspended  what he had dubbed International Burn a Quran Day. It had been scheduled for tomorrow, the ninth anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.        
	Unlike the Quran-burning by Westboro Baptist, Joness planned event in Gainesville, Florida, coincided with the controversy over the proposed building of a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan near ground zero and a simmering summer-long debate about the freedoms of speech and religion.        
	 Jones was able to put himself at the centre of those issues by using the news lull of summer and the demands of a 24-hour news cycle to promote his anti-Islam cause. He said he consented to more than 150 interview requests in July and August, each time expressing his extremist views about Islam and Sharia law.        
	By the middle of this week, the planned Quran burning was the lead story on some network newscasts, and topic No. 1 on cable news  an extraordinary amount of attention for a marginal figure with a very small following.         
	Yesterday, President Obama condemned Joness plan, and his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said that there were more people at his press conferences than listen to his sermons, in a bit of media criticism.        
	Joness plan, announced in July, slowly gained attention in August, particularly overseas. It became a top story in the US this week after protests against Jones in Afghanistan and after the commander of American and Nato forces in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, warned that the Quran burning could endanger troops.        
	Before there were riots and heads of states talking about him, it could have been a couple of paragraphs in a story about September 11 commemorations, Kathleen Carroll, the executive editor of The Associated Press, said yesterday. Its beyond that now.        
	In some ways, this weeks events were the culmination of a years worth of hateful statements and stunts by Jones and the few dozen members of his church.        
	Jones started to make noise in Gainesville in the summer of 2009, when he posted a sign outside his church that read Islam is of the devil. The Gainesville Sun wrote about the sign, under the headline Anti-Islam church sign stirs up community outrage.        
	He told The Sun that the sign would not be his last. The newspaper soon published an investigation into what it called the churchs financial abuses, which included a profit-making eBay furniture sales business operating on the churchs property.

	London, Nov. 12 (AP): He missed the plane. Now thousands of annoyed Internet users says authorities missed the joke.        
	When Paul Chambers was arrested and fined for posting a jocular message to micro-blogging site Twitter in which he threatened to blow up northern Englands Robin Hood Airport if it didnt reopen in time for his flight, it caused a minor stir.        
	Now that a court has turned down his appeal, the Internet has come alive with outrage, with thousands of online fans posting comic threats to the regional airport out of solidarity. Rights groups warn that the so-called Twitter Joke Trial had set an ugly precedent for free speech online.         
	According to accounts carried on Greens blog and in the British media, the 27-year-old was alarmed when heavy snow closed Robin Hood Airport, which he was due to fly out of in order to see a friend hed met online.         
	In a profane message posted to dozens of followers on January 6, he stated: Robin Hood Airport is closed. Youve got a week and a bit to get (it) together, otherwise Im blowing the airport sky high!!

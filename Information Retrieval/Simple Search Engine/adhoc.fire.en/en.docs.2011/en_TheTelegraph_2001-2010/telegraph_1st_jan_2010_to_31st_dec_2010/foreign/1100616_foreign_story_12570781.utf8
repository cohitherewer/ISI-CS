	Washington, June 15: The commander of American forces in West Asia, Gen. David H. Petraeus, appeared to faint briefly during an intense period of questioning today by senators.        
	The commander, a long-distance runner, slumped forward towards the microphone where he was seated and was escorted from the Senate hearing room by aides. He returned about 30 minutes later and was greeted with applause from those in the audience.        
	I just got dehydrated, Gen. Petraeus said. Though the general indicated that he was able to continue his testimony, he was asked to return later in the week. Gen. Petraeus had just completed a serious question-and-answer period with Senators Carl Levin, and John McCain on whether it was possible to meet Obamas deadline of pulling out troops next year.

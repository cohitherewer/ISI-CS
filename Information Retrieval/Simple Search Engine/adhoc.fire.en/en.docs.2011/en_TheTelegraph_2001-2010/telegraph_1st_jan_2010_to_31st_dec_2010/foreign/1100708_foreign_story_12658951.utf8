	Islamabad, July 7: Six suspected terrorists arrested by Pakistans police last week from Lahore have revealed that they were planning to assassinate President Asif Ali Zardari and other top political figures, including Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif.        
	The police arrested the terrorists a day after the twin suicide attacks on the shrine of Sufi saint Hazarat Syed Ali Hajwairi in Lahore.         
	We seized 18,000kg of explosive material, Kalashnikov rifles, over two dozen hand grenades and other ammunition from them, Lahore police chief Aslam Tareen said.

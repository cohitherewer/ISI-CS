	Cyrus video    
	 Los Angeles, June 16 (Reuters): Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton yesterday sought to defuse a media furore he created by posting a picture on his Twitter account that seemed to suggest teen pop star Miley Cyrus had been photographed without wearing underwear.      
	The snapshot showed the Hannah Montana Disney idol, 17, climbing out of a car while wearing a short, white dress. The space between her legs was pixilated and carried a warning notice in Hiltons Twitter posting, which has some 2 million followers.      
	Although the photo was later removed, it sparked a flurry of news reports and talk among celebrity watchers over whether LA-based Hilton could be prosecuted for distributing child pornography, given that Cyrus is still a minor under US law.     
	Berry duo    
	London (PTI): Former couple Halle Berry and Gabriel Aubry put up a display of affection as they spent a day out with their daughter in Disneyland. Berry and Aubry had split last month but were all smiles on a trip with Nahla, 2. Dressed down for the trip, the former couple gave Nahla a tour of the theme park before grabbing some ice cream, reports The Sun tabloid.

                              Prince Saud Abdulaziz bin Nasser al Saud. (Reuters)                            
	London, Oct. 19 (Reuters): A Saudi prince was found guilty today of murdering his servant in their room at a luxury London hotel in a ferocious beating that prosecutors said had a sexual element.        
	The prince, Saud Abdulaziz bin Nasser al Saud, 34, was convicted at the Old Bailey of murdering Bandar Abdulaziz, 32. The pair were believed to be having some kind of sexual relationship, the court had heard.        
	Abdulaziz, was found beaten and strangled in the Landmark Hotel in central London in February. The court was told the prince had attacked him in the culmination of a campaign of sadistic abuse.        
	Al Saud, who will be sentenced tomorrow, had admitted manslaughter but denied murder. The servant had spent the previous three years travelling as an occasional companion of the prince.

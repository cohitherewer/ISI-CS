	New York, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Two Canadian men who pleaded guilty in a plot to acquire anti-aircraft missiles and other military equipment for the Tamil Tigers were sentenced yesterday to 26 and 14 years in prison.        
	Sathajhan Sarachandran, 30, and Nadarasa Yogarasa, 55, were among four men arrested in 2006 in an FBI sting operation as they attempted to purchase surface-to-air missiles, missile launchers and hundreds of AK-47 automatic rifles that were to be used against Sri Lankan aircraft, prosecutors said.        
	Sarachandran pleaded guilty in January 2009 to conspiring to provide and attempting to provide material support to the Tamil Tigers. Nadarasa pleaded guilty at the same time to conspiring to provide material support to the group.

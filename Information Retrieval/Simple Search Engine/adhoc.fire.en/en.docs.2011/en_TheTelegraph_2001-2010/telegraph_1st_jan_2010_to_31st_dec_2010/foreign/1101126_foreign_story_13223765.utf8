The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | PM blasted for poor joke
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      PM blasted for poor joke
                              Above the law                            
	London, Nov. 25: British Prime Minister David Cameron was accused by campaigners today of breaking the law by cracking an appalling joke comparing Commons Speaker John Bercow to one of the Seven Dwarfs.        
	A charity which helps people with primordial dwarfism and other forms of restricted growth said the comments were a form of harassment  and called for talks with the Prime Minister.        
	In a dig at Bercow  believed to be 5 feet 6 inches tall  Cameron said that health minister Simon Burnss driver had accidentally hit the Speakers car while reversing. When Bercow said he was not happy about the incident, Cameron quipped to journalists at a Westminster lunch yesterday, Burns retorted: So which one are you?.        
	In June, Burns publicly apologised after calling the Speaker a stupid, sanctimonious dwarf in the Commons. He said he was sorry for any offence he had caused after the insult was branded derogatory and deeply offensive by the Walking with Giants Foundation (WWGF).        
	The charity said it considered all such jokes as a form of harassment, contrary to equalities law, that enhanced negative stereotypes.         
	Camerons spokeswoman said he had made light-hearted comments not intended to cause offence.        
	But John Connerty, WWGF co-founder, launched a fierce condemnation of the Prime Ministers decision to glorify the previous incident.        
	Once again we have an influential figure, if not the most influential person in the country, making distasteful references about a persons lack of height, he said. It was bad enough having a minister of health make similar distasteful comments but to have the Prime Minister himself glorify the comments in a joke is totally unacceptable.        
	It appears that certain government officials are above the law when making derogatory references and associations to a disability. It would be nice to know if Cameron and his cabinet have a diversity policy that they can refer to. If they do, I think they should read it so that they can understand what effect derogatory comments have on a disabled persons mental well-being.

	Sept. 17: Police have arrested five suspected Islamist terrorists, working as street cleaners in London, over an alleged plan assassinate the Pope.        
	The men were arrested during raids at 5.45am at a rubbish depot in central London based on an intelligence tip off received overnight.        
	The suspects, aged 26, 27, 36, 40 and 50 were arrested by officers from Scotland Yards Counter Terrorism Command on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. They are said to be from a variety of nationalities including a number of Algerian origin.        
	The depot where they worked is less than a mile from Hyde Park where the Pope was supposed to hold a prayer vigil. As street cleaners they would have been able to move relatively freely and inconspicuously through the London crowds.        
	Westminster City Council said the men worked for Veolia Environmental Services, a contractor which employs 650 on-street staff to keep Westminsters streets clean and free from rubbish.        
	The men have been taken to a central London police station where they will be interviewed by detectives. Searches are being carried out under the Terrorism Act 2000 at the rubbish depot and at residential premises in north and east London.

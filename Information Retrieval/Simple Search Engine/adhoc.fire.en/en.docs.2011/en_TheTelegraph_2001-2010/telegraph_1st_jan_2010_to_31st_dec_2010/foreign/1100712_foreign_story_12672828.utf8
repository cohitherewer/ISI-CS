                          A photograph released by Cuban state media shows Fidel Castro at the National Center for Scientific   Investigation in Havana on July 7. (AP)                    
	Havana, July 11 (AP): New pictures of Fidel Castro show the stooped but smiling veteran venturing out to meet workers at a Cuban scientific think tank  the first to show him in public since he got sick four years ago.        
	Previously, Cuba had occasionally released pictures showing him in private meetings with dignitaries, most recently during a visit in February by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. In those pictures, Castro looked cheerful and robust.        
	The latest batch of pictures of the tracksuit-clad Castro were posted on Saturday on the blogs of two Cuban journalists and a media website.        
	Castro, 83, appears slightly stooped but otherwise healthy in the pictures, which were said to have been taken on Wednesday during a visit to the National Center for Scientific Investigation in Havana.        
	The initial set of four photos appeared on the blogs of two official Cuban journalists and apparently were taken with a workers mobile phone. Castro is seen raising his hand to wave in one picture and seemingly being led away in another.        
	More images from the same event were posted later on Cubadebate, a state-run media website.         
	In those pictures, Castro is seen laughing and talking with workers, some of whom line an overhead walkway to wave and clap at him.        
	In one, he leans back casually against a desk, looking animated.        
	He is thin but he looks good, and according to our director, he is very good mentally, reads a comment accompanying photos on the blog of Rosa C. Baez, a journalist who works for official Cuban media.        
	The comments were sent to her along with the photos by an unidentified worker, who said Castro stopped, said hello and blew kisses to the employees.        
	 They didnt let us get close to him, but when he left, there were too many people standing around and I was standing just 3 metres from him, gushes the worker. Cuban media outlets are strictly controlled by the government.

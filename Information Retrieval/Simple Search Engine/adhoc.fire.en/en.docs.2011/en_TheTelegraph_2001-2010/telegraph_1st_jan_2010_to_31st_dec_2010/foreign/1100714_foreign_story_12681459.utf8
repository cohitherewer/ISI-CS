	Kathmandu, July 13: Nepals Parliament today announced that the countrys next Prime Minister would be elected by lawmakers on July 21.         
	The Parliaments Business Advisory Committee finalised the date for the Prime Ministers election after the political parties failed to form a consensus government within the deadline set by President Ram Baran Yadav. After the Presidents extended deadline lapsed yesterday, the Parliament was given the task of electing the Prime Minister through a simple majority.         
	Briefing reporters after the Business Advisory Committee here today Law Minister Prem Bahadur Singh said that nominations for the post would be registered until July 20. The timetable for the Prime Ministers election was endorsed by the parliament later in the day.         
	Significantly this will be the third time that the Prime Minister is being chosen by the lawmakers in the last two years in the aftermath of the historic elections which saw the Maoists return to mainstream electoral politics.         
	Following the elections two governments fell in quick successions. While the first ever Maoist government which assumed office as a majority government after the landmark elections fell after the former rebels opted out over the Nepal Army chiefs sacking row last year, the succeeding government led by the CPN(UML) quit last month following pressure from the Maoists.

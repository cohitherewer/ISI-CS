	March 12: Tiger Woodss mistresses have paraded themselves in bikinis for a tongue-in-cheek beauty pageant arranged by the controversial disc jockey Howard Stern.        
	Cocktail waitress Jamie Jungers beat former escort Loredana Jolie and Jaimee Grubbs  another cocktail waitress  to be named the golfers true mistress in the radio show hosted by Stern, often referred to as New Yorks shock jock.        
	The 27-year-old took away $75,000 for answering a series of personal questions about Woods, but said all she wanted from him was an apology.        
	On winning, she said: Im so excited. I just feel blessed.              
	Woods, 34, made a public statement last month over his string of affairs, apologising to his wife Elin Nordegren, his supporters, his fellow professionals and his sponsors for his conduct. However, he did not apologise to the women with whom he had been sleeping.

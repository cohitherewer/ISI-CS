The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Vuvuzela in Oxford Dictionary
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Vuvuzela in Oxford Dictionary
                                  
	Aug. 18: The vuvuzela has blasted its way into the Oxford Dictionary of English for the first time after becoming the sound of the World Cup.        
	The word vuvuzela has only been in common use since the summer when the long horn began to be heard at the World Cup matches in South Africa.        
	It is one of more than 2,000 new words and phrases included in the dictionary for the first time. Other newcomers include: tweetup (a meeting arranged through Twitter); and a cheeseball (lacking taste or style).        
	Two of the greatest influences on current language have been the Internet and the financial crisis. Paywall (which restricts website access only to subscribers), microblogging (posting short entries on a blog), netbook, viral and defriend have all arrived in our language because of the Internet.

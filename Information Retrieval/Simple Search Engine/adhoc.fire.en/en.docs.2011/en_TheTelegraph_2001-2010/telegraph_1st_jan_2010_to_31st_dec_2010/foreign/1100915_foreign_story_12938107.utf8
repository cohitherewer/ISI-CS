	Sept. 14: Being surrounded by family and friends makes you live longer, scientists have said.        
	 People who have no social life are fifty per cent more likely to die early than those who are well connected, a study has shown. Those who socialise regularly with family and friends live an average of 3.7 years longer than those who lead lonely lives, according to a report published yesterday.        
	People with little social support have a mortality rate as high as alcoholics, while the impact of making friends is comparable to the effect of giving up smoking, the research showed.        
	Burt Uchino, the professor who led the research, said: Friends and supportive people can make life easier on a basic, every day level.

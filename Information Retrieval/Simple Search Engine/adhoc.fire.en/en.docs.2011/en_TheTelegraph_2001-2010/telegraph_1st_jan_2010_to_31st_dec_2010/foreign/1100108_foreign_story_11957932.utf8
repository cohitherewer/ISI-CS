	New York, Jan. 7 (Reuters): The White House will ask a coat-maker to take down a billboard advertisement in New Yorks Times Square showing President Barack Obama wearing one of the companys coats that was put up without Obamas permission, an administration official said today.        
	The advertisement for Weatherproof Garment Co showing Obama wearing a black overcoat during a visit to the Great Wall of China went up in Times Square yesterday.        
	An Obama administration official said the White House would contact the company and ask it to take the ad down.        
	This ad is clearly misleading because the company suggests the approval or endorsement of the President or the White House that it does not have, the official said.

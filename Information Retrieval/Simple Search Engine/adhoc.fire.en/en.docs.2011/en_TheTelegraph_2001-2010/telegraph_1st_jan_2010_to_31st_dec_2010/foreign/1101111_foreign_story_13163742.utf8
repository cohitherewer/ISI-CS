The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Yemen mail bomb timed to hit US
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Yemen mail bomb timed to hit US
                            
	London, Nov. 10 (Reuters): A bomb found on board a cargo plane at a British airport last month could have exploded over the eastern seaboard of the US if it had not been defused, British police said today.        
	Al Qaidas Yemen-based wing has claimed responsibility for sending two US-bound parcel bombs that were intercepted in Dubai and Britain in October. The bombs, addressed to synagogues in Chicago, were found in computer printer cartridges.        
	Forensic examination has indicated that if the device had activated it would have been at 0930GMT on Friday, October 29, 2010, London police said in a statement.        
	If the device had not been removed from the aircraft the activation could have occurred over the east- ern seaboard of the US, they said.

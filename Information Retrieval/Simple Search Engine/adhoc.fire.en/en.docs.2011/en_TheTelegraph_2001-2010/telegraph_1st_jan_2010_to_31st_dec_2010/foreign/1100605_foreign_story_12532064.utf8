	Black Claudia    
	 June 4: Supermodel Claudia Schiffer has been accused of being racially insensitive after she posed as a black woman, complete with afro, for the cover of a magazine, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Schiffers skin was covered in dark foundation for the shots, which were taken by fashion designer and photographer Karl Lagerfeld. The images were taken for a Dom Perignon advertising campaign.

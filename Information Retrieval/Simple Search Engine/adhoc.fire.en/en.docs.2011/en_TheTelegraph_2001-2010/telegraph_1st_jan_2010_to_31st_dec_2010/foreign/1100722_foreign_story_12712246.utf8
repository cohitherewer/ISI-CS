                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      North Korea faces new US sanctions
                            
	Seoul, July 21 (Reuters): The US today announced new sanctions against North Korea, targeted against its leadership, and warned of serious consequences if it again attacked the South.        
	US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said Washington was ready to return to international talks over North Koreas nuclear weapons programme if Pyongyang sent a positive signal.        
	She said the sanctions aimed to prevent North Korea selling arms and from procuring luxury goods, as well as to put out of business North Korean entities operating illicitly overseas. We are aiming very specifically after much intensive research to target the leadership, to target their assets, Clinton told a news conference in Seoul.

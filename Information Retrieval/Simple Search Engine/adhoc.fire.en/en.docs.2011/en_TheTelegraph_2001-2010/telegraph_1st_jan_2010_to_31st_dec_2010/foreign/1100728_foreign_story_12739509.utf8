	July 27: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian leader, says Paul the octopus, the sea creature that correctly predicted the outcome of World Cup games, is a symbol of all that is wrong with the western world.        
	He claims that the octopus is a symbol of decadence and decay among his enemies.        
	Paul, who lives at the Oberhausen Sea Life Centre, in Germany, won the hearts of the Spanish by predicting their World Cup victory.        
	However, the Iranian President accused the octopus of spreading western propaganda. Paul was mentioned by Ahmadinejad on various occasions at a speech in Tehran.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

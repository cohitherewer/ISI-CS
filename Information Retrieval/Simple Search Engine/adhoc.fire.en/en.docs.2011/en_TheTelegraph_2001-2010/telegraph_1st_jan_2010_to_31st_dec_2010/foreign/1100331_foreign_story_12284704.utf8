	Islamabad, March 30 (Reuters): A top Pakistan government official was detained today on the orders of the Supreme Court, the first official to face legal action over revived corruption charges after a controversial amnesty was thrown out.        
	The detention of Ahmed Riaz Sheikh, director general of the countrys top police investigation agency, could herald action against numerous officials, including President Asif Ali Zardari, and could intensify a destabilising face-off between the judiciary and the government.        
	The court sent him into police custody after he withdrew his challenge to his conviction, Sheikhs lawyer, Rashid A. Rizvi, told Reuters.        
	The Supreme Court in December threw out a 2007 amnesty deal that protected Sheikh and several thousands of others  including Zardari  from old corruption charges. Sheikh had been convicted of corruption and jailed for five years.        
	The amnesty was widely seen as the basis for a power-sharing deal between former military President Pervez Musharraf and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in December 2007 after returning from self-imposed exile.        
	The court has been demanding the revival of corruption cases since it threw the amnesty out.        
	The government says Bhuttos widower, Zardari, who faces corruption cases filed in the 1990s which he says were politically motivated, is protected by presidential immunity.        
	But Nawid Ahsan, chairman of the National Accountability Bureau, the state anti-corruption agency, told the court action would be taken according to the courts orders.        
	Sheikhs detention appears to signal that the judiciary, which has rarely enjoyed good relations with the executive branch, is determined to press ahead with the cases.         
	The US, which wants Pakistan to focus on battling militants as US forces struggle to bring stability to Afghanistan, would be dismayed to see a crisis between the judicial and the government consuming attention.        
	Pakistan has a history of disputes between the executive and the judiciary sparking instability and, in at least one case, bringing down a government in the 1990s.        
	Though Zardari is protected by presidential immunity, he is vulnerable to legal challenges to his 2008 election as President on the grounds that the old corruption charges against him made him ineligible to stand for office.

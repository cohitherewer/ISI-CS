The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama meets Dalai, defies China
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama meets Dalai, defies China
                              The Dalai Lama in Washington DC. (AFP)                            
	Washington, Feb. 18 (Reuters): President Barack Obama hosted the Dalai Lama at the White House today, brushing aside Chinas warning that the meeting with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader could further damage strained Sino-US ties.        
	The Dalai Lama told reporters on the White House driveway that he spoke to Obama about the promotion of human values, religious harmony and the concerns of the Tibetan people. He said Obama was supportive.        
	Obama  like his White House predecessors  denied the Dalai Lama the symbolism of meeting in the Oval Office. Instead they met in the lesser-known Map Room. Such distinctions signalled to Beijing that the Tibetan monk was not being received as a political leader.        
	The Dalai Lama entered the White House out of sight of journalists, and the talks were closed to media coverage. The White House planned to release a photograph later.        
	Obamas first presidential meeting with the Dalai Lama was sure to draw angry complaints from Beijing, which is increasingly at odds with Washington over trade, currencies, US arms sales to Taiwan and Chinese Internet censorship.        
	With the two giant economies so deeply intertwined, tensions are considered unlikely to escalate into outright confrontation. The White House expects only limited fallout.         
	But the Dalai Lamas visit could complicate Obamas efforts to secure Chinas help on key issues such as imposing tougher sanctions on Iran, resolving the North Korean nuclear standoff and forging a new global accord on climate change.        
	By going ahead with the meeting over Chinese objections, Obama may be trying to show his resolve against an increasingly assertive Beijing after facing criticism at home for being too soft with Chinas leaders on his trip there in November.        
	Chinese officials have known about this and their reaction is their reaction, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said dismissively on the eve of the Dalai Lamas visit.        
	Although admired by millions around the world as a man of peace, the Dalai Lama is accused by Beijing of being a dangerous separatist who foments unrest in Tibet.        
	Gibbs insisted the US and China  the worlds largest and third-biggest economies  have a mature relationship capable of withstanding disagreements.        
	But mindful of Chinese sensitivities, the White House has sought to strike a balance in the Dalai Lamas visit.         
	Seeking to avoid alienating Beijing, Obama had delayed meeting the Dalai Lama until after first seeing Chinese leaders during his Asia trip last year.

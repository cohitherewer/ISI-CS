	Peshawar, Sept. 6 (PTI): A suicide bomber rammed his car into a police station in northwest Pakistan today killing at least 20 people, including 11 policemen and four schoolchildren.         
	The attacker targeted the main police station in Lakki Marwat, a key city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, destroying the station with the blast. Forty were wounded.         
	The police station, a mosque and a government office collapsed while portions of two other buildings were damaged.         
	The bomber struck at 7am, when most of the 45 policemen at the station were asleep following sehri, the pre-dawn meal taken ahead of a day-long Ramazan fast.        
	A school bus was passing the area when the blast occurred. A live electric wire fell on the vehicle, killing four children and injuring several others.         
	At least 10 policemen were among the injured. Several of the injured were in a critical condition, officials in local hospitals said.         
	Local residents joined rescue operations and rushed the injured to hospital in private vehicles.         
	The bomber targeted the police station from the rear as its front side and entrance was barricaded with cement blocks, officials said. Officials of the bomb disposal squad said over 40 kg of explosives were used in the attack.         
	They feared the death toll could rise as rescuers were still clearing the rubble of collapsed buildings. Police cordoned off the area and launched a search operation.         
	No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

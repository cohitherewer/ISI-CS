	Washington, July 16 (AFP): Last month was the hottest June ever recorded on Earth, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said.        
	The combined global land and ocean surface temperature data also found that the January-June and April-June periods were the warmest on record, according to NOAAs National Climatic Data Center, which based its findings on measurements that go back as far as 1880. In June, the combined average for global land and ocean temperatures was 16.2 Celsius  0.68 Celsius more than the 20th century average of 15.5 Celsius.        
	 Temperatures warmer than average spread throughout the globe in recent months, most prominently in Peru, in the central and eastern United States and in eastern and western Asia, according to NOAA. In contrast, cooler-than-average conditions affected Scandinavia. The Beijing Climate Center found that Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and Jilin experienced their warmest June.

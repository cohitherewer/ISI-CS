The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Swiss snub US on Polanski
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Swiss snub US on Polanski
                                (Top) Swiss Justice minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf in Bern and a file picture of Roman Polanski. (AP)                           
	Bern (Switzerland), July 12 (AP): The Swiss government declared renowned film director Roman Polanski a free man today after rejecting a US request to extradite him on a charge of having sex in 1977 with a 13-year-old girl.        
	The Swiss mostly blamed US authorities for failing to provide confidential testimony about Polanskis sentencing procedure in 1977-1978.        
	The stunning decision could end the USs three-decade pursuit of Polanski, unless he travels to another country that would be willing to apprehend him and weigh sending him to Los Angeles.        
	France, where he has spent much of his time, does not extradite its own citizens, and the public scrutiny over Switzerlands deliberations may dissuade other nations from making such a spectacular arrest.        
	The Swiss government said it had sought confidential testimony given on January 26 by Roger Gunson, the Los Angeles attorney in charge of the original prosecution against Polanski. Washington rejected the request.        
	Mr Polanski can now move freely. Since 12:30pm today hes a free man, justice minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf declared.        
	The Oscar-winning director of Rosemarys Baby, Chinatown and The Pianist was accused of plying his victim with champagne during a 1977 modelling shoot and raping her.        
	He was initially indicted on six felony counts, including rape by use of drugs, child molesting and sodomy, but pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sexual intercourse.        
	In exchange, the judge agreed to drop the remaining charges and sentence him to prison for a 90-day psychiatric evaluation. However, he was released after 42 days by an evaluator who deemed him mentally sound and unlikely to offend again. The judge responded by saying he was going to send Polanski back to jail for the remainder of the 90 days and that afterwards he would ask Polanski to agree to a voluntary deportation. Polanski then fled the country on the eve of his February 1, 1978, sentencing.        
	Based on references to Gunsons testimony in US courts, the Swiss said it should prove that Polanski served his sentence after undergoing 42 days of diagnostic study, the statement said.        
	If this were the case, Roman Polanski would actually have already served his sentence and, therefore, both the proceedings on which the US extradition request is founded and the request itself would have no foundation, the ministry said.

	Moscow, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Russia test-flew a long-awaited new fighter aircraft today, determined to challenge the US for technical superiority in the skies.        
	The fifth-generation stealth fighterflew for 47 minutes, planemaker Sukhoi said. Its a remarkable event, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said, but he suggested the plane still needed work.        
	There is very much to be done, in part as regards the engine, Putin said.But the fact that the plane is already in the air is a big step forward.        
	Russias main television networks led news programmes with reports of the flight and showed footage of the needle-nosed, camouflage-painted plane taking off from a snow-lined airstrip at a Sukhoi factory in Komsomolsk-on-Amur, in Russias Far East.        
	The plane performed very well. All our expectations for this first flight were met, Sukhoi spokeswoman Olga Kayukova said on Rossiya 24 television.The premiere was a success.        
	Foreign journalists were not invited.

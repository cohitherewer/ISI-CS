The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thai protesters storm hospital
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Thai protesters storm hospital
                            
	Bangkok, April 30 (Reuters): A hospital in Bangkok evacuated some of its patients today after protesters forced their way into the grounds to look for soldiers they thought were there preparing an attack.        
	More than 200 red shirt protesters had burst into the grounds of Chulalongkorn University Hospital, located next to the encampment of anti-government protesters, late yesterday.        
	They found no soldiers and left after roaming for an hour through the grounds, the lobby and car parks, some carrying wooden staves. Some wanted to return today to make sure there were no troops but red shirt leaders ruled it out.        
	We have told them it was an inappropriate move. We truly apologise for any inconvenience caused. Some were very concerned the hospital was harbouring troops, Weng Tojirakarn told Reuters.        
	The incursion raised concerns about how much control the leaders have over their followers, especially the red shirt guards in charge of security at the sprawling protest site.        
	The hospital is near the Silom business district, scene of deadly clashes on April 22. It evacuated some patients from late yesterday but hospital director Adisorn Patradul said it would remain open and many in-patients who cannot be moved would stay.        
	Hospital management denies there are troops on its site, but thousands of soldiers and riot police are in the area to contain a seven-week-old protest movement aimed at forcing Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to dissolve parliament and hold elections.        
	Tension remains high in Bangkok after a soldier was killed on Wednesday in a clash on a suburban highway packed with vehicles.

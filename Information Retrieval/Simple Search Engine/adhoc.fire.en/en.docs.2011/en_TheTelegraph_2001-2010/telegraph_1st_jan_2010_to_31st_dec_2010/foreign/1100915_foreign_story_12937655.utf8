The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | George gets 8 weeks in jail
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      George gets 8 weeks in jail
                              Michael in London. (Reuters)                            
	London, Sept. 14 (Reuters): British singer George Michael was sentenced to eight weeks in jail today for driving under the influence of cannabis when he crashed his car into a north London shop in July.        
	Michael, wearing a grey suit and black tie, sighed as judge John Perkins sentenced him at a London court, while his long-term partner Kenny Goss threw his head into his hands. The singer was told he would serve four weeks in prison and spend the remainder on licence.        
	It does not appear that you took proper steps to deal with what is clearly an addiction to cannabis, Perkins told Highbury Corner Magistrates Court. Thats a mistake which puts you and, on this occasion, the public at risk, he was quoted by the Press Association as saying.        
	Perkins said he took into account the fact that Michael had checked into a clinic after the crash to seek help for anxiety, depression and insomnia, which had led him to depend on prescription drugs.        
	I accept entirely that you have shown remorse for the offence, that you are ashamed of it, that you admitted it, he said, but added that a jail term was inevitable because of Michaels previous conviction.        
	Michael, 47, was also banned from driving for five years and was ordered to pay a $1,930 fine. Mukul Chawla, Michaels lawyer, said his client considered the prospect of putting other peoples lives in danger appalling, and said he had tried to turn his life around since the incident and started writing songs again.        
	A police patrol found the singer slumped at the wheel of his Range Rover in the early hours of July 4 after smashing into the facade of a photographic shop in Hampstead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BP posts loss, confirms chief
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      BP posts loss, confirms chief
          JULIA WERDIGIER                          Robert Dudley                                  
	London, July 27: BP named Robert Dudley as its next chief executive today and reported a record $17 billion loss in the second quarter as the company set aside billions of dollars to deal with the aftermath of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.        
	BP set aside $32.2 billion for costs related to the spill, including $20 billion for an escrow fund announced earlier. To help cover the costs, the company plans to sell assets worth $30 billion over the next 18 months. The sales would leave BP with a smaller exploration and production operation, it said.        
	Dudley, an American, is to become BPs first non-British chief executive at the beginning of October, replacing Tony Hayward, who is stepping down after criticism of the way he handled the spill.        
	In a statement today, Dudley said he did not underestimate the nature of the task ahead, but the company is financially robust, with an enviable portfolio of assets and professional teams that are among the best in the industry. I believe this combination  allied to clear, strategic direction  will put BP on the road to recovery.        
	 Dudley, 54, grew up in Mississippi and has been in charge of BPs response to the spill for the past month. His appointment was widely expected among analysts and investors, who are hoping that he can help repair BPs reputation in the US, where it is most tarnished. BP has about one-third of its business interests and 40 per cent of its shareholders and employees in US.

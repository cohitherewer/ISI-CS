	Dhaka, April 6 (PTI): The Bangladesh Rifles has ordered the dismissal of 510 trainee border guards for their role in the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) mutiny last year.        
	According to the BDR, the guards joined the rebels during the mutiny in which 57 army officers were killed.         
	They were disqualified to be soldiers of the BDR for their role during the mutiny, deputy director general of the border force, Brig. Gen. Obaidul Haque, said.        
	The mutiny had broken out on February 25-26 last year at the paramilitary forces Pilkhana headquarters in Dhaka.         
	Haque said the recruits were sent back home after detailed investigations which found that they took up weapons with the rebel soldiers at the Rifles Training Centre and School near Chittagong. This was the easiest way to take the action for their role as they could not be tried under the BDR Act as they were yet to become soldiers at the time of the mutiny, he said.        
	Another official said 510 soldiers were being trained under a six-month regular training programme.

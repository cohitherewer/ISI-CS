The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | After India, cattle row hits UK
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      After India, cattle row hits UK
          AMIT ROY                                                Sir Nicholas Winterton and Shashi Tharoor      
	London, Feb. 18: A veteran Tory politician stirred up Britains equivalent of Shashi Tharoors cattle class controversy today by insisting members of parliament should have the right to travel first class on trains because passengers in standard class (economy) are a totally different type of people.        
	The remarks made by Sir Nicholas Raymond Wasteman Winterton, 71, a Right- winger who has been MP for Macclesfield in Cheshire for 39 years, will not be helpful to the Conservative Party at a time when the public are outraged with MPs for abusing the expenses system.        
	During a period of recession when businesses are going bankrupt and millions of Britons either losing their jobs or finding it very difficult to pay their basic bills, Wintertons comments will be widely regarded as ill chosen and even contemptuous of his own constituents.        
	There is certainly a big difference in price between first and standard class since Britain now has some of the most expensive train travel in the world.        
	Were Winterton to get a cheap day return from London to Macclesfield on the day of travel, he would have to pay Pound65 and leave Euston on any train after 9.26am. A first class return would set the taxpayer back by Pound361. He could also charge Pound30 to get him to Euston and back from the Houses of Parliament by taxi.        
	 Winterton told Total Politics magazine that he was infuriated by the current clampdown on MPs expenses after last years scandal and said reforms of the Commons allowance system would make things much worse.        
	In a BBC interview he expounded on his views, emboldened, no doubt, by the fact he will not seek re-election in the forthcoming general election to be held probably in May.        
	 If I was in standard class, I would not do work because people would be looking over my shoulder all the time, there would be noise, there would be distraction and, I am sorry, if I am doing work I want to concentrate on that, he said. Why do businesspeople travel first class?        
	Asked whether he thought standard-class passengers behaved differently from those with first class tickets, Winterton responded: Yes, I do. They are a totally different type of people. There are lots of children, there is noise, there is activity. They have a different outlook on life. I very much doubt whether they are undertaking serious work and study, reading reports and amending reports which MPs do when they are travelling.        
	 This controversy is more serious than the one provoked by Tharoor last year when Indias external affairs minister of state, asked by a journalist, Tell us minister, next time you travel to Kerala, will it be cattle class?, Twittered back: Absolutely, in cattle class out of solidarity with all our holy cows.        
	Winterton, in marked contrast, cannot claim he was being humorous.        
	In Britain over the past year, popular opinion has turned from dismay to disbelief and then outrage as newspapers have exposed how members of both houses of parliament and of all parties have milked the expenses system.        
	In addition to free first class train travel, MPs are also given an allowance for overnight stays if their constituencies are outside London. It turns out that many fraudulently claimed thousands of pounds for nights when they were in London.        
	Others used allowances to buy second homes or refurbish them or carry out repairs.        
	The degree of abuse has varied but the Winterton household received generous expenses for Sir Nicholass wife, Ann, 68, is also an MP, having represented Congleton, the seat adjacent to her husbands, since 1983.        
	 The Macclesfield MP is by no means the worst offender but he has not been immune from criticism. He has had to repay Pound850 after an inquiry into MPs expenses by a senior civil servant, Sir Thomas Legg, found he had been overpaid for council tax bills on his second home.        
	More seriously, it was discovered he and his wife had claimed parliamentary allowances for rent of Pound20,000 a year on a flat they transferred to a family trust after paying off the mortgage.        
	Many other MPs have also bent the rules, usually staying just within the law, but abusing the spirit of the expenses system to enrich themselves.        
	Winterton is far to the right of David Cameron, who is trying to shift the Conservative Party to more of the centre ground of British politics. Winterton is well known for his views  he has opposed the reduction of the age of consent for same-sex sexual relations to 16 and the ban on fox hunting and supported the reintroduction of capital punishment.        
	 His wife lost her job as Shadow Rural Affairs Minister for telling the following joke at a rugby club dinner:        
	 An Englishman, a Cuban, a Japanese man and a Pakistani were all on a train. The Cuban threw a fine Havana cigar out the window. When he was asked why, he replied: They are ten a penny in my country.        
	The Japanese man threw an expensive Nikon camera out of the carriage, adding: These are ten a penny in my country.        
	The Englishman then picked up the Pakistani and threw him out of the train window.        
	When the other travellers asked him to account for his actions, he said: They are ten a penny in my country.

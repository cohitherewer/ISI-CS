          STEPHEN ADAMS                          Beryl Bainbridge                                  
	London, July 2: Dame Beryl Bainbridge, the esteemed novelist, has died at the age of 75 after a short battle with cancer.        
	The author, whose acclaimed works included An Awfully Big Adventure and Master Georgie, died at a London hospital at around 2am this morning. A spokesman said: She died after a short illness in the early hours of this morning.        
	Liverpool-born Dame Beryl was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize on five occasions, although she never won. Those shortlisted were: The Dressmaker (1973); The Bottle Factory Outing (1974): An Awfully Big Adventure (1989); Every Man for Himself (1996) and Master Georgie (1998).        
	Her novels often drew on her own experiences during her early literary career, featuring fictionalised episodes from her own life.        
	She was well known for her historical fiction, including an imagined account of how Hitler might have developed his traits during a six-month stay in Liverpool, in Young Adolf (1978); and in The Birthday Boys (1991) fictionalised diaries of the five men on Captain Scotts final expedition to Antarctica, which ended in their deaths in 1912.        
	Her publicist Susan de Soissons said: She was one of the huge doyennes of literature and everyone adored her.        
	Dame Beryl was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006 but after surgery to have her left breast removed appeared to have overcome the disease. She also suffered from emphysema, brought on by decades of relatively heavy smoking.        
	In 2008 doctors discovered she had suffered a minor heart attack after she was admitted to hospital with breathing problems.        
	However, she appeared to have recovered her health and last year told a newspaper: Im fine now.        
	She had been working on a new book, The Girl In The Polka-Dot Dress, her first since the publication of According To Queeney in 2001. The new book focused on the assassination of Bobby Kennedy.        
	Every Man for Himself, set on the sinking Titanic, shot her into the media spotlight when it became swept up in the publicity surrounding the hit Hollywood film.        
	In 2008, she featured in a Times newspaper list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. She was made a dame in 2000.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pope worship plea to W. Asia 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pope worship plea to W. Asia 
                            
	Vatican City, Oct. 24 (Reuters): Pope Benedict has called on Islamic countries in West Asia to guarantee freedom of worship to non-Muslims and said peace in the region was the best remedy for a worrying exodus of Christians.        
	He made his appeal at a solemn mass in St Peters Basilica ending a two week Vatican summit of bishops from West Asia, whose final document criticised Israel and urged the Jewish state to end its occupation of Palestinian territories.        
	In his sermon at the gatherings ceremonial end, the Pope said freedom of religion was one of the fundamental human rights that each state should always respect.        
	At least 3.5 million Christians of all denominations live in the Gulf Arab region, the birthplace of Islam and home to some of the most conservative Arab Muslim societies in the world.        
	The freedom to practise Christianity  or any religion other than Islam  is not always a given in the Gulf and varies from country to country. Saudi Arabia, which applies an austere form of Sunni Islam, has by far the tightest restrictions.        
	The synod concluded that Israel cannot use the biblical concept of a promised land or a chosen people to justify new settlements in Jerusalem or territorial claims.        
	In a response, an Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson said theological disputes over the interpretation of the holy scriptures disappeared with the Middle Ages, adding: It doesnt seem like a wise move to revive them.

                              Obama with Emanuel at the White House. (AP)                            
	Washington, Oct. 1 (Reuters): President Barack Obama turned to low-key insider Pete Rouse today to replace high-profile chief of staff Rahm Emanuel in a prelude to a wider staff shake-up expected at the White House.        
	Obama named Rouse, a veteran Capitol Hill operator, to take over at least on an interim basis from Emanuel, 50, who announced his resignation as Obamas top aide to launch a campaign for Chicago mayor.        
	Rouse, 64, is one of Obamas longest-serving aides, working for him since Obama was a US senator from Illinois. He was previously chief of staff to Democrat Tom Daschle when he was a senator.        
	White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Rouse hasalways put the organization ahead of himself and has Obamas complete trust.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Men to grant loved ones wishes at 6pm
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Men to grant loved ones wishes at 6pm
                            
	Oct. 19: Men are more likely to grant a womans request if she times it at 6pm, a survey has found.        
	Wishes can range from booking a holiday or performing a domestic chore. However, the worst time of day for men to try and row with their female loved one is around 3pm. This is because it is reportedly the best time for women to win an argument.        
	Meanwhile, according to the poll of 1,000 people, the best time to ask for a promotion is at 1pm rather than at the beginning of the day. Around 86 per cent of the 1,019 people surveyed said they were aware of regular peaks and troughs in their mood. The survey was carried out by the pharmaceuticals corporation Bayer Schering Pharma.        
	Evie Bentley, a psychotherapist, said: Each biorhythm cycle is regulated by the brain, which controls what hormones and how much of each are produced in order to balance bodily function. A great deal of how a person feels physically, intellectually, and emotionally, is caused by their biorhythms.

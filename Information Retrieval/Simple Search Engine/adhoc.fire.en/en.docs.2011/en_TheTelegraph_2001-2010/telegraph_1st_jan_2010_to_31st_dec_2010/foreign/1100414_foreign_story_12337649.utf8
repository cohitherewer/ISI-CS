The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cameron seeks special ties with India
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Cameron seeks special ties with India
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, April 13: The Tories would seek to build a new special relationship with India if David Cameron becomes prime minister, it is stated in the Conservative Party general election manifesto published today.        
	The first time Cameron said this was in 2006 when his first overseas trip after becoming Tory leader was to India.However, the dramatic upgrading of the relationship with India is now official party policy.        
	The job of Foreign Secretary, should Cameron win on May 6, is expected to go William Hague, a former party leader who is now the Shadow Foreign Secretary.        
	Outlining the foreign policy priorities for a future Conservative government, the manifesto says: We will work patiently with the grain of other societies, but we will always support liberal values and human rights because they provide the foundations for stability and prosperity.        
	Cameron would create a National Security Council to integrate at the highest levels of government the work of our foreign, defence, energy, home and international development departments.        
	There would be a a commitment to the transatlantic alliance, which is as necessary in 2010 as ever in order to make progress in Afghanistan, bring success in May at the review conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and to deter and dissuade Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.        
	The next line will be studied closely by both the Indian High Commission in London and the Ministry of External Affairs in Delhi: The deepening of alliances beyond Europe and North America, including a strong and effective relationship with China. We also want to build a new special relationship with India, to provide support for Pakistan, and to strengthen our ties with nations in the Gulf, North Africa and Latin America.        
	Like Gordon Brown, Cameron, too, would probably also support Indias bid for a permanent seat on the UN security council. The Tories say they want the reform of older international institutions such as the United Nations and the effective use of new ones such as the G20. Cameron is also committed to cutting immigration. Britain can benefit from immigration, but not uncontrolled immigration, says the manifesto.        
	The Tories do not want to come across as too right wing, which explains why the manifesto says: Look at any aspect of life today and you will see the contribution that migrants have brought, and not just to the economy. We want to continue to attract the brightest and the best people to the UK, but with control on the overall numbers coming here.         
	This may provide assurance to executives of Indian companies which have set up offices in the UK and prefer to send staff from India rather than recruit locally.        
	 A Conservative government will reduce net immigration to the levels of the 1990s  tens of thousands a year, instead of the hundreds of thousands a year under Labour, the manifesto says. We will introduce an annual limit on the numbers of non-EU economic migrants allowed to work here, taking into consideration the effects a rising population has on our public services and local communities.        
	Indian students could also be affected because the manifesto warns: We will introduce important new rules to tighten up the student visa system, which at the moment is the biggest hole in our border controls. We will promote integration into British society. There will be an English language test for anyone coming here to get married.        
	That could stem the flow of brides and grooms from the rural hinterlands of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.        
	Among his political reforms, Cameron wants to reduce the number of MPs in the Commons, which stood at 650 at dissolution, by 10 per cent.        
	Although the Indian political system has borrowed heavily from the mother of parliaments, there is one Cameron innovation which may not find much favour in India. He wants to give voters the right to kick out MPs guilty of wrongdoing.        
	He does not mean this should happen only at election time. He is suggesting electors should have the right to expel MPs at any time.

	Dec. 15: In New Yorks culinary world, with its unending appetite and closet-size kitchens, it is an unimpressive building housing a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour revolving-door operation built on need, ambition and nostalgia.        
	Shefalee Patel, who had a hand in one of the most ambitious construction projects in the West Asia before being laid off, uses the space to turn out Indian sweets.        
	Marisa Angebranndt, who lost her job at a hedge fund when Wall Street collapsed, now makes whoopie pies there.        
	Miguel Urrego, a son of Colombian immigrants who had worked as a waiter and cook all over Manhattan, caters parties with a menu produced there that is as diverse as New Yorkers palates: gyoza and mini-falafel; focaccia and soba noodles; bite-size burritos and croquettes.        
	On a block in Long Island City, Queens, shared by car washes, plumbing parts manufacturers and livery-car garages, the three, as well as other cooks, pay by the shift to use a commercial kitchen equipped with 80-quart mixers, deep-frying cauldrons and walk-in ovens, churning out food they sell on the Internet and at farmers markets and coffee shops.        
	The kitchens 5,500-sq ft work space is both a refuge for dreamers and a life preserver for the unemployed.        
	There are a lot of career-changers here, a lot of casual gourmets who channelled their energies into cooking as a way to make money, said Meg LaBarbara, a former travel consultant who makes dips and spreads at the kitchen, called the Entrepreneurs Space, on 37th Street near Northern Boulevard.        
	Working at a hedge fund, Angebranndt, 35, had organised meetings and retreats for high-level executives. After the fund shut down in 2008, she invested her severance pay and savings in whoopie pies, adapting her grandmothers cookie recipe and her own fillings  no marshmallow, but a dozen flavours of butter cream.        
	I started out making cakes for my friends, then I asked them to spread the word, and next thing I knew, I was cooking at home until 2 in the morning, Angebranndt said. I figured, theres less money, but also less stress and more fun.        
	Patel, 32, worked as a civil engineer for Bermello Ajamil amp; Partners, which is based in Miami, and was involved in the development of artificial islands off the coast of Dubai in the UAE until she was laid off last year.        
	The idea to make sweets to sell first occurred to her while she was still in Dubai, where she said chocolates are packaged and consumed as if they are luxury goods. Once she lost her job, she put the idea into action, cooking in her mothers kitchen in Passaic, New Jersey, before moving to the commercial kitchen in Queens.        
	It is too early to know if whoopie pies or Indian treats will be lucrative, but neither Angebranndt nor Patel is worried about that.        
	As Patel said, I havent looked for a job since I started cooking here.        
	Some of the cooks work alone, but Patel drafted her mother into the kitchen, and her sister made the packages for her concoctions.         
	Its a true family business, she said.        
	Patel creates variations of burfi, which she had watched her mother make a thousand times. She favours cardamom over curry and chilli, combines coconut with dark chocolate ganache, and mixes nutmeg and apple cream or pecan and maple caramel for a distinctly American twist.        
	Her first order, right after she got laid off, was for 100 favour boxes for her best friends wedding, each containing two sweets made with dates and coconut. For Diwali, she sold 500 gift boxes. And, she said several weeks ago, I already have a bunch of orders for Christmas.

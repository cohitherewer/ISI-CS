	Chaplin at sea    
	 Montpellier (Vermont), April 9 (AP): As she sorted through her father Alistair Cookes belongings after his death, Susan Cooke Kittredge came across something odd: an old 8mm film canister with yellow tape spelling out Chaplin film.      
	What she found inside was intriguing: All at Sea, an 11-minute home movie shot by a 24-year-old Cooke on a 1933 yacht cruise that included actor Charlie Chaplin, his Modern Times co-star Paulette Goddard and Alistair Cooke.       
	The silent film, which shows a relaxed Chaplin aboard his boat Panacea was apparently never seen, ending up in Cookes New York apartment.

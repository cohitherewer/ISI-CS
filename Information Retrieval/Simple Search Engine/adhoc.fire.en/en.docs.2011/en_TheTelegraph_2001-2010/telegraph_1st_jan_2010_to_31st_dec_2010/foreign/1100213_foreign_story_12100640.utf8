	Sitar not for Norah    
	 London, Feb. 12 (PTI): Singer Norah Jones has no plans of following in the footsteps of her father Pandit Ravi Shankar by learning the sitar as the instrument has left him and her half-sister Anoushka with twisted backs.       
	Jones admits that she once took sitar lessons from Anoushka but later realised that it wasnt her cup of tea.      
	It was fun, but you have to twist your back all around. My dad and Anoushka both have twisted backs from playing so much, Jones said. And you have to sit cross-legged. See, that aint cool! I cant imagine doing a world tour cross-legged, Jones added.

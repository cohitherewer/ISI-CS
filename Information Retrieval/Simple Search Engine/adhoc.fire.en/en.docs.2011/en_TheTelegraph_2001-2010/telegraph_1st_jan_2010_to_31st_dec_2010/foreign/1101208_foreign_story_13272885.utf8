	Yangon, Dec. 7 (AP): Actress Michelle Yeoh has been spending time with Myanmars Aung San Suu Kyi to study for a possible film role as the Nobel Peace laureate.        
	Yeoh chatted with Suu Kyi in an airport waiting lounge today as the pro-democracy leader bid farewell to her youngest son, Kim Aris, 33, who lives in England and was allowed to visit his mother for the first time in a decade after her recent release from house arrest.        
	The former Bond girl had spent the day with Suu Kyi yesterday as part of research for an apparent film about the democracy icon, said Suu Kyis lawyer Nyan Win. Details of the film were not immediately known.        
	Yeoh  who starred in the James Bond movie Tomorrow Never Dies and in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon  observed Daw Suu and they had dinner together last night, the lawyer said. Daw is a term of respect.        
	The actress, the 65-year-old Nobel laureate and her son sat together in a waiting room of the Yangon International Airport before Yeoh and Suu Kyis son boarded flights. Suu Kyi was released on November 13 after more than seven years under house arrest.         
	Her release came a week after Myanmars first election in 20 years in which neither she nor her party could participate. Suu Kyi was first arrested in 1989 when Kim Aris was 11 and his older brother, Alexander, was 16. The military junta kept her locked away for 15 of the past 21 years.        
	Aris arrived in Myanmar on November 23 after waiting several weeks in Thailand, where he was granted a visa for the first time in years.        
	During his two-week stay, Aris bought a little brown puppy for his mother to keep her company when he leaves. Asked at the time if the dog was his new pet, he replied that it was May Mays pet, using the Myanmarese word for mother.        
	Aris mostly kept a low profile except when he marked World AIDS Day on December 2 at the headquarters of Suu Kyis political group, where he played guitar and entertained HIV/AIDS patients.        
	He visited the famed Shwedagon Pagoda a day after his arrival and also the popular Bogyoke Aung San Market with his mother on November 30, drawing huge crowds who came to greet them.         
	The well-wishers shook hands with Suu Kyi and showered her with gifts ranging from jewellery to longyis, the traditional Myanmarese sarong. Aris last visited his mother in December 2000 when they spent Christmas together.        
	Yeoh, 48, is also a dancer and is well known for performing her own stunts in action movies. She has starred mostly in Asian films and was nominated for a BAFTA award for best actress for her role in Ang Lees Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon which won four Academy Awards.

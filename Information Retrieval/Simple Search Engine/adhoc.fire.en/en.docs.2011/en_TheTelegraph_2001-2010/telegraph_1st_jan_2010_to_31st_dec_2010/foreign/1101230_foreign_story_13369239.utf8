	Beijing, Dec. 29: China is preparing for conflict in every direction, the defence minister said yesterday in remarks that threaten to overshadow a visit to Beijing by his US counterpart next month.         
	In the coming five years, our military will push forward preparations for military conflict in every strategic direction, said Liang Guanglie in an interview published by several state-backed newspapers in China.         
	We may be living in peaceful times, but we can never forget war, never send the horses south or put the bayonets and guns away, Liang added.         
	China repeatedly says it is planning a peaceful rise but the recent pace and scale of its military modernisation has alarmed many of its neighbours in the Asia-Pacific, including Japan which described Chinas military build-up as a global concern this month.         
	Liangs remarks come at a time of increasingly difficult relations between the Chinese and US armed forces which a three-day visit by his counterpart Robert Gates is intended to address.         
	A year ago China froze substantive military relations in protest at US arms sales to Taiwan and relations deteriorated further this summer when China objected to US plans to deploy one of its nuclear supercarriers, the USS George Washington, into the Yellow Sea off the Korean peninsula.         
	China also announced this month that it was preparing to launch its own aircraft carrier next year in a signal that China is determined to punch its weight as a rising superpower. The news came a year earlier than many US defence analysts had predicted.         
	China is also working on a carrier-killing ballistic missile that could sink US carriers from afar, fundamentally reordering the balance of power in a region that has been dominated by the US since the end of World War II.         
	A US Navy commander, Admiral Robert Willard, told Japans Asahi Shimbun newspaper this week that he believes the Chinese anti-ship missile, the Dong Feng 21, has already achieved initial operational capability, although it would require years of testing.         
	Analysts remain divided over whether China is initiating an Asian arms race. Even allowing for undeclared spending, Chinas annual defence budget is still less than one-sixth of Americas $663 billion a year, or less than half the US figure when expressed as a percentage of GDP.         
	However in a speech earlier this year Gates warned that Chinas new weapons, including its carrier-killing missile, threaten Americas primary way to project power and help allies in the Pacific, underscoring the difficulties that lie ahead as China and the US seek to contain growing strategic frictions.         
	As China modernises, Liang pledged that its armed forces would also increasingly use homegrown Chinese technology.

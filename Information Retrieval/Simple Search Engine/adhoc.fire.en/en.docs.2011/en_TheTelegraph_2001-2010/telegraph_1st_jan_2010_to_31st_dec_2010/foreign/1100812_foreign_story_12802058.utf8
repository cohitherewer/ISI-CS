	Jolie kids     
	 London, Aug. 11 (PTI): Actress Angelina Jolie wants her six children to see Mr amp; Mrs Smith, the film where she first met their father Brad Pitt.       
	Jolie first met Pitt on the sets of the action thriller in 2005 and went on to have a relationship with him even though Pitt was then still married to actress Jennifer Aniston.       
	I think this is gonna be a fun film for the kids to discover one day. Because its their mum and dad. It was certainly fun to film, said Jolie.       
	The actress also confessed to having an interesting time with Pitt and got an opportunity to get to know him well, reports celebrity website Contactmusic.       
	Brad and I had lots of fight scenes. Were both really competitive in real life, so it made things interesting. We went to a real shooting range together, which is an amazing thing to do as an actress, to get to know someone.

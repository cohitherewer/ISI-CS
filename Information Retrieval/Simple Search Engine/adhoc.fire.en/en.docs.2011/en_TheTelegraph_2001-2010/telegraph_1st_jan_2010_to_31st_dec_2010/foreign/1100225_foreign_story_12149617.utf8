The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | PM Office endorses GM brinjal moratorium

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Prime Ministers Office today appeared to endorse the moratorium on genetically modified brinjal imposed by environment minister Jairam Ramesh earlier this month, but said biotechnology was a key option for ensuring food security.         
	Biotechnology is an important option for increasing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security, the PMO said in a statement tonight after a meeting held by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Ramesh, agricultural minister Sharad Pawar and science and technology minister Prithviraj Chavan.         
	At the same time, we must ensure that it has no adverse effects on human and animal health and biodiversity, the PMO said.         
	The government is moving towards setting up a National Biotechnology Regulatory Authority to inspire confidence and stimulate investment in biotechnology, it added.         
	The moratorium announced by Ramesh on February 9 has been widely interpreted as an assertion of a lack of confidence in Indias existing regulatory system for approving GM crops. He had said that India should use the moratorium to establish a new regulatory system for biotechnology products. The consultation came against the backdrop of Pawar and Chavan indicating they had faith in the current regulatory system.         
	The PMO also said the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee  the regulatory arm of the environment ministry that had approved the GM brinjal  should address concerns for resolving all scientific issues related to the GM brinjal.         
	Environmental groups have interpreted the PMO statement as a vindication of the moratorium and Rameshs own stand. Ramesh has also indicated that the moratorium will remain in place until scientists are able to arrive at a consensus on the GM brinjal.         
	Pawar had reportedly written to the Prime Minister that the moratorium was demoralising for biotechnology researchers. But Ramesh has asserted that the moratorium will in no way impact research.         
	Research on GM rice, tomato, potato, cauliflower, cabbage and groundnut will continue, Ramesh had said earlier today. Im not destroying anyones science, he said, but added that among these multiple plants, only rice was relevant to food security.         
	Pawar had told a gathering of agricultural scientists last week that they should not view the moratorium as a setback but should double their research efforts to ensure that all misgivings about GM crops were removed from the minds of policy makers and the public.         
	Many scientists argue that biotechnology offers the only hope for India to ensure it produces enough food to feed its growing population. But they say GM crops should focus on introducing stresstolerant crops that will help build food security.

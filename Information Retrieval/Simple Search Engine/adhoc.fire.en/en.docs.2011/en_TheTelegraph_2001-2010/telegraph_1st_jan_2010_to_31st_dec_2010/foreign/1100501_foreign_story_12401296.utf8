The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK candidates agree: race is wide open

	London, April 30 (AP): Divided over the countrys ballooning debt, the economy and the contentious issue of immigration, the three front runners in Britains general election can still agree on one thing: this race is anyones to win.        
	Conservative challenger David Cameron, fresh off what observers said was his best live televised debate performance to date, told BBC radio that next weeks national election was still far from won.        
	Nick Clegg, still riding higher in the polls than most political observers had ever expected, said the campaign was wide open.         
	Even Britains ever-optimistic former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who hit the campaign trail today in support of his successor, Gordon Brown, could only say that their governing Labour Party has every chance of succeeding.        
	An ICM/Populus poll, published today by The Guardian, showed the gap between each party within the margin of error. Statistically, the three-way contest involving Cameron, Clegg and Brown has become a dead heat.        
	Those figures are disappointing for Cameron, whose Tories at one point enjoyed a double-digit lead over Labour, which has run the country since Blair was elected in 1997.        
	But Labour managed to whittle away Camerons advantage as the election drew closer, and both parties have been caught off-guard by Clegg, whose affable and straightforward style in the nations first US-style TV debate on April 22 led to a surge in support for his Opposition Liberal Democrats. Andrew Gamble, the head of the department of politics at Cambridge University, said Cameron should be winning this election by a mile.        
	The fact that theyre not is deeply troubling for the Conservatives, he said. Clegg is spoiling the party for them.        
	Political observers said Cameron did well in yesterdays debate, watched by some 8 million people, although Clegg also held his own. Brown placed a distant third in a performance that politics expert John Curtice described as overly defensive.        
	But none of the candidates provided detailed economic recovery plans in a nation that faces major economic troubles and one of the largest deficits in Europe  both of which will require harsh cuts in public spending after the election.        
	However, Browns opponents are not taking anything for granted. Addressing a crowd in northern England, Clegg said he was certainly not going to rest one millisecond, one minute until this campaign ends  right up to the moment when people decide how to vote.        
	There are lots of people who havent decided how they are going to vote, he said. I think many people now see this campaign is wide open. Its one of the most exciting campaigns in a generation and that we can do something different.

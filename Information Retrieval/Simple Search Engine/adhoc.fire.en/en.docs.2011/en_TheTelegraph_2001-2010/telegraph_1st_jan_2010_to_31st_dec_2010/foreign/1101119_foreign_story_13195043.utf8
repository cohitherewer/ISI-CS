          ALAN COWELL                          Liu Xiaobo                                  
	London, Nov. 18: The Nobel Peace Prize committee said today that a central part of the 2010 award presentation in Oslo next month would most likely be postponed because neither the winner, the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, nor family members who are under official restriction in China were able to attend.        
	While the pageant itself is still scheduled to be held in the soaring Central Hall of Oslo City Hall before around 1,000 guests, some of its most evocative high points  the handover of the Nobel gold medal, a diploma and prize money worth some $1.5 million  are unlikely to be included, the organisers said.        
	The ceremony is set to take place on December 10, but Liu is imprisoned and his wife, Liu Xia, is under house arrest. Under Nobel Peace Prize rules, the prize may only be presented to the winner or a close family member.        
	The Chinese restriction on the Nobel laureates family are some of the most severe in the history of the prize, including in the years of the cold war when Soviet leaders kept close controls on dissent.        
	Even in 1975, Elena Bonner Sakharavoa was able to accept the prize on behalf of her husband, the physicist Andrei D. Sakharov while, in 1983, Danuta Walesa accepted on behalf of her husband, Lech Walesa, the Polish labour leader, according to the secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Geir Lundestad. The limitations on the prize-giving this year will not, however, derail the entire pageant.        
	The ceremony will definitely take place, Lundestad said in a telephone interview from Oslo. It will include a speech by the chairman of the peace committee and text messages from the winner read out by the Norwegian actor and director Liv Ullmann..        
	But, Lundestad said, it looks likely that the formal presentation of the diploma, medal and prize money will be indefinitely delayed until we have the right people here.        
	There was no immediate reaction from Lius family, who, along with scores of outspoken supporters in China, has been subjected to various forms of pressure from authorities since the prize was announced in early October.        
	Lius wife has been largely incommunicado since the day the prize was awarded. One of Lius brothers, Liu Xiaoxuan, did not answer his mobile phone. He had voiced a willingness to represent his brother in Oslo. But this evening, he sent a brief text message in response to a reporters unanswered calls, writing: Right now I am being monitored, cannot take interviews, can only keep silent.

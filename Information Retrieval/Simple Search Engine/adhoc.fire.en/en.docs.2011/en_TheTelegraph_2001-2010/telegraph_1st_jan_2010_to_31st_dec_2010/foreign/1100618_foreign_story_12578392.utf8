                              Not immune                            
	Washington, June 17 (Agencies): The US Supreme Court has upheld the search of a police officers personal messages on a government-owned pager, saying it did not violate his constitutional rights even though some of the texts were sexually explicit.        
	The court was unanimous today in reversing a federal appeals court ruling that sided with the Ontario, California, Swat team officer. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court that the officer, Sergeant Jeff Quon, could not assume that his messages were in all circumstances immune from scrutiny.        
	But Kennedy said the court purposely avoided a broader ruling about employees expectations of privacy when using equipment provided by their employers because of rapid and unpredictable changes in technology.        
	The Ontario department discovered many personal messages, including some that were said to be sexually explicit, when it decided to audit text message usage to see whether Swat team officers were using their pagers too often for personal reasons.        
	It marked the first time that the Supreme Court addressed whether the US Constitutions protection of privacy rights extended to text messages on the job.        
	The ruling was a victory for a city in California and for the Obama administration, which had argued that workers have no expectation of privacy in their communications on devices supplied by their employers.        
	The case had been closely watched as computers, mobile phones and pagers have become standard communications equipment in the workplace.         
	Many employers have told their workers their use of the devices can be monitored.        
	Quon and three others had sued the department and the police chief who read the text messages. Quon said the police chief violated his privacy rights and those with whom he sent and received the messages  fellow Sergeant Steve Trujillo, Dispatcher April Florio, who was his girlfriend, and his wife Jerilyn Quon.        
	The department said Quon used his pager to exchange hundreds of personal messages, many of them sexually explicit.        
	He sent the messages despite signing a city policy that allows only limited personal use of employer-owned electronic equipment and that warns them not to expect any privacy in use of the devices.        
	Under the citys contract with the company that provided the text messaging services, each pager was allotted 25,000 characters a month.         
	Another officer told Quon he could reimburse the city for any charges when exceeding the limit.        
	The police department contacted the provider, a company which is now part of USA Mobility Inc, after learning some officers had exceeded the limit each month. The company provided transcripts of the messages to the police chief.        
	Kennedy said: Though the case touches issues of far-reaching significance, the court concludes it can be resolved by settled principles determining when a search is reasonable.

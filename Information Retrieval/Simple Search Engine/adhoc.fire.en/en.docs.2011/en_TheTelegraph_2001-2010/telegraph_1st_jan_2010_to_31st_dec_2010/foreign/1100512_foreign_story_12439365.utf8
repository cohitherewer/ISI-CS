          ANDREW HOUGH                          Bug bother                                  
	May 11: Twitter, the microblogging site, was targeted by a Turkish hacker who caused a security glitch that left users, including many celebrities, with no followers.        
	The bug, believed to have been started by a user called Bora Kirca, caused millions of users accounts around the world to temporarily lose the list of people who followed them on the social networking site. The glitch, which was fixed late yesterday, allowed any Twitter user to force another to follow them without permission. Normally, the other person has to initiate such a following.        
	 It hit countless number of high profile users and celebrities of the Internet site including Oprah Winfrey, the talk show host, Justin Bieber, the Canadian teenage pop star, and Hollywood couple Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore.        
	Twitters efforts to close the hole briefly left a number of users with zero followers although the delivery of messages did not appear to have been affected.        
	It also left many of the sites users being bombarded by spammers and unsavoury users. Its unclear how long the flaw existed and how many people took advantage of it. Gizmodo, a popular technology blog, broke news of the bug before later publishing details about the bug.        
	Follow this dead-simple guide to force any Twitter user  from Oprah (Winfrey) to (Ashton) Kutcher  to follow you. No, seriously, said Gizmodo.com, which last month obtained and published details about the latest iPhone prototype from Apple.        
	It said the bug was discovered by a Turkish Twitter user who figured out accidentally that if you tweet accept username, for example billgates, then Bill Gates will follow you.              
	For hours, thousands of people were able to take control of other peoples Twitter accounts with a trick so easy that even the newest Twitterer could execute it, Gizmodo said.        
	Bieber tweeted earlier yesterday: So I woke up here in LA and Twitter has been hacked. Turns out I am no longer popular. He later added: Hackers, I send a warning ... u have now p***** off over 2 million teenage girls. They are more dangerous than Navy Seals.        
	Kutcher, one of the first people to build up a million followers, tweeted: Twitter is being hacked by some Turkish hacker. Ha ha, I have 0 followers.         
	His wife tweeted: The Turkish hacker is really doing a number on Twitter. Wow!                    The Daily Telegraph

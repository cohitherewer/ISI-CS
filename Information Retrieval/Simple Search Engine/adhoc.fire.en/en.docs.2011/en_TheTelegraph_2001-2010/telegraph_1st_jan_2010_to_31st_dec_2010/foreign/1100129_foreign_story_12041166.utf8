	Insecure Cruz    
	 London, Jan. 28 (PTI): Actress Penelope Cruz says that her best work comes out of her insecurities.       
	Since winning an Oscar for her role in Vicky Cristina Barcelona last year, the 35-year-old actress says she doesnt feel any extra pressure when making her films because she has always worked hard.      
	Cruz said: Ive always felt under pressure and had a lot of insecurity, so that doesnt change and I dont want that to alter. I dont want to get to the set and feel too secure. Ive worked for so many years feeling a lot of respect and healthy fear of the work and I dont feel I can change that now.     
	Dress size    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): One is known for her rail tin figure while the other is a Hollywood diva famous for her curves, but Victoria Beckham and Jennifer Lopez share the same dress size. Victoria admits that she too was surprised that Lopez fits into the same dresses as her, reports Us magazine. My dresses are for women of all shapes and sizes. Actually, the one I tried on yesterday was the one Jennifer wore.

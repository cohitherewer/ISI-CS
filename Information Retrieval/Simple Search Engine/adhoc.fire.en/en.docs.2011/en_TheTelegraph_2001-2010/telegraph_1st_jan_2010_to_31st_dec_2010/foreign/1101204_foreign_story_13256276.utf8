	Beijing, Dec. 3: Chinas top leaders announced today that the country will tighten monetary policy next year, a sign that the leaders are increasingly concerned about inflation and an overheated economy even as other nations, including the US, continue to grapple with a global recession.        
	The announcement was made in an article by Xinhua, Chinas official news agency. It reported that the Politburo, the elite nine-member team at the top of the party hierarchy, had decided that Chinas monetary policy should shift from relatively loose to prudent next year. The article also said China will continue its proactive fiscal policy, meaning that investment spending would not be severely curbed.        
	Chinas economy has continued to grow rapidly, bolstered in part by an enormous government stimulus package and liberal lending by state banks following the onset of the global financial crisis in late 2008. The move to rein in liquidity and bank lending, presumably through interest rate increases and other means, indicates that Chinese leaders feel confident enough in prospects for future growth that they can afford to cool down the economy.        
	The Xinhua article did not discuss the implications of a tighter monetary policy for the value of the renminbi. But an important reason Chinas monetary policy has been loose for the last several years has been the central banks large-scale issuance of renminbi so as to buy dollars.        
	This currency market intervention has kept the renminbi weak and has made Chinese exports more competitive in foreign markets while making foreign goods more expensive in China.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bomb kills professor in Tehran
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bomb kills professor in Tehran
          ALAN COWELL                          Massoud Ali Mohammadi                                  
	Paris, Jan. 12: A remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle killed an Iranian physics professor outside his home in northern Tehran today, state media reported, blaming the US and Israel for the attack.        
	There was no immediate claim of responsibility. One state broadcaster, IRIB, quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying that in the initial investigation, signs of the triangle of wickedness by the Zionist regime, America and their hired agents are visible in the terrorist act against the scientist, Massoud Ali Mohammadi.        
	There was some dispute about his field of scientific specialisation. The English-language Press TV said he taught neutron physics at Tehran University, although it was not clear whether he was part of Irans contentious nuclear enrichment programme.        
	The broadcaster called the professor a staunch supporter of the Islamic Revolution of 1979 that overthrew the Shah.        
	But two Iranian academics, who spoke in return for anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said in telephone interviews that he was not a nuclear physicist and had specialised in particle and theoretical physics. The website of Tehran University lists him as a professor of elementary particle physics.        
	A spokesman for Irans atomic agency, Ali Shirzadian, told The Associated Press that Ali Mohammadi had no link with the agency responsible for Irans nuclear programme.        
	Since flawed presidential elections last June, Iran has been gripped by its deepest political crisis since 1979, pitting supporters of the victorious President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad against opponents who call his regime illegitimate. News reports said Ali Mohammadis name had been on a list of 240 university teachers published on reformist websites before the election and identified as supporters of the main Opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi. But there was no formal confirmation from Tehran.        
	After brutal crackdowns, the authorities late last year broadened efforts to stifle dissent to encompass the educational system, hinting that dissident professors would be purged. A number of hard-line clerics have called for the university humanities curriculums to be further Islamised. But it was not immediately known whether todays killing was related to that dispute.        
	Analysts said the Iranian authorities seemed to have been quick to label Ali Mohammadi a loyalist, possibly as a precursor to renewed, harsh action against their opponents. The reported bombing came just days after pro-government demonstrators shot at the armoured car of the Irans most outspoken Opposition leader, Mehdi Karroubi, last Thursday.        
	Press TV reported today that Ali Mohammadi, 50, was killed close to his home in the Qeytariyeh neighbourhood of northern Tehran when a bomb attached to a motorcycle exploded near his car.

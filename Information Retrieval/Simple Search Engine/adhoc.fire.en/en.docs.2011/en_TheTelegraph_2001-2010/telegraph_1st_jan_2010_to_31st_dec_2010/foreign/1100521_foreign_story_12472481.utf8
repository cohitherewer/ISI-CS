	Bangkok, May 20 (AP): Fears grew today that the tentative quiet restored to Thailands capital after a bloody crackdown on protests may just be a respite from violence and political polarisation that could continue for years.        
	Soldiers mopped up pockets of resistance and the government declared it was back in control,        
	Leaders of the anti-government Red Shirt movement vowed a return as they were taken into custody.        
	I think this is a new beginning for the Red Shirts, said Kevin Hewison, a Thailand expert at the University of North Carolina. It will be a darker and grimmer time of struggle and less-focused activities. By no stretch of the imagination is the movement finished.        
	The Thai government declared today it had mostly quelled 10 weeks of violent protests in the capital as buildings smouldered, troops rooted out die-hard holdouts and some residents cautiously attempted a return to normal life a day after a military operation cleared the main commercial district of thousands of demonstrators, leaving 15 dead and nearly 100 injured.        
	 Troops roamed the city on foot and in Humvees and exchanged gunfire with scattered Red Shirt holdouts, who fought near the citys Victory Monument and torched a bank, bringing to 40 the number of buildings set aflame after the military push sent the protesters retreating from their demonstration site.        
	The protesters, demanding elections, had fortified themselves behind tyre-and-bamboo-spike barricades.         
	Thailands finance ministry estimated the economic damage to the country at $1.5 billion. Continued security concerns led officials to extend a nighttime curfew in Bangkok and 23 other provinces for three more days.        
	Even so, army spokesman Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd said the government was in charge. Overall, we have the situation under control, he said.        
	Residents, meanwhile, moved carefully to resume their routines. With military checkpoints closing, city workers removed debris and collected piles of garbage left in the streets. Residents in protest areas were able to leave home to shop. Electricity was restored in many areas.        
	But many of those who ventured into the streets were still deeply shaken by the violence. This really worries me  this shouldnt happen to Thailand, said Somjit Suksumrain, a construction company manager. Thailand should not end up like this.        
	By late today, authorities had taken into custody most of the senior Red Shirt leaders.        
	Three surrendered today after five others gave themselves up the previous day and were flown to a military camp south of Bangkok for interrogation. Id like to ask all sides to calm down and talk with each other in a peaceful manner, Veera Musikapong said after being taken into custody today. We cannot create democracy with anger.        
	Not all were as conciliatory.        
	Somyot Pruksakasemsuk, another Red Shirt leader, said the movement was simply regrouping. Initially, independent movements of the masses in Bangkok and the regions will begin, then riots will ensue, he said. For Thailand in the long term, there will be major changes due to the crisis of faith.        
	The government described the mayhem as organised terrorism. Officials also said the arson and looting after the troops quashed the main protest were anticipated aftershocks that did not represent deeper trouble.        
	Still, government spokesman Panithan Wattanayagorn acknowledged the protesters had sympathisers among the broader populace, and said the rioting was sparked by disappointment, hopelessness and anger.        
	But he said it was only as large as it was because of prior organised planning.        
	The Red Shirts had demanded the ouster of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajivas government and new elections. The protesters, many of them poor farmers or members of the urban underclass, say Abhisit is oblivious to their plight.        
	Analysts said Abhisit was under increased pressure to hold early elections. Abhisit still has to hold elections by next year, and he could be under pressure still to do it earlier, by his original November offer, said Paul Handley, the author of a biography of Thailands king. Thailand still needs to hit this reset button. ... Even if Abhisits government is technically legal, the Reds widespread perception that it is illegitimate remains.

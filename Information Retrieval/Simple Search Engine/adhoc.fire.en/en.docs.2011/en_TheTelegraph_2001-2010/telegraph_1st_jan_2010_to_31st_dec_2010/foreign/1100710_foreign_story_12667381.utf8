	Beijing, July 9 (Reuters and AP): Google Inc said today that the Chinese authorities had renewed its licence to operate a website, averting a potential shutdown of its flagship search page in the worlds biggest Internet market.        
	The renewal of the licence to provide Internet content was in doubt because of the rocky relations between Google and Chinese authorities over hacking of Gmail accounts and censorship of Google search results.        
	Google had last week stopped automatically redirecting users in China to its uncensored Hong Kong site after Beijing threatened to withdraw its licence.        
	We are very pleased that the government has renewed our... licence and we look forward to continuing to provide web search and local products to our users in China, said an e-mailed statement by Googles top lawyer, David Drummond.        
	The statement, which gave no other details, also was posted on Googles blog. There was no immediate statement posted on the website of Chinas ministry of industry and information technology.        
	Losing the Chinese licence would have been a significant setback for Google, even though China will only account for a fraction of the companys projected $28 billion in revenue this year.         
	China already has nearly 400 million web surfers, making it the worlds biggest Internet market, and usage is expected to rise for years to come. For Beijing, the renewal partly defuses a high-profile dispute that has added to the perception of China as becoming less welcoming to foreign businesses.        
	Google CEO Eric Schmidt had said yesterday that he expected Beijing to renew the licence. A company spokesperson, Courtney Hohne, said today she could give no further details.        
	In the coming days, we will clarify what products well offer locally through google.cn, she said, referring to companys Chinese site.        
	Google closed its China search engine in March but has wanted to keep a website that offers music and other services. Users had been automatically redirected to Googles uncensored Hong Kong site, but the company stopped that last week after Chinese officials warned the move could mean losing its licence.        
	Googles relations with Beijing have been rocky since the US search giant said it no longer wanted to cooperate with government Internet censorship. The announcement was prompted by cyber attacks the company traced to China.        
	The conflict has posed a balancing act for Google. The company wants to uphold the principle of free access to information while also keeping a foothold in the Chinese market.        
	Google, based in Mountain View, California, does not hold the kind of dominant position in the Chinese search market that it does in the US. The search engine operated by Chinese competitor Baidu Inc has about 60 per cent of the market to Googles 30 per cent.

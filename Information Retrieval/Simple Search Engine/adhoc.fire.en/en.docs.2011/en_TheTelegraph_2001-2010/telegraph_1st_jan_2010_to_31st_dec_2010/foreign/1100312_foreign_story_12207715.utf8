	Washington, March 11 (PTI): President Barack Obama today named secretary of state Hillary Clinton the certification authority to verify the Indo-US civilian nuclear act for Congress every six months.
    
	Under the act, the US President needs to certify to the appropriate congressional committees that it is the policy of America to work with members of the Nuclear Suppliers Group, individually and collectively, to agree to further restrict the transfers of equipment and technology related to the enrichment of uranium and reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. 
    
	Clintons new responsibility came as First Lady Michelle Obama almost mixed up the secretary of state with the President. As she stood up to address a ceremony held to present awards to women from across the globe, Michelle said: Let me thank my dear friend, Senator  Secretary Clinton. 
    
	The audience burst into laughter as Michelle said: I almost said, President Clinton.
    
	Michelle showered praise on Clinton. I think its fair to say that this woman (Hillary Clinton) here set the standard in her last post in a presidential administration and she is once again setting a terrific standard.

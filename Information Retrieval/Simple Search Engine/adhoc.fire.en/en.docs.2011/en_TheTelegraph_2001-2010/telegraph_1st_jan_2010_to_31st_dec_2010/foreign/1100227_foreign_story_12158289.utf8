	Singapore, Feb. 26 (Reuters): An iceberg the size of Luxembourg has broken off from a glacier in Antarctica after being rammed by another giant iceberg, scientists said today, in an event that could affect ocean circulation patterns.        
	The 2,500sqkm iceberg broke off earlier this month from the Mertz Glaciers 160km floating tongue of ice that sticks out into the Southern Ocean. The collision has since halved the size of the tongue that drains ice from the vast East Antarctic ice sheet.

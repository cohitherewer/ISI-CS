                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Innovation key to Indo-US relations
          K.P. NAYAR                          SM Krishna                                  
	Washington, May 29: External affairs minister S.M. Krishna will outline the next stage of Indo-US relations under the Obama administration when he addresses the 35th anniversary meeting of the US-India Business Council (USIBC) here on Wednesday.        
	Drawing on his experience as Karnataka chief minister in having turned Bangalore into quot;Asias Silicon Valley quot;, Krishna plans to underpin quot;innovation quot; as the sheet anchor of Indias ties with America as bilateral relations between them enter a new phase, six months before US President Obamas planned visit to New Delhi.        
	As part of preparations for the first quot;strategic dialogue quot; between the two countries next week, the US assistant secretary of state for South Asia, Robert Blake, said yesterday that plans on schedule for a global disease detection centre in India quot;has the potential to be one of the flagship science and technology ventures between the US and India, in which our joint researchers will be able to study and hopefully find cures for some of the major global pandemic diseases. quot;        
	Obama is taking a personal interest in the inaugural strategic dialogue with India and will demonstrate his commitment to the process with a special gesture of meeting Krishna although he is not a head of state or government.        
	According to administration sources here, he plans to do this either by attending a reception for Krishna to be hosted by the US secretary of state Hillary Clinton on Thursday or by dropping in on Krishnas meeting with the US national security adviser, General James Jones in the White House complex earlier. Obama had a phone conversation with prime minister Manmohan Singh yesterday.        
	In his address to the USIBC, Krishna will stress innovation being already done in India by US companies like Honeywell and General Electric as well as by the large pool of Indian Americans engaged in scientific and other research in US, including its commercial sector.        
	The external affairs minister will point out that by pooling the resources available in both countries in this area, India and the US stand to benefit through mutual cooperation in the 21st century.        
	Such innovation outside its borders is crucial for America and its economy since the US is an ageing society demographically and needs to look at younger nations with a large talent pool in order to remain competitive in the long run.        
	After the outbreak of pandemics like swine flu, Sars and avian flu, the US has been keen to expand its domestic Center for Disease Control (CDC) globally by setting up facilities abroad to detect disease occurrences in association with countries which are willing to improve their own surveillance and reporting.        
	India was chosen last year to host the seventh such regional centre around the globe in what the CDC calls its quot;principal and most visible program for developing and strengthening global capacity to rapidly detect, accurately identify, and promptly contain emerging infectious disease and bioterrorist threats that occur internationally. quot;        
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao will fly directly from Beijing at the end of president Pratibha Patils visit to China and arrive here on Tuesday to revive structured foreign office consultations between the two sides which had become moribund despite the intensity of Indo-US engagement in recent years.        
	On Wednesday, she will have a whole day of consultations with her US counterpart, the US under secretary of state for political affairs, William Burns.        
	Burns returned from a flying visit to New Delhi a few days ago and wrote an unusual blog on the state departments website about India.        
	 quot;The rise of India is important and positive for American interests. I cant think of a global challenge today that doesnt require Indian cooperation -- climate change, counterterrorism, international economic stability, nuclear nonproliferation, economic growth and the list goes on, quot; Burns wrote as the Obama administration prepares the red carpet for Krishna, planning commision deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, human resources development minister Kapil Sibal, the minister of state for science and technology, Prthviraj Chavan and a host of government secretaries.        
	So keen are the Americans to ensure that the strategic dialogue with India has no hiccups and creates the best atmospherics in the run up to Obamas visit that the administration has sent away Richard Holbrooke, the presidents special envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, on a holiday and dropped broad hints that he should not even be in town from June 1 to 4 when the Indian delegation is here.        
	Afghanistan and Pakistan will form a crucial segment of the strategic dialogue, but there is no love lost between Indian officials and Holbrooke, whom New Delhi sees as Islamabads cats paw in the so-called Af-Pak policies of the Obama administration.        
	Equally, there is considerable curiosity on the American side about the significant absence from the strategic dialogue of the minister of state for environment, Jairam Ramesh, although climate change is a crucial component of next weeks talks.        
	The official explanation for the ministers absence is that Ramesh is tying up his re-nomination to the Rajya Sabha, a process with potential slips, but he may have decided to lie low after his controversial remarks about Sino-Indian relations in Beijing recently.        
	The Americans have vivid memories of how Ramesh called a spade and spade about US hypocrisy on climate change during Clintons visit to India last year and upset American sensibilities. Ramesh will be represented by the Secretary of the ministry of environment and forests, Vijai Sharma, at the dialogue.

          PETER NICHOLAS                          Real plunge                                  
	Washington, Aug. 17: First Lady Michelle Obama will soon take her first real plunge into partisan politics since her husband won the presidency 21 months ago, making select appearances for Democratic candidates hoping that her popularity will excite crowds and donors in a bleak election season.        
	Her campaign schedule will not be a heavy one, the White House said yesterday. She makes public appearances about three days a week, and any campaigning she does for the mid-term election will be within that time frame, a White House official said.        
	The First Ladys itinerary will not be set until Labour Day, when the White House political team determines travel plans for the President and Vice-President, the official said.         
	Michelle Obama will deliver a campaign speech that is largely upbeat. She will not castigate individual Republicans, said the White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The First Lady has enlisted Republicans in her anti-obesity campaign, so she would risk antagonising hard-won allies were she to deliver a fiercely partisan message.        
	Instead, she will keep the focus on her husbands legislative successes. This wont be a red-meat partisan speech, the official said. Thats not her nature, and it wouldnt necessarily be effective. Things like her Lets Move campaign have been entirely bipartisan.         
	Rather, the First Lady will tell voters: We have a lot on the agenda, and the person Im standing next to here is an ally in that effort, the official said.

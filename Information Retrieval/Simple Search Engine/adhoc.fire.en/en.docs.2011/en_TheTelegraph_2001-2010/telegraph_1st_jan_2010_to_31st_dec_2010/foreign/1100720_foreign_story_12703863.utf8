                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      On Twitter, Palin invents new word
          ALEX SPILLIUS                          gaffe prone                                  
	Washington, July 19: Sarah Palin has run into language difficulties in the course of attempting to write an entry on her Twitter account about plans to build a mosque near the Ground Zero site in New York.        
	The former vice-presidential candidate, who regularly uses the social networking website to communicate her views, made three attempts before writing an error-free Twitter entry, which can only contain 140 characters.        
	In her first effort, she asked peaceful Muslims to pls refudiate the mosque. Having invented a word, in her second attempt she used refute incorrectly, calling on peaceful New Yorkers to refute the Ground Zero mosque plan.        
	Both those messages were removed from her Twitter page, though not before being salvaged by US news websites. The third attempt remains.        
	By way of explanation for her errors, the former Alaska governor posted a fourth tweet that said: English is a living language. Shakespeare liked to coin new words too.        
	The substance of her messages prompted a strong response  on Twitter  from an aide to Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York. Andrea Batista Schlesinger tweeted: SarahPalinUSA mind your business.

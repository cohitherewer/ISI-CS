The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Death penalty down in US

	New York, Dec. 21: States are continuing a trend of executing fewer prisoners and juries are wary of sentencing criminal defendants to die, according to year-end figures compiled by a group that opposes the death penalty.        
	The 46 executions in 2010 constituted a nearly 12 per cent drop from the previous years total of 52, according to the group, Death Penalty Information Center, which produces an annual report on execution trends. The overall trend shows a marked drop when compared with the 85 executions in 2000. Jurors, too, show a continuing preference for the alternative of punishing criminal defendants with sentences of life without parole.         
	Juries handed out 114 death sentences in 2010, slightly higher than the 112 death sentences last year, and 50 per cent fewer for the current decade than in the 1990s  before the widespread availability of life without parole sentences.        
	Theres just a whole lot more concern about the accuracy of the death penalty, the fairness and even the costs  all are contributing, said Richard C. Dieter, the author of the report and the executive director of the center, which is in Washington. The availability of the alternative to the death penalty, Dieter said, also means that prosecutors know its going to be a harder sell and are seeking it less.        
	The states continue to condemn far more prisoners to death than they actually execute.There are 3,261 people on death row in the US; California has the largest population, with 697, while New Hampshire has one apiece. A majority of Americans support the death penalty, with 64 per cent of those surveyed by Gallup favouring it and 29 percent opposed.

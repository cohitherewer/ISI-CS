	Karachi, Nov. 11 (AP): Militants attacked a police compound in the heart of Karachi today with a hail of gunfire and a massive car bomb, levelling the building and killing at least 18 people, authorities and witnesses said.        
	The gang of around six gunmen managed to penetrate a high-security area of Karachi that is home to the US Consulate, two luxury hotels and the residence of the Sindh chief minister While no stranger to extremist violence, Karachi has not witnessed this kind of organised assault in recent years.        
	It was the first major attack against a government target outside the northwestern tribal regions for several months, showing the reach of Islamist militants seeking to overthrow the US-allied government despite efforts to crack down on them over the last three years.        
	The gunmen first opened fire on the offices of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) before detonating a huge car bomb, said Sindh home minister Zulfiqar Mirza. The building has a detention facility that was believed to be holding criminals, and possibly militants.        
	 The CID takes the lead in hunting down terrorists in Karachi.        
	Earlier this week, the agency arrested six members of the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, an al Qaida linked group blamed for several high profile attacks in recent years. The suspects were presented before a court earlier today.        
	The blast could be heard several kilometres away in the city of 14 million people. It destroyed much of the two-storied police building, damaged nearby houses and left a 3-metre wide crater in the road. The US consulate was around 1.5km away, but was undamaged.        
	We heard different kinds of firing for several minutes and then a deafening explosion, said Ali Hussain, who was covered in dust. The roof of our house collapsed.        
	 Bloodied and dazed victims were taken to ambulances, some of them children pulled from the debris. Security officers searching through mangled bricks and iron looking for survivors late into the night.        
	Sindh government spokeswoman Sharmila Farooqi said 18 people, including 10 police officers, were killed. About 100 people were injured.        
	Geo News channel reported that the banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan had claimed responsibility for the attack. They said their next target was the Presidents House in Islamabad.         
	In 2002, suicide bombers had struck at one of the Sheraton hotel, killing 12 French naval technicians. After that incident the government had declared the area a high-security zone.         
	Islamist militants with bases in the northwest close to Afghanistan began targeting the state in earnest in 2007.        
	Many thousands of people, most of them civilians, have been killed in suicide attacks against government, police and western targets, as well religious minorities.        
	The government has declared war on the militants, and the army has moved into several areas in the northwest. But the insurgents have proved to be remarkably resilient.

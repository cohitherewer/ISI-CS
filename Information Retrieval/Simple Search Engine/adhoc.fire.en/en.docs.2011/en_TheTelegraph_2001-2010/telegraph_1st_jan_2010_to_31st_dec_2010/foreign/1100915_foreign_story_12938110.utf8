	Sept. 14: Barack Obama has written a book for children about inspirational Americans called Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters.        
	The book is a tribute to 13 Americans, from the first President, George Washington, to baseball great Jackie Robinson to artist Georgia Keeffe.        
	It will be released on November 16 by Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers, an imprint of Random House Childrens Books.         
	Obama is not the first President to write for young people. Jimmy Carters The Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer was published in 1995, more than a decade after he left office.        
	More in line with President Obamas effort, Theodore Roosevelt collaborated with Henry Cabot Lodge on Hero Tales from American History, released in 1895, before Roosevelt was President.        
	Obamas book is illustrated by Loren Long, whose many credits include Watty Pipers classic The Little Engine That Could, Randall de Seves Toy Boat and Madonnas Mr Peabodys Apples.        
	Long wrote and illustrated the childrens stories Otis and Drummer Boy. His cover design for Of Thee I Sing is a sunny impression of presidential daughters Sasha and Malia Obama walking their dog, Bo, along a grassy field.

	Jhelum, March 9 (Reuters): A five-year-old British boy kidnapped in Pakistan nearly a week ago is alive and police are making progress in the investigation, a police official said today.        
	Sahil Saeed, who is of Pakistani origin, was abducted last Thursday after gunmen barged into his grandmothers house, held the family at gun-point for hours and then left with some valuables and the boy.        
	The child is safe. We made some progress and hopefully, well sort out this case soon, Khalid Mehmood, police superintendent for investigations in the city of Jhelum, told Reuters.        
	Interior minister Rehman Malik said on Sunday that police were closing in on the kidnappers and that the abductors appeared to be close to the boys family.

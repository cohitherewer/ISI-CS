                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Assange rape case rejected
                              Assange: Reprieve                            
	Stockholm, Aug. 25 (AP): A Swedish prosecutor said today she will continue investigating an accusation of molestation against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange but formally dismissed another case that was initially labelled a suspected rape.        
	 Assange has denied both allegations.        
	After reviewing information from an interrogation with the woman who had filed the rape complaint, chief prosecutor Eva Finne said she decided that there were no grounds to suspect Assange of any type of crime in that case.        
	On Saturday, Finne withdrew an arrest warrant for Assange issued by another prosecutor and said he was no longer suspected of rape.        
	However, she continued investigating the case to see whether there were grounds to suspect the Australian of lesser crimes, including molestation or sexual molestation.        
	But I find in my analysis that this is not the case, Finne said today.        
	In the other case, which involved a different woman, Finne said the suspicion of molestation remains and that Assange would be questioned in the investigation.        
	Molestation covers a wide range of offences under Swedish law, including inappropriate physical contact with another adult, and can result in fines or up to one year in prison.        
	Assange was in Sweden last week seeking legal protection for WikiLeaks.

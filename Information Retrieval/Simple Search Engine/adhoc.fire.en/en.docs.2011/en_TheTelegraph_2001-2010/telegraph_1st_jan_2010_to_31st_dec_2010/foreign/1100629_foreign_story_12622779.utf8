                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Celebrity shapers to help remove love handles
  - IT FIRMS EVERYTHING UP                              TONING AND TIGHTENING: Actress Jessica Alba who has got rid of excess fat with the help of slimming garments. (Reuters)                                  
	If you could slip into Scarlett Haras wasp waist at will, would you still spend sweaty hours on that Pilates mat?        
	Shapewear, bodywear and shapers are figure flattering foundation garments that use the latest technology to smooth away those pesky love handles, tummy rolls and muffin tops.        
	Experts say while these very trendy undergarments may effectively eliminate the panty lines of celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba, they are not magic bullets for the rest of us.        
	For some women its the difference between size 8 and size 10, said Maggie Adams of Spanx, the US-based shapewear giant that began with footless pantyhose in 2000.It firms everything up. But Adams said it is not your grandmothers girdle, referring to her companys line, which now includes slimming swimwear and mens T-shirts.        
	Those had boning, metal and really uncomfortable, heavy stuff. Our newest collection is a single layer. Were trying to get it as thin as possible.        
	Certainly the science, and the sociology, of foundation wear has come a long way since the 1830s when the corset was considered a medical necessity because it was believed that women were so fragile they needed stays to hold themselves up.        
	Adams said Spanx is working on a line of active wear. Were about helping women and now men to accentuate their assets.        
	Leonisa Shapewear goes one step beyond. The lingerie brand, which began in Latin America, claims to redistribute and eliminate fat by creating a lipo-transportation affect, which is described as similar to liposuction without the surgery.        
	A girdle will smooth out, but once you take off a girdle youre back from where you started, said spokesperson Mary Lou Burkhardt. If you keep using it (shapewear), youll see a change in your body, she said. Its toning and tightening.        
	Burkhardt added that it is breathable. You dont sweat but it does have that compressive nature, she explained.        
	Jessica Matthews, spokesperson for the American Council on Exercise, said shapewear is the latest take on the compression clothing that has been used by distance runners, athletes and football players for some time.

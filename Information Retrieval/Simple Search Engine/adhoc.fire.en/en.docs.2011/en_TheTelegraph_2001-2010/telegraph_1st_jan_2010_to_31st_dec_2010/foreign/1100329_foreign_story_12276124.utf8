	Drew ire    
	 London (PTI): Actress Drew Barrymore has said she detests being called a celebrity. Celebrity! Its become the most disgusting word on the planet. It makes me sick to my stomach, Barrymore told The Guardian. The 35-year-old actress has done mainly comic roles. When I started out, I was an actor. And now when someone calls me a celebrity, I want to shoot them. I want to go, thank you for reducing me  Ive killed myself to be established as someone who is responsible, reliable and accountable in my field of work, yet youre calling me a name of someone who basically got famous for no reason, she said.

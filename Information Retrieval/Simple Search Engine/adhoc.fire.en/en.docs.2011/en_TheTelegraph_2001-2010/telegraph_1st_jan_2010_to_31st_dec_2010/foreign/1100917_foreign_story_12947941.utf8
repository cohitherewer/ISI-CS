	Washington, Sept. 16 (AP): The White House is denying that Michelle Obama, the Presidents wife, ever described her White House life as hell.        
	Michelle Obamas spokeswoman, Katie McCormick Lelyveld, responded today to a purported comment attributed to Michelle Obama in the book, Carla and the Ambitious, about French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy.         
	The book says Bruni-Sarkozy recalled that during a recent White House visit with her the French President she asked Michelle Obama about her new role. According to the book, Obama replied: Its hell. I cant stand it.

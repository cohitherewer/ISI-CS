          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Dec. 10: Mamata Banerjee has said she wants turn Calcutta into London but after what happened last night Bengals chief minister in waiting might conclude that perhaps it is better to keep dear old Calcutta, with all its faults, just as it is.        
	 For a start, thugs who throw stones at police in Calcutta are engaging in childs play, compared with the London riots when a protest over rise in student fees turned into a full-fledged battle between police and demonstrators.        
	 The prime minister David Cameron insisted the perpetrators of last nights violence would feel the full force of the law of the land.        
	 As MPs debated the motion to raise university fees, baying mobs broke away from the rest of the estimated 30,000 strong crowds consisting of students, lecturers, parents and union officials.        
	 They moved from the gathering point in Trafalgar Square towards Westminster where hundreds of police in full riot gear and others mounted on horses were waiting.         
	The Mothers of parliaments in the worlds oldest democracy was barricaded by a double row of steel barriers.        
	In Parliament Square, rampaging students  some were probably professional agitators who had infiltrated the demonstrations  tore down metal barriers, painted a black anarchists A sign on a wall, daubed graffiti on statues and on St Margarets Church.        
	 Bus stops, benches, sign posts and five red listed telephone booths in the area were also targeted by the vandals, as was the Supreme Court and the Treasury building where windows were smashed.        
	 Missiles were thrown at the police during the fierce running battles. Police responded by striking protestors with batons and charging them on horseback.         
	 While injured police were helped by their colleagues, battered and blooded protestors lay on the ground.         
	 Underground passengers were told Westminster station was closed. The trains slowed down but the doors did not open. Then the trains picked up speed and did not allow anyone to disembark at Westminster.        
	 Above ground, scenes almost resembled something from the Russian revolution.         
	Benches were torched in Parliament Square. A discarded maintenance shed was set alight so that the running battles looked very more dramatic.        
	 Winston Churchills statue was vandalised  he had once urged the British to fight on the seas and oceans, in the air, on the beaches and landing grounds but last nights rioters had taken to heart only the last bit about fighting on the streets.        
	 These were the streets in and around parliament where the Labour opposition were probably secretly glad the riots were going on against the coalition governments policies though, of course, everyone spoke out against violence.        
	 And as the violence continued, police adopted their controversial policy known as kettling  demonstrators were locked into areas without toilet facilities from which they were not allowed to move for several hours.        
	 Churchill would turn in his grave if he could have read the graffiti on his statue: f*** police, Clegg eat s***, a reference to the Lib Dem leader, Nick Clegg, and education for the masses.        
	By 9pm, 43 protestors were taken to hospital; 12 officers were also injured. In all 2,800 police officers were deployed yesterday but they were not enough. Nor was the rioting confined to Parliament Square. The Topshop store in Oxford Street had its windows smashed, while Austin Reed in Regent Street had its front defaced by graffiti.        
	 Westminster Council pressed 80 cleaners into action last night to clean up the widespread trail of destruction. Many politicians condemned the violence but Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, made an unusual observation. He alleged some parents were urging their children to take part in the demonstrations.        
	 We have a balance to strike in this city and this country  we allow peaceful protests, we have 5,000 demonstrations every year on the streets of London, he said. And every time it happens, and every time everyone eggs on their children to go out and demonstrate, the police are obliged to abstract their forces from the outer boroughs, from keeping our streets safer and from cracking down on burglary.

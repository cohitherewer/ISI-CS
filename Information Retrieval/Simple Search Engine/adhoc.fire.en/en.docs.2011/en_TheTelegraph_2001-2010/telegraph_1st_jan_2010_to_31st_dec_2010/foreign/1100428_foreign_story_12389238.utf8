                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hefner saves Hollywood
          CHING-CHING NI                          Hefner: Symbolic sign                                  
	Los Angeles, April 27: When Playboy founder Hugh Hefner heard that the campaign to buy the open space west of the Hollywood sign was short by $1 million, he knew he had to step in once again to protect the Los Angeles landmark.        
	Turned out the kid was back in the water again, he said in a telephone interview.        
	So he coughed up $900,000, which helped the campaign cross the finish line. Yesterday, the Trust for Public Land announced that, thanks to Hefners gift and an additional $500,000 from the Tiffany amp; Co. Foundation and Aileen Getty, it finally had the $12.5 million needed to buy Cahuenga Peak from Fox River Financial Resources Inc.         
	The 138-acre property, which offers a spectacular 360-degree panorama of the Los Angeles basin, now will become part of Griffith Park.        
	In 1978, Hefner played a major role in a campaign to fix up the then-terribly dilapidated Hollywood sign. Ensuring that the land would remain undeveloped was worth taking action again, he said. Its like saying lets build a house in the middle of Yellowstone Park.

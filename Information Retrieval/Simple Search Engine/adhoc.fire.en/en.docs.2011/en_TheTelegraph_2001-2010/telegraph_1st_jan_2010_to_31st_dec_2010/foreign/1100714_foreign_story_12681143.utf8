The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Abducted Iran scientist flees to US Pak embassy
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Abducted Iran scientist flees to US Pak embassy
          SALMAN MASOOD AND ALAN COWELL                          Shahram Amiri                                  
	Islamabad, July 13: In the latest twist in a murky tale, Pakistan said today that an Iranian nuclear scientist, who Tehran says was kidnapped by the CIA, has taken refuge in the Iranian interests section of the Pakistani embassy in Washington.        
	Iranian officials were making arrangements for his repatriation, said Abdul Basit, a spokesman at the Pakistan foreign ministry. It was not clear how or when the scientist would leave the country.        
	The scientist, Shahram Amiri, 32, vanished during a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in June 2009. He had worked at Irans Malek Ashtar University, which is linked to the powerful Revolutionary Guards.        
	The US government has never acknowledged Amiris existence, or admitted to a role in his disappearance.        
	He is not in the Pakistani embassy, per se, Basit said. He is at the Iranian interests section, which is manned by Iranian nationals.        
	He added: We understand that they are making arrangements for his repatriation.        
	Basit declined to comment on how the Iranian scientist entered the mission section and denied that the incident could strain relations between Iran and Pakistan.        
	Earlier today, Press TV, an Iranian state-run broadcaster, said Amiri had reportedly taken refuge in Irans interest section in Washington, urging an immediate return to the country.        
	Irans interest section is linked to the Pakistani embassy, just as the US maintains a similar status at the Swiss embassy in Tehran. Iran and the US severed diplomatic ties after the 1979 revolution. The development was the latest in a series of statements concerning the scientist.        
	In June, Iran publicised what it called a videotaped statement from Amiri purporting to prove its claim about the scientists disappearance. But a second videotape posted on the Internet showed a man who identified himself as the scientist and who claimed to be studying in the US.        
	If the Iranian version is true, it is not clear how the man escaped his alleged captors to reach the Pakistani embassy. If the second version is accurate, it is not clear why he would want to escape, or whether he had been taken under duress.        
	In the first video in June, Press TV said today, Amiri said that he was abducted in a joint operation by terror and kidnap teams from the US intelligence service, CIA and from Saudi intelligence.        
	Press TV said the Iranian foreign ministry had handed over to Swiss diplomats in Tehran new documents related to the abduction of the Iranian national by the CIA and called for Amiris swift and unconditional release.        
	The broadcaster quoted an audio message obtained by Irans intelligence sources as saying he had been offered $10 million to appear on CNN and announce that he had willingly defected to the US. Iranian media have also said that a former Iranian deputy defence minister, Alireza Asgari, was abducted during a trip to Turkey in 2007. The two videos released in June served to deepen the mystery.        
	The first blurry Iranian video showed a man identified as the scientist, wearing a T-shirt and speaking Persian through a computer phone connection, who said he was captured, taken to a house in Saudi Arabia and given an injection. He awoke on a plane bound for the US.        
	The second video, released shortly afterwards on YouTube, showed a young man in a suit who said he was Amiri, insisting that he was free and safe in the US, working on a Ph.D.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

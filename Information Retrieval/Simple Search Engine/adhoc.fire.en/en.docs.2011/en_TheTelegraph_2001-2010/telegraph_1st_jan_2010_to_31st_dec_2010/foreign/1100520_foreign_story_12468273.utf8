The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | For protesters, losing game means death
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      For protesters, losing game means death

	Bangkok, May 19 (AP): Red shirt protester Sakhorn Iamsri strides the front line with a slingshot hanging from his jeans pocket.        
	If the walnut-sized stones he shoots fail to hurt the Thai soldiers gathered behind sandbag bunkers, Sakhorn and his comrades have an arsenal to fall back on: firecrackers shot from metal pipes, Red Bull bottles brimming with glass shards, Molotov cocktails, burning tires and other weapons fashioned with ingenuity and scrap.        
	If it sounds like a David and Goliath fight, in most cases it is.         
	A ragtag army of Red Shirt anti-government protesters has spread out in central Bangkok, shouting obscenities at troops and attacking them with rudimentary weapons. Often, it seems that some of the demonstrators treated the fighting like a game of paintball. But for many, the price for losing was death.        
	Troops  including sharpshooters positioned on high buildings  have used live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas. Since the violence flared on May 14, 39 protesters were killed by gunfire and 313 wounded in violence that turned parts of Bangkok, a city known for its crime-free nightlife, into deserted wastelands. One soldier from the government side has died.        
	Death is a normal thing, thats what I told my wife when I joined the Red Shirts, Sakhorn, a 58-year-old delivery driver, told The Associated Press during a lull in the fighting from behind a 3-metre-high wall of tyres that protesters had built on a major boulevard.        
	Normally, the road that runs across Bangkok is choked with traffic. Today, it is littered with the debris of rioting: burning tyres, broken bottles, confetti-like paper strips from detonated fireworks, and mounds of uncollected garbage.

	The protesters fight with imaginative weapons. Behind one tyre wall, masked rioters filled bottles with pieces of glass, taped it with a large firecracker, lit the fuse and hurled it at the soldiers about 100 meters away. It barely reached halfway.        
	Another helmeted protester tried to throw a Molotov cocktail but the top came off before he let it go, and burning petrol spilled on his back, setting his shirt on fire. Friends quickly doused the flames.        
	In Bon Kai, a working class neighbourhood, protesters put a few drops of flammable liquid into a metal pipe, one end of which was fitted with a firework bomb. A fuse was lit at the other end to ignite the liquid, which propelled the bomb towards the soldiers in a smokey trajectory.        
	Meanwhile, his comrade lit a string of firecrackers that made a sound similar to automatic rifle fire while a friend held up a dust pan and pointed its handle at soldiers, pretending to be firing a gun.        
	A shot rang out and another comrade fell, hit by a bullet. His injury was not life-threatening. Not all protesters are so poorly armed. Some have been seen with guns, and the government says it has come under attack from rifle fire and grenades.

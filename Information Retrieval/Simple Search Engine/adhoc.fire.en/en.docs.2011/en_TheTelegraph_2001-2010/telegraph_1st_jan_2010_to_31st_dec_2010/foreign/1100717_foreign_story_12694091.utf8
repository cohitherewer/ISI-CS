The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Apple not perfect, to give away iPhone cases
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Apple not perfect, to give away iPhone cases
                              Steve Jobs during the news conference at the company headquarters in Cupertino, California. (Reuters)                            
	Cupertino (California), July 16 (AP): Apple Inc. will give free protective cases to buyers of its latest iPhone to alleviate the so-called death grip problem in which holding the phone with a bare hand can muffle the wireless signal.        
	Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the giveaway today at a news conference at the companys headquarters, even as the company denied that the iPhone 4 has an antenna problem that needs fixing. The more than 3 million people who have already bought the iPhone 4 and new buyers till September 30 will all be eligible.        
	People who already purchased the $29 Bumper cases will be refunded.        
	Jobs began the event by saying: Were not perfect, but was quick to point out that no mobile phone is perfect. He played a video showing competing smart phones, including a BlackBerry from Research in Motion Ltd., losing signal strength when held in certain ways.        
	Phones usually have an antenna inside the body. In designing the iPhone 4, Apple took a gamble on a new design, using parts of the phones outer casing as the antenna.         
	That saved space inside the tightly packed body of the phone, but means that covering a spot on the lower left edge of the case blocks wireless signal.        
	Consumer Reports magazine said covering the spot with a case or even a piece of duct tape alleviates the problem. It refused to give the iPhone 4 its recommended stamp of approval for this reason, and it had called on Apple on Monday to compensate buyers.        
	Today, in the companys first remarks following the magazines report, Jobs said Apple was stunned and upset and embarrassed.        
	Jobs said the iPhone 4s antenna issue isnt widespread. He said just over five out of every thousand users have complained to Apples warranty service, and less than 2 per cent have returned the device.        
	Were not feeling right now that we have a giant problem we need to fix, Jobs said. This has been blown so out of proportion that its incredible. I know its fun to have a story, but its less fun when youre on the other end of it.        
	Analysts have criticised Apples first responses to reports of reception problems as dismissive, and cautioned that the company should not come across as arrogant.        
	Jobs apologised to buyers who had less than perfect experiences with the new device. Were going to do whatever it takes to make them happy and if we cant make them happy were going to give them a full refund and say were really sorry we inconvenienced you, and were going to do better next time, the CEO said.        
	The refund applies even for those who have long-term contracts with AT amp;T Inc., the iPhones exclusive US wireless carrier.         
	Jobs, a cancer survivor, also addressed a question about his health today.        
	Im doing fine. I was even better earlier in the week (when) I was having a vacation in Hawaii, but I decided this was important enough to come back for, he said. Im doing great.        
	Jill Small, an iPhone 4 owner who runs a fashion consignment business in Los Angeles, said she was in two minds about the antenna issue. On the one hand, she had not noticed any problems with the phone. On the other hand, if there really is a problem, she finds Apples response inadequate.

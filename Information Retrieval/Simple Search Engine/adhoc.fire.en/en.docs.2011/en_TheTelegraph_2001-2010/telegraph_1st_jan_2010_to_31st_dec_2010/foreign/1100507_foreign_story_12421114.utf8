The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Money woes, silences and a zeal for Islam
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Money woes, silences and a zeal for Islam
          JAMES BARRON AND SABRINA TAVERNISE                          Faisal Shahzad                                  
	New York, May 6: Theirs was an arranged marriage: two well-educated children of prominent Pakistani families set up through a mutual friend. He was the quiet one; she was the one who laughed at parties.        
	At their wedding in Peshawar six years ago, men and women danced separately but also together, a rarity at that time, recalled one guest. It was such a huge gathering that even their family friends from Qatar came.        
	When they returned to the US, his colleagues at the cosmetics maker Elizabeth Arden celebrated with a small office party.        
	The husband, Faisal Shahzad, put photographs of his wife, Huma Mian, on his desk at the Arden office in Stamford, Connecticut. They bought a brand-new house for $273,000, 56km away on Long Hill Avenue in Shelton. By the time they moved in, she was pregnant, the neighbours recalled.        
	As another day passed with Shahzad talking to investigators about the car bomb he had admitted driving into Times Square on Saturday, details emerged yesterday about the couple and their life together, along with speculation about his radicalisation.         
	People who knew them, both in Connecticut and in Pakistan, said he had changed in the past year or so, becoming more reserved and more religious as he faced what someone who knows the family well called their financial troubles. Last year, one Pakistani friend said he even asked his father, Bahar ul-Haq, a retired high-ranking air force pilot in Pakistan, for permission to fight in Afghanistan.        
	Haq, now in his 70s, adamantly refused, according to a person familiar with the conversation, saying that he disapproved of the mission and reminded his son that Islam does not permit a man to abandon his wife or children.        
	As a newlywed, the wedding guest said of Shahzad by email from Pakistan, there was no sign of him being extremist or, for that matter, he wasnt a bit religious. But in the past couple of years, after changing jobs and fathering two children, Shahzad started talking more of Islam.         
	The recession had taken a toll on them, I guess, he wrote in an email message from Pakistan. He said that their money worries became apparent in 2008 or 2009 and that Shahzad lost his way during the financial problems. JPMorgan Chase has since moved to foreclose on the Shelton house, which the couple had abandoned in a hurry, leaving behind clothes and toys.        
	In February, Shahzad leased a two-bedroom apartment in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His landlord said he never saw Shahzads wife. Faiz Ahmad, a friend from the Shahzad familys ancestral village, Mohib Banda, said that when he last saw Shahzad, at a wedding a year and a half ago, he was sure that something was wrong. Shahzad seemed changed, he said, sitting by himself and not talking very much.        
	He was completely quiet on the sofa, like someone who has some worries, and undergoing some internal change, Ahmad said. So he was sitting silent, silent. And silence in itself is a question.        
	A Pakistani man said that an acquaintance of his who was a friend of the Shahzad family told him that within the past year, Shahzad had peered critically at a glass of whisky the friend was holding, indicating a judgmental stance typical for rigid jihadis.

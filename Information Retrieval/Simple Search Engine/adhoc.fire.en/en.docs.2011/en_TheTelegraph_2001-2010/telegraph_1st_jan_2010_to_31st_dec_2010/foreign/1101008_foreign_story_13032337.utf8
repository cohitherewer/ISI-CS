          JULIE BOSMAN AND SIMON ROMERO                          Vargas Llosa speaks to reporters in New York on Thursday. (Reuters)                                  
	Oct. 7: The Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa, whose deeply political work vividly examines the perils of power and corruption in Latin America, won the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature today.        
	Announcing the award in Stockholm, the Swedish Academy praised Vargas Llosa for his cartography of the structures of power and his trenchant images of the individuals resistance, revolt and defeat.        
	Vargas Llosa, 74, is one of the most celebrated writers of the Spanish-speaking world, frequently mentioned with his contemporary Gabrel Garcia Mrquez, who won the literature Nobel in 1982, the last South American to do so. He has written more than 30 novels, plays and essays, including The Feast of the Goat and The War of the End of the World.        
	In selecting Vargas Llosa, the Swedish Academy has once again made a choice that is infused with politics. Recent winners included Herta Muller, the Romanian-born German novelist, in 2009, Orhan Pamuk of Turkey in 2007 and Harold Pinter of Britain in 2005.        
	In 1990, Vargas Llosa ran for the presidency of Peru and has been an outspoken activist in his native country. The news that he had won the prize reached him at 5am, when he was hard at work in his apartment in New York, Preparing to set out on a walk in Central Park, he told a radio station in Peru. Initially, he thought it was a prank.        
	It was a grand surprise, he said. Its a good way to start a New York day.        
	He is currently spending the semester in the US, teaching Latin American studies at Princeton University.        
	The prize is the first for a writer in the Spanish language in two decades, after Mexicos Octavio Paz won the Nobel in 1990, and focuses new attention on the Latin American writers who gained renown in the 1960s, like Julio Cortazar of Argentina and Carlos Fuentes of Mexico, who formed the regions literary boom generation.        
	In an interview with The Times in 2002, Vargas Llosa said that it was the novelists obligation to question real life. I dont think there is a great fiction that is not an essential contradiction of the world as it is, he said. The Inquisition forbade the novel for 300 years in Latin America. I think they understood very well the seditious consequence that fiction can have on the human spirit.        
	Beyond his own political activities, Vargas Llosa has explored in his novels how politics feels to ordinary people.        
	Theyre not only fantastic novels that read beautifully, Ruben Gallo, a professor of Spanish-American literature at Princeton University, said today. Hes one of the authors who in the 20th century has written the most eloquently and the most poignantly about the intersection between culture and politics in Latin America.        
	Born in 1936 in Arequipa, Peru, Vargas Llosa first realised that he wanted to be a writer when he was a child.        
	He spent much of his early childhood in Cochabamba, Bolivia, then moved with his parents to a middle-class suburb of Lima. He studied law and literature at the University of San Marcos in Lima in the mid-1950s  a tumultuous and violent time in Peru  and later drew from the experience to write Conversation in the Cathedral, a novel published in 1969.        
	After college, he spent time writing for newspapers and, like many Latin American writers, began his literary career abroad, living in Paris, Madrid and London as a young man.        
	His work found a wide international audience in the 1960s with the publication of The Time of the Hero, a novel based on a Peruvian military academy that aroused some controversy in his home country.         
	By the early 1980s, he was perhaps the best-selling Latin American writer in the world, having published Green House, Conversation in the Cathedral and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, among others.

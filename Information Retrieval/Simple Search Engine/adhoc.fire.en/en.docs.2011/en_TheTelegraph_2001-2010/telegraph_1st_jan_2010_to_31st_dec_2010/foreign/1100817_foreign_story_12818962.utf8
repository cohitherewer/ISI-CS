The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chinas economy surpasses Japans
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Chinas economy surpasses Japans
          DAVID BARBOZA                          A Chinese woman works at a Lenovo production line in Shanghai. (AP)                                  
	Shanghai, Aug. 16: After three decades of spectacular growth, China passed Japan in the second quarter to become the worlds second-largest economy behind the US, according to government figures released early today.        
	The milestone, though anticipated for some time, is the most striking evidence yet that Chinas ascendancy is for real and that the rest of the world will have to reckon with a new economic superpower.        
	The recognition came today, when Tokyo said that Japans economy was valued at about $1.28 trillion in the second quarter, slightly below Chinas $1.33 trillion.         
	Japans economy grew 0.4 per cent in the quarter, Tokyo said, substantially less than forecast. That weakness suggests that Chinas economy will race past Japans for the full year.        
	Experts say unseating Japan  and in recent years passing Germany, France and Great Britain  underscores Chinas growing clout and bolsters forecasts that China will pass the US as the worlds biggest economy as early as 2030. Americas gross domestic product was about $14 trillion in 2009.        
	This has enormous significance, said Nicholas R. Lardy, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It re-confirms whats been happening for the better part of a decade: China has been eclipsing Japan economically. For everyone in Chinas region, theyre now the biggest trading partner rather than the US or Japan.        
	For Japan, whose economy has been stagnating for more than a decade, the figures reflect a decline in economic and political power. Japan has had the worlds second-largest economy for much of the last four decades, according to the World Bank. And during the 1980s, there was even talk about Japans economy some day overtaking that of the US.        
	But while Japans economy is mature and its population quickly ageing, China is in the throes of urbanisation and is far from developed, analysts say, meaning it has a much lower standard of living, as well as a lot more room to grow. Just five years ago, Chinas gross domestic product was about $2.3 trillion, about half of Japans.        
	China has roughly the same land mass as the US, but is burdened with a fifth of the worlds population and insufficient resources.        
	Its per capita income is more on a par with those of impoverished nations like Algeria, El Salvador and Albania  which, along with China, are close to $3,600  than that of the US, where it is about $46,000.        
	Yet there is little disputing that under the direction of the Communist Party, China has begun to reshape the way the global economy functions by virtue of its growing dominance of trade, its huge hoard of foreign exchange reserves and US government debt and its voracious appetite for oil, coal, iron ore and other natural resources.        
	China is already a major driver of global growth. The countrys leaders have grown more confident on the international stage and have begun to assert greater influence in Asia, Africa and Latin America, with things like special trade agreements and multibillion dollar resource deals.        
	Theyre exerting a lot of influence on the global economy and becoming dominant in Asia, said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell and former head of the IMFs China division. A lot of other economies in the region are essentially riding on Chinas coat tails, and this is remarkable for an economy with a low per capita income.        
	In Japan, the mood was one of resignation. Though increasingly eclipsed by Beijing on the world stage, Japan has benefited from a booming China, initially by businesses moving production there to take advantage of lower wages.        
	Beijing is also beginning to shape global dialogues on a range of issues, analysts said; for instance, last year it asserted that the dollar must be phased out as the worlds primary reserve currency.        
	And while the US and the EU are struggling to grow in the wake of the worst economic crisis in decades, China has continued to climb up the economic league tables.

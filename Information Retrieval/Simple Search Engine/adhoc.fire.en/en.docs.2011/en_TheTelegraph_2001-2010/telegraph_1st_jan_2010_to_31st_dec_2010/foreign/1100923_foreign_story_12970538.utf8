The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Summers to leave Obama economic team
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Summers to leave Obama economic team
          SHERYL GAY STOLBERG                          Lawrence H. Summers                                  
	Washington, Sept. 22: The White House said today that Lawrence H. Summers, the chief architect of President Obamas economic policy, would leave at the end of the year, continuing an exodus of top-level advisers at a time when voters are expressing deep dissatisfaction with the Presidents stewardship of the economy.        
	The White House says the departure has been long-planned; Summers, 55, said in a brief interview that he must return to his professorship at Harvard by January to keep his tenure. His departure gives Obama a chance to reshape his economics team after the mid-term elections, when Republicans are expected to gain strength and possibly reclaim the majority in Congress.        
	A brusque and brilliant economist and one-time Harvard president, Summers directs the Presidents National Economic Council, and runs Obamas daily Oval Office briefings on the economy.        
	He has guided the President through an extraordinarily tumultuous time, on matters ranging from the $787 billion economic stimulus package to the financial regulatory reform bill passed this year, to the current fight with Republicans about whether to extend Bush-era tax cuts.        
	Theres a time and a place for everything. Its been my plan long term, to return to Cambridge, Massachusetts, Summers said. As to the administrations economic record, he said: I think history will judge that a profound crisis that might not have been contained was contained.        
	But with unemployment at 9.6 per cent, Republicans have been sharply critical of Summers. In a recent speech, the House Republican leader, John A. Boehner of Ohio, called for both Summers and Timothy F. Geithner, the treasury secretary, to be fired.         
	Yesterdays announcement came amid intense speculation about the future of both men; the White House confirmed Summerss plans after Bloomberg News first reported them.        
	A senior administration official said yesterday that Geithner expected to stay on. But other top economics advisers are already gone. Peter R. Orszag quit as budget director earlier this year, and just this month Christina D. Romer, the administrations chief economics forecaster, left to return to teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. And Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, is contemplating leaving to run for mayor of Chicago, adding to the expectation of a postelection shake-up.        
	We are on a better path thanks in no small measure to Larrys wise counsel, Obama said in a statement yesterday. Just one day earlier, the President brushed off a question about the futures of both Summers and Geithner, saying he thought they both were doing an outstanding job.        
	This is tough, the work that they do, Obama said then, during a televised question-and-answer session on CNBC. Theyve been at it for two years. And you know, theyre going to have a whole range of decisions about family thatll factor into this as well.        
	Republicans have been running for election on the theme that the mid-term elections are a referendum on the economy, as Boehner told business leaders in Cleveland last month. He said Obamas team lacked real-world, hands on experience, a direct shot at Summerss career as an academic.        
	News of Summerss departure set off speculation that Obama would replace him with a corporate executive to counter the impression that he is anti-business. His exit will undoubtedly expand the influence of Geithner and also of Austan Goolsbee, a longtime adviser to the President who was recently named to replace Romer. Jack Lew, the new budget director, is also emerging as a powerful voice, especially as the President puts more emphasis on cutting the federal deficit.        
	Such changes are natural for an administration at the halfway point, especially in the current era, when working at the White House can be a taxing grind. Still, the rearranging will undoubtedly be watched closely for evidence of policy shifts or a so-called midcourse correction, especially if the election is as devastating for Democrats as many analysts expect.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Saudi setback for al Qaida
                            
	Riyadh, Nov. 26 (Reuters): Saudi Arabia today said it had captured 149 al Qaida militants in recent months who were raising money and recruiting members to carry out attacks inside the kingdom, with links to other militants in Somalia and Yemen.        
	The announcement by the worlds largest oil-exporting country was made with elderly Saudi King Abdullah in the US recovering from surgery to treat a blood clot complication from a slipped disc.        
	In the past eight months 149 people linked to al Qaida were arrested, among them were 124 Saudis and 25 were of other nationalities, interior ministry spokesperson Mansour Turki told a news conference.        
	Turki said the attackers belonged to 19 al Qaida cells and were planning to target government facilities, security officials and journalists in the kingdom. He gave no names of targets.        
	When asked whether they had also targeted oil installations in Saudi Arabia he said:We cannot exclude this. Investigations are ongoing.        
	The television channel al Arabiya had reported that the kingdom had also foiled plans to attack Saudi oil installations.        
	One cell had links to Somalia, but the large majority had ties to Yemen. Most cells were very small, were operating independently and still in the stages of being set up, he said.        
	The ministry confiscated 2.24 million riyals ($597,000) from the al Qaida suspects, he said, and militants had tried to collect money and spread their ideology during the Muslim pilgrimages of Haj and Umra in Saudi Arabia.

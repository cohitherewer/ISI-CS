	Julia no to sequel    
	 London, Feb. 2 (PTI): Actress Julia Roberts is against making a sequel of Pretty Woman because she considers herself too old to star in it.      
	The actress, who is best known for her role as prostitute Vivian Ward opposite Richard Gere in the 1990 movie, is adamant that she does not want a sequel.      
	Nobody wants to see an old hooker. Its not that Im anti-romantic comedy, which, for some reason, is always the favoured interpretation, said Roberts. I like being funny... but its challenging trying to find a script which is original or interesting.

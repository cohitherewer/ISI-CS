	Muzaffarabad (Pakistan), Sept. 21 (AP): A van carrying at least 30 schoolchildren plunged into a river in Pakistan Kashmir today. Most of the passengers were confirmed or feared dead.        
	The driver lost control of the vehicle and it plunged 15 meters into the Jhelum river from an elevated road in the regional capital Muzaffarabad, said local police chief Ghulam Akber. The driver and four children were rescued, he said. But school teacher Bashir Mughal said local villagers who plucked the four children from the water.

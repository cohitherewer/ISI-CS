The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China banks show Wall Street cracks

	Hong Kong, Aug. 30: Off-balance-sheet liabilities. Bad mortgage loans. Uncertain growth prospects.        
	These issues, which nearly toppled the US banking industry and triggered the financial meltdown, are increasingly threatening the stability of Chinese banks.        
	Last week, a slew of Chinese banks  including Industrial amp; Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China  reported strong profits. ICBC, the countrys largest, earned $12.4 billion in the first six months of the year, above analysts expectations. But rather than providing reassurance about the banks health, the positive numbers are fanning fears of what is yet to come.        
	I expect housing prices to take a turn later this year, and when they do, then youll start to see the effect on (Chinese) banks, says Dragon Yongjun Tang, an assistant finance professor at the University of Hong Kong. Some of the weaker local banks may need to be restructured.        
	Chinas growth has helped lead the global economy out of the recession, but critics worry that if its economy weakens, it could pull the world back in. In the US, weak economic data are already stoking concerns about a double-dip recession.        
	Last year, Chinas banks wrote a record $1.4 trillion of new loans as the government sought to stimulate the economy. The government has since clamped down on lending and also ordered banks to move off-balance-sheet liabilities back onto their books, according to analysts and media reports. (Like US banks, Chinese institutions had moved loans off their balance sheets en masse, allowing them to reduce their capital requirements and fund more loans.)        
	Despite the industrys aggressive growth, some analysts remain optimistic about Chinese banks prospects, arguing that if the economy continues to grow by double digits, it will mitigate the impact of poor-performing loans.        
	So far, the governments tightening has not been draconian, says Wendy Liu, head of China research for the Royal Bank of Scotland, meaning that banks have been able to charge higher loan rates and boost interest income even as lending has slowed.        
	Investors, however, are not convinced about the health of the sector. Despite the industrys positive earnings this year, Chinese bank stocks have generally fared poorly.        
	Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based analyst for Mizuho Securities Asia, believes its sentiment rather than reality driving the share price.        
	As far as reality is concerned, he says, 25 per cent year-over-year growth for the Chinese banking sector for the full year should be achieved.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | India-origin executive fired for graft
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      India-origin executive fired for graft
                            
	Houston, Jan. 4 (Reuters): The Koss Corporation has said it has fired its Indian-origin vice-president of finance after she was accused of embezzling more than $20 million from the company for a multi-year shopping spree of expensive clothes, jewellery and other personal items.        
	The executive, Sujata Sachdeva, held the position at Koss since 1992. The company, based in Milwaukee, also said it placed two members of the accounting staff, who served under Sachdeva, on unpaid administrative leave.        
	Sachdeva is accused of using company money to pay down her personal credit card bills, which totalled more than $4.5 million from January 1, 2008, to December 19, 2009, according to a criminal complaint filed by the US attorneys office in Wisconsin.        
	Preliminary estimates indicate that the amount of unauthorised transactions since fiscal year 2006 may exceed $20 million, Koss said. Sachdevas total compensation for fiscal year 2009 was $173,734, according to a regulatory filing. Sachdeva had bills that often ran into hundreds of thousands of dollars, the complaint showed.        
	The case was discovered when American Express noticed that a customers personal card account balances were being paid using several large wire transfers originating from a Koss bank account.        
	Sachdeva acknowledged to the FBI that she had been using her position at Koss to authorise wire transfers to pay her personal credit card bills, and that she falsified the balance in Kosss bank account to hide the fact, according to the complaint. Sachdeva owns a home in an elite neighbourhood of the upscale Mequon suburb of Milwaukee with her husband, a doctor.

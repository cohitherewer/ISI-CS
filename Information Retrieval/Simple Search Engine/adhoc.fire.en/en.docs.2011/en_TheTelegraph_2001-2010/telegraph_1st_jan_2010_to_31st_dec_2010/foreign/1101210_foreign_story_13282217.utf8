	Los Angeles, Dec. 9 (PTI): Troubled rap artist Nicki Minaj is unhappy with fans who try to grab her famous derriere and plans to start wearing a booty protector made of barbed wire.        
	The Massive Attack singer was gifted the spiky accessory by US chat show host George Lopez who hoped that the barbed wire will put off fans such as popstar Rihanna who has previously enjoyed grabbing Minajs ample curves, reports the Daily Mail.        
	Minaj, 25, was appearing on Lopez Tonight when she was given a cage made out of wire fashioned into a belt, by the shows host. Lopez said Minaj has magical powers in her posterior. For months, rumours have spread across the Web that Minaj underwent surgery or uses pads to boost her bottom.

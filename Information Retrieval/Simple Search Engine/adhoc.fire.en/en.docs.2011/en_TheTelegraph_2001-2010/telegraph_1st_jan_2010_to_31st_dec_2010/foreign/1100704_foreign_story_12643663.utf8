The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tiger wife to get $100m in divorce
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Tiger wife to get $100m in divorce

	Los Angeles, July 3: Tiger Woodss wife Elin Nordegren will reportedly get around $100 million in an imminent divorce settlement.        
	The US celebrity website TMZ spoke to a source with direct knowledge of the settlement and said she would get close to nine figures.        
	The amount is more than she would have received under a prenuptial agreement which was believed to have given Miss Nordegren the right to $20 million after 10 years of marriage. However, it would be less than the largest divorce settlement in celebrity history, the $150 million paid by Michael Jordan to his former wife Juanita.        
	According to Forbes magazine Woods is worth a total of around $600 million. Both Woods and Nordegren are believed to have wanted to avoid an ugly public divorce.        
	The central issue in negotiations has been to ensure that both have access to their two children Sam, 3, and Charlie, 15 months. Woodss private and professional life imploded in November after he crashed his car into a tree outside his home in Florida. The crash was said to have followed an argument with his wife over his marital infidelities, and a string of women then came forward alleging affairs.

	Fergie sting    
	 London, May 23 (Reuters): Britains News of the World paper said it had caught the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson in a sting, filming her allegedly offering to sell access to her former husband and UK trade envoy Prince Andrew.       
	According to the footage on the tabloids website, Ferguson appears to ask for $40,000 in cash followed by 500,000 as a wire transfer, claiming she could introduce the undercover reporter to the prince. The News of the World said the prince knew nothing of Sarahs claims. But Fergusons spokeswoman declined. She is devastated by the story and deeply regrets the situation and any embarrassment it has caused, she said.    
	Oprah name

When theyre talking about her, and someone overhears the conversation, no one knows theyre referring to Oprah, said Kelley.

  - Trust deficit lingers: Gates                            Gates in Islamabad. (AP)                                  
	Jan. 22: The US defence secretary, Robert Gates, apologised for Americas grave mistakes in Pakistan and Afghanistan before the launch of the US war on terror in 2001.        
	In his first visit to the country in three years and first under President Barack Obama, Gates tried to reassure a public and leadership wary of Washingtons plan to tackle militancy and turn around the war in Afghanistan.        
	I was in government in the early 1990s, when Russia left the region and the US largely abandoned Afghanistan and cut off defence ties with Pakistan  a grave strategic mistake driven by some well-intentioned but short-sighted US legislative and policy decisions, said Gates.        
	Speaking at the National Defence University in Islamabad, he said a US ban on military contacts in the 1990s over Pakistans nuclear programme undermined a bond between the armed forces and created a trust deficit that lingered.        
	He vowed the US was prepared to invest whatever time and energy it takes to forge and sustain a genuine, lasting partnership with Pakistan.        
	Rebuilding relationships with a generation of Pakistani officers who have had little contact with the US military will take years, Gates said.         
	Gates arrived yesterday in Pakistan, urging it to root out Afghan Taliban factions based in its northwestern border enclaves from where they have been orchestrating an intensified insurgency in Afghanistan.

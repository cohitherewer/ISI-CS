	Oct. 29: The success of Apples hugely popular iPhone range has seen it overtake Research in Motion, which makes the BlackBerry, as one of the worlds biggest mobile phone companies.        
	Apple shipped 14.1 million handsets during the most recent financial quarter, up 91 per cent on the same quarter last year, according to analysts at Strategy Analytics. Bumper sales of Apples flagship iPhone 4 has seen the company outperform Research in Motion, the Canadian company that makes the BlackBerry range of smartphone devices.         
	RIM shipped 12.4 million units during that period, an increase of 46 per cent on the same quarter last year.        
	The reversal of fortunes has prompted some industry experts to question whether the popularity of the BlackBerry could be on the wane, as other devices match the mobile emailer for efficiency and usability.        
	A total of 327 million mobile phones were shipped worldwide during the third financial quarter of this year, up from 291 million on the same period last year.         
	Strategy Analytics said that growth had been less than expected and slightly down on the first six months of the year, but blamed this on component shortages and ongoing economic volatility which slightly constrained volumes.        
	Nokia remained the biggest mobile phone maker in the world, shipping 110.4 million handsets worldwide during the third financial quarter. The company has undergone a shake-up in recent months, with several key executives, including chief executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, announcing their departure.

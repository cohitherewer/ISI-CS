The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Terror groups target Facebook

          NICK ALLEN                          Recruitment ground                                  
	Los Angeles, Dec. 11: The US government has warned that terrorist groups like al Qaida are targeting Facebook as a prime recruitment ground.        
	A department of homeland security report said extremists had focused on the social networking website as a way to identify sympathisers and disseminate information on bomb making.        
	It said terrorists are trying to exploit a non-ideological medium which allows them to reach a wider audience, and are specifically infiltrating Facebook because it has 500 million users. Investigators looking at the website found videos on getting to know your AK-47 and how to field strip an AK-47, and instructions on how to make nitric acid.        
	The report, which was leaked to Fox News, said: In this way Facebook acts as a gateway or launching pad for further radicalisation and for easy access to sites where explosives recipes and IED information are regularly posted.        
	On recognised extremist Internet forums the investigators found discussions among radicals about the need to make serious efforts to optimise our Facebook usage and form a solid base on the website.        
	Suggestions included using it to distribute updates of US military losses in Afghanistan and creating large groups of users so that jihadi articles could be distributed quickly. One post said it was our duty as adherents of jihad to use Facebook to reach others.        
	The report said: These posts call for the organised, strategic exploitation of Facebook, recognising its value as a platform for reaching a wider, younger audience.        
	Some of those trying to target Facebook showed technological awareness, advocating the use of proxy internet servers to preserve anonymity, according to the report.        
	Facebook checks for names of known terrorist organisations and individuals, and also removes any content which infringes or violates someone elses rights or otherwise violates the law. But the report, called Terrorist Use of Social Networking Sites: Facebook Case Study, pointed out that the information is not screened before being posted.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

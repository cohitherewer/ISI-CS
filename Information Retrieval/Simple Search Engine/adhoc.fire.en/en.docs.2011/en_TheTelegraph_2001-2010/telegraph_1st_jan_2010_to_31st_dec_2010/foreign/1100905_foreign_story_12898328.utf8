	Dublin, Sept. 4 (AP): Protesters hurled shoes and eggs today as Tony Blair held the first public signing of his memoir amid high security in the Irish capital.         
	Hundreds more people lined up to have their books autographed  evidence that the divisions left by Blairs decade as British leader have yet to heal. Blairs new book, A Journey, is a bestseller, but it has angered opponents of his policies, especially the 2003 invasion of Iraq.        
	About 200 demonstrators chanted that Blair had blood on his hands as the former Prime Minister arrived at a Dublin book store. A shoe, eggs and other projectiles were thrown towards Blair as he emerged from a car, but did not hit him. A flip-flop could be seen lying on the roof of a BMW in Blairs motorcade.        
	Security was tight, with book buyers  who appeared to outnumber the protesters by about two to one  told to hand over bags and mobile phones before entering Easons book store on Connell Street, Dublins main shopping thoroughfare.        
	There were scuffles between police and demonstrators when some tried to force their way through the security cordon. Two protesters were arrested and bundled into the back of a security van. Several demonstrators, including one wheelchair user, laid themselves in the vans path, and riot police were brought in to remove them.        
	Blair spent about two hours in the store before emerging to more shouts, boos and hurled eggs. He was quickly driven away, as a police helicopter circled overhead.        
	Blair took the world to war in Iraq and Afghanistan on the basis of lies, said protester Donal MacFhearraigh. He said Blair should be indicted as a war criminal.        
	Another protester, 24-year-old Kate Sullivan, said she was bundled away by security guards after approaching Blair in the store and trying to perform a citizens arrest.        
	Confrontation erupted again once Blair had left, as police stopped demonstrators from entering the book store.        
	Many of the demonstrators then marched to the police station where the two who were arrested were being held to continue their protest there.        
	Despite the protests, Blair is popular with many in Ireland for his role in forging the 1998 Good Friday peace accord in Northern Ireland, and several hundred people lined up in the rain to have their copies of A Journey autographed.        
	I appreciate what he did for Irish politics, particularly along the border, thats why Ive come, retiree Maureen Hedderman told the Press Association news agency.        
	Released this week, A Journey is Amazons best-selling title in Britain, and has climbed into the top 10 on the online retailers US chart.

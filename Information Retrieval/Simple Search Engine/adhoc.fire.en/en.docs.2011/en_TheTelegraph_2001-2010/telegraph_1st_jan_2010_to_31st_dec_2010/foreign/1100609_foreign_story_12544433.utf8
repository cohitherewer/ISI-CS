	Sydney, June 8 (AFP): Australian officials withdrew 200 Barack Obama mugs from the parliamentary gift shop, not because he cancelled his visit, but because they misspelt his name.        
	The mugs, featuring a smiling picture of the American President, cheerfully welcomed Barrack Obama on his visit due this month. The mugs, as well as the trip, have now been scrapped. Officials said the specially made commemorative mugs arrived over the weekend and promptly hit the gift shops shelves.        
	At that moment the reality (dawned) that wed ordered mugs with the wrong spelling of his first name, so instead of being Barack Obama B-A-R-A-C-K we had B-A-R-R-A-C-K, parliamentary services secretary Alan Thompson said. Two mugs were sold and by then our staff in the shop worked out something was seriously amiss so we stopped sales.

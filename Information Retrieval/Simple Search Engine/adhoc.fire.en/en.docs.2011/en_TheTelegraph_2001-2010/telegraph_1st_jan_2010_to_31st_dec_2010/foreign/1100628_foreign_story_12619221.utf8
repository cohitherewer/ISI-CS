	Toronto, June 27 (Reuters): President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron have exchanged beers to honour their bet over the England-US World Cup soccer match that ended in a draw.        
	This is Goose Island 312 beer from my hometown of Chicago. ...I advised him that in America we drink our beer cold, Obama said after a meeting on Saturday with Britains new Prime Minister at a Group of 20 summit in Toronto.        
	Cameron reciprocated with a brew local to his Witney constituency called Hobgoblin.        
	Obama had earlier given Cameron a ride to Toronto in his Marine One helicopter from the Group of Eight summit in a resort north of Toronto, and apparently suggested his passenger pay his own way.        
	Thank you also for the lift between the two. It was he threatened to send me a bill, but as I said, times are very tight in the UK, so Im afraid well have to take it as a free lift, Cameron said.        
	Earlier this year, Obama shipped a case of American beer to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper after losing a bet over the mens Olympic hockey final in which Canada beat the US.         
	Obama had also sipped beer with a professor and a policeman after the academics complaints against the law officer and the Presidents response landed the White House in a controversy.

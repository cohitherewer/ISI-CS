The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Somali pirates get $9m ransom
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Somali pirates get $9m ransom
                            
	Mogadishu, Nov. 6 (Reuters): Somali pirates said today they had received a record ransom of $9.5 million for the release of Samho Dream, a South Korean oil supertanker they hijacked in the Indian Ocean in early April this year.        
	Andrew Mwangura, coordinator of the East African Seafarers Assistance Programme, confirmed the supertanker was free.        
	I can confirm Samho Dream is now free, but still in Somali waters, said Mwangura, who is based in the Kenyan port of Mombasa. They initially demanded $20 million. What I can confirm is that negotiators tell me they agreed to make the drop with an amount in excess of $9 million. This would be the highest sum paid out to pirates so far.

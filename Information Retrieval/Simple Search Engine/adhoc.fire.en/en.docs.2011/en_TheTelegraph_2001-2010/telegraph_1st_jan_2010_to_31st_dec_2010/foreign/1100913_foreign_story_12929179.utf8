	Paris, Sept. 12: You may know it as Bordeaux  home to claret, fine gastronomy and unforgettable landscapes. But officials seeking to generate additional revenue from tourism have come up with a new name for the famous region in south-western France: Oenoland.        
	They have invented the term, a reference to Oeno, the Greek goddess of wine, to underline their determination to woo holidaymakers on paying tours of the areas 11,000 chateaux.        
	Critics dismiss Oenoland  which is in official tourist brochures and websites  as an attempt to transform the hallowed soil of Bordeaux into a giant theme park. They say that it is an insult to an ancestral wine-making tradition.        
	Supporters say that the 3.3 million people who visit vineyards in south-western France every year could help to save impoverished winemakers from financial ruin. People around here are starting to understand that tourism is absolutely essential, said Petrus Desbois, the owner of Chateau Saint-Georges. Its very recent. A few years ago no one would have dreamt of opening their chateaux to tourists.        
	Now some owners have started charging up to 30 euros a head for viewings of their cellars, tastings of their more recent vintages and even the chance for visitors to pick grapes, in an attempt to copy Napa Valley, California.        
	The Oenoland concept is meeting with resistance in a region that has traditionally taken a snooty view of the ordinary mortal.

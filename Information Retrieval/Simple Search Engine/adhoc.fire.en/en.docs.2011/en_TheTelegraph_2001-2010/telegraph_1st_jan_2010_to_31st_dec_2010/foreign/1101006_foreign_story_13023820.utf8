	Oct. 5: A pair of Russian-born physicists working at the University of Manchester in England have won the Nobel prize in physics for investigating the remarkable properties of ultra-thin carbon flakes known as graphene, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said today.        
	They are Andre Geim, 51, and Konstantin Novoselov, 36. They will split the prize of about $1.4 million.        
	Graphene is a form of carbon in which the atoms are arranged in a flat hexagon lattice like microscopic chicken wire, a single atom thick. It is not only the thinnest material in the world, but also the strongest: a sheet of it stretched over a coffee cup could support the weight of a truck bearing down on a pencil point.        
	Among its other properties, graphene is able to conduct electricity and heat better than any other known material, and it is completely transparent. Physicists say that eventually it could rival silicon as a basis for computer chips, serve as a sensitive pollution-monitoring material, improve flat screen televisions, and enable the creation of new materials and novel tests of quantum weirdness, among other things.        
	In a statement, the Royal Academy said: Carbon, the basis of all known life on earth, has surprised us once again.        
	Graphene is closely related to two other forms of carbon that have generated intense interest in recent years: buckyballs, which are soccer-ball arrangements of carbon atoms, and nanotubes, which are rolled-up sheets of carbon atoms.         
	It was long thought, however, that an essentially two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms would be unstable and would warp or fold up.         
	 Geim and Novoselov first succeeded in creating flakes of graphene by peeling them off piles of graphite  the material that is in your pencil lead  using Scotch tape.        
	Geim, who was born in Sochi, Russia, and is now a Dutch citizen, studied at the Moscow Physical-Technical Institute and was awarded a Ph.D. at Institute of Solid State Physics in Chernogolovka in 1987. He led a wandering research life  Sometimes I joke that I am not interested in doing re-search, only search, he told ScienceWatch.com in 2008  before he became a professor at the University of Nijmegen in Holland.        
	It was at Nijmegen that he connected with Novoselov, who was born in Nizhny Tagil, and became Geims graduate student in the Netherlands. When Geim subsequently moved to the University of Manchester he brought Novoselov with him; Novoselov is now a British and Russian citizen.        
	The work on graphene arose from the pairs desire to investigate the electrical properties of graphite. To do that, however, they needed very thin pieces, which they first tried to produce by filing down graphite crystals, with no luck.         
	Then a technician showed them how graphite was cleaned before being observed in a scanning tunneling microscope by peeling layers off with Scotch tape.

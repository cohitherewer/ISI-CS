          PHILIP SHERWELL                              
	New York, Jan. 10: Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the US Senate, has apologised for previously unreported comments he made about Barack Obamas race during the 2008 presidential campaign.         
	In a private conversation, Reid had predicted that Obama, then a fellow senator hoping to become the first African-American President, could win the election as he was light skinned and with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.         
	Reids acutely embarrassing remarks are revealed in a new book to be published on Monday and were revealed on websites over the weekend.         
	I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words. I sincerely apologise for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans for my improper comments, the Nevada senator said in a statement released on Saturday.         
	I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obamas legislative agenda.         
	Obama quickly came to the support of Reid, who has fought hard to secure the 60 Senate votes required to pass the Presidents domestic policy priority of health care reforms.         
	In a statement issued by the White House, he said: Harry Reid called me today and apologised for an unfortunate comment reported today. I accepted Harrys apology without question because Ive known him for years, Ive seen the passionate leadership hes shown on issues of social justice and I know whats in his heart. As far as I am concerned, the book is closed.

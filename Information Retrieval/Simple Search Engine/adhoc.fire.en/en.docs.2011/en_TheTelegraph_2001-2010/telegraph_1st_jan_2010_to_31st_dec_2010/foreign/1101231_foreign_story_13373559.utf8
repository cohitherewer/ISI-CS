	No diva Gaga    
	 London, Dec. 30 (PTI): She is best known for her over-the-top outfits but Lady Gaga has traded her signature leotards and heels for slippers and smocks to impress her boyfriends parents.       Gaga is spending the holidays in Omaha, Nebraska, with her bartender friend Luc Carl and his parents. So she has dumped her elaborate security, dressed casually and is helping out in the family kitchen, reported The Sun. Gaga also rejected a hotel to stay in Luc rsquo;s old bedroom with him.

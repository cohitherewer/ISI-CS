The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Weddings feel Pak power heat
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Weddings feel Pak power heat
                            
	Islamabad, April 22 (AP): Pakistan today announced a raft of energy-saving measures, including shorter weddings and curbs on lighted billboards, aimed at easing a crisis that leaves much of the country powerless for up to 16 hours a day and stokes anger at the shaky government.        
	Opinion polls show the rolling power cuts are a greater concern for many Pakistanis than Islamist militancy.        
	Washington, keen to show support for the Pakistan government at a time of surging militant violence, has made improving the countrys badly managed and investment-starved power infrastructure one of its top priorities.         
	The measures were aimed at cutting demand for electricity by about 500 megawatts of electricity.              
	, so what little is being produced could be better used. Prime Minister Yusaf Raza Gilani said the measures were expected to save $500 million in energy costs.        
	They included ordering markets shut at 8pm  most are still bustling at 11pm  and limiting the hours that wedding halls are open, since many weddings in Pakistan start at around midnight, and banning illuminated billboards.        
	Water and power minister Raja Pervez Ashraf also said government offices would now be closed on Saturdays and air conditioner use by civil servants would be limited.        
	The government has announced similar measures in the past, but they have been patchily enforced. Shop owners do not like having to shut their business early in Pakistan, where late-night shopping is the norm.        
	With summer soon beginning, some are predicting violent protests if more power is not available.        
	I ask the people to be patient and not indulge in violent agitation, Gilani said.        
	The lack of power hurts industrial production, increasing the cost of doing business and hurting the economy.        
	Experts say solving the problem will require the government to improve the efficiency of the electricity distribution system, getting better management at electricity companies and boosting investment in the energy sector.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama tries to calm tensions at G20
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama tries to calm tensions at G20

	Seoul, Nov. 10: President Obama, marking the start of a summit meeting that has already tested the limits of international cooperation, implored other world leaders today to shift global economic demand away from its historic reliance on American consumption and borrowing.        
	In a letter to other leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers, released shortly after he arrived here, Obama tried to calm the currency tensions that have roiled global economic relations, though he did not mention by name the two most prominent sources of the tension: Chinas foreign-exchange interventions and the Federal Reserves recent decision to inject $600 billion into the economy.        
	We all now recognise that the foundation for a strong and durable recovery will not materialise if American households stop saving and go back to spending based on borrowing, Obama wrote. Yet no one country can achieve our joint objective of a strong, sustainable and balanced recovery on its own.        
	In an op-ed article for the Asian edition of The Wall Street Journal, the treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, joined Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the finance minister of Singapore, and Wayne Swan, the treasurer of Australia, in warning that a two-track recovery will dominate the global economy for a long time to come.        
	Together, Obamas letter and Geithners article laid out a strategy that combined an appeal to reason, an avoidance of confrontation and more than a little humility. The benefit of their approach, they said, would be higher overall growth in the long term.        
	But it remained to be seen whether China and Germany, the worlds two most powerful surplus economies, would take steps to curb their reliance on exports and their high rates of savings and to increase their relatively low consumption, as American officials argue is needed.         
	In the run-up to the two-day meeting that begins tomorrow, officials from both nations unleashed stinging criticism of the Fed, accusing the US central bank of essentially playing tricks with its economy to prop up a flagging recovery.        
	Obamas letter indirectly defended the Fed, buttressing his argument that the world needs a robust US recovery even though it should no longer depend on the American consumer to serve as the mainstay of demand.        
	A strong recovery that creates jobs, income and spending is the most important contribution the United States can make to the global recovery, Obama wrote in the letter. The dollars strength ultimately rests on the fundamental strength of the US economy.        
	A few hours after Obamas letter was released, the commerce department reported that American exports grew 0.3 per cent in September while imports fell 1 per cent. Exports through the first nine months of the year are up nearly 18 per cent from the period a year.        
	Our renewed focus on trade promotion is helping to grow exports, which are critical to our continued economic growth, the commerce secretary, Gary Locke, said in a statement from Yokohama, Japan, where Obama is to travel on Friday evening for meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.        
	Obamas letter reiterated goals the Americans have been articulating for months, but he omitted specific policy prescriptions  notably, a proposal by Geithner that each G20 economy commit to limiting the surplus or deficit on its current account, a broad measure of a nations trade, to no more than 4 per cent of gross domestic product.        
	A rebalancing of the sources of global demand, along with market determination of exchange rates that reverses significant undervaluation, are the best base for the shifts needed to bring about the vigorous and well-balanced recovery that we all want, Obama wrote. When all nations do their part  emerging no less than advanced, surplus no less than deficit  we all benefit from higher growth.        
	Late tonight, a G20 statement said its members will move towards more market-determined exchange rates, closely echoing the wording of a statement issued by G20 ministers late last month.

	Rhinebeck, New York, Aug. 1 (AP): High society took stage inside and high security outside as Chelsea Clinton wed her long-time boyfriend at an elegant estate in a Hudson river village where several prominent guests were spotted beforehand, but the husband-and-wife-to-be stayed out of sight.        
	Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton announced in a statement on late Saturday evening that their daughter wed investment banker Marc Mezvinsky after weeks of secrecy and build-up that had celebrity watchers flocking to the small village of Rhinebeck for the evening nuptials. The site of the wedding, a Beaux Arts riverside estate called Astor Courts, was sealed off from the general public.        
	Today, we watched with great pride and overwhelming emotion as Chelsea and Marc wed in a beautiful ceremony at Astor Courts, surrounded by family and their close friends, the Clintons said.        
	We could not have asked for a more perfect day to celebrate the beginning of their life together, and we are so happy to welcome Marc into our family. On behalf of the newlyweds, we want to give special thanks to the people of Rhinebeck for welcoming us and to everyone for their well-wishes on this special day.        
	Chelsea Clinton, wearing a strapless white gown with a full skirt and silver beading around the waist and carrying a bouquet of white flowers, was escorted down the aisle by her father. The former President and the groom wore dark suits, while the mother of the bride wore a fuchsia dress.        
	 The ceremony was conducted by a reverend and a rabbi as Chelsea Clinton is Methodist and Mezvinsky is Jewish, and included a poem by Leo Marks titled, The Life That I Have, according to the family.        
	The road to Astor Courts was blocked off on Saturday  neighbours received bottles of wine for their troubles  and the sky above was declared a no-fly zone by federal aviation officials. Police and security guards fanned out around this usually sleepy town.        
	Celebrities spotted in Rhinebeck for the event included actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, fashion designer Vera Wang and Madeleine Albright, who was secretary of state during Bill Clintons second term as President.

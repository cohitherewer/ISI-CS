	Seoul, Dec. 27 (Reuters): A train packed with birthday gifts for North Koreas leader-in-waiting Kim Jong-un derailed this month in a possible act of sabotage, a Seoul-based radio station which broadcasts across the border reported today.         
	Open Radio for North Korea, a non-profit station which often cites sources in the reclusive, impoverished North, said the train laden with gifts including televisions and watches came off the rails on December 11 near North Koreas border with China.         
	The security service has been in an emergency situation because a train departing Sinuiju and headed for Pyongyang derailed on December 11, the radio station quoted a source in the security service in North Phyongan province as saying.         
	The tracks and rail beds are so old it is possible there was decay in the wood or nails that secured the tracks could have been dislodged but the extent of damage to the tracks and the timing of the incident points to a chance that someone intentionally damaged the tracks, the source said.

                          Liu Xia                    
	Beijing, Oct. 11 (AP): China today blocked European officials from meeting the wife of the jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner, cut off her phone communication and cancelled meetings with Norwegian officials  acting on its fury over the award.        
	As China retaliated, UN human rights experts called on Beijing to free imprisoned democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobo, who was permitted a brief, tearful meeting with his wife yesterday. Liu dedicated the award to the lost souls of the 1989 military crackdown on student demonstrators.        
	Liu, a slight, 54-year-old literary critic, is in the second year of an 11-year prison term for inciting subversion.        
	In naming him, the Norwegian-based Nobel committee honoured Lius more than two decades of advocacy of human rights and peaceful democratic change  from demonstrations for democracy at Beijings Tiananmen Square in 1989 to a manifesto for political reform that he co-authored in 2008 and which led to his latest jail term.        
	Beijing had reacted angrily to Fridays announcement honouring Liu, calling him a criminal and warning Norways government that relations would suffer, even though the Nobel committee is an independent organisation.        
	On Monday, it abruptly cancelled a meeting that had been scheduled for Wednesday between visiting Norwegian fisheries minister Lisbeth Berg-Hansen and her Chinese counterpart. Berg-Hansen was in China for a weeklong visit to the World Expo in Shanghai.        
	If the meeting has been cancelled due to the Peace Prize, we find that to be an unnecessary reaction from China, said Norways foreign ministry spokesperson Ragnhild Imerslund. We have not received any reason for cancelling the meeting.        
	Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama criticised China for its response to the Nobel Peace Prize award, saying the government must change, the Kyodo News agency reported. The Tibetan spiritual leader, who won the prize himself in 1989, said Beijing must recognise that fostering an open society is the only way to save all people of China.        
	Also Monday, four UN human rights experts released a statement calling for China to immediately release Liu. The independent UN-appointed investigators, who examine issues from free speech to arbitrary detention, called on China to release Liu and all persons detained for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression.        
	European diplomats, meanwhile, were prevented from visiting his wife, Liu Xia, who has been living under house arrest since Friday.        
	Liu Xia has been told that if she wants to leave her home she must be escorted in a police car, the New York-based group Human Rights in China said.        
	She reported that her phone communications, along with her Internet, has been cut off; both her and her brothers mobile phones have been interfered with, HRIC said. She is not being allowed to contact the media or her friends, the group said.        
	Simon Sharpe, the first secretary of political affairs of the EU delegation in China, said he went to see her at her home in Beijing to personally deliver a letter of congratulations from European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso.        
	Sharpe was accompanied by diplomats from 10 countries, including Switzerland, Sweden, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Italy and Australia.        
	But three uniformed guards at the main gate of Lius apartment complex prevented the group from entering, saying someone from inside the building had to come out and fetch them.        
	We were told that we could only go in if we called somebody from the inside and if they came out to meet us. But of course, we cant call Liu Xia, because its impossible to get through to her phone, Sharpe told reporters at the entrance to the compound.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Julia sparks plastic surgery rumours
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Julia sparks plastic surgery rumours
                              buxom star                            
	Los Angeles, Sept. 11 (PTI): Actress Julia Roberts has sparked rumours that she has gone under the knife after being spotted with noticeably larger cleavage.        
	Roberts, 42, who was photographed in a bikini during a recent holiday in Hawaii, looked more buxom than she had on her holiday last year, reports Star magazine.        
	She was probably a 34A or small B, and now she looks more like a full C cup, said renowned Beverley Hills plastic surgeon Dr Stuart A Linder.        
	However, Roberts has been very vocal with her feelings about plastic surgery in the past.        
	I want my kids to know when Im annoyed, when Im happy and when Im confounded. Your face tells a story and it shouldnt be a story about your drive to the doctors office, Roberts had said in a recent interview.        
	Its unfortunate that we live in such a panicked, dysmorphic society where women dont even give themselves a chance to see what theyll look like as older persons, she added.        
	The mother-of-three had famously showed off her assets in the 2000 film Erin Brokovich, but is said to have relied on a push-up bra to give her the desired effect.

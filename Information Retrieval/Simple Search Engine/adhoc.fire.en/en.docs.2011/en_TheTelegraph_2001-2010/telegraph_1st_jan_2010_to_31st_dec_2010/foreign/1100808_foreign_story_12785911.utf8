The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mandelas illegitimate daughter
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Mandelas illegitimate daughter
                            
	Johannesburg, Aug. 7: Nelson Mandela, the former South African President, may have fathered an illegitimate daughter following a brief affair with a woman he met in Cape Town, in 1945, his foundation has admitted.        
	Mpho Pule spent almost 12 years battling to see the man she believed was her father but died just a month before his office wrote to say that they were close to confirming her claim. Now her children are continuing her fight to be recognised as the seventh child fathered by the former apartheid-era freedom fighter.        
	Pules claim matched the documentary record of his life, but stressed that only a DNA test would provide absolute confirmation.        
	This is the point at which we hand the matter over to the family, he said. While the allegation that the former South African President, now 92, was unfaithful while married is not new, no claim of paternity is ever known to have been confirmed.

	New York, Oct. 23: The reports in the archive disclosed by WikiLeaks offer an incomplete, yet startlingly graphic portrait of one of the most contentious issues in the Iraq war  how many Iraqi civilians have been killed and by whom.        
	The reports make it clear that most civilians, by far, were killed by other Iraqis. Two of the worst days of the war came on August 31, 2005, when a stampede on a bridge in Baghdad killed more than 950 people after several earlier attacks panicked a huge crowd, and on August 14, 2007, when truck bombs killed more than 500 people in a rural area near the border with Syria.        
	But it was systematic sectarian cleansing that drove the killing to its most frenzied point, making December 2006 the worst month of the war, according to the reports, with about 3,800 civilians killed, roughly equal to the past seven years of murders in New York. A total of about 1,300 police officers, insurgents and coalition soldiers were also killed in that month.        
	The documents also reveal many previously unreported instances in which American soldiers killed civilians  at checkpoints, from helicopters, in operations. Such killings are a central reason Iraqis turned against the American presence in their country, a situation that is now being repeated in Afghanistan.        
	The archive contains reports on at least four cases of lethal shootings from helicopters. In the bloodiest, on July 16, 2007, as many as 26 Iraqis were killed, about half of them civilians. However, the tally was called in by two different people, and it is possible that the deaths were counted twice.         
	In another case, in February 2007, an Apache helicopter shot and killed two Iraqi men believed to have been firing mortars, even though they made surrendering motions, because, according to a military lawyer cited in the report, they cannot surrender to aircraft, and are still valid targets. The shooting was unusual. In at least three other instances reported in the archive, Iraqis surrendered to helicopter crews without being shot.

	London, Feb. 18: Hollywood star Leonardo Di Caprio has revealed that he wants to play the role of the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.        
	The 35-year-old Titanic star told Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda: Id love to play Stalin very much. However, it is all about a script and there is no such script at the moment.        
	DiCaprios Russian grandmother survived the Soviet era with its political purges, mass killings and all powerful secret police.        
	 My grandmother was telling me about the Second World War, the Gulags and other Russian tragedies.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

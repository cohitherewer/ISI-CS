The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Man pulls shark tail, saves woman
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Man pulls shark tail, saves woman
                            
	Sydney, Oct. 31: A man who grabbed and pulled on the tail of a great white shark as it attacked a young woman has been hailed a hero in Australia.        
	Elyse Frankcom, 19, a snorkelling guide, was leading a group in waters off Garden Island, about 80km south of Perth, on Saturday when she was attacked and mauled by the 10ft great white, which swam up from underneath and bit her thighs.        
	The burly, bearded man, named only as Trevor, was in the water nearby as part of Frankcoms tour group. He risked his life by grabbing the tail of the shark and trying to pull it away from Frankcom.         
	As the wounded woman began to sink to the ocean floor, he grabbed her and swam her to the surface and back to the tour boat where she received medical help, before being rushed to hospital.        
	On disembarking the tour boat, the man was reluctant to identify himself, saying only: All I want is for the girl to be OK.         
	Rescue professionals have praised his bravery, saying Frankcom could have died if he had not taken on the shark, which left two shards of teeth embedded in the tour guides thigh. Frank Pisani, of Fremantle Sea Rescue, said that as the shark attacked Frankcom, it brushed past a fairly large man on the tour who grabbed the animal, causing it to release her from its jaws.         
	A helicopter patrol failed to find the shark, but swimmers today said they saw a similar-sized shark circling a boat in the same area.         
	Frankcoms mother Linda said her daughter would not want the shark to be hunted down. Frankcom was wearing a shark shield, a device that uses electronic impulses to repel attacks, at the time of the attack, but it is not known why it did not deter the great white.

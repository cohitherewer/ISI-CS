The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Attempt to kill Danish cartoonist fails
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Attempt to kill Danish cartoonist fails
                              Kurt Westergaard                            
	Copenhagen, Jan. 2 (Reuters): A Somali man armed with an axe and suspected of links with al Qaida broke into the home of a Danish cartoonist whose drawings of the Prophet Muhammad had caused global Muslim outrage and was shot and wounded by police.        
	Hours later, the 28-year-old was stretchered into court today and denied charges of trying to kill Kurt Westergaard. The Somali also denied trying to murder a police officer at Westergaards home in the town of Aarhus late yesterday after he broke into the house armed with a knife and an axe, police said.        
	Danish police intelligence said they believed the attempted assassination ... is terror related and accused the man, who was not named, of having links with Somalias al Shabaab militant group as well as al Qaida militants.        
	The cartoonist, 74, pushed a panic button, fled to a safe room and was unhurt when police arrived. His grand-daughter was in the house during the attack. Police could not confirm reports he had tried to break down the safe room door with the axe.        
	Westergaard, who in 2005 depicted Prophet Mohammad with a bomb in his turban, has been under police protection since his caricatures of the prophet led to death threats.        
	The Somali man appeared in court on a stretcher with a hand and leg in plaster casts due to gunshot wounds from a police officer who had narrowly dodged the axe thrown at him by the intruder who was trying to evade arrest, police said.        
	The accused did not speak in court, but denied the charges through his lawyer.        
	The Security and Intelligence Service PET, a department of the national police, said in a statement: It is PETs impression that the attempted assassination of the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard is terror related.        
	The man, the PET said, has close relations to the Somali terror organisation al Shabaab and al Qaida leaders in East Africa, and he is also suspected of having been involved in terror-related activities during his stay in East Africa.        
	It also accused him of involvement in a terror-related network with links to Denmark, where he has a residence permit.        
	For some time this network has been the subject of PETs investigation without, however, this having any relation to the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, the PET said.        
	Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said that the incident was not only an attack on Westergaard but also an attack on our open society and democracy.

                              Hitler                            
	London, Aug. 24 (PTI): Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler may have had Jewish and African ancestors, according to DNA tests.         
	Saliva samples taken from 39 relatives of Hitler show he probably had biological links to the Jewish community and people from North Africa, such as Berbers of Morocco,  the subhuman races he vowed to exterminate during the Holocaust.         
	Investigative journalist Jean-Paul Mulders was able to probe Hitlers DNA after taking a serviette dropped by the German Fuhrers great-nephew Alexander Stuart-Houston, 61, who lives in New York. He also got a sample from an Austrian cousin of the dictator, a farmer known as Norbert H.         
	The tests have revealed a form of the Y-chromosome that is rare in Germany and the rest of western Europe, but common among Jewish and North African groups.         
	Both the test samples had a form of genetic material known as Haplopgroup E1b1b, proving an irrefutable link to the Nazi leader.         
	It is most commonly found in the Berbers of Morocco, in Algeria, Libya and Tunisia, as well as among Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. One can from this postulate that Hitler was related to people whom he despised, Mulders says in Belgian magazine Knack. Haplogroup E1b1b1 appears to be a major founding lineage of the Jewish population.

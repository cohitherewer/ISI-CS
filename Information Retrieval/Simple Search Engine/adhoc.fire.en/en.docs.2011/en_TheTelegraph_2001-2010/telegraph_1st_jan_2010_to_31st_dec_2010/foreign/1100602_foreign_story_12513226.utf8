	Funny Ben    
	 New York, June 1 (PTI): He is best known for playing Mahatma Gandhi on the silver screen, but Sir Ben Kingsley proved that there is a funny side to him as he spoofed reality TV starlet Heidi Montag in a new video.      
	Kingsley made fun of the audition tape that Montag had made for Transformers director Michael Bay asking him to cast her in the third installment of the superhit franchise.       
	Kingsley shot for the spoof video and repeated Montags line: This is for you Michael Bay for the George Lopez Show.     
	Spears fans    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Popstar Britney Spears has beat off competition from all fellow celebrities to become the first person to have 5 million followers on the social networking website Twitter. Spears overtook actor Ashton Kutcher, the first to reach one million supporters, as the most popular celebrity on the forum last week and has now set a new record with a fan following of 5,015,346.    
	Depp sleep    
	 London (PTI): Actor Johnny Depp says he struggled with nightmares while he was shooting for Alice In Wonderland. Depp, 46, admits creating such an oddball character as the Mad Hatter left his mind buzzing at the end of the day and dark thoughts would haunt his sleep. I had hideous dreams.      
	 But I have a tendency to have somewhat dark dreams. I cant remember any of them specifically that affected me during the filming, but I dont think it had to do with the filming at all, Depp said. But I did have a dream once that Alan Hale, the skipper of Gilligans Island, chased me through the streets of Hollywood, the actor added. Alan Hale was an American actor, best known for his role as Skipper on the sitcom Gilligans Island.

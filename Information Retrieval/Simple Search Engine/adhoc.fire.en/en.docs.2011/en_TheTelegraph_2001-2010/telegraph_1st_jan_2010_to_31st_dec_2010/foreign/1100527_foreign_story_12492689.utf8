The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | After Facebook ban, Malik joins Twitter
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      After Facebook ban, Malik joins Twitter

	Islamabad, May 26 (Reuters): After Pakistan banned Facebook in a bid to stop it hosting blasphemous pictures, the countrys interior minister found a new way to get his online fix. He jumped on Twitter.        
	Interior minister Rehman Malik said his son told him that if he couldnt get on Facebook, where he has his own page which hosts pictures of dignitaries and has 691 fans, he should Tweet.        
	Only a few days back I came in (as a Twitter user). I like it, Malik told Reuters in an interview yesterday. There are lot of questions, are you real, are you fake?        
	Malik already has more than 270 followers, according to his page (including this correspondent), far less than the countless ones he said he had after only a few days.         
	Many people writing to him question if indeed the account is real (it is) or complain that he should be governing instead of tweeting.         
	Maliks tweets give no hint the digital hecklers bother him. He calls for unity in the face of violence in Karachi and comments on how nice it is to meet so many women parliamentarians from around Asia. He also freely engages with his followers, an unusual practice in Pakistans stratified political culture.        
	Thank you for your appreciation, Malik wrote to one well-wisher. I will hunt the terrorists to their demise.         
	 While he declined to criticise the decision to ban Facebook and other websites, he said he hoped that a solution could be worked out soon that pleased most people.        
	I think we should be open-minded, he said.

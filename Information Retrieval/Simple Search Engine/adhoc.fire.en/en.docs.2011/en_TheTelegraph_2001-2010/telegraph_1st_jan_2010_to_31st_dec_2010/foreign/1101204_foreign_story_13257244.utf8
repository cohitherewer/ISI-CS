The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama in surprise Afghan trip
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama in surprise Afghan trip
                            
	Bagram Air Base (Afghanistan), Dec. 3 (Reuters): President Barack Obama visited Afghanistan today but stayed on a US military base, cancelling a planned trip to Kabul to meet Afghan President Hamid Karzai because of bad weather.        
	Obamas second visit to Afghanistan as President came as the White House prepared to release a review of the war strategy on December 13, and the day after leaked cables detailed deep US concerns about Karzais abilities and widespread fraud.        
	The President is under pressure to show progress in the increasingly unpopular nine-year-old war and the visit is a chance for a first-hand assessment. But White House officials emphasised the main purpose of the his journey was a visit with the troops around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, rather than a fact-finding mission.        
	Above all, we wanted to underscore their sacrifice at a time of year when Americans are coming together as families to mark the holiday, said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for communications.

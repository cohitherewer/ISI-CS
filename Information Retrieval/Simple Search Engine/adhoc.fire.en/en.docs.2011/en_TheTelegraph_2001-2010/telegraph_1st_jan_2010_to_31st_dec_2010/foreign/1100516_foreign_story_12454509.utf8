	Bangkok, May 15: The Thai military declared a neighbourhood of Bangkok a live-fire zone today and said it was calling in reinforcements as fighting spread to several areas in the city and the death toll in a three-day offensive against anti-government protesters rose to 24.        
	Gunfire and a series of explosions shook a neighbourhood in central Bangkok that includes the citys night bazaar and a kickboxing stadium. At least three persons were shot in the head by what appeared to be sniper fire from tall buildings. In the Silom business district soldiers were seen positioned on rooftops and a waft of black smoke rose from fires set alight by protesters.        
	Thai Prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said security forces would not retreat but would press forward with plans to halt the violent protest. The government has to go forward. We cannot retreat. What we are doing is for the benefit of the country, he said in a televised address. We cannot leave the country in the hands of armed groups.        
	The number of people injured rose to 179 by this afternoon, according to the government-run Erawan medical centre.        
	The US government said it was offering a voluntary evacuation of non-essential personnel from Bangkok and advised against all travel to the city, a revision from its previous stance of advising against non-essential travel.        
	Around the area where troops clashed with the protesters, shops were closed and streets were nearly deserted.        
	In another neighbourhood a few kilometres away, the military posted a banner, declaring a Live firing zone. The banner also included the words in English that were misspelled as life firing zone.        
	People should avoid the area, Panitan Wattanayagorn, a government spokesman, said on television. Yesterday troops fired tear gas and bullets at protesters, who responded with stones, slingshots and homemade rockets.         
	The fighting followed an assassination attempt on Thursday on a renegade general who had declared himself a protector of the protesters before he was critically wounded by a snipers bullet.        
	The anti-government protesters, mostly poor rural residents known as red shirts, seized and vandalised several military vehicles, setting at least one truck on fire and cheering as a column of soldiers with riot shields looked on. Protesters pulled soldiers from their vehicles and beat them severely.        
	The standoff has paralysed the Thai government and further fractured a society struggling to cope with the growing demands of its poor.        
	Yesterday and today, streets that would normally have been bustling with traffic were instead littered with stones and bottles and sealed off by soldiers building roadblocks with sandbags and coils of razor wire.

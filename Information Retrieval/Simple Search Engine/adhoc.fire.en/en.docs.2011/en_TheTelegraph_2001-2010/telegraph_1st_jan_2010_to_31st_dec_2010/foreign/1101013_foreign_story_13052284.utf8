The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Liu wife hopes for Nobel visit
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Liu wife hopes for Nobel visit
                              Liu Xiabo                            
	Beijing, Oct. 12 (AP): The wife of imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo today said she hopes to travel to Norway to collect the Nobel Peace Prize on his behalf, though for now she can only leave her Beijing home under police escort.        
	China has claimed the award was an attack on the country and an attempt to change its political system, and retaliated by cancelling a set of meetings with the Norwegian government.        
	In brief interviews by phone, Liu Xia said her husband has started receiving better food since the Oslo-based Nobel committee announced the award last Friday  honouring his more than two decades of advocacy of human rights and peaceful democratic change that started with the demonstrations at Beijings Tiananmen Square in 1989.        
	The 54-year-old literary critic is now in the second year of an 11-year prison term after being convicted of inciting subversion over his role in writing an influential 2008 manifesto for political reform.        
	He said he hoped I could receive the award on his behalf, Liu Xia said. However, she said she was not optimistic about her chances of leaving since she has been placed under virtual house arrest since the award was announced.        
	At this point, I cant even get out of my own house door, let alone the gates of the country, she said, adding that she has not been allowed to meet friends or journalists and police escort her every time she goes outside her home.        
	China has been infuriated by the prize, accusing other countries of using the award to attack the country and warning that it wont change the communist nations political course.         
	If some people try to change Chinas political system in this way, and try to stop the Chinese people from moving forward, that is obviously making a mistake, said foreign ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu.         
	Beijing also singled out Norways government today, saying that bilateral relations would suffer because of its backing of the award, although the Nobel committee acts independently.        
	I am not allowed to meet the press or friends. If I have to do any daily chores, like visiting my mother or buying groceries, I have to go in their (police) car, said Liu Xia, who was using a new cell phone brought to her by a brother  after police rendered her old one unusable.

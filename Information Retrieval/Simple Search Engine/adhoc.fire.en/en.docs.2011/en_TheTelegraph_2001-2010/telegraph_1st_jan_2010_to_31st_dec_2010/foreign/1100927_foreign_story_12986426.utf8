                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jolie sends patch-up note to Jen
                                            From top) Angelina Jollie, jenifer Ainston      
	London, Sept. 26 (PTI): Hollywood star Angelina Jolie has reportedly written a letter to Jennifer Aniston in a bid to patch things up with partner Brad Pitts ex-wife.        
	The 35-year-old actress sent Aniston a note telling her that it was time to have a baby and that she would make a good mother, the Daily Star reported.        
	Jolie, who fell for Pitt while he was married to the former Friends star, thought the note would end their feud. But friends of Aniston said the 41-year-old actress was beyond shocked and thought it was a prank.        
	Angelina doesnt want any more bad energy in her life and she hates the hostility that exists between her and Jen. She genuinely wants to put the past behind them, said a source.        
	It may seem crazy but for those of us who actually know Angelina, it really isnt all that surprising. Shes an unpredictable character, the source said.        
	The source added that Aniston was eventually impressed by the letter after she realised Jolies advice was genuine and appreciated the courage it must have taken to write.

	Washington, May 19 (PTI): Times Square bomb suspect Faisal Shahzad, who was arrested for driving an explosives-laden SUV into the square, was trained by Lashker-e-Toiba to fight in Kashmir, a top commander of the terror group said.         
	Shahzad visited Pakistan in mid-June 2006 to receive training at an LeT camp, according to the commander at the groups main base of operations in Dulai, a village 25km south of Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.         
	Shahzad came to us for training... He stayed with us for three months and we provided him with the basics. Then he went back to the US, the commander was quoted as saying by the Canadian magazine Maclean. It did not name the Lashkar leader.         
	However, he denied his group had anything to do with the foiled attack in Times Square on May 1.        
	We told him we wanted to send him to Kashmir to fight the Indian occupation. But he refused. He said he wanted to fight Americans and that Afghanistan is where he wanted to go. We were hesitant... But we told him, okay, do your training and well see after that, the commander said.         
	He wanted to do something big, the LeT chief said.         
	For us, that was dangerous. We dont want attention on us, and we were worried that Shahzads personal agenda would get him captured and bring the spotlight on us.         
	He said that Shahzad was brought to the LeT camp by another member of the organisation. He was an eager recruit... Very intelligent but also very intense, and driven to make his mark for the sake of Islam, the commander said.         
	Shahzad, a Connecticut resident, was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport while he was trying to flee to Pakistan via Dubai. The Dulai camp, the groups headquarters, was built a little over a year and a half ago after the previous headquarters were closed by the Pakistan army, the commander said.         
	Maybe hes returned to the affairs of the world and the desire for jihad has left him, the commander added.

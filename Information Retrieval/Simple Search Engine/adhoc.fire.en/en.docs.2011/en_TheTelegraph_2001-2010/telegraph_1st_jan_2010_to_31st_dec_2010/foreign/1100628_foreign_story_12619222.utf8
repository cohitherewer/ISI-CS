                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Asked for belt, pilot drops pants
                            
	Sao Paulo, June 27 (AP): A United Airlines pilot was briefly detained at the international airport in Rio de Janeiro after lowering his pants during a security screening.        
	Pilot Michael D. Slynn, 49, was asked to remove his belt and shoes as part of a routine security screening on Friday afternoon.        
	In response, Slynn laughed at security guards and lowered his pants to his ankles, said a police spokesperson.        
	Slynn was detained but released shortly afterwards and allowed to fly back after signing a document promising to appear before a judge the next time he is in Brazil. Calls to United Airlines were not immediately returned.

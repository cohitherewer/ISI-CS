	London, April 23: Leonard Nimoy has announced he will step down from his role as Spock, the Vulcan, after more than 40 years on Star Trek.         
	The 79-year-old actor, who was part of the original Star Trek cast when the series began in 1966, has announced his retirement.         
	Nimoy, one of the cult shows best-known characters, said he wanted to get off the stage in order to let Zachary Quinto, the young actor who assumed the role for the Star Trek movie last year, take over.         
	He said he planned to give up acting altogether after a last visit to Vulcan, the small town in Canada which has made him an honorary citizen.         
	He said: I love the idea of going out on a positive note. Ive had a great, great time.         
	Since Star Trek began, Ive never had to worry about where the next job was.         
	The actor has earned millions of dollars from his role as pointy-eared Spock in the television series and seven films, as well as making numerous appearances at Star Trek conventions, the Daily Mail has reported.         
	He rekindled his love for the show after becoming disillusioned with it in the 1970s, in the fear that its popularity might prevent his career from developing.         
	He named his 1975 autobiography I Am Not Spock, but later got over what he called an identity crisis and released his book again in 1995, calling it I Am Spock.

	Islamabad, June 30: Pakistani authorities have ordered checks on hundreds of politicians after it emerged that dozens may have faked their degrees in order to win their seats.        
	The Supreme Court has asked the Elections Commission to examine the degree certificates of almost all the countrys 1,100 elected officials. They could lose their seats if found guilty in a scandal that has rocked a country still coming to terms with democracy after long periods of military rule. The investigation has also re-opened a question about whether President Asif Ali Zardari ever graduated, as he claims, from a London business school.        
	Local journalists have pored over reams of documents and dedicated thousands of column inches to the issue, much to the anger of politicians. A degree is a degree, said Nawab Aslam Raisani, the chief minister of Baluchistan, when asked about the issue by reporters.         
	Former President Pervez Musharraf introduced the law in 2002.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

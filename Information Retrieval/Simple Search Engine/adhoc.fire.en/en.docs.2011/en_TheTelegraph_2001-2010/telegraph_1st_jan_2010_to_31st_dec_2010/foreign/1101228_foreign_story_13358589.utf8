	Kaneohe bay (Hawaii), Dec. 27 (AP): President Barack Obama and his family took a break from their Hawaiian vacation to attend Sunday church services, a rare occurrence for a President who prefers to worship in private.        
	The first family arrived at a chapel at the Marine Corps Base Hawaii for the service. The Obamas were greeted by about 100 clapping parishioners and a band playing Joy to the World as they were led to their seats in the front row.         
	 In his sermon, chaplain Steve Moses asked worshippers to recommit to God in the new year. He also joked that the reason God put him through a heart surgery was so he wouldnt suffer a heart attack while preaching before the President.        
	Obama was the first worshipper to take communion, dipping the wafer in wine before placing it in his mouth.        
	Though Obama speaks frequently about his Christian faith, his family rarely attends church services in Washington. The White House says the President hasnt joined a parish because his appearances would be disruptive to the rest of the congregation.        
	However, he does attend private services when he spends weekends at Camp David, the presidential retreat.        
	 Obama last attended church in September, shortly after a poll was released indicating that a majority of Americans had doubts about the Presidents religious beliefs.        
	During the hour-long service, Obama and the other churchgoers sang along to a youth band playing Christmas carols such as Silent Night and Oh Holy Night.        
	After church, Obama went golfing on the Marine base despite sporadic light rain.        
	Saudi call        
	Obama spoke with Saudi Arabias King Abdullah yesterday to wish him well and a speedy recovery after the elderly leader underwent back surgery, the White House said. King Abdullah, who is believed to be aged 86 or 87, was reported last week to have left a New York hospital in good health following an operation.

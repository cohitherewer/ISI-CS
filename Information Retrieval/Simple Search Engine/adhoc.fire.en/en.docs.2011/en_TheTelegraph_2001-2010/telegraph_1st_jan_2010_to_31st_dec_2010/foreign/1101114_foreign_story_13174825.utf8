The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | DiCaprios attacker pleads guilty
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      DiCaprios attacker pleads guilty
          HARRIET ALEXANDER                              
	Nov. 13: A woman who smashed a broken bottle into Leonardo DiCaprios face has pleaded no contest to assault with a deadly weapon.        
	Aretha Wilson, 40, could face seven years in prison for the attack, which happened during a party in the Hollywood Hills hosted by Paris Hiltons former boyfriend, film producer Rick Salomon.        
	DiCaprio was rushed to hospital after the attack, needing 12 stitches around his face and neck, but avoided lasting injury to his face.         
	However, the judge, who saw photographs of the stars injuries, said he did not consider them trivial or moderate. Wilson, who reportedly had mistaken DiCaprio for her ex-boyfriend, fled to Canada after the incident but police tracked her down and arrested her last summer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tea party surge raises Obamas hopes
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Tea party surge raises Obamas hopes
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Sept. 15: A minor American political earthquake from yesterdays final party primaries before the November 2 Congressional elections has raised hopes, albeit only slightly, that President Barack Obama will not arrive in New Delhi a few days later, bleary-eyed and weary from the loss of both the Senate and the House of Representatives to Opposition Republicans.         
	Because of a string of upset victories for the so-called Tea Party candidates against official Republican Party nominees in the primaries, Obama need not lose sleep in the next seven weeks that an opposition landslide will decimate the Democrats in Capitol Hill and make him an irrevocable lame duck for the remainder of his presidency.         
	And vice-president Joe Biden need not mourn that the Senate seat from Delaware which he held for 36 years in a row will slip into Opposition hands.         
	Republicans, who had a good shot at taking that seat, shot themselves in the foot last night when a well-liked, two-term governor and nine-term Congressman, Mike Castle, the official party candidate, was roundly defeated by the tea party express supported by former Alaska governor Sarah Palin.         
	But Obamas worries are not altogether behind him yet. Voter anger against incumbency dramatically erupted in the national capital, where Washingtons mayor Adrian Fenty was swept out in the Democratic primary with a convincing margin.         
	Washington is not a state and does not have members either in the Senate or the House of Representatives: its mayor, therefore, is like a state governor.         
	Fentys fate, which Indian Americans compare to that of Rajiv Gandhi because both men served only one term after winning by the biggest landslide in history in their respective elections, is also a reminder to Obama not to tinker too much with the system or with vested interests in his bid for health or others reforms.         
	Mayor Fenty, who is bi-racial like Obama, was only 39 when he was elected as the citys youngest mayor. He implemented sweeping education reforms in Washingtons dysfunctional schools and remarkably raised their performance.         
	Most Washingtonians who voted against Fenty yesterday cited changes to the school system as their reason for opposing the mayor. It was reminiscent of how Mulayam Singh Yadav successfully campaigned in December 1993 against the BJPs anti-copying law in UP and became chief minister.         
	About half of Washingtons voters are black and Fentys opponent Vincent Gray, himself African-American, convincingly carried all the black wards of the city.         
	The real winner of the primary night, though, was Sarah Palin, who lost the vice- presidency to Joe Biden in the 2008 Republican presidential ticket as John McCains running mate. Palin is not a candidate in the November elections.         
	At the time of writing, in New Hampshire, among other states, her preferred candidate, Kelly Ayotte, the states former attorney general, has a narrow lead of 1,000 votes in the Republican Senate primary with 86 per cent of the votes counted.         
	Last night, the Republican victor in Delaware, Christine Donnell, in her victory speech thanked Palin for the upset result in the state. Thank you, Governor Palin, for your endorsement because she got behind us war-weary folks and gave us a boost of encouragement when we needed it. And she was a vote against the politics of personal destruction.        
	The reference to personal destruction was to the campaign ran by the official Republican Party against one of its own. It was alleged that Donnell did not receive her college degree for 12 years because of unpaid debts to her university and that the Internal Revenue Service had put a lien on her finances because of tax problems.         
	Delawares Republican party chief Tom Ross said Donnell could not be elected dog catcher in Wilmington, the states biggest city. The head of the Democratic National Committee, Tim Kaine, said today that the victory of Palin-backed ultra-conservative candidates was good for Democrats.         
	That creates opportunities for us...Moderate Republican voters are being forced from their party and will have to look long and hard before supporting these candidates, Kaine said.         
	The Tea Party movement is a Right-wing reaction primarily to Obamas health care and financial reforms and traces its name from the Boston Tea Party resistance to British colonialist taxes, which catalysed American independence.

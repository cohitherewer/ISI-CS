          ROD NORDLAND AND ABDUL WAHEED WAFA                          An Afghan policeman outside the shattered Park Residence hotel in Kabul after it was attacked by militant gunmen on February 26, 2010. The hotel was rented out by the Indian embassy for its staffers                                  
	Kabul, May 25: A spokesman for Afghanistans intelligence agency yesterday accused Pakistans intelligence agency of involvement in the suicide bombing here last week that killed six Nato soldiers, including four colonels, and the attacks on the Indian embassy.        
	While Saeed Ansari, the spokesman for the National Directorate of Security, Afghanistans spy agency, did not mention the ISI by name, he left no doubt of what he meant.        
	The remarks came in a news conference announcing the arrest of seven people suspected of organising the attack last Tuesday, in which a suicide bomber drove a minivan full of explosives into a convoy of armoured SUVs. The blast killed 18 people, including a Canadian and an American colonel, 2 American lieutenant colonels and their 2 American drivers, as well as 12 Afghan civilians.        
	The seven were also charged with involvement in other suicide attacks in Kabul that killed another 25 people.        
	All the explosions and terrorist attacks by these people were plotted from the other side of the border and most of the explosives and materials used for the attacks were brought from the other side to Afghanistan, Ansari said.        
	Of course, when we say that those attacks were plotted from the other side of the border, the intelligence service of our neighbouring country has definitely had its role in equipping and training of this group, Ansari said.        
	Afghan officials have frequently accused the ISI of supporting the Afghan Taliban and have voiced suspicions about the agencys role in Taliban suicide attacks on Indian targets in Kabul. In February, suicide bombers attacked two guesthouses popular with Indians, killing 16 people, and in 2008 a bombing of the Indian embassy killed 41 people.        
	The seven suspects, all Afghans ranging in age from 21 to 45, lived in Kabul, and included a schoolteacher, a taxi driver and a trading company employee. One was identified as the second in command of the Taliban suicide bombing cell.         
	Ansari said they had been arrested in the past week but did not say how the authorities managed to arrest them so quickly. Their commander, he said, was a man known as Dawood, the Talibans shadow governor for Kabul.        
	In addition to the attack on the Nato convoy, the suspects were involved in the attack on the guesthouses in February, he said. Ansari released names and photos of the suspects as well as videotaped confessions.        
	In the confessions, each a few minutes long, the men admitted having various roles in the attacks, from providing vehicles to storing explosives. They said the attacks had been organised while they were in Peshawar. They did not explicitly implicate the ISI or Pakistani officials in their plot, but said they belonged to the Taliban, and had organised their attack from the groups clandestine offices in Peshawar.        
	Ansari did not explain what evidence the Afghan spy agency had of Pakistani involvement in the suicide bombings. Yesterday an Afghan court convicted the former treasurer of the ministry of Haj and religious affairs, Muhammad Noor, of taking bribes.

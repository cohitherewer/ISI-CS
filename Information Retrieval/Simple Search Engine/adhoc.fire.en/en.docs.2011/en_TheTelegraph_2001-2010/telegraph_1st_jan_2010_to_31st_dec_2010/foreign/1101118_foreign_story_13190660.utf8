The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Device cuts blood pressure by 32 points
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Device cuts blood pressure by 32 points
                            
	Chicago, Nov. 17 (Reuters): A device that destroys nerves leading to the kidney safely lowered blood pressure in people with treatment-resistant hypertension, potentially offering a new option for millions of people who struggle to keep their disease in check, researchers said today.        
	The device, made by privately held Ardian Inc of Mountain View, California, lowered the top blood pressure reading by an average of 32 points after six months.        
	There are a lot of questions, but it is very exciting, said Dr Suzanne Oparil of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who reviewed the findings presented at the American Heart Association meeting in Chicago. The one-time treatment works by silencing nerves leading into and out of the kidney, which play a central role in the sympathetic nervous system, the bodys fight or flight response that can increase heart rate and blood pressure.

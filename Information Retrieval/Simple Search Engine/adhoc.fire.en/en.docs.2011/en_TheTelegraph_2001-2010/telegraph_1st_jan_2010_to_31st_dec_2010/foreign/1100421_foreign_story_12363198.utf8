	Daring Jolie    
	 Los Angeles, April 20 (PTI): Actress Angelina Jolie is even more motivated to perform daring stunts in her films these days as she thinks her children like it.      
	Jolie, who raises six children with partner actor Brad Pitt, insists that motherhood inspires her to take up tougher stunts since her kids think its cool, reports Entertainment Weekly.      
	The funny thing about having children is that now I am twice as motivated to do a cool stunt because my kids will like it, said Jolie.      
	Her latest film, Salt, about a CIA agent accused of being a Russian sleeper spy, called for a lot of tough action scenes.     
	Garner bash    
	 London (PTI): Actress Jennifer Garners star-studded birthday party was a child-friendly low-key afternoon affair instead of a wild Hollywood night bash. Garner, who turned 38 on Saturday, celebrated with an afternoon party at her Los Angeles home.

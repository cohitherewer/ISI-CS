The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Court glare on Zardari posts
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Court glare on Zardari posts
                                  
	Islamabad, May 18 (Reuters): A Pakistani court asked President Asif Ali Zardari today to explain how he can be co-chairman of the countrys ruling party and head of state at the same time, a lawyer said.        
	Separately, Zardari set aside sentences issued by anti-corruption courts in 2004 against his interior minister and close aide, Rehman Malik, hours after a high court dismissed Maliks challenge to them, a presidential spokesman said.        
	The legal challenge to Zardari over his two posts does not pose an immediate threat to the unpopular President but it is a reminder of the legal difficulties he faces, legal analysts said.        
	The Pakistan Lawyers Forum (PLF) filed a petition, or a challenge, questioning the right of the President to hold the two offices and in response, the High Court in Lahore ordered Zardaris principal secretary to explain. Since the President could not appear because of security reasons, the court asked his principal secretary to appear in court on May 25, PLF president A.K. Dogar told reporters outside the court.        
	There is no constitutional bar on the President holding office in a political party but Dogar said the Supreme Court had in the past barred a President from holding a party post.        
	Our Supreme Court judges decided in 1993 that the President should be non-partisan. He should not involve himself in political battles. He should shun politics but here he is a party head, which is illegal, he said. Zardari, the widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, is co-chairman of her Pakistan Peoples Party.

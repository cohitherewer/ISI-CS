The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kiss couple jail upheld in Dubai
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Kiss couple jail upheld in Dubai
                            
	Dubai, April 4 (AP): A Dubai appeals court today upheld a one-month prison sentence for a British couple convicted of kissing in a restaurant.        
	The pair landed in court after an Emirate woman complained about the public kiss, which the couple insisted was just a peck on the cheek. They were arrested and convicted of inappropriate behaviour and illegal drinking. Ayman Najafi and Charlotte Adams both in their 20s  have 30 days to appeal.        
	Cosmopolitan Dubai has the most relaxed social codes in the conservative Gulf, but authorities enforce strict decency laws and regularly crack down on people accused of pushing the limits, which can include everything from wearing a mini skirt to losing ones temper in traffic.        
	Last month, an Indian couple was sentenced to three months in jail for exchanging steamy text messages. Two Britons accused of having sex on the beach got three months in jail, though their sentences were suspended.

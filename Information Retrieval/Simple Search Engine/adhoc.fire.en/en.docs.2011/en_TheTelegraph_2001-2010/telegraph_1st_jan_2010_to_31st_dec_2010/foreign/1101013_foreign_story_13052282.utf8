	Gloomy dogs    
	 London, Oct. 12 (Reuters): If your dog destroys the furniture when you are away, it could be a pessimist, researchers have concluded. A study has found that some dogs are natural gloom-mongers while others have sunnier dispositions.       
	The study, published in Current Biology, which looked at 24 dogs at two UK animal centres, found that dogs temperaments correlated with their behaviour when separated from their owners.       
	Dogs that were less enthusiastic about bowl of food were calmer when left alone, sure their owners would return, while pessimistic dogs were more likely to worry, bark and misbehave.

	Jakarta, Aug. 9 (Reuters): Indonesian anti-terror police detained radical Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir today and several other militants in a crackdown on a network found making bombs and planning to attack the countrys President.        
	From documents, we knew this group had for some time made the president the target of their attack, said police spokesman Edward Aritonang after Bashirs detention.        
	Bashir, who told reporters his detention was a plot by the US, was linked by the polices anti-terror unit Detachment 88 to a militant training camp in Aceh.         
	Aceh is the only province that has Islamic sharia law.

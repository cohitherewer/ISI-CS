The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jolie scales back Bosnia filming plans
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jolie scales back Bosnia filming plans

	Nov. 17: Angelina Jolies controversial Balkan war movie is set to start filming in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo - but the Hollywood star, who is directing, will not be behind the camera, her local partner says. And none of the main actors will be there either.        
	A storm of protest erupted last month after word began to circulate that the film would depict not only the rape of a Bosnian Muslim woman by a Serb but also a romance between the two. Women who were raped during the 1990s war protested to government officials, who briefly rescinded permission to film in the country, then reinstated it after a full script was submitted for review.        
	Jolie has been shooting much of the untitled movie in Hungary. Edin Sarkic, 47, production director, location manager and co-owner of Sarajevo-based production house Scout Film  Jolies Bosnian partner on the movie  said yesterday that the filming in Sarajevo would be handled by a second-unit director.         
	He said Jolie would come to Bosnia, perhaps even during the filming, but only briefly. He added that she also plans to meet with the rape victims at some point.        
	Sarkic said the original plan called for eight to 10 days of filming in Bosnia, but that has been cut to three or four. This story, there is a paper [permit], there is no paper, is a non-starter in the West. Nobody from the West is going to work with you when one day you tell them you can film, and then the next day you tell them now you cant film, he said. That is simply a no-go.

	Los Angeles, Aug. 20 (PTI) Pop superstar Madonna is a facing a lawsuit for her new Material Girl fashion line as a clothing company has accused the singer of stealing the trademark.         
	Madonna and daughter Lourdes launched their latest clothing line for teenagers through Macys store and the 50-year-old singer used Material Girl, the title of her most famous track, as the brand name, TMZ reported.         
	But clothing manufacturer LA Triumph, Inc. has claimed in its lawsuit that its company has been doing business under the Material Girl banner since 1997 and Madonnas latest range will cause a deception in the market.         
	The company is now seeking to ban Madonna from using the trademark.         
	They are also demanding that they receive all profits the line has garnered so far.

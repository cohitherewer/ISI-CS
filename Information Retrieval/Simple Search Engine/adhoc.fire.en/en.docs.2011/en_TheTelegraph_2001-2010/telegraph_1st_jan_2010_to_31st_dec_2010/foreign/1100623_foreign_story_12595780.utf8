          DEXTER FILKINS                          Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal                                  
	Kabul, June 22: An angry President Obama summoned his top commander in Afghanistan to Washington today after a magazine article portrayed the general and his staff as openly contemptuous of some senior members of the Obama administration.        
	The militarys senior leaders joined in sharp criticism of the commander, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, and an administration official said he would meet President Obama and Vice-President Biden at the White House tomorrow to explain to the Pentagon and the commander in chief his quotes in the piece, which appears in the July 8-22 edition of Rolling Stone magazine.        
	McChrystal was scheduled to attend a monthly meeting on Afghanistan by teleconference, the official said, but was directed to return to Washington in light of the article. The general apologised for his remarks, saying the article was a mistake reflecting poor judgment and should never have happened.        
	The article shows McChrystal or his aides talking in sharply derisive terms about Biden; Ambassador Karl Eikenberry; Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan; and an unnamed minister in the French government. One of McChrystals aides is quoted as referring to the national security adviser, James L. Jones, as a clown.        
	A senior administration official said Obama was furious about the article, particularly with the suggestion that he was uninterested and unprepared to discuss the Afghanistan war after he took office.        
	The magazine article, The Runaway General, quotes aides of McChrystal saying the he was pretty disappointed by an Oval Office meeting with Obama, and that he found the President uncomfortable and intimidated during a Pentagon meeting with McChrystal.        
	The article, an advance copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, does not mention any serious policy differences with Obama, who chose McChrystal to take charge of a major escalation of American troops and equipment in hopes of reversing the deteriorating situation here.         
	In his statement, McChrystal said: I have enormous respect and admiration for President Obama and his national security team, and for the civilian leaders and troops fighting this war and I remain committed to ensuring its successful outcome.        
	Defence Secretary Robert M. Gates released a statement today that criticised McChrystal for a significant mistake and poor judgment in this case.        
	We are fighting a war against al Qaida and its extremist allies, who directly threaten the United States, Afghanistan, and our friends and allies around the world, said Gates, who has been among the most robust supporters of McChrystal.        
	Our troops and coalition partners are making extraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our security, and our singular focus must be on supporting them and succeeding in Afghanistan without such distractions, he added. General McChrystal has apologised to me and is similarly reaching out to others named in this article to apologise to them as well.

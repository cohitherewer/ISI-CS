The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kashmir an obstacle: US
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Kashmir an obstacle: US
  - No desire to mediate between India amp; Pak, says Hillary                            Hillary Clinton in Islamabad. (AP)                                  
	Islamabad, July 19 (PTI): US secretary of state Hillary Clinton today said here that the Kashmir issue is an impediment in developing a relationship beneficial to both India and Pakistan.         
	Kashmir (issue) has divided India and Pakistan and, in my view, are impediments to developing a relationship that would be beneficial to both countries, she told a joint news conference with the Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi.         
	Clinton also made it clear that the US has no desire to mediate between India and Pakistan to settle the Kashmir issue. It will have to be resolved by the two countries through talks, she said.         
	With Clinton by his side, Qureshi raked up the Kashmir issue and said his country wants a sustained dialogue with India. Qureshi, who held talks that ended in deadlock with external affairs minister S.M. Krishna on Friday, said sustaining dialogue with India and finding a just solution of the Kashmir dispute was part of the convergent interest of US and Pakistan.        
	While Pakistan has been insisting on discussing the Kashmir issue at all bilateral meetings with India, New Delhi has said all issues will be discussed as long as Islamabad addresses its core concern of terrorism emanating from the Pakistani soil.        
	At a town hall meeting with members of the civil society later in the day, Clinton said: We can only encourage, we cant solve (the Kashmir issue) because at the end of the day, this is an issue (to which) there is no dictated response.         
	The US cannot impose its decision on India and Pakistan or tell them what they must do to settle the Kashmir issue, she said.         
	We continue to encourage, we try to arrange and facilitate but this is going to take a tremendous act of courage by the political leadership in both countries. There is no short cut around it, she said.         
	$500 million in aid        
	Clinton announced more than $500 million in new aid projects for Pakistan today. At the same time, she again said that both the US and Pakistan should work harder to go after al Qaida leaders still believed to be hiding in Pakistan.        
	We would like to work more closely together to go after them and either capture or kill them, she told a roundtable of journalists. I believe that they are here in Pakistan and it would be really helpful if we could get them. It was a slightly softer repeat of statements she made last year that people in the Pakistan government knew where Osama bin Laden and other leaders were and she was puzzled over why they were not being arrested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | South Korea raid on Google offices
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      South Korea raid on Google offices
          CHOE SANG-HUN                          Street view woes                                  
	Seoul, Aug. 10: The South Korean police raided the offices of Google Korea today as part of an investigation into whether the company illegally collected and stored personal wireless data.        
	The US search and advertising titan is already facing lawsuits and investigations in several countries in connection with private wireless data collected by its Street View cars. Street View, which was first launched in 2006, allows users to view panoramic street scenes on Google Maps and take a virtual walk through cities.        
	From late last year until May, Google Korea dispatched cars topped with cameras to cruise around South Korea to photograph neighbourhoods ahead of the planned launch of Street View service in this country this year.        
	Police suspect those cars may have illegally captured and stored personal data from wireless networks while they were mapping streets, the Cyber Terror Response Centre of the Korean National Police Agency said in a statement.        
	We will investigate Google Korea officials and scrutinise the data we confiscated today to see whether company has violated the countrys laws on communications and privacy, it said.        
	We intend to find out what kinds of data they have collected and how much. We will try to retrieve all the original data illegally collected and stored through domestic Wi-Fi networks from the Google headquarters.        
	Google Korea officials were not immediately available for comment. Google, based in Mountain View, California, said previously that the collection of personal wireless data in other countries was unintentional and a blunder, and that the company would cooperate with investigations.

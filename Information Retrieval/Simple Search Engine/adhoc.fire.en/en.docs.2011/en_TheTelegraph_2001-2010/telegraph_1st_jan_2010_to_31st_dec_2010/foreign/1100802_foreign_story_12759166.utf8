	Lindsay fans    
	 London, Aug. 1 (PTI): Troubled star Lindsay Lohan is being flooded with fan mail in jail, receiving almost 250 letters per day. The Mean Girls star, who is serving jail term in Lynwood, California, for violating her 2007 drunken driving probation, is only allowed to read 10 a day, Sun reported online.      
	The 24-year-old actress has to return the letters she has already read before getting new ones. Lohan has served ten days of a 90-day sentence and is expected to be out next week. She will head straight to a rehab facility from jail.

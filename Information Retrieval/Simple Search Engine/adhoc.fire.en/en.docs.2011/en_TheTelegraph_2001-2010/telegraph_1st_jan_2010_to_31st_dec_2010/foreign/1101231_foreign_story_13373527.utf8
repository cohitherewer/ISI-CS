	Vatican City, Dec. 30 (AP): The Vatican today created a financial watchdog agency and issued new laws to try to comply with international rules to fight money laundering and terrorist financing.        
	The decrees, which go into effect on April 1, were passed as Vaticans own bank remains implicated in a money-laundering investigation that resulted in $31 million being seized and its top two officials placed under investigation.        
	Pope Benedict XVI signed the documents today, saying the Vatican wanted to join other countries that have cracked down on legal loopholes.         
	International financial organisations today said it appeared the Vatican had taken a step in the right direction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Putin is blocking democracy: Gorby
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Putin is blocking democracy: Gorby
          CLIFFORD J. LEVY                          Gorbachev: Unhappy                                  
	Moscow, Oct. 27: Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who once supported Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, is voicing growing frustration with Putins leadership, saying that he had undermined Russias fledgling democracy by crippling the Opposition forces.        
	He thinks that democracy stands in his way, Gorbachev said.        
	I am afraid that they have been saddled with this idea that this unmanageable country needs authoritarianism, Gorbachev said, referring to Putin and his close ally, President Dmitri A. Medvedev. They think they cannot do without it.        
	In an interview, Gorbachev even described Putins governing party, United Russia, as a a bad copy of the Soviet Communist Party. Gorbachev said party officials were concerned entirely with clinging to power and did not want Russians to take part in civic life.        
	Gorbachev was especially disparaging of Putins decision in 2004, when he was President, to eliminate elections for regional governors and the mayors of Moscow and St Petersburg. Those positions are now filled by Kremlin appointees. The impact of this change was illustrated in Medvedevs dismissal last month of Moscows longtime mayor, who was replaced with a Putin loyalist.        
	Democracy begins with elections, Gorbachev said. Elections, accountability and turnover.        
	 Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, was giving interviews this month to promote a benefit concert that his foundation is sponsoring in March in honour of his 80th birthday. The foundation runs a research centre and has raised millions of dollars for charities for children with cancer.        
	Gorbachevs criticism of Putin, while not new, appears to have grown somewhat sharper recently, as if Gorbachev feels that he put Russia on the path towards being a functional democracy, only to have Putin block its progress.        
	Neither Putin nor Medvedev have responded publicly to Gorbachev. Asked yesterday about Gorbachevs comments, Putins spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, seemed to choose his words carefully. We do feel the deepest respect towards Mikhail Gorbachev, and we certainly respect his point of view, Peskov said. But that doesnt mean that we agree with it.        
	Peskov said Opposition parties had failed to make gains in Russia because their leaders were unpopular and had not developed attractive platforms. Neither Putin personally nor United Russia as a political party can be held responsible for the inability of other parties to produce anything promising for citizens of this country, he said.

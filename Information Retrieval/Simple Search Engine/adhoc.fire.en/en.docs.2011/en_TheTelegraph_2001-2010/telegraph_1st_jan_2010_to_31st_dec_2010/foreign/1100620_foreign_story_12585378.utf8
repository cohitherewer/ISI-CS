	June 19: Soccer fans wrote a record-breaking 2,940 posts per second in the 30 seconds after Japan scored against Cameroon in a World Cup match on Monday. Their record fell three days later when the Lakers won the NBA championship.        
	Sports fans have spent the week watching the World Cup during the workday and staying up late to watch the NBA playoffs. They have also been logging on to Twitter.        
	Despite the serious technical problems that Twitter had during the week, three World Cup goals broke the all-time record for the number of Twitter posts written per second, Twitter reported. And those records were quickly shattered on Thursday night, after the Lakers won the final game of the NBA playoffs.        
	In the 30 seconds after Japan scored against Cameroon on Monday, soccer fans wrote a record 2,940 posts per second. Basketball fans quickly broke that record with 3,085 posts per second after the Lakers victory.

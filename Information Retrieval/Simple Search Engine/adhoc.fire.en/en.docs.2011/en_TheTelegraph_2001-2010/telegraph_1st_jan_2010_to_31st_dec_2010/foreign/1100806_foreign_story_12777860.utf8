	Julia no to Botox    
	 Los Angeles, Aug. 5 (PTI): Actress Julia Roberts has no desire to get Botox injections to delay the ageing process because she wants her face to remain natural for her children.      
	Roberts, 42, mother of five-year-old twins Hazel and Finn, and Henry, three, said every face tells a story but wrinkle-smoothing injections freeze your facial expressions.       
	She is angry that some women feel pressured by society to resort to such measures. Its unfortunate that we live in such a panicked, dysmorphic society where women dont even give themselves a chance to see what theyll look like as older persons, said Roberts, who will next be seen in Eat, Pray, Love .    
	Dog toe    
	Detroit (Reuters): A Michigan man credited his dog with saving his life by chewing off his diseased big toe as he lay passed out in a drunken stupor. Jerry Douthett, 48, woke up on a Saturday night in late July in his Rockford, Michigan, home to find his Jack Russell Terrier, Kiko, had gnawed off his right big toe. The dog always lays with me on the bed, said Douthett. That night, I woke up and looked down at my foot, and it was wet. When I looked it was blood, and there was the dog looking at me with a blood moustache. Douthetts wife, Rosee, rushed him to a hospital where doctors found his toe was badly infected and surgeons amputated the remainder of the digit.    
	Dustin role    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Actor Dustin Hoffman is likely to reprise his role of Bernie Focker in Little Fockers, the sequel to Meet The Fockers.

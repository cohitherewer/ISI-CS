The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palin in North Korea gaffe
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Palin in North Korea gaffe
          ANDREW HOUGH                           Slip of tongue                                  
	Nov. 25: Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and Tea Party favourite, has been hit by another gaffe after mistakenly declaring the US should stand by its North Korean allies.        
	Palin, who is widely tipped to run in the 2012 presidential made the verbal slip during a live American radio interview after being asked about the war games being played out between North and South Korea.        
	The former Republican Vice-Presidential candidates foreign policy credentials suffered a blow after she claimed that Barack Obamas administration should stand firm alongside Kim Jong-ils Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.        
	When asked by prominent conservative Glenn Beck about the escalating conflict on the Korean peninsula, the former beauty queen claimed it was worrying that the US could not be trusted to make appropriate decisions.        
	Were not having a lot of faith that the White House is going to come out with a strong enough policy to sanction what it is that North Korea is going to do, she said on the Fox News presenters nationally syndicated radio show.        
	So this speaks to a bigger picture here that certainly scares me in terms of our national security policies.        
	But obviously we gotta stand with our North Korean allies. When the host immediately corrected her Palin repeated: Er yeah. And were also bound by prudence to stand with our South Korean allies, yes.        
	While the statement appears to have been a slip of the tongue, it will likely damage her credibility and fail to shed perceptions that she is weak on foreign policy.        
	Palin, who left midway through her first term in office as governor of Alaska, has been criticised by the lamestream media for her apparent lack of knowledge on key foreign when she was John McCains running mate during his failed bid for the White House.        
	She was lampooned for claiming that Alaskas proximity to Russia gave her an edge to Kremlinology after an interview.

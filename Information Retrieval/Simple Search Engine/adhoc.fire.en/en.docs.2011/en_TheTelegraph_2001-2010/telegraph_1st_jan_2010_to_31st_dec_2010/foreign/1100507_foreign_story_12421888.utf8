The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Change clock ticks in Britain
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Change clock ticks in Britain
          AMIT ROY                          Men drink at a pub being used as a polling station in London on Thursday. (Reuters)                                  
	London, May 6: Today could well be Gordon Browns last day as prime minister which means that at meetings of world leaders such as G20 summits or Commonwealth heads of government gatherings, he will no longer be able to wander across the room to greet my very good friend Manmohan Singh.        
	They have known each other as finance ministers and then as prime ministers.        
	There is no room for sentiment in British politics but the Indian prime minister might well find some comfort in Tennysons lines in Morte dArthur: The old order changeth, yielding place to new, And God fulfils Himself in many ways, Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.        
	The polls suggest approaching Morte dGordon. However, because of a starring role by the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who has done amazingly well in three prime ministerial debates, David Cameron may not be able to get an absolute Commons majority for the Tories.        
	But as Britain went to the polls today, all the indications were that one lot of removal vans would take away Browns belongings from 10, Downing Street, tomorrow and minutes later, another lot would arrive with Camerons pictures, books, bicycle, his pregnant wife Samantha and their two children. (In Britain, politicians tend not to cling on to their official residences).        
	The three main party leaders all cast their votes early with Cameron voting first, accompanied by Samantha as they went to the polling station in Witney, Oxfordshire; Brown voted next in drizzle in North Queensferry, in Scotland, with his wife Sarah. Clegg then cast his vote in Sheffield, accompanied by his wife Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, who cannot vote as she is Spanish.        
	Although India-UK relations have been the best ever, as Foreign Secretary David Miliband told Indian journalists recently, it could also be business as usual under the Tories.        
	In fact, Cameron has announced he wants a special relationship with India, a commitment highlighted in the Conservative Party manifesto. But he has also said he will impose a cap on immigration which could make it difficult for Indian companies that have invested in the UK to send their staff to Britain.        
	Indian students, too, may find many more questions are asked before they are given visas to come to join their universities.        
	Since successive Indian governments have enjoyed a warm relationship with Labour over the past 13 years since Tony Blair swept to power in 1997, there will be some sadness at the anticipated passing of Brown.        
	On the other hand, there will be several more MPs of Pakistani origin likely to be elected this time, thereby giving Pakistan powerful friends on issues such as Kashmir and liberation movements within the Labour movement. From a purely selfish point of view, a Tory win may have distinct advantages for India.        
	Compared with India, a British general election is logistically a modest affair. Only 44 million people are eligible to vote. Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis make up well over a million voters but because they are concentrated in marginal seats, their influence can be disproportionate to their numbers.        
	Polls opened at 7am today with counting due to begin immediately and manually after voting ended at 10pm. In all, there are 50,000 polling stations, run by 150,000 council staff, across the UK, located at schools, libraries and community centres so that no voter has to walk for more than a few minutes.        
	There is usually an exit poll flashed on television a few minutes after 10pm but tonight early predictions will have to be treated with caution. There will be high drama as some famous names fall and some surprise wins and defeats.        
	In the last parliament of 646 seats, Labour, with 345 members, had an overall majority of 56 in a house that contained 193 Tories and 63 Lib Dems.        
	The final newspaper polls of the campaign all put Conservatives in the lead with support ranging between 35-37 per cent. The other two parties were vying for second place, with Labour apparently edging slightly ahead on 28-29 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 26-28 per cent.        
	On an even swing, the figures would make the Tories the largest party, with between 268 and 294, but leave them well short of the 326 MPs Cameron needs to lead a majority administration. The polls suggest Labour could emerge with around 248-274 MPs, with the Lib Dems holding the balance of power on 77-82 seats.        
	This is what the Lib-Dems find so upsetting. If they go up only 20 seats but have a popular vote a percentage point or two behind Labour, they will demand a change from the first past the post method to a proportional system as the price of handing the keys of No 10 to Cameron.        
	 As the likely kingmaker, Clegg will be wooed by both sides so it is technically not impossible for Brown to remain prime minister although that is the least likely option. Tomorrow could also see the resignation of Brown and the start of a new poll to choose his successor as the Labour party leader.        
	There are 4,149 candidates fighting for 650 slots in the new Commons  there is polling in only 649 because the election has been suspended in one constituency where a candidate has suddenly died. Each constituency has 70,000-80,000 voters, with turnout expected to be around 60 per cent  a significant drop from 20 years ago when it was over 70 per cent. Young voters are expected to turn out for Clegg.        
	Many of the MPs, quite a few of them women, will be first timers because old members disgraced by the expenses scandal had to give way to new candidates. It has been predicted that the number of candidates of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin will more than double to 30.        
	The Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt was asked what he thought of British electioneering when he visited Leicester last week to express support for Labours Keith Vaz.        
	Its different, said Dutt, half in admiration, half in disappointment, its so peaceful.

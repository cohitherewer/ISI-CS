The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nazi shame on Popes lips
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Nazi shame on Popes lips

	Birmingham, Sept. 19 (Reuters): Pope Benedict told a Mass today the world felt shame and horror at suffering inflicted by his German homeland in World War II and recalled a key air battle that saved Britain from invasion.        
	At the same Mass in a park in the British midlands where the pope spoke of the war, he beatified Cardinal John Henry Newman, one of the most prominent English converts from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism.        
	But in his sermon, on the last day of a four-day visit, before a crowd of more than 50,000 people attending the open-air Mass under an intermittent drizzle, he spoke first of the war.        
	Britain today commemorated the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, the summer and autumn air conflict which prevented Hitlers planned invasion of Britain.        
	For me, as one who lived and suffered through the dark days of the Nazi regime in Germany, it is deeply moving to be here with you on this occasion, and to recall how many of your fellow citizens sacrificed their lives, courageously resisting the forces of that evil ideology, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gulf of Mexico oil rig explodes
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Gulf of Mexico oil rig explodes
                                  
	New Orleans, Sept. 2 (AP): An offshore petroleum platform exploded and was burning today in the Gulf of Mexico about 160km off the Louisiana coast, west of the site where BPs undersea well spilled after a rig explosion.        
	According to the coast guard, a mile-long oil sheen is spreading from the site of the platform.        
	It said no one was killed in the explosion, which was spotted by a commercial helicopter flying over the site this morning. All 13 people aboard the rig have been accounted for, with one injury. The extent of the injury was not known.        
	They were rescued from the water by an offshore service vessel, the Crystal Clear, said the coast guard commander, Cheri Ben-Iesau. She said they were taken to a nearby platform. All were being flown to the Terrebonne General Medical Centre in Houma to be checked.        
	Thirteen people were seen huddled together in the water wearing gumby suits or immersion suits, water protection suits, so we were able to confirm that all people were accounted for, coast guard spokesman Chief Petty Officer John Edwards said.        
	Seven coast guard helicopters, two airplanes and three cutters were dispatched to the scene from New Orleans, Houston and Mobile, Alabama, Ben-Iesau said. She said authorities do not know whether oil was leaking from the site.        
	The platform, known as Vermilion Oil Platform 380, was owned by Mariner Energy of Houston, according to a homeland security operations update obtained by The Associated Press. The platform was not producing oil and gas, according to the operations report.        
	Melissa Schwartz, spokeswoman for Bureau of Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement, said the platform was authorised to produce oil and gas at this water depth but had not been recently in active production.        
	There were ongoing maintenance activities underway, she said, adding it was in approximately 105 metres of water.        
	White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said President Barack Obama was in a national security meeting and did not know whether Obama had been informed of the explosion. We obviously have response assets ready for deployment should we receive reports of pollution in the water, Gibbs said.        
	A call to the company seeking comment was not immediately returned.        
	Responding to an oil spill in shallow water is much easier than in deep water, where crews depend on remote-operated vehicles access equipment on the sea floor. The platform is about 320km west of BPs blown out Macondo well.         
	Tomorrow, BP was expected to begin the process of removing the cap and failed blowout preventer, another step towards completion of a relief well that would complete the choke of the well.

	Small bombs exploded at the Swiss and Russian embassies in Athens yesterday, a parcel with explosives was intercepted at the German chancellors office and another package addressed to Italys Prime Minister caught fire when it was checked.         
	The bombs may be intended to spur an anti-government vote in Sundays local elections in protest against Prime Minister George Papandreous austerity plan, agreed with the EU and IMF to deal with Greeces debt mountain.        
	Such brainless and irresponsible actions aim to damage the Greek peoples great effort to put the country and its economy back on its feet, said Papandreou.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | No Red, cries Ed but buries New Labour
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      No Red, cries Ed but buries New Labour
          AMIT ROY                      Ed Miliband                          
	London, Sept. 26: Ed Miliband, dubbed Red Ed because of his alleged dependence on Left-wing trade union bosses, chose to wear a blue tie today when he was interviewed on a television show less than 24 hours after narrowly beating elder brother David to win the Labour Party leadership.        
	The 40-year-old, who was able to win by a wafer thin majority of 1.3 per cent of votes cast only because of backing from bandh-loving trade union leaders  yes, Britain has bandhs, too  sought to project himself as an independent man.        
	I am nobodys man, I am my own man, Ed told BBC1s Andrew Marr Show. All these characterisations about Red Ed are both tiresome and also rubbish, he declared.        
	In broad terms, the main difference between the Tories and Labour is as follows: the former want deep public expenditure cuts even if it is painful in order to reduce the massive national debt; the latter, while conceding a reduction in government spending is necessary, believes the process should be rendered less painful by staggering it over a longer period of time.        
	The big union bosses, who have put Ed into power, have warned they will bring Britain to a bandh if Prime Minister David Cameron and his chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, choose to pursue their policy of cuts.        
	Ed reflected the union view: They (the Tories) want to say the only thing that matters in our society is to eliminate the structural deficit over the next four years. I dont agree with that because that will inflict huge damage on our communities. Deficit reduction, yes, but at a cautious pace and in a way that will help our economy, not hinder it.        
	Ed denied that his election represented a lurch to the left, but he confirmed: The era of New Labour is past. A new generation has taken over and its not about the old labels any more.        
	In his memoirs, Tony Blair, who won three successive general elections, wrote about the dangers of abandoning New Labour and the centre ground of British politics. Labour won when it was New Labour. It lost because it stopped being New Labour.        
	Blair had said: The danger for Labour now is that we drift off, or even move decisively off, to the Left. If we do, we will lose even bigger next time.        
	Eds response is: My issue about what happened to New Labour is that at the beginning we were a radical, reforming government, we were people who were hungry for change in Britain, we said there were injustices and problems in our society and we needed to sort them out, he said. Im afraid we became the establishment and when you become the establishment you get kicked out of power.        
	He explained his philosophy: I think there are big injustices we need to deal with in Britain, many of them affecting so-called Middle England  people who are working hard, working long hours, they dont have enough time to see their kids, they are worried about their kids getting into debt, they are worried about housing. They are the people I want to speak for.        
	The business folk among the 1.5-million strong Indian community will certainly not want to pay higher taxes in order to sustain those who have become overly dependent on the welfare state as a lifestyle choice (the words used by George Osborne). But the latter are largely Labour voters.        
	In reality, the battle lines are not always clear cut. The Tory-Lib Dem coalition has announced its determination to track down tax dodgers and evaders.        
	Hundreds of wealthy taxpayers  it is not known if there are Indians among them  were recently sent letters by HM Revenue amp; Customs (HMRC) over possible large-scale tax evasion.        
	Most of the letters relate to offshore bank accounts held at HSBC in Switzerland after HMRC acquired a list of well-off individuals with accounts at the bank. The letters advise the recipients that HMRC will investigate any situation of suspected serious tax fraud.        
	An HMRC spokesman said: The days of hiding money offshore to evade tax are now over.        
	The US government, too, has begun a criminal investigation into whether clients of HSBC are evading tax by putting money in undeclared accounts in Singapore and India.        
	According to HSBC, one of the banks former IT employees in Switzerland stole information concerning clients and former customers.        
	French authorities acquired the data, which includes names, account numbers and some addresses of an estimated 15,000 existing HSBC customers and 9,000 who have closed their accounts. Some of the intelligence was passed to the US, the UK, and, it is understood, to India as well.        
	Switzerland then issued a warrant for the arrest of Herv Falciani, who is alleged to have stolen the data in late 2006.        
	In theory, Ed Miliband, who wants increased taxation on the banks, should support Cameron as he orders a crackdown on tax dodgers. But bashing the banks is not seen as a wise long-term policy simply because the financial sector contributes heavily to the British economy.Ed has also made right-wing noises on immigration, which suggest he will not necessarily be sympathetic to Indian companies who want to bring their own staff to the UK.

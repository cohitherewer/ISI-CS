The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China pig salvo at US climate rant
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China pig salvo at US climate rant
          CHRIS BUCKLEY                              
	Tianjin, China, Oct. 9 (Reuters): China hit back today at US claims it was shirking in the fight against climate change, likening criticisms from the Obama administrations top climate envoy to a pig preening itself in a mirror.        
	Su Wei, a senior Chinese climate change negotiator, rejected comments from US climate envoy Todd Stern as a week of UN talks on fighting climate change drew to a close in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin.        
	Stern, in remarks at a US university, said Beijing could not insist rich nations take on fixed targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions while China and other big emerging nations adopt only voluntary domestic goals.        
	Su countered that Sterns claims were a diversion from the US failure to make big cuts in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases causing global warming. China is the worlds top greenhouse gas polluter after the US.        
	In fact, it amounts to doing nothing themselves and then shirking responsibility. They want to place the blame on China and other developing countries, Su told reporters in Tianjin.        
	The UN says there is little time to agree on the outlines of a broader climate pact that binds all big carbon emitting nations and to prevent dangerous climate change, such as greater extremes of droughts, floods and storms.        
	The first phase of the Kyoto Protocol, the UNs main weapon against climate change, ends in 2012 and what follows from 2013 is under contention.        
	Greens say the Tianjin talks made progress on a future climate fund to help poorer nations adapt to global warming and to green their economies. But anger over rich nations carbon pledges, particularly the US, soured the mood.        
	The US Senate is struggling to approve a pledge to cut emissions by about 4 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, a long way from the size of cuts other Western governments have pledged.

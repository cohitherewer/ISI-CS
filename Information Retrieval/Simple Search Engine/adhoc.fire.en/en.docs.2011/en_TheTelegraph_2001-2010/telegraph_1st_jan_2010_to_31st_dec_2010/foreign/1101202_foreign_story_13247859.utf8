	Islamabad, Dec. 1: Less than a month after President Obama testily assured reporters in 2009 that Pakistans nuclear materials will remain out of militant hands, his ambassador here sent a secret message to Washington suggesting that she remained deeply worried.        
	The ambassadors concern was a stockpile of highly enriched uranium, sitting for years near an ageing research nuclear reactor in Pakistan. There was enough to build several dirty bombs or, in skilled hands, possibly enough for an actual nuclear bomb.        
	In the cable, dated May 27, 2009, the ambassador, Anne W. Patterson, reported that the Pakistani government was yet again dragging its feet on an agreement reached two years earlier to have the US remove the material.        
	She wrote to senior American officials that the Pakistani government had concluded that the sensational international and local media coverage of Pakistans nuclear weapons made it impossible to proceed at this time. A senior Pakistani official, she said, warned that if word leaked out that Americans were helping remove the fuel, the local press would certainly portray it as the US taking Pakistans nuclear weapons.        
	The fuel is still there.        
	It may be the most unnerving evidence of the complex relationship  sometimes cooperative, often confrontational, always wary  between America and Pakistan nearly 10 years into the American-led war in Afghanistan.        
	 The cables, obtained by WikiLeaks and made available to a number of news organisations, make it clear that underneath public reassurances lie deep clashes over strategic goals on issues like Pakistans support for the Afghan Taliban and tolerance of Al Qaida, and Washingtons warmer relations with India.        
	Written from the American embassy in Islamabad, the cables reveal American manoeuvering as diplomats try to support an unpopular elected government that is more sympathetic to American aims than is the real power in Pakistan, the army and intelligence agency so crucial to the fight against militants.         
	Frustration at American inability to persuade the Pakistani army and intelligence agency to stop supporting the Afghan Taliban and other militants runs through the reports of meetings between American and Pakistani officials. That frustration preoccupied the Bush administration and became an issue for the incoming Obama administration, the cables document, during a trip in January 2009 that Biden made to Pakistan 11 days before he was sworn in.         
	In a meeting with Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the army chief of staff, Biden asked several times whether Pakistan and the United States had the same enemy as we move forward.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Medvedev is seeking another term: Aide
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Medvedev is seeking another term: Aide
                              WANTS TO STAY ON                            
	Moscow, Dec. 10 (Reuters): The Kremlins top economic aide said he believes President Dmitry Medvedev wants to seek a second term in the 2012 presidential elections, the BBC reported in Russian today.        
	I think it will be clear to anyone who looks carefully at what Dmitry Medvedev is doing, that he wants to stay on for a second term, Arkady Dvorkovich was quoted as telling the BBC in an interview, reported in Russian.        
	Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin have both said they will make a decision together on who will run in the elections closer to the vote.        
	Dvorkovich added that he believed they still have not made the final decision.        
	Putin served as President from 2000 to 2008 and dominates what officials call a ruling tandem with Medvedev, the protege he steered into the Kremlin when a constitutional limit prevented him from running for a third term.        
	Many analysts and diplomats expect Putin to return to the Kremlin in 2012, and polls show most Russians believe he is still just as powerful as he was while President.        
	Putin and Medvedev say they consult on a regular basis and agree on most issues. Signs of significant discord between them could create uncertainty and undermine investor confidence.

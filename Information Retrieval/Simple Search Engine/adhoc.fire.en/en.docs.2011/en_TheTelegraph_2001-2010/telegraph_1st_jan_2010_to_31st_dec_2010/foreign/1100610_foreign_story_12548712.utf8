	Los Angeles, June 9 (Reuters): A judge yesterday issued a new arrest warrant for actress Lindsay Lohan for violating the terms of her probation following an emergency meeting with lawyers in her 2007 drunken driving case.        
	Judge Marsha Revel also set a new bail amount of $200,000 for the actress, a court spokesman said. Judge Revel called the meeting in her Beverly Hills court following reports, which were denied by Lohan, that her alcohol-monitoring bracelet was set off.

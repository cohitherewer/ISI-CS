The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Church pat for artificial cell

	London, May 23 (PTI): The Vatican has praised the breakthrough achieved by researchers in creating the worlds first synthetic cell as an interesting result but asked them to join courage with caution as they tread the fragile territory.        
	The Vatican newspaper LOsservatore Romano called it an important research and the work of high-quality genetic engineering.         
	But it said scientists who created the cell had not created life, just replaced one of its motors.        
	On Friday, scientists led by genome pioneer J. Craig Venter announced that they have developed the first bacteria cell controlled by a synthetic genome.         
	Venter said this would help science in a range of applications from converting carbon dioxide to fuel to creating new vaccines to treat diseases.         
	Genetic engineering can do good: It is enough to think that it could heal chromosome-related diseases, the article said yesterday.        
	However, scientists must join courage with caution, it said.        
	They touch a very fragile territory where the environment and manipulation play a role that cannot be underestimated, CNN quoted it as saying.        
	 The weight of the DNA is great, and great are the expectations of genetic science, it said.         
	Nevertheless, the DNA, even though it is an excellent engine, is not life.        
	The church does not officially oppose genetic engineering as long as it avoids embryonic stem cells, cloning or anything that fiddles too much with the re-creation of human life.

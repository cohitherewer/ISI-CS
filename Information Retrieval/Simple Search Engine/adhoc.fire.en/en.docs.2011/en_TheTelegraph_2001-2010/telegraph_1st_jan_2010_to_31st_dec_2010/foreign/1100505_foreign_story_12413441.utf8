                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Man with Kashmir ties arrested over NY plot
                              A picture of Faisal Shahzad taken from the social networking site Orkut.com. (Reuters)                            
	Washington/New York, May 4 (Agencies): An American citizen of Kashmiri descent and said to be born in Pakistan-held territory was hauled off a plane about to fly to West Asia and arrested in the failed attempt to explode a bomb-laden SUV in New Yorks Times Square.        
	According to a source familiar with the investigation, it was not known if he was affiliated with any militant group.        
	The source, who asked not to be identified because the issue is sensitive, said the suspect, Faisal Shahzad, was born in 1979 and had been in the US for some time.        
	Which group he may have belonged to and how he became radicalised, we dont know yet, said the source. He is Kashmiri by ethnicity.        
	The source said Shahzad, a naturalised US citizen, had his Pakistani passport renewed in March 2000 and by 2005 was in the process of getting a green card, or permanent residency in the US. In Pakistan, official sources said Shahzad was born in Pabbi, northwest of Islamabad.        
	Shahzad and two others were arrested on board a Dubai-bound plane at the John F. Kennedy airport after it had pulled away from the gate and was recalled, but the other two were cleared and allowed to travel, the Emirates airline said. Clearly the guy was on the plane and shouldnt have been and we got very lucky, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told a news conference.        
	US authorities will not rest until we have brought everyone responsible to justice, Attorney-General Eric Holder said today, suggesting additional suspects are being sought. He said the Times Square attempt was a terrorist plot aimed at murdering Americans. Holder said Shahzad will be charged with act of terrorism and attempted use of weapon of mass destruction.        
	Hes admitted to buying the truck, putting the devices together, putting them in the truck, leaving the truck there and leaving the scene, a law enforcement source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Hes claimed to have acted alone. He did admit to all the charges, so to speak, said the source.        
	President Barack Obama said hundreds of lives may have been saved on Saturday night by the quick action of ordinary citizens and law enforcement authorities who saw the smoking SUV parked in Times Square.        
	Shahzad, 30, had recently returned from a five-month trip to Pakistan, where he had a wife, returning to the US in February, according to law enforcement officials.         
	He became a US citizen last year.        
	Based on our collective experience its hard to really believe that this is something someone would do on their own. It seems hard to pull off alone. Theres a lot we dont know yet, the source said.        
	Shahzad is suspected of buying a 1993 Nissan SUV used to carry the crude bomb, made of fuel and fireworks, into Times Square as the theatre and shopping area was packed with people on a warm Saturday evening.        
	Authorities searched Shahzads home in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the FBI said today. An FBI spokeswoman did not say what authorities had found.

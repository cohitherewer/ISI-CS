The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | India ties on Nato lips
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      India ties on Nato lips
  - Alliance sees greater Afghan role for neighbours                                 
	Germany, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Nato should develop closer ties with China, India, Pakistan and Russia and become a forum for consultation on global security, the alliances head said today.        
	The four countries all have interests in stability in Afghanistan and can do more to help develop and assist the country, Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said.        
	What would be the harm if countries such as China, India, Pakistan and others were to develop closer ties with Nato? I think, in fact, there would only be a benefit, in terms of trust, confidence and co-operation, he said.        
	His comments came ahead of a major Nato operation in Helmand province in southern Afghanistan, in one of the biggest offensives in the eight-year-old war. US Marines are set to launch an operation within days to take Marjah, an area of lush farmland criss-crossed by canals in the centre of Helmand, Afghanistans most violent province.        
	Rasmussen said Nato should become the global forum with other nations on a host of security issues extending from terrorism, cyber attacks, nuclear proliferation, piracy, climate change and competition for natural resources as well as Afghanistan.        
	Nato can be the place where views, concerns and best practices on security are shared by Natos global partners. And where... we might work out how to tackle global challenges together, he told a conference in Munich ahead of discussion of a new Natostrategic concept due to be approved in November.        
	Rasmussen said Nato was already working with Pakistan, and other countries stood to gain from a stable Afghanistan. India has a stake in Afghan stability. China too. And both could help further develop and rebuild Afghanistan. The same goes for Russia, he said.        
	A senior Russian politician reacted with scepticism to the proposals, saying Nato first had to think globally, and complained that Russia had not been involved in the process.        
	I believe the problem of Nato today is that Nato develops in reverse order  it tries to act globally more and more but continues to think locally, said Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the Russian Dumas International Affairs Committee.        
	As soon as Nato starts to reach beyond its borders this is no longer just an internal matter for Nato, said Kosachev.         
	Moscow still views Nato, its Cold War adversary, with deep suspicion. Ties were severely strained by the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia.

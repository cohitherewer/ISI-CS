	London, Jan. 10 (Agencies): A veteran war correspondent for Britains Sunday Mirror newspaper has been killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan.        
	Defence correspondent Rupert Hamer was accompanying a US Marine patrol to the northwest of Nawa in Helmand province when the vehicle he was in struck an improvised explosive device.        
	A US Marine was also killed in the explosion. Sunday Mirror photographer Philip Coburn was wounded. As many as 18 reporters have been killed in Afghanistan since the US-led offensive began after the September 11, 2001, attacks.        
	Rupert believed that the only place to report a war was from the front line. Affectionately known as Corporal Hamer in the office, he was a gregarious figure and a wonderful friend, Sunday Mirror editor Tina Weaver said.

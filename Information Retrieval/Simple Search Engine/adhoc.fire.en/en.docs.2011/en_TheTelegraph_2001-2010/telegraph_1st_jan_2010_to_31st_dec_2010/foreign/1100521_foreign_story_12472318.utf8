          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                              
	Islamabad, May 20: The Pakistani government blocked access to YouTube today because of sacrilegious content in a growing Internet crackdown against sites deemed offensive to the countrys population.        
	The move against the video-sharing website came a day after the government blocked access to Facebook amid anger over a page on the social networking site that encourages users to post caricatures that are considered blasphemous.         
	The Pakistan Telecommunications Authority did not point to specific material on YouTube that prompted it to block the site, only citing growing sacrilegious contents. The government acted against both Facebook and YouTube after it failed to persuade the websites to remove the derogatory material.        
	It welcomed representatives from the two websites to contact the Pakistani government to resolve the dispute in a way that ensures religious harmony and respect. The regulatory body said it has blocked more than 450 Internet links.

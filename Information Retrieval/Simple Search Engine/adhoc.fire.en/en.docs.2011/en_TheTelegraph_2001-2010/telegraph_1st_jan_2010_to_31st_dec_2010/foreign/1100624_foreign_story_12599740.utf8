	June 23: Google is planning to launch a music download service linked to its search engine later this year in a bid to up the ante against Apple, according to a report.        
	The Wall Street Journal report states that the search giant is preparing to launch the music download offering in 2010, followed by an online subscription service in 2011.        
	The newspaper cites people familiar with Googles discussions with the music industry as its sources, but was unable to confirm whether actual deals have been signed with record labels so far.        
	Rumours that Google has been planning its own music streaming and download service have been doing the rounds since October 2009.        
	According to the Journal, Google has been stepping up its conversations about offering new music services tied to phones running its Android operating system along with the broader Web.

	Sinabang (Indonesia), April 7 (Reuters): A major earthquake of 7.7 magnitude struck off the coast of Aceh on the Indonesian island of Sumatra today triggering panic and power blackouts.        
	Later, a tsunami alert was later lifted. Neighbouring Thailand and Malaysia, lying east of Sumatra, also cancelled tsunami warnings.        
	A Reuters photographer in Sinabang on Simeulue island, south of Aceh, said that electricity was cut in the area and that he saw four injured people, including a child with a head wound who had been hit by fallen masonry.        
	Aceh Governor Irwandi Yusuf said earlier there had not been reports of damage or casualties so far. I am on the coast now, some people had gone to take refuge on higher ground but now they have returned to their homes, Yusuf told Metro TV.        
	The resource-rich island of Sumatra is an important supplier of commodities such as rubber, palm oil and liquefied natural gas, but there were no immediate reports of delays in shipments because of the quake. The quake, which struck around 2215GMT, was centred 200km west-northwest of the coastal town of Sibolga and was at a depth of 31km, the US Geological Survey said. The epicentre was around 215 km from Medan, the largest city on Sumatra.

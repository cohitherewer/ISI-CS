                              Mario Monicelli                            
	Rome, Nov. 30 (Reuters): Mario Monicelli, 95, who directed some of post-war Italys most famous films and launched the careers of some of the countrys greatest actors, jumped to his death from a Rome hospital win- dow yesterday, Italian media said.        
	Monicelli directed such classics as I Soliti Ignoti, The Great War, For Love and Gold, and the My Friends series with Ugo Tognazzi and Philippe Noiret. The reports said he jumped from the fourth floor of the San Giovanni hospital, where he was being treated for terminal prostate cancer.        
	Monicelli, known as a genius of the Italian comedy, also directed serious films such as A Very Little Man, which tells the tragic tale of an average man who takes justice into his own hands after his son is killed in a robbery.        
	He worked with some of post-war Italys greatest actors, including Marcello Mastroianni, Sophia Loren, Vittorio Gassman, Alberto Sordi, Anna Magnani, Claudia Cardinale and Monica Vitti.

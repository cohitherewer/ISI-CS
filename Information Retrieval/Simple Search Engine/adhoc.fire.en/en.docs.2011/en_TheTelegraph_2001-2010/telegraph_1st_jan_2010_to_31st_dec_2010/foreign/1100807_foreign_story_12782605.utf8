	Amys expose    
	 London, Aug. 6 (PTI): Singer Amy Winehouse topped her own record when she had a wardrobe malfunction in front of the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelthini.      
	Winehouse was at the launch of a restaurant here and was already drunk when she arrived at the venue with boyfriend Reg Traviss.       
	While the other 200 diners gave the king a standing ovation, Traviss had to drag Winehouse to her feet. The king then made a speech which the singer ignored as she slept on her boyfriends lap, exposing her breasts.

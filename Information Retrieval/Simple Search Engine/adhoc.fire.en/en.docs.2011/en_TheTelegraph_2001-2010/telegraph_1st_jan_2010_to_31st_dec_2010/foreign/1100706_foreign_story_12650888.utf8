The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Yoga faces a big riddle
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Yoga faces a big riddle
                            
	New York, July 5 (Reuters): When one of Meera Patricia Kerrs students tried to attend a regular yoga class, the instructor told her to come back when she lost weight.        
	That kind of broke my heart, said Kerr, a yoga instructor and author of Big Yoga, a Simple Guide for Bigger Bodies.        
	Overweight people feel out of the loop. If youre big, you might be uncomfortable in a class of normies, she said, even if the instructor is welcoming.        
	Kerr says some yoga teachers dont know how to adapt to bigger bodies.        
	Theres fitness yoga with the bendy girls in their cute little outfits, then theres the more mystical side which attracts a lot of people, then theres the plus size, which is becoming more visible, she said.        
	With almost two-thirds of American women either overweight or obese and more than 15 million people practising yoga in the US, that comes as no surprise.        
	Kerr, who lives in Michigan, started teaching yoga 32 years ago. I was young and plump but not as big as I am now, she explained. I got bigger and I needed to adapt my practice to the belly and the boobs.        
	She said while you dont have to be thin to do yoga, you do have to modify poses to suit the more curvaceous body. In her book, Kerr demonstrates classic poses with a chair or a wall for extra support.        
	Most people who are bigger cant start from a lying down position, said Kerr. Im 64. I do a modified headstand. I dont go all the way up.        
	On the plus side, she said, people who are bigger dont need a lot of cushioning. Kerr said the yogic practice of pranayama is especially good for bigger people.        
	Jessica Matthews, of the American Council on Exercise (ACE), acknowledged that overweight people might feel vulnerable.        
	In an ideal world I want to see everyone interact together, she said. But when we hear of celebrities and Hollywood actresses doing yoga, it does attract a different crowd.        
	She would like to break that stereotype. Yoga is a place to encourage people to feel a posture, not to worry, When I twist is my stomach hanging over my pants? she added.

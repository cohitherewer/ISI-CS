The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Drunk pilot held before takeoff
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Drunk pilot held before takeoff
                            
	Sept. 15: An intoxicated pilot was arrested at Amsterdams Schipol airport just minutes before his aeroplane carrying 196 passengers was supposed to take-off.        
	Aviation authorities boarded a plane after a tip-off from a crew member. The pilot, identified only as a 52-year-old from Woodbury, New Jersey, was taken into custody in the cockpit of his plane. Delta Flight 35 was cancelled after the pilot was found unfit for duty, according to an airline spokesman. The Boeing 767-300 with 196 passengers was bound for Newark.        
	A breath test found he had a blood-alcohol content of 0.023 per cent, a fraction above the legal threshold for intoxication in the Netherlands.        
	The pilot paid a 600 fine and has been suspended for Deltas investigation.        
	Dutch law prohibits flight-crew members from imbibing alcohol within 10 hours of take-off. The aircraft had pulled back from the gate and was en-route to the runway when the police arrived and boarded it.

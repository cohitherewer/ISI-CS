The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | French anger after burger chain bans pork
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      French anger after burger chain bans pork
                            
	Sept. 2: A French fast food chain has fuelled the countrys bitter debate over the influence of Muslim values by banning pig products from its menu.        
	 Quick, the No. 2 burger chain in France after McDonalds, serves halal-only food in 22 of its outlets, targeting the countrys large Muslim population. The bacon has been removed from bacon burgers, replaced by smoked turkey.        
	 Quick claimed sales doubled at restaurants that have tested the concept but the move has opened a new chapter in the debate war over how much society should accommodate Muslim traditions.        
	The French Senate looks set to approve a ban on Islamic face-covering veils such as niqabs or burqas despite Muslim fears the law will stigmatise them.         
	Halal beef must come from a cow that has been killed by a cut to its jugular vein from which all the blood from the carcass is drained.         
	Marine Le Pen, of the far-right National Front party, said Quicks decision was a scandal. Im not Muslim, I dont want this imposed on me, she said.        
	Stephane Gatignon, the mayor of the Paris suburb of Sevran and a member of the environmentalist party Europe Ecologie, says he is worried the Quick in his town will become a Muslims-only hangout, preventing ethnic groups from mingling. The chain launched its halal-only burger restaurants in the middle of Ramazan. Quick says the date was purely a coincidence.        
	Abdel El Machkour, who oversees Quick franchises for the Paris region, said the goal is simply to be able to serve its products to a larger number of people. The fact that we propose this halal food range is not led by any kind of will to segregate a particular community  it is to propose a product range that many clients from all religions can consume.

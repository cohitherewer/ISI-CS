The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Denied pay, attendants pose nude
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Denied pay, attendants pose nude
                            
	Madrid, March 31 (Reuters): Flight attendants owed up to nine months wages by a grounded Spanish airline have posed nude for a calendar to draw attention to their plight, one of the cabin crew turned models said today.        
	The calendar, numerous excerpts of which appeared in the Spanish media, shows the Air Comet attendants, all female, posing provocatively in and outside airline cabins, and in one case on top of a jet turbine. We are just demanding our rights to receive what is ours, we each have eight or nine months of unpaid salaries, attendant Adriana Ricardo said.

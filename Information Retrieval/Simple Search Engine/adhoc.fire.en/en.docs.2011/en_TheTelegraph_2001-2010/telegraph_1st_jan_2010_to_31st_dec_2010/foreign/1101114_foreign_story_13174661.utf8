                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      First Apple PC to be auctioned

	Nov. 13: The first ever Apple computer is expected to fetch up to 150,000 when it is auctioned later this month.        
	 The price is more than any of Apples high-range products.        
	Apple 1, the original computer model hand made by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs will go under the hammer at Christies in London on November 23.         
	The lot comprises a fully assembled motherboard, a handful of extra components including a microprocessor and extra RAM and a letter signed by Jobs, CEO of Apple.        
	The return address in the package is Jobss parents garage where Jobs and Wozniak built the computers.        
	The circuit board, numbered 82, is one of only 200 built before the development of the Apple II, meaning it is unlikely to be one of the first 50 sold to The Byte Shop, an early computer store, according to The Mac Observer.        
	Christies said the Apple 1 is presented in its original packaging  a cardboard box  complete with all documents, manuals and cassette interface.         
	It came without a casing, power supply, keyboard or monitor.         
	Apple 1 was the first personal computer to feature a pre-assembled motherboard, representing a significant step forward from contemporary models which buyers had to solder together.         
	The computers, priced at $666.66, were sold for 15 months before being discontinued in October 1977, and it is estimated that as many as 50 still survive.        
	The computer is part of an auction in London of rare books and manuscripts that will quicken the heart of any rich geek.         
	It includes a book by Charles Babbage, a collection of Alan Turings published papers, an Enigma cypher machine and the patent specifications for an ENIAC, the first electronic digital computer.

                              Spicy star                            
	London, Jan. 30 (PTI): Desparate Housewives star Eva Longoria-Parker claims she does not diet because she enjoys treats heavy in calories, especially Indian cuisine.         
	The 34-year-old star said she watches what she eats but does not stop herself from chomping on her favourite Indian dishes.        
	I am a big eater, but I do watch what I eat. I love to cook. So Id say Mexican food is my secret indulgence. I also love New York pizza and I just love Indian cuisine, the spicier the better, Eva said.         
	The 34-year-old star, who is married to basketball player Tony Parker, owns Mexican eatery Beso in Hollywood and has another restaurant in Las Vegas.         
	Eva also said that she does not do a lot of exercise to retain her sexy trim physique.         
	Its mostly weight training or kick boxing. I have this amazing high for adrenaline. It agrees with me.         
	Your body is a vehicle and you have to take care of that vehicle, she said.

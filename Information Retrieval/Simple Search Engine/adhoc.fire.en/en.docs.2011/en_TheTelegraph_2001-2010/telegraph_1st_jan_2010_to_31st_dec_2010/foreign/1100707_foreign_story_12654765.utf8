	Twitter ban call  
	Amsterdam, July 6 (Reuters) : The busy thumbs of Dutch politicians were silenced on Tuesday after advisers overseeing cabinet formation talks called for a ban on Twitter use during difficult negotiations.  
	Twitter has been a particular favourite of Dutch government officials, mostly notably leaders of the formerly in-power Christian Democrats.  
	Finance minister Jan Kees de Jager had earned a rebuke from the parliament for tweeting too much.

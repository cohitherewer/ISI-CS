	Los Angeles, June 13 (PTI): Hollywood star Matt Damon has reportedly mastered the art of catching a quick nap while standing in between his busy work schedules. Much to the astonishment of onlookers, the Invictus star was found enjoying a quick nap on his feet backstage at a recent childrens fundraiser in Greenwich, the National Enquirer reported.         
	Someone asked him if he was ok and Matt woke up. He explained he recently found out he can nod off on his feet, an onlooker said. His ability to take a nap anywhere could be handy in the future as he is expecting to get even busier in his career.         
	Speaking of his future ambitions, the 39-year-old actor said recently, I want to direct someday and I cant really pass up the chance to work with the people Im getting to work with. Ive worked with Paul Greengrass three times now and Clint Eastwood twice and Steven Soderbergh five or six times, and the Cohen Brothers. As long as that keeps happening, I cant see myself taking time off, unless the work dried up, he said.

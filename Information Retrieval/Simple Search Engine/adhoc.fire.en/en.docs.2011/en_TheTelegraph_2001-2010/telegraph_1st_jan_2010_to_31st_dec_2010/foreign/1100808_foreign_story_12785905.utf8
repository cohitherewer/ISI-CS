                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Castro in rare House appearance
                            
	Havana, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Former Cuban President Fidel Castro addressed a session of the islands parliament for the first time in four years today.        
	Castro, dressed in a long-sleeved green military shirt without rank insignias, was greeted by a standing ovation and shouts of Viva Fidel as he entered the National Assembly. He was helped by aides to walk in.        
	It was the first time that the bearded, historic leader of Cubas revolution, who turns 84 this month, had participated in a public government meeting since 2006, when he fell ill and underwent intestinal surgery. Castro was attending a special assembly session he had requested to debate his warnings that the world is on the brink of a nuclear war.        
	Standing at the podium, Castro read a prepared statement saying that the nuclear confrontation could break out if President Obama ordered an attack on Iran if Tehran resisted efforts to enforce international sanctions against it.        
	 for its nuclear activities.        
	He spoke in a firm, clear but sometimes halting voice.        
	In his 12-minute speech, Castro also referred to the case of one of five convicted Cuban spies jailed in the United States, Gerardo Hernandez, saying he hoped his wife would be allowed to visit him or that he could even be released.        
	In 2008, Fidel Castro formally handed over the presidency of communist-ruled Cuba to his younger brother Raul Castro, who also attended the assembly session.        
	Following his 2006 illness, Fidel Castro disappeared from public view and was only seen occasionally in photographs and videos. But since July 7, he has emerged from four years of seclusion and has made several public appearances.        
	This has ignited widespread speculation that Castro wants to be more active again in the day-to-day life of Cuba.

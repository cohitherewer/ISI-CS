	Kabul, Nov. 22: Natos senior civilian representative in Afghanistan provoked a storm of criticism from childrens advocates today by saying Kabul is relatively safe for children compared to major western cities.        
	The children are probably safer here than they would be in London, New York or Glasgow or many other cities, Mark Sedwill told an interviewer for a BBC childrens television programme, which was broadcast today. Its a very family-orientated society. So it is a little bit like a city of villages.        
	The broadcast, on the BBC childrens programme Newsround, also quoted representatives of groups that champion childrens well-being. Afghanistan is the worst place on earth to be born a child  one in four children living there will die before they reach the age of five, said Justin Forsyth, the head of Save the Children.        
	Christopher Chambers, a spokesman for Sedwill, said the officials remarks had been unfairly mischaracterised.        
	He was speaking in the context of family and children, thats how it was meant. It was about the crime level generally, it wasnt, full stop, children are safer, and it was Kabul, not Afghanistan.        
	Sedwill is an experienced diplomat who served as the British ambassador to Kabul before taking over as Natos top civilian official here in January.        
	He made the comment in response to a question from the shows presenter about reports Newsround had received from Afghan children in Kabul who said they felt unsafe on the streets because of the risk of bombs.

                          Mikhail Pletnev                          
	Bangkok, July 8 (AP): Acclaimed Russian pianist and conductor Mikhail Pletnev has been allowed to leave Thailand after being charged with raping a teenage boy on the condition he return following a concert appearance in Europe, police said today.        
	Pletnev, who was arrested at a restaurant on Monday in the beach town of Pattaya, flew out of the country to Moscow.        
	We expect him to come back (from his European music tour) given that he is famous and that he claims that he is innocent. And since he has hired a legal team, we expect him to come back to fight the case, police Lt. Col. Omsin Sukkanka said.

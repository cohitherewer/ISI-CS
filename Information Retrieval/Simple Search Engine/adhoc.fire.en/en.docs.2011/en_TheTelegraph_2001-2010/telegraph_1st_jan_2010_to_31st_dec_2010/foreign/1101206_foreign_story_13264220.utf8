	Late bloomer    
	 London, Dec. 5 (PTI): Actress Mischa Barton says that she was a late bloomer who was scared of men as a teenager, despite her long list of romances. Barton says that she was nothing like Marissa Cooper, the wild teenager she played in TV drama The OC for three years until 2006, reports Contactmusic.

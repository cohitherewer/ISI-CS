The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nato razes dangerous Afghan homes

	Kandahar, Nov. 17: In the newly won districts around this southern city, American forces are encountering empty homes and farm buildings left so heavily booby-trapped by Taliban insurgents that the Americans have been systematically destroying hundreds of them, according to local Afghan authorities.        
	The campaign, a major departure from Nato practice in past military operations, is intended to reduce civilian and military casualties by removing the threat of booby traps and denying Taliban insurgents hiding places and fighting positions, American military officials said.        
	While it has widespread support among Afghan officials and even some residents, and has been accompanied by an equally determined effort to hand out cash compensation to homeowners, other local people have complained that the demolitions have gone far beyond what is necessary.        
	It would also seem to run counter to Gen. David H. Petraeuss counterinsurgency strategy, which calls for respecting property as well as lives, and to run up against recent calls by President Hamid Karzai for foreign forces to lower their profile and avoid tactics that alienate Afghan civilians.         
	There have been no reports of civilians casualties from the demolitions.        
	General Petraeus, the Nato commander in Afghanistan, has recently pointed to progress in routing the Taliban in Kandahar, thanks to 30,000 additional troops, although the insurgents have countered that they have simply gone into hiding to wait out the American push.        
	What they have left behind are vacant houses and farm buildings so heavily rigged that soldiers have started referring to them as house-borne improvised explosive devices. In recent weeks, using armoured bulldozers, high explosives, missiles and even airstrikes, American troops have taken to destroying hundreds of them, by a conservative estimate, with some estimates running into the thousands.        
	We dont know the accurate number of homes destroyed, but its huge, said Zalmai Ayubi, the spokesman for the Kandahar provincial governor, Tooryalai Wesa, and who with the governor visited on October 21. Its the insurgents and the enemy of the country that are to blame for this destruction, because they have planted mines in civilian houses and main roads everywhere.        
	Lt. Col. Webster Wright, the spokesman for Nato forces in Kandahar, said he did not know how many homes had been destroyed in the campaign, but put the number of deliberate demolitions since September at 174, including homes and other structures.        
	The number seemed well below the destruction indicated by the accounts of local officials.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

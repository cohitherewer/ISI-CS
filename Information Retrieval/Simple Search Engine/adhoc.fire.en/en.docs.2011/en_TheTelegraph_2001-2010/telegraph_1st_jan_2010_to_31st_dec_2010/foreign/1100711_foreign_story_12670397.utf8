                              Cindy Crawford                                   
	London, July 10 (PTI): Supermodel Cindy Crawford, who had once vowed never to go under the knife, says she has experimented with Botox and may also go for plastic surgery.         
	The 44-year-old says she is no longer highbrow about fighting the ageing process.         
	Crawford, who is mother of two children, has used Botox and is open to surgery, the Daily Mail reported.         
	When I was 30 I might have said, Im going to age in a way that honours time and is completely natural. But Im no longer so highbrow about it, she told Ladies Home Journal.         
	Ive tried Botox but it scares me. Plastic surgery is really scary, but as long as you dont use these things to change your face, I think its okay, the star said.         
	The former model says: I dont expect to look the way that I used to. I do have cellulite.        
	However, Crawford insists that age has given her a sense of power which she is not ready to trade for anything.        
	I think Im holding up pretty well, but what I like most is the sense of power I have. So much of your life you spend trying to prove yourself, trying to make things happen, trying to get somewhere else.        
	But then you get into your late 30s and 40s and realise life is pretty amazing right in front of you if you can just be present in it.         
	She says her marriage to nightlife boss Rande Gerber sometimes needed some work: Its OK not to feel happy all the time.

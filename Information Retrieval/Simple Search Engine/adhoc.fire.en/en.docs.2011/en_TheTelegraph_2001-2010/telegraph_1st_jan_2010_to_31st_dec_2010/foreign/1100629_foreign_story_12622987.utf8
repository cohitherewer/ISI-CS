	Washington, June 28 (Reuters): The US Supreme Court today extended gun rights to every state and city in the nation, in a ruling likely to spur new challenges to gun control measures across the US.        
	The 5-4 ruling could ultimately make it easier for individuals to own handguns.        
	Splitting along conservative and liberal lines, the nations highest court extended its landmark 2008 ruling, that individual Americans have a constitutional right to own guns, to all cities and states for the first time.        
	The decision was a setback for Chicagos 28-year-old ban on handguns, which will now face a fresh judicial review and is likely to be eventually overturned. Legal challenges to existing laws restricting gun use in other states and cities are also expected.        
	The right to bear arms, under the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, previously applied to just federal laws and federal enclaves, like Washington DC, where the court struck down a similar handgun ban in its 2008 ruling.        
	Gun rights has been one of the countrys most divisive social, political and legal issues. Some 90 million people in the US have an estimated 200 million guns.        
	The US is estimated to have the worlds highest civilian gun ownership rate. Gun deaths average about 80 a day, 34 of them homicides, according to US government statistics.        
	The ruling, issued on the last day of the Supreme Courts term, was a victory for four Chicago-area residents, two gun rights groups and the politically powerful National Rifle Association.        
	It was a defeat for Chicago, which defended its law as a reasonable exercise of local power to protect public safety.        
	The law. and a similar handgun ban in suburban Oak Park, Illinois, were the nations most restrictive gun control measures.        
	We hold that the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the states, Justice Samuel Alito concluded for the court majority.

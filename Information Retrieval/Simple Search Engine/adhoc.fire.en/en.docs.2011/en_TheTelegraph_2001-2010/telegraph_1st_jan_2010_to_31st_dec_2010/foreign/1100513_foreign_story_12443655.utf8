	May 12: Apple will release a software update to address Wi-Fi problems with the iPad        
	Apple has confirmed that it will issue a software patch to resolve ongoing issues with Wi-Fi connectivity on the iPad.         
	Hundreds of iPad owners in the US have complained about weak Wi-Fi signals and dropped connections. The iPad sometimes refuses to automatically rejoin authorised networks, they said.        
	Apple said that the problems affected a very small number of iPad users, but has pledged to issue a software update to deal with the glitch. A release date has not yet been given.

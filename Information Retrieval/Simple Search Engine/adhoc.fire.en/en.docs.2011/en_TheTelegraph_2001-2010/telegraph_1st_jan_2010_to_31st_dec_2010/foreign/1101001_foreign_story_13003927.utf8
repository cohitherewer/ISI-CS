	Islamabad, Sept. 30 (Reuters): Pakistani authorities blocked a vital supply route for Nato troops fighting in Afghanistan today, angered by a cross-border Nato airstrike that killed three Pakistani soldiers, officials said.        
	Trucks and fuel tankers for foreign forces in Afghanistan were stopped at Torkham border post in Khyber tribal region near Peshawar, hours after the raid, the fourth reported by Pakistani authorities in recent days.        
	Yes, the Nato supplies have been stopped. It has been done locally, a senior security official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Early today, two Nato helicopters from Afghanistan attacked a border village in the Kurram region, a Pakistani official said.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Indian mom tosses baby into Hudson
                            
	New York, May 15 (PTI): A mother of Indian origin threw her 19-month-old daughter into the chilly Hudson river and then jumped in herself to get back at her husband, prosecutors said today.        
	The baby, Jessica Prithviraj, was in critical condition and had to be taken to a trauma centre in Manhattan. The mother was identified as 33-year-old Devi Silvia. Other than the toddler, Silvia has another child.        
	She said she was sad and lonely and angry at her husband and that she did this horrific act on purpose, Assistant District-Attorney Robert Hettleman was quoted as saying by the New York Post.        
	She made clear that she threw her baby into the freezing river in order to get back at her husband, he said, arguing successfully that the mother be held without bail.         
	Prithviraj was blue and motionless when rescuers plucked her and Silvia from the roughly 10 degrees Celsius water, Hettleman said. He said the child was in a stable condition yesterday.         
	Silvia had told family members that she was desperate to take the child back to India, Hettleman said. The family had been in the US only a few years and, in that period, had travelled, for the husbands job, to Chicago, California and New York.        
	The Tamil-speaking Silvia was told that prosecutors would seek to indict her on an attempted-murder charge for her plunge on Tuesday off an Upper West Side pier in New York.        
	Silvia was told of her charges through a Tamil interpreter at a Manhattan court arraignment conducted via a video link to a conference room at Elmhurst Hospital, where she was being held in a psychiatric ward.

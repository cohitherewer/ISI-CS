The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hands off? Not so fast, minister
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hands off? Not so fast, minister

	Jakarta, Nov. 10: A conservative Muslim government minister admits he shook hands with First Lady Michelle Obama in welcoming her to Indonesia but says it was not his choice.         
	Footage on YouTube shows otherwise, sparking a debate that has lit up Facebook and Twitter.        
	I tried to prevent (being touched) with my hands but Mrs Michelle held her hands too far toward me (so) we touched, information minister Tifatul Sembiring told tens of thousands of followers on Twitter. While Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world, the vast majority practice a moderate form of the faith. But Sembiring has flaunted his conservatism and says he avoids contact with women who are not related to him.        
	 The minister was among the dignitaries in a receiving line that greeted President Barack Obama and his wife as they arrived in Jakarta today  a homecoming of sorts for the President who spent part of his childhood here.         
	Indonesians gathered around television sets across the country to watch the American President touch down. Children at the school he attended practiced a song dedicated to him just in case he visited. In footage of the official welcome, Sembiring appeared to share his countrymens enthusiasm. He smiled broadly as he shook the Presidents hand and then reached with both hands to grasp Michelle Obamas. But later he said she forced their contact.        
	His denial was in a response to tweets from Indonesians who noted the handshake and questioned his long-standing claims that, as a good Muslim, he restricts his contact with women. Many posts had a gotcha quality to them. One female journalist  who said the minister had refused to shake her hand  gleefully noted that now he would no longer be able to wriggle out of it. Sembiring has often tweeted controversial comments, including blaming natural disasters on a lack of morality and joking about AIDS.

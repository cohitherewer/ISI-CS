          HENRY SAMUEL                              
	Paris, March 27: Thrill-seekers in France unimpressed by skydiving, rock-climbing and other extreme sports are turning to a controversial new way of testing their limits  designer kidnapping.        
	For 1,000, customers of Ultime Ralit, a company in Besanon, eastern France, can buy a basic abduction package in which they are seized by strangers, bundled into a car bound and gagged, and kept in a dank cellar for four hours. If that sounds too tame, boat chases and helicopter escapes can be added to the tailor-made experience, and customers kept for longer periods, depending on the budget.        
	 You will go through the real sensations of violence, terror and fear of a real kidnapping  a psychological shock that you wont forget in a hurry, promises the companys website.        
	Customers explain exactly what they want and once the scenario is established, they sign a contract and liability waiver, but have no idea exactly when or where their abductors will strike.        
	We follow you for a few days. At an opportune moment, in the street or elsewhere, we kidnap you, the contract stipulates.        
	Georges Cexus, 28, launched Ultime Ralit in January and says it is already receiving two orders a day, mainly from top-level executives. He said the maximum incarceration time was 11 hours, after which the novelty may start to wear off.         
	Crexus said nobody was ever physically hurt during the kidnappings. Thats not part of the plan, he told Est Rpublicain, a local daily.

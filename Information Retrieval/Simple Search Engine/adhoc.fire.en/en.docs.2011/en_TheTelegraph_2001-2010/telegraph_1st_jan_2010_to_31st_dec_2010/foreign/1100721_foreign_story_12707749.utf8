          ANDREW HOUGH                          Anna Chapman                                  
	July 20: One of the worlds leading pornography producers has approached Anna Chapman, the Russian spy, to star in an adult movie.        
	Vivid Entertainment, which claims it makes adult movies with high profile celebrities, has approached the sultry redhead because executives believe she is the hottest spy weve seen in years.        
	Chapman, 28, who was married to a British man Alex Chapman and lived in London for several years, was expelled from the US earlier this month in the biggest spy swap since the Cold War. Since the case emerged semi-nude pictures of Chapman and stories of her racy romances have been published all over the world.        
	In a letter sent to Chapmans US-based lawyer Robert Baum yesterday, Steven Hirsch, the Los Angeles-based president of Vivid Entertainment, said he wanted to make a movie with her.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

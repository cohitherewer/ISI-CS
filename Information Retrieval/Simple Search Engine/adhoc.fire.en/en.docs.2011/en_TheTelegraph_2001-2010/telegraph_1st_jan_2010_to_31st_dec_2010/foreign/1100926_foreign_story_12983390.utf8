The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ed Miliband wins Labour race
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Ed Miliband wins Labour race
          AMIT ROY                      Ed Miliband (left) with his brother David in Manchester on Saturday. (AP)                          
	London, Sept. 25: A new version of the Ramayana was played out in Britain today with Lakshman slaying elder brother Ram  with a little help from Raavan  to seize the crown.        
	 For Raavan, read Britains Left-wing trade union bosses and readers in India will have an explanation for why Ed Miliband, 40, beat his elder brother, David Miliband, 44, by a knife edge majority of 50.65 per cent to 49.35 per cent  a margin of only 1.3 per cent  to become the new leader of the Labour Party.        
	 As the result was announced today live on television from a gathering of the party faithful in Manchester, David got up and gave his younger brother a hug but not everyone is certain whether the grievous family wounds will ever heal. It is a situation with which Mukesh and Anil Ambani, for example, would be familiar.        
	 Ed succeeds Gordon Brown who led Labour to defeat at the last general election in May, 2010, after three successive wins under Tony Blair.        
	 A union chief, Tony Woodley, joint leader of Unite, hailed Eds triumph as a clear sign that the party wants change. His victory, coming from nowhere a few months ago, is a clear sign that the party wants change, to move on from New Labour and reconnect with working people.        
	 But an Indian David Miliband supporter, who probably expressed what might be the broad view of the British people, told The Telegraph: Todays result consigns Labour to 10 years in opposition.        
	 This analysis may prove to unduly pessimistic for those who want the re-election of a Labour government but the choice of Ed over David does suggest that trade union leaders want to take the party back to the earlier socialist model that was discarded for Blairs centrist New Labour.        
	 Ed has become leader after serving one term as an MP. He and David, both born in London, are the sons of Polish Jewish immigrants Marion Kozak and the late Marxist intellectual Ralph Miliband (a Brussels native whose parents were from Warsaw), who fled Belgium during World War II. Ralph was a friend of Amartya Sen.        
	 Edward Samuel Miliband (born 24 December 1969) went to Haverstock Comprehensive School in the Chalk Farm area of north London  just like David. After completing his A Levels, he read PPE at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, gaining a BA  again just like David. Ed then studied Economics at the LSE where he obtained an MSc. He was elected Labour MP for Doncaster North in 2005 and served in the cabinet from 2007 to 2010 as energy and climate change secretary.        
	 David has had much greater experience of government, having held three ministerial positions, including foreign secretary. At one point, he was urged to challenge Brown for the Labour leadership but chose not to do so  a decision he may now regret with the benefit of hindsight.         
	 He may serve as shadow foreign secretary under his brother for now but some of his friends think David will eventually seek a new life outside politics.        
	 David may have paid the price for his closeness to Blair, a former prime minister now seen as someone who had a huge mistake by taking Britain to war against Iraq.        
	 The Labour Party used a complicated system of voting under which three other candidates, Ed Balls, Andy Burnham  they had served as schools and health ministers under Brown  and Diane Abbott, a black woman, were eliminated in three rounds of voting before the winner was chosen in the fourth and final one.        
	 David won the first three rounds but the overwhelming support of hard left trade union leaders enabled Ed to pip his brother to the post in the closing stage.        
	 In a speech immediately after being declared leader, Ed said: I am proud of the leadership of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown but we lost the election and lost it badly. My message to the country is this  I know we lost trust, I know we lost touch, I know we need to change. Today, a new generation has taken charge of Labour  a new generation that understands the call to change.        
	 The new generation of Labour leaders has no link with India, either the old or the new. This withered probably with the passing of Michael Foot.         
	 As he faces David Cameron in the Commons, the new Labour leader will have to shake off the tag of a Red Ed controlled, like a puppet, by trade union bosses.

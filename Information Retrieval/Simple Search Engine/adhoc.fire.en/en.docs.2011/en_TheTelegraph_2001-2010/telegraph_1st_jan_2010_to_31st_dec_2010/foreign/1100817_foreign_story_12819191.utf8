The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Robert Gates plans to retire next year
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Robert Gates plans to retire next year
                                  
	Washington, Aug. 16 (Reuters): US defence secretary Robert Gates, a driving force behind both the Afghan war plan and in overhauling the Pentagons finances, said in an interview published today that he aims to retire next year.        
	But his press secretary Geoff Morrell shot down suggestions that Gates announced his retirement to Foreign Policy magazine, saying it was nothing more than musings over a wish to quit, which the US defence chief has done before. I think that it would be a mistake to wait until January 2012, Gates was quoted as telling the magazine in an article published on its website.         
	This is not the kind of job you want to fill in the spring of an election year, added Gates, who is also in the midst of a major budgetary overhaul of the Pentagon.        
	But Morrell sounded a cautionary note when asked to comment: Dont get carried away. This is not Bob Gates announcing he is stepping down. This is somebody who has been a failure at retirement.        
	All he was doing here was expressing the logic about leaving with enough time on the clock for the president to backfill him, he told Reuters.         
	That Gates would like to leave should not come as news to anybody.

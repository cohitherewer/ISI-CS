The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban flee bases in Kandahar

	Arghandab (Afghanistan), Oct. 21: American and Afghan forces have been routing the Taliban in much of Kandahar province in recent weeks, forcing many hardened fighters, faced with the buildup of American forces, to flee strongholds they have held for years, Nato commanders, local Afghan officials and residents of the region said.        
	A series of civilian and military operations around the strategic southern province, made possible after a force of 12,000 American and Nato troops reached full strength here in the late summer, has persuaded Afghan and western officials that the Taliban will have a hard time returning to areas they had controlled in the province that was their base.        
	Some of the gains seem to have come from a new mobile rocket that has pinpoint accuracy  like a small cruise missile  and has been used against the hideouts of insurgent commanders around Kandahar.         
	That has forced many of them to retreat across the border into Pakistan. Disruption of their supply lines has made it harder for them to stage retaliatory strikes or suicide bombings, at least for the moment, officials said.        
	Nato commanders are careful not to overstate their successes  they acknowledge they made that mistake earlier in the year when they undertook a high-profile operation against Marja that did not produce lasting gains. But they say they are making deliberate progress and have seized the initiative from the insurgents.        
	Western and Afghan civilian officials are more outspoken, saying that heavy losses for the Taliban have sapped the momentum the insurgency had in the area. Unlike the Marja operation, they say, the one in Kandahar is a comprehensive civil and military effort that is changing the public mood as well as improving security. We now have the initiative. We have created momentum, said Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, the British commander of the Nato coalition forces in southern Afghanistan, who has overseen the Kandahar operation for the last year. It is everything put together in terms of the effort that has gone in over the last 18 months and it is undoubtedly having an impact.        
	Nato forces have experienced setbacks in other parts of Afghanistan, and some military officials say the advances in Kandahar may not represent a turning point in the overall war effort. The Taliban, for example, have surprised the Americans by asserting control over some areas in the northern part of Afghanistan, from which they had once been almost entirely eliminated.        
	But Kandahar represents the heartland of the Taliban insurgency and is the main focus of the large influx of American troops and Afghan government forces. Afghans will tell you, if you have a peaceful Kandahar, you will have a peaceful Afghanistan, General Carter said.

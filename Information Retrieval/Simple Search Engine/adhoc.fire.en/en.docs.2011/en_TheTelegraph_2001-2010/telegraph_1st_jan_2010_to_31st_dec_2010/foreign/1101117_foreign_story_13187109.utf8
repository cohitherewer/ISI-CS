	Jackson single    
	 New York, Nov. 16 (Reuters): The first official single from a controversial new Michael Jackson album was released yesterday to good initial reviews and expectations of strong digital sales.      
	Hold My Hand, a duet Jackson first recorded with Senegalese rapper and record producer Akon in 2007, is a simple but catchy mid-tempo ballad with touches that will remind fans of Jacksons death last year with the opening line: This life dont last forever. Early reviews commended the duet.

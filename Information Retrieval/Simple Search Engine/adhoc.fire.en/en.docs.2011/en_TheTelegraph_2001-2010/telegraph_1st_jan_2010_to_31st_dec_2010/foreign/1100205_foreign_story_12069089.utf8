	Sydney, Feb. 4 (Reuters): An online campaign has started to save the job of an Australian banker who became an Internet sensation after he was caught on live television viewing images of scantily clad supermodel Miranda Kerr on his computer.        
	The financial website Here is the City News (http://news.hereisthecity.com/) has set up a Save Dave page that encourages readers to save banker David Kielys job. The Web campaign lists four reasons for Kiely to keep his job: he seems like a nice bloke; the pictures were not hardcore; he has suffered enough, and theres just too much political correctness.

	Karachi, Feb. 5 (Reuters): A suspected suicide bomber on a motorcycle killed 12 Shias in Karachi today, followed hours later by a blast at a hospital where the wounded were being treated which killed 13 people.        
	 In scenes that have become familiar in the states battle with the Pakistani Taliban, the second blast sent a plume of white smoke above Jinnah Hospital as distraught Pakistanis transported dead relatives. The bomb, which wounded 100, blew clothes and sandals off bodies near ambulances. A teenage girl wept over what appeared to be a female relative whose stomach was shredded by shrapnel.        
	Provincial health minister Saghir Ahmed said 15 people were in critical condition. It (the explosion) happened right in the middle of ambulances, Reuters reporter Augustine Anthony said of the second blast.        
	There were conflicting reports on the causes of the blasts, with some police officials saying it was suicide bombers on motorcycles and others saying the bombs were planted. Its not clear whether the attack was meant to trigger sectarian violence or create the impression that the government was incapable of stabilising nuclear-armed Pakistan.        
	Police said they defused a bomb in the premises of the Karachi hospital treating the victims of the blast. The bomb was planted in a television set and we successfully defused it, said senior police officer Ghulam Nabi Memon.        
	A woman was calling me at the emergency ward, when the blast went off outside and then it was all darkness, said Seemi Jamali, a senior emergency room doctor recalling the explosion. There was absolute chaos and people ran out of hospital from whichever door they could access.        
	The violence shook Karachi, a city of around 18 million, as questions are being asked about the fate of Pakistan Taliban leader Hakimullah Meshud, who was wounded after a US drone aircraft strike in the northwest of the country in December. The killers and murderers must be brought to justice and given exemplary punishment; they will be, said Zardari.        
	The attacks had all the trademarks of the Taliban. Raja Umer Khattab, a senior police officer, said initial investigations suggested an al Qaida-linked group was responsible. I came here with my two brothers to see our ailing cousin. Now they are missing. I dont know where they are, Meena, a 10-year-old girl, said at the hospital.

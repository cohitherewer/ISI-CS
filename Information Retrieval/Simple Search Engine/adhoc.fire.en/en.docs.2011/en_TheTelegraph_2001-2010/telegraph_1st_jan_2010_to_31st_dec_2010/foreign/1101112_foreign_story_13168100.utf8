	London, Nov. 11: A day after violent protests against government proposals to cut education spending and steeply increase tuition for university students, the government unveiled proposals today for welfare reforms that could penalise Britons deemed to be work-shy and stir further resistance.        
	In one particularly contentious proposal, the welfare reform advocated a system of punishments that could strip unemployed people of a $100-per-week job seekers allowance for up to three years if they turn down three offers of work  a proposal that drew protests from civic groups. Some economists called the sanctions the most harsh imposed by a British government. Changes to the benefits system proposed today will expose people to the risk of destitution, said Kate Wareing from Oxfam. Removing benefits and leaving people with no income will result in extreme hardship for them and their families.        
	In parliament, Iain Duncan Smith, the minister for works and pensions, said he planned reforms to provide a single, universal payment to replace around 30 different forms of housing, unemployment and tax credits supposed to help jobless and disabled people.        
	There will be no losers, he said. Referring to some 4.5 million people who were receiving unemployment benefits even before the global economic crisis, he said that the British population included a group of people who have been left behind, even in periods of growth. Like the proposed cuts in education spending, the welfare measures are part of a vast austerity programme announced by the coalition government of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.

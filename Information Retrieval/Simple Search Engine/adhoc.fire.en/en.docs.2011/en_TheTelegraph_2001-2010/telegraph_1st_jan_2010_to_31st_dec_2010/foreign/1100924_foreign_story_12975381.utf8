	Beijing, Sept. 23: For the last several years, one big theme has dominated talk of the future of Asia: As China rises, its neighbours are being inevitably drawn into its orbit, currying favour with the regions new hegemonic power.        
	The presumed loser, of course, is the US, whose wealth and influence are being spent on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and whose economic troubles have eroded its standing in a more dynamic Asia.        
	But rising frictions between China and its neighbours in recent weeks over security issues have handed the US an opportunity to reassert itself  one the Obama administration has been keen to take advantage of.        
	Washington is leaping into the middle of heated territorial disputes between China and southeast Asian nations despite stern Chinese warnings that it mind its own business.         
	The US is carrying out naval exercises with South Korea in order to help Seoul rebuff threats from North Korea even though China is denouncing those exercises, saying that they intrude on areas where the Chinese military operates.        
	Meanwhile, Chinas increasingly tense standoff with Japan over a Chinese fishing trawler captured by Japanese ships in disputed waters is pushing Japan back under the American security umbrella.        
	The arena for these struggles is shifting this week to a summit meeting of world leaders at the UN. Wen Jiabao, the Chinese Prime Minister, has refused to meet his Japanese counterpart, Naoto Kan, and on Tuesday he threatened Japan with further action if it did not unconditionally release the fishing captain. The US has been smart, said Carlyle A. Thayer, a professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy. It has done well by coming to the assistance of countries in the region.        
	All across the board, China is seeing the atmospherics change tremendously, he added. The idea of the China threat, thanks to its own efforts, is being revived.        
	Asserting Chinese sovereignty over borderlands in contention  everywhere from Tibet to Taiwan to the South China Sea  has long been the top priority for Chinese nationalists, an obsession that overrides all other concerns.         
	But this complicates Chinas attempts to present the countrys rise as a boon for the whole region and creates wedges between China and its neighbours. Nothing underscores that better than the escalating diplomatic conflict between China and Japan over the detention of the Chinese fishing captain, Zhan Qixiong, by the Japanese authorities, who say the captain rammed two Japanese vessels around the Senkaku or Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea.         
	The islands are administered by Japan but claimed by both Japan and China.        
	The current dispute may strengthen the military alliance between the US and Japan, as did an incident last April when a Chinese helicopter buzzed a Japanese destroyer.         
	Such confrontations tend to remind Japanese officials, who have suggested that they need to refocus their foreign policy on China instead of America, that they rely on the US to balance an unpredictable China, analysts say.        
	Japan will have no choice but to further go into Americas arms, to further beef up the US-Japan alliance and its military power, said Huang Jing, a scholar of the Chinese military at the National University of Singapore.        
	In July, southeast Asian nations, particularly Vietnam, applauded when secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton said that the US was willing to help mediate a solution to disputes that those nations had with China over the South China Sea, which is rich in oil, natural gas and fish.         
	China insists on dealing with southeast Asian nations one on one, but Clinton said the US supported multilateral talks. Freedom of navigation in the sea is an American national interest, she said.        
	Exports blocked        
	The Chinese government has blocked exports to Japan of a crucial category of minerals used in products like hybrid cars, wind turbines and guided missiles, sharply raising the stakes in the dispute.

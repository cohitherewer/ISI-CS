The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Smooth Camerons tough task
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Smooth Camerons tough task
          SARAH LYALL      
	London, May 12: The Conservative Party that David Cameron inherited in 2005 was a disoriented shadow of its once mighty self, riven by ideological disarray, wounded by endless power struggles and facing the bleak prospect of long-term unelectability.        
	As leader, the smooth, self-assured Cameron, who became Britains new Prime Minister yesterday, moved swiftly to weed out the old guard, replacing the partys mean-spirited image with a kinder, more socially progressive philosophy that he called compassionate Conservatism. That he succeeded is a reflection of his toughness, acumen and resolve.        
	He will need those qualities now. As Prime Minister in charge of Britains first coalition government in 65 years, Cameron will have to contend not only with the tensions within his own party, but also with the duelling demands of his Liberal Democratic partners. He will also face an electorate likely to respond unhappily to the deep and painful budget cuts the government will need to impose to fix Britains ailing finances.        
	Its going to be a very interesting and hairy ride, said Steven Fielding, director of the Centre for British Politics at Nottingham University.         
	Weve got a set of politicians who arent used to coalition government and who are going to have to learn on the job, in the midst of one of the worst economic crises weve ever lived through.        
	One thing Cameron does have is flexibility, said Peter Snowdon, author of Back From the Brink: The Inside Story of the Tory Resurrection.        
	Hes more pragmatic than ideological, Snowdon said. Hes not a strong-conviction politician the way Margaret Thatcher was. In many ways, hes an old-fashioned conservative with a small c. He was brought up in rural England and he considers things like family life and the state of the British union very important.        
	David William Donald Cameron was born on October 9, 1966, which makes him, at 43, the youngest Prime Minister since the 2nd Earl of Liverpool ran the government in the early 19th century.         
	Likeable, quick on his feet, informal, self-assured, his easy charm a vivid contrast to the tortured intensity of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Cameron seemed at times to be gliding into power.        
	The third of four children, Cameron had a privileged childhood in a small Berkshire village. His father, Ian, a stockbroker and the chairman of the London gentlemens club Whites, met personal adversity  badly deformed legs that have since been amputated  with old-fashioned British perseverance.        
	My father always used to say that nothing in life is fair, but both he and mum were very much of the view that you had to muck in and get on with things and deal with the difficult stuff that comes your way, Cameron said.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Rampage in US over cooked eggs
                            
	Jackson, US, Sept. 12 (AP): A man facing eviction over his hostile temper became enraged by how his wife cooked his eggs and killed her, his stepdaughter and three neighbours with a shotgun before shooting himself.         
	Trooper Jody Sims of the Kentucky State Police said 47-year-old Stanley Neace killed the five people in two mobile homes in rural eastern Kentucky around 11.30am local time yesterday, then went to his home and turned the gun on himself.         
	Neighbours in the roadside mobile home park said Neace stormed across the lawns of about seven homes in his pajamas and fired dozens of shots from a 12-gauge pump shotgun.         
	Sims said that when state police arrived about an hour after the gunfire began, they heard a single gunshot and found Neaces body on the porch in the unincorporated community of Mount Carmel in Breathitt County. The county is home to about 16,000 people.         
	Sherri Anne Robinson, a relative of two of the victims, said witnesses to the shootings told her that Neace became enraged when his wife did not cook his breakfast to his liking.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hollywood to be covered
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hollywood to be covered
          NICK ALLEN                          Under threat                                  
	Los Angeles, Feb. 10: A conservation group is planning to cover the iconic Hollywood sign with a giant shroud that will read Save The Peak.        
	The Public Trust For Lands group want to preserve Cahuenga Peak, which sits next to the world famous 450 feet-long sign.        
	It has secured an option to buy the rugged 138-acre peak area for about $12 million to stop luxury homes being built there. The plan to cover the Hollywood sign with the banner is part of an attempt to raise the money it needs to buy the land and may happen as soon as tomorrow.        
	Tim Ahern, a spokesman for the group, said it was still waiting for final permission from city authorities and the Hollywood Sign Trust.        
	But the Los Angeles Police Department has already sent out a community alert to Hollywood residents telling them to not be alarmed when the sign is covered.        
	It suggested the sign would be covered tomorrow until further notice.        
	The police alert said the sign will remain in place and there will be no changes done to the sign while it is covered. A police spokesman said the alert was so we do not receive phone calls from worried citizens.        
	Cahuenga Peak was put on the market two years ago by Chicago-based Fox River Financial Resources and the conservationists fear it will be bought by a developer who would erect buildings on it.              
	They have until April 14 to raise enough money to buy the land and are believed to already be half way there.        
	The sage-covered peak area, which begins just beside the quot;H quot; of the Hollywood sign, was once owned by the reclusive billionaire industrialist and film producer Howard Hughes.        
	He planned to build a love nest there for the actress Ginger Rogers.        
	It was bought by Fox River from Hughes estate in 2002.        
	Los Angeles officials and Hollywood residents are also against building on the site, partly because it would ruin spectacular panoramic views of the city.        
	Local councilman Tom LaBonge, whose district includes Cahuenga Peak, said: quot;The city of Los Angeles wants to acquire this land, not only to maintain the view of the Hollywood sign, but also to preserve open space, hiking trails and wildlife corridors for the future health of our great city. quot;        
	Donations to the fund to buy the land include $1 million (600,000) from jeweller Tiffany amp; Co.        
	Tiffany chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Kowalski said: quot;The Hollywood sign cannot be separated from its untrammeled setting of hiking trails and wildlife corridors.        
	 quot;Preserving both means that future generations may gaze on this parkland and know the California frontier before freeways. quot;              THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

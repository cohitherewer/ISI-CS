The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Michelle faces flak for trip to Spain
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Michelle faces flak for trip to Spain
          PETER BAKER AND RAPHAEL MINDER                          Michelle in Ronda, southern Spain, on Saturday. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Aug. 7: Theres nothing like a little Mediterranean beach vacation to unwind.         
	Unless, that is, you happen to travel with dozens of Secret Service agents, trailed by photographers and dogged by controversy.        
	Michelle Obama hoped to enjoy a quiet summer break in southern Spain with her younger daughter and a few friends. But the Andalusian getaway has gotten away from her as the European media document her every flamenco dance step and critics back home question such a lavish vacation  one that involves some taxpayer money  in a time of austerity.        
	As Michelle Obama and her entourage arrived yesterday in a 13-car motorcade at a beach club with a stretch of sand cleared by security and police boats hovering off the shore, the blogosphere has been filled with commentary about a tone-deaf trip in the same week the US government reported the loss of another 131,000 jobs. A modern-day Marie Antoinette, scolded a New York Daily News columnist.        
	The White House silently endured the criticism, reluctant to discuss the First Ladys trip. The only official comment came from Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, at a briefing last week when he said that Michelle Obama is a private citizen and is the mother of a daughter on a private trip. And I think Id leave it at that.        
	Privately, officials note that the First Lady is paying for her own room, food and transportation, and the friends she brought will pay for theirs as well. The government picks up the cost of security and the Secret Service, not the First Lady, determines the extent needed to protect her.        
	Officials said some reports of the trip have been exaggerated. Michelle Obama is not travelling with 40 friends, one official said, but with two friends and four of their daughters, as well as a couple of aides and a couple of advance staff members. The staff is with her because she will pay a courtesy call on King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofa on the island of Majorca tomorrow before flying home to Washington.        
	Every First Lady in modern times flies government planes with a sizeable security detail, and it is hard to pinpoint the cost to taxpayers.         
	The Air Force jet she flew costs $11,351 per hour to operate, according to several reports, meaning a 14-hour round trip would cost nearly $160,000. The First Lady would reimburse only the equivalent of first-class commercial tickets for herself and her daughter Sasha the rest of the seats being occupied mainly by Secret Service.         
	Laura Bush took vacations without her husband each year of George W. Bushs presidency, likewise travelling with her Secret Service detail on a government plane.

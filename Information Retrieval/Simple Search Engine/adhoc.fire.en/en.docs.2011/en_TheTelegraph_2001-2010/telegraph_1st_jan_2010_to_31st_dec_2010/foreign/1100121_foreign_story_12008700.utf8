	Port-au-Prince, Jan. 20 (Reuters): A strong aftershock struck Haiti today, creating panic among people camping out in the capitals streets after last weeks devastating earthquake.        
	The 6.1 aftershock rattled already shattered buildings but there were no immediate reports of damage from the tremor, which struck after daybreak. Fearing damage from aftershocks, thousands of people have been sleeping in streets in Port-au-Prince since the January 12 earthquake.        
	The US Geological Survey said todays tremor was centered 42km west-northwest of Jacmel.        
	Fears of violence and looting have eased in Haiti as US troops provided security for water and food aid deliveries, and thousands of displaced Haitians heeded the governments advice to seek shelter outside Port-au-Prince.        
	Medical care, handling of corpses, shelter, water, food and sanitation remain the priorities for the international operations.

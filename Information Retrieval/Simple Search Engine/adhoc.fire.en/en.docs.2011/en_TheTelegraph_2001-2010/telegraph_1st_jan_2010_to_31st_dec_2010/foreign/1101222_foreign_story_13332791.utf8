	Tokyo, Dec. 21 (AP): A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.4 has struck in the Pacific Ocean off southern Japan.        
	Japans Meteorological Agency has issued a tsunami warning from the quake, which occurred about 130km off the southern coast of Chichi Island in the Pacific Ocean. The offshore quake struck at around 1720GMT at the depth of 10km.        
	The agency issued a tsunami alert of up to 2 metres for nearby islands and warnings of milder tsunami for the southern coasts on the main Japanese island.        
	 A minor swelling of waves of about 30cm was observed on the islands shorelines about 40 minutes after the quake, the agency said.        
	There was no immediate report of any damage or injuries. It shook quite violently. Im sure everyone was scared, said Kenji Komura, principal at a high school on the island. He rushed to school, where about 20 students gathered to take refuge. Despite the shaking, nothing fell on the floor or got damaged at school, Komura said.        
	About 170 people evacuated to several community centres and school buildings on the Chichi and nearby Haha islands, public broadcaster NHK said.         
	Tomoo Yamawaki, a fisheries cooperative official on the Chichi island, said he has observed no signifi- cant swelling of the waves so far.        
	Weve taken all fishing boats on the island off coast to protect them from the tsunami, said Yamawaki, who is in charge of community tsunami broadcast, told NHK.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | American hunting Osama held in Pak

	Peshawar, June 15 (AP): An American armed with a pistol and a 102-cm sword who was detained in northern Pakistan told investigators he was on a solo mission to kill Osama bin Laden, a police officer said today.        
	 The man, identified as 52-year-old Californian construction worker Gary Brooks Faulkner, said he wanted to cross over into the Afghan province of Nuristan because he had heard bin Laden was living there, according to officer Mumtaz Ahmad Khan.        
	Faulkner was picked up in a forest in the Chitral region late on Sunday, he said.        
	We initially laughed when he told us that he wanted to kill Osama bin Laden, said Khan. But he said when officers seized the pistol, the sword, a dagger and night-vision equipment, our suspicion grew.        
	 He was questioned today by intelligence officials in Peshawar, the main northwestern city.        
	Faulkner told police he visited Pakistan seven times, and this was his third trip to Chitral, which is a mountainous region that attracts adventurous western tourists and hikers. Unlike much of northwestern Pakistan, it is considered relatively safe for foreigners.        
	Chitral and Nuristan are among several rumoured hiding places for the al Qaida leader, who has evaded a massive US effort to capture him since 2001. The focus of that hunt has been along the Afghan-Pakistan border.        
	Bin Laden is accused of being behind the September 11 attacks on the US, as well other terrorist acts. Washington has offered a bounty of $25 million for information leading to his capture.        
	 Khan said Faulkner was also carrying a book containing Christian verses and teachings.        
	When asked why he thought he had a chance of tracing bin Laden, Faulkner replied: God is with me, and I am confident I will be successful in killing him, said Khan.         
	Faulkner arrived in the Chitrali town of Bumburate on June 3 and stayed in a hotel there.        
	He was assigned a police guard, as is quite common for foreigners visiting remote parts of Pakistan. When he checked out without informing police, officers began hunting for him, said Khan.        
	US embassy spokesman Richard Snelsire said the mission had received notification from Pakistani officials that an American citizen had been arrested. He said embassy officials were trying to meet the man and confirm his identity.        
	The daily Dawn newspaper today said Faulkner acknowledged to police that he wanted to decapitate Osama bin Laden.        
	If confirmed, this would mark one of the first instances of an American entering Pakistan and Afghanistan on his own to fight against al Qaida and other militants.        
	An intelligence official in Chitral, who asked not to be identified, said Faulkner shouted: Dont come closer to me or Ill open fire! when approached.        
	He says that he is a kidney patient. He was also carrying medicines for kidney and blood pressure treatment, Mumtaz Ahmed, a senior police investigator, said.        
	Faulkner said he was hunting bin Laden because he suffered personal losses in the 9/11 terror attacks. He was airlifted from Chitral to Peshawar today.

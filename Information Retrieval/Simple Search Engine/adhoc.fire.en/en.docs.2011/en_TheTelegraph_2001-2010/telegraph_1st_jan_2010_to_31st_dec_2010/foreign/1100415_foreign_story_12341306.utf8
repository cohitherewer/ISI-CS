	San Francisco, April 14 (Reuters): Microblogging sensation Twitter has signed up more than 100 million users and hopes to snag hundreds of millions more in coming years by making the service easier and more accessible on mobile devices like cellphones.        
	At the companys first conference for Twitter developers today, Chief Executive Officer Evan Williams said generating revenue was among the key priorities going forward  a change of tone for a firm that had previously said it focused mainly on improving the user experience.        
	The comments come a day after Twitter rolled out a new advertising programme dubbed Promoted Tweets, its first attempt to make money from its service.        
	Williams cited improvements to Twitters infrastructure, its ease of use and its ability to serve up Twitter messages by relevance, instead of simply in chronological order, as other key priorities.        
	Twitter is one of the Webs most popular social networking services, along with Facebook and LinkedIn.

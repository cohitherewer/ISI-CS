	Washington, Oct. 8 (Reuters): President Barack Obamas national security adviser James Jones is resigning and will be replaced by his deputy Tom Donilon, a senior administration official said today.        
	Jones, the point person for co-ordinating foreign policy advice to Obama, had been expected to leave his post by the end of 2010.         
	Jones is the latest in a series of high-level Obama aides to leave the administration recently.

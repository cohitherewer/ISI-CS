The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jobs unveils touch Nano
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jobs unveils touch Nano

	San Francisco, Sept. 1 (AP): Apple Inc. CEO Steve Jobs announced a new line of iPods today, including a Nano model that has a touch screen and lacks buttons.        
	 Like previous versions, the Nano has a built-in FM tuner and can display photos. But instead of buttons, controls for playing, pausing and selecting music are right on the screen. It will cost $149 for the 8GB version and $179 for 16GB.        
	In a refresh to the iPod Touch, Apple is adding video-chat features similar to the newest iPhone. It has a front-facing camera for conducting video chats with other iPod Touch and iPhone users over Wi-Fi using Apples FaceTime programme. A camera on the back can be used for taking snapshots and recording video. Prices range from $229 to $399.        
	Jobs also introduced a new iPod Shuffle, the lowest-end music player in Apples line. Like the past generation, it can speak the names of playlists and songs. But unlike the most recent of the tiny music players, the new $49 device brings back the square shape and buttons of Apples second-generation Shuffle.        
	Apple, meanwhile, is adding social features to its iTunes software. Jobs said iTunes 10 brings new ways for people to learn what their friends are listening to. The feature, called Ping, is likely based on the technology Apple acquired with the purchase of Lala.com last year.        
	The Ping section in iTunes lets people follow friends, musicians and others, similar to the way Facebook and Twitter work.

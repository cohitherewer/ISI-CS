	Kabul, July 20 (Reuters): Afghan forces should be leading security operations in all parts of the country by 2014, an international conference agreed today, with the aim of taking over from foreign troops in some areas by the years end.        
	The ambitious deadline will rely heavily on the success of some 150,000 foreign troops in an ongoing operation against the Taliban in their spiritual southern heartland, as well as on enticing thousands of insurgents to lay down arms.        
	It also depends on how fast foreign troops are able to train and equip their local counterparts, the difficulty of which was underscored today when an Afghan soldier killed two US civilians and one of his own comrades in northern Mazar-i-Sharif.        
	The reality of security elsewhere was illustrated by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moons flight to todays conference being diverted to Natos Bagram airfield following an insurgent rocket attack.        
	As it turned out the rocket attack was little more than a serious attempt to disrupt our sleep, Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt, on the same flight, wrote in his blog.        
	The final communique from the gathering said the Afghan government would be given more responsibility for its own affairs  including security  in exchange for guarantees it will improve standards and accountability.        
	Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) should lead and conduct military operations in all provinces by the end of 2014, said the communique.        
	British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Afghans had set out their own plans, but needed to put those into practice. I have said to their ministers, individually and collectively, that its now very important to implement these plans, Hague said.        
	Lawmaker Daud Sultanzoi said the goal was laudable but wishful thinking.        
	Looking at it from a realistic perspective it is a very good and necessary goal, but in terms of its practicality there are so many questions that have to be answered before we can really just stick to a timetable, he told Reuters.        
	The US plans to start withdrawing troops from July next year, and Clinton told the conference that the target date underscored the urgency of transferring more security responsibility to the Afghan government. The July 2011 date captures both our sense of urgency and the strength of our resolve. The transition process is too important to push off indefinitely, she said.        
	The Taliban have been emboldened by talk of transition timetables, convinced that Washington is not committed to a drawn-out fight and insist they will not stop fighting until all foreign forces leave.

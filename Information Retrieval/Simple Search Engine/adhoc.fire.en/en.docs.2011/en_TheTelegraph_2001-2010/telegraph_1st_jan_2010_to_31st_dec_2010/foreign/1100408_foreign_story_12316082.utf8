                              Patriot games                            
	New York, April 7 (Reuters): American espionage writer Tom Clancy is bringing all his fictional characters together into one thriller novel about modern terrorism to be released a few weeks before Christmas, the Penguin Group said today.        
	The novelists first book in seven years, called Dead or Alive, will be published in the US and Britain on December 7. Penguin imprint G.P. Putnams Sons will have a first print run of 1.75 million in the US.        
	This is Tom Clancy for the first time bringing all his all-stars together, including Jack Ryan, said Ivan Held, president of G.P. Putnams Sons, adding the novel takes in the last quarter century of Clancys literary characters. They will be going after modern terrorism.        
	The 62-year-old bestselling author is best known for his books Patriot Games and The Hunt for Red October that featured former US marine turned CIA analyst Jack Ryan and were later turned into films starring Harrison Ford and Alec Baldwin.        
	Dead or Alive, which is written with former US Navy veteran Grant Blackwood, will chronicle efforts by Ryan, his son as well as colleagues at a secret US counter-terrorism organisation to capture The Emir, a mastermind of terrorist attacks on the west and who has eluded capture by the worlds armed forces and law enforcement agencies, said Penguin.        
	Other characters to appear in the novel include Irish-American catholic John Clark, who was portrayed by Willem Dafoe and Liev Schreiber in the film adaptations of Clancys novels Clear and Present Danger and The Sum of All Fears.        
	David Shanks, CEO of Penguin Group USA, said the latest novel turns up the tension between US forces and their most lethal rivals. He added: Toms genius for telling a story with exceptional realism and cutting edge authenticity are his hallmarks as a writer.

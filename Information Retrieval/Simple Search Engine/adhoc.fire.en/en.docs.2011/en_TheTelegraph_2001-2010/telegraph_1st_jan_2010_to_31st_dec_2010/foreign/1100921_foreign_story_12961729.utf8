	Blind Wonder    
	 Geneva, Sept. 20 (Reuters): US pop and soul music legend Stevie Wonder told diplomats from nearly 200 nations today to stop squabbling over copyright and agree on a pact bringing hope and light to blind people around the globe.      
	And the singer-musician, himself sightless since just after birth, warned negotiators at the UN intellectual property and copyright agency WIPO that he would write a sad song about them if they didnt act on his appeal.      
	We must declare a state of emergency and end the information deprivation that continues to keep the visually impaired in the dark, said Wonder.      
	The star wrapped up his appeal by singing some famous lines from many of his best-loved songs, including I Just Called to Say I Love You and Keep Our Love Alive.

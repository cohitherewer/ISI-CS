	Santiago, Feb. 27 (Reuters): A huge magnitude-8.8 earthquake struck Chile early today, killing at least 122 people, knocking down homes and hospitals and triggering a tsunami that rolled menacingly across the Pacific.        
	TV Chile reported that a 15-storey building collapsed in the hardest-hit city of Concepcion, where buildings caught fire, major highway bridges collapsed and cracks opened up in the streets. Cars turned upside down lay scattered across one damaged bridge.        
	Residents huddled in streets full of rubble of masonry and glass from destroyed homes. Many were terrified by powerful aftershocks and desperately trying to call friends and family.        
	Chilean President-elect Sebastian Pinera said 122 people had been killed and the death toll could climb higher.        
	Tsunami warnings were posted around the Pacific, including the US state of Hawaii, Japan and Russia.        
	Telephone and power lines were down in much of central Chile, making it difficult to assess the full extent of the damage close to the epicentre.                     
	Chile is the worlds No. 1 copper producer, and the quake halted operations at two major mines. Never in my life have I experienced a quake like this, its like the end of the world, one man told local television from the city of Temuco, where the quake damaged homes and forced staff to evacuate the regional hospital.        
	The US Geological Survey said the earthquake struck 115km northeast of Concepcion at a depth of 35km at 0634GMT.        
	The capital Santiago, about 320km north of the epicentre, was also badly hit. The international airport was closed for at least 24 hours as the quake destroyed passenger walkways and shook glass out of doors and windows.        
	Chiles Codelco, the worlds largest copper producer, suspended operations at its El Teniente and Andina mines, but reported no major damage and said it expected the mines to be up and running in the coming hours.        
	President Michelle Bachelet said a huge wave hit the Juan Fernandez islands. Radio stations reported serious damage on the archipelago, where Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk was marooned in the 18th Century inspiring the novel Robinson Crusoe.        
	Bachelet, who flew over the worst-affected area, said residents were also being evacuated from coastal areas of Chiles remote Easter Island.        
	The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a Pacific-wide tsunami warning for countries in Latin America, and as far away as the US state of Hawaii as well as Japan, Russia, Philippines, Indonesia and the South Pacific. French Polynesia was also put on alert.        
	Chile probably got the brunt force of the tsunami already. So probably the worst has already happened in Chile, said Victor Sardina, geophysicist at the centre.

          DEBORAH HAYNES, ALEXI MOSTROUS AND GILES WHITTELL                          Containers await loading at Ningbo Port in Chinas Zhejiang province. Ningbo was included in a list published by WikiLeaks identifying key infrastructure sites that the US believes could pose danger to its security if they came under terrorist attack. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, Dec. 6: WikiLeaks raised the stakes in its battle with America last night by releasing a secret list of all the global industries and assets that the US most wishes to protect.        
	Security experts said that the cable, published by the whistleblower website as part of an unauthorised package of diplomatic correspondence, was a gift for terrorist organisations.        
	It spelt out hundreds of pipelines, undersea cables and factories across the world, including a number in Britain, that would cause most damage to US interests if destroyed.        
	Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former defence and foreign secretary and chairman of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee, said WikiLeaks had made no credible attempt to find out whether the material could assist terrorists.        
	This is further evidence that they have been generally irresponsible, bordering on criminal. This is the kind of information terrorists are interested in knowing, he added.        
	A spokesman for Downing Street condemned the unauthorised release of classified information, saying: The leaks and their publication are damaging to national security in the United States, Britain and elsewhere.        
	It is vital that governments are able to co-operate on the basis of confidentiality of information.        
	In Washington, Philip Crowley, assistant secretary of state, said: There are strong and valid reasons information is classified, including critical infrastructure and key resources that are vital to the national and economic security of any country.        
	Julian Assange [the founder of WikiLeaks] may be directing his efforts at the United States but he is placing the interests of many countries and regions at risk. This is irresponsible.        
	But WikiLeaks said that the document, approved by secretary of state Hillary Clinton, provided further evidence that the US administration was hoarding sensitive information on countries without their knowledge. Clinton faced embarrassment after earlier cables revealed that US diplomats were asked to collect information on high-ranking UN diplomats and other individuals. Kristinn Hrafnsson, a spokesman for the website, said: This further undermines claims made by the US government that its embassy officials do not play an intelligence-gathering role.        
	In terms of security issues, while this cable details the strategic importance of assets across the world, it does not give any information as to their exact locations, security measures, vulnerabilities or any similar factors, though it does reveal the US asked its diplomats to report back on these matters.        
	US embassies were told to update a 2008 list of critical infrastructure and key resources in their host countries whose loss would critically impact the public health, economic security and/or national and homeland security of the United States, according to the leaked cable.                    THE TIMES, LONDON

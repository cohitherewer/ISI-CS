The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Exposed: British MP wife works as prostitute
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Exposed: British MP wife works as prostitute
                                  
	London, Sept. 6 (PTI): A British MP was shocked after his wife of seven years was exposed as a prostitute.        
	Carla Weatherley, 39, wife of Tory MP Mike Weatherley, who came to power with Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this year, was caught on camera performing a sexy striptease for an undercover reporter for the Sunday Mirror newspaper.        
	Carla, who allegedly worked as a prostitute in her native Brazil before marrying Weatherley, plied her trade in three different massage parlours under the names Bea, Adriana and Bianca, reports the Daily Mail.        
	I like it here, nice clients, nice people, nice place and good money, she told the reporter.        
	The shocking revelation is bound to prove an embarrassment to Cameron who is pictured with Weatherley on the MPs personal website.         
	The couple are understood to have met in Rio de Janeiro during one of Weatherleys trips as a business executive.        
	They married in Brighton in 2003. It was the MPs second marriage and, at the time, Carla Weatherleys occupation was listed as housewife.        
	She is reported to have gone back home to Brazil in 2007, returning two years later when her husband asked her to assist him ahead of his election campaign. The MP, who insists that he has been separated from his wife since February this year, wept when approached at his home in Brighton yesterday.         
	I do have proof that we have been separated since February which I can show if needed, Weatherley said.

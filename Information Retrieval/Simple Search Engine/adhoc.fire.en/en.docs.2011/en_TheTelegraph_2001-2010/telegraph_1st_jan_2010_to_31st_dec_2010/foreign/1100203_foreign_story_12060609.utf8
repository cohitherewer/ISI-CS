                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fatima wants ailing granny back in Pak
                              Fatima Bhutto                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 2 (PTI): The niece of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Fatima, has written to the Supreme Court chief justice asking for his help to get her ailing grandmother, Nusrat, back in Pakistan so that she can get proper care.        
	In the letter, Fatima said that her grandmother was being held incommunicado by the family of President Asif Ali Zardari and was at the mercy of the maids. My grandmother, no longer under her daughters care, is now being held incommunicado by the Zardaris in Dubai.        
	They have dragged her good name into their corruption cases which have placed her in the horrific position of being listed as a beneficiary of the criminal and unconstitutional National Reconciliation Ordinance, the letter said.        
	 Fatima said Nusrat was not getting proper medical care and the state authorities should be directed to bring her to Pakistan so that she could live with family.         
	Fatima said that soon after the 1996 murder of her father, Mir Murtaza Bhutto, their aunt Benazir came to take Nusrat for what she promised would be a short trip to New York to attend the UN General Assembly session.        
	Since then, Fatima and her brother have met their grandmother only once briefly for 45 minutes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | President addresses wider Muslim world
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      President addresses wider Muslim world
          NORIMITSU ONISHI                          President Obama waves to a person he recognised in the crowd after his address at the University of Indonesia in Jakarta on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	Jakarta, Nov. 10: In a much-anticipated speech focusing on development, democracy and religion, President Obama sought today to strengthen Americas ties with Indonesia, a rising Asian power with the worlds largest Muslim population.        
	However, his intended audience was also elsewhere in the Muslim world, especially in West Asia, where he began talking last year of a fresh start between the West and the Islamic world.        
	Muslim leaders here praised Obamas knowledgeable and warm approach to Indonesia but expressed doubts that his speech would resonate in the wider Muslim world. Too few concrete changes in American foreign policy, they said, had followed previous speeches in Egypt and Turkey.        
	President Obama didnt offer any new major points, said Azyumardi Azra, a prominent Muslim thinker and the director of the graduate school at Syarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University. There is no breakthrough, for example, to accelerate a peaceful resolution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine.        
	Many people had been expecting that he would address one of the stumbling blocs to the peace process, like Israels construction of new housing, Azra added.        
	Mixing the personal, political and religious, Obama spoke of Indonesias history of religious tolerance and its commitment to democracy and diversity before a receptive audience of 6,500 mostly young people at the University of Indonesia. In a 30-minute speech, the president underscored the shared values between the Us and Indonesia, which is known for its tradition of moderate Islam.        
	Obama spoke about hearing the call to prayer across Jakarta, where he lived for four years as a boy. He referred several times to his Indonesian stepfather, Lolo Soeotoro, who, he said, was raised a Muslim but firmly believed that all religions were worthy of respect.        
	I thought the speech was very good because it showed that Obama knows about the people of Indonesia, our cultures and traditions, and mentioned what we have in common, said Slamet Effendi Yusuf, a deputy chairman of Nahdlatul Ulama, one of Indonesias largest Islamic organisations.         
	Although 90 per cent of Indonesias nearly 240 million citizens are Muslim, the countrys Constitution recognises the worlds major religions, and for decades political Islam had little role in this country.         
	But in the past two decades, as Indonesians have become increasingly religious, events in West Asia and other Muslim regions have gained more traction here.        
	Obama talked about the issues that have caused tensions for many years, mentioning the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the conflict between Israel and Palestine.         
	He said that the United States had made some progress in those areas since Obama gave his first speech on the United States and Islam 17 months ago in Cairo.

	Clooney young    
	 London, Aug. 12 (PTI): Italian model Elisabetta Canalis says dating George Clooney is better than plastic surgery because he makes her feel so young.      
	Canalis, 31, is happy with Clooney and says he makes her feel 18 again. The model is looking forward to the Emmy awards when Clooney, 49, will receive the Bob Hope Humanitarian Award.

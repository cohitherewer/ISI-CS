	Passport nudity    
	 Nicosia, Dec. 23 (Reuters): She may be the ancient Greek goddess of love, but a picture of a nude Aphrodite on the new passport of Cyprus has set more than hearts racing.      
	Cypriot diplomats are furious with the interior ministry for failing to consult the foreign ministry before issuing passports with a depiction of a naked immortal that might offend conservative foreign cultures. But it may be too late to change them.

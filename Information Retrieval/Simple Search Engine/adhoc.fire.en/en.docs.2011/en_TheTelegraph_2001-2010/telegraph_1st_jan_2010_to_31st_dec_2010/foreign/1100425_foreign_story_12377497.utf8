The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thai govt rejects insincere truce call 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Thai govt rejects insincere truce call 
                            
	Bangkok, April 24 (Reuters): Thailand Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva today rejected a new compromise offer by anti-government red shirt demonstrators to end weeks of increasingly violent protests in return for early polls.        
	The red-shirted supporters of ousted former Premier Thaksin Shinawatra immediately removed their offer to end a three-week occupation of Bangkoks ritzy shopping area if the government dissolved the parliament and announced elections in 30 days.        
	Abhisit said the peace overture looked insincere and designed only to improve the protesters image. They keep saying they will escalate the situation. Thats why the government cannot consider the proposal, he told reporters.        
	The mostly rural and working class red shirts responded by threatening more aggressive measures, including laying siege to Central World, the second-largest shopping complex in Southeast Asia.        
	If you want Central World shopping mall back safely, you must withdraw the army out of the nearby Rajaprasong area immediately, a protest leader told supporters. The shopping centre has been closed since the protesters occupied the area on April 3.        
	The risk of violence remains high after a series of grenade blasts that killed one person and wounded 88 on Thursday in Bangkoks business district, an attack the government blamed on the red shirts.        
	As part of their demands, the red shirts also want an independent probe into an April 10 clash between protesters and the army that killed 25 people.        
	Thousands of troops, many armed with M-16 assault rifles, are keeping watch over the red shirts at several city intersections. Royalist pro-government protesters often gather outside their fortress-like barricade, sparking clashes in which both sides hurl bottles and insults.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Putin sings at charity event
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Putin sings at charity event
                              Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sings during a charity concert in St Petersburg. (AP)                            
	Dec. 11: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin serenaded a star-studded crowd, singing Louis Armstrongs song Blueberry Hill at a childrens charity event.        
	Called onto the stage by the hostess in St Petersburg, Putin said: Like an overwhelming majority of people, I can neither sing nor play, but I very much like doing it.        
	The events hostess reminded him that he had sung before a group before. Putin sang last summer at a secret meeting with a team of Russian undercover agents who were expelled from the US.        
	His audience yesterday included Sharon Stone, Monica Bellucci, Kevin Costner and Gerard Depardieu.        
	Wearing a black suit and a white shirt, Putin went on stage and played the opening notes to Blueberry Hill on the piano, then stepped behind the microphone and sang, backed by several musicians and singers.        
	Putin, 58, described as an alpha-dog in US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks website, has a black belt in judo, and frequently undertakes testosterone-fuelled feats such as flying a fighter jet or shooting a Siberian tiger.        
	He has thus far shown little interest in musical pursuits, but his piano performance suggested he has been able to squeeze in some music lessons.        
	The Prime Ministers spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Putin takes lessons but very rarely, when he has time.        
	He said Putin learned the lyrics to Blueberry Hill as part of his English-language studies. Putin also attempted to play the Soviet-era spy movie song From Where the Motherland Begins, which he said he had sung with the Russian agents, but hit a wrong key and stopped, promising to rehearse it better for the next performance.        
	Putin, a former KGB agent, remains Russias most popular politician and is seen as a senior partner in tandem with President Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev will now have to learn to play saxophone, said a participant at the event.

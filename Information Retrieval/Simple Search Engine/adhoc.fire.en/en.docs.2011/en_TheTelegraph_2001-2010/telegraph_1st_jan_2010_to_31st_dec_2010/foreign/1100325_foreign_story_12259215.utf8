The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Terrorists can use implants to blow up jet
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Terrorists can use implants to blow up jet

	London, March 24: Breast-implants packed with explosives could be used by terrorists to blow up an airliner, experts have reportedly warned.        
	Radical Islamist plastic surgeons could be carrying out the implant operations in lawless areas of Pakistan, security sources warned. Explosives experts have reportedly said just 141 grams of Pentaerythritol Tetrabitrate packed into a breast implant would be enough to blow a considerable hole in the side of a jumbo jet.        
	 It would be virtually possible for airport security scanners to detect the explosive if hidden inside a breast, doctors have said.        
	Joseph Farah, a terrorism expert, told The Sun: Women suicide bombers recruited by al Qaida are known to have had the explosives inserted in their breasts under techniques similar to breast enhancing surgery.        
	Plastic surgeons may also have inserted the chemical into the buttocks of would-be suicide bombers. The discovery was reportedly made after Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a London-educated Nigerian, attempted to blow up an airliner bound for Detroit on Christmas day with explosives packed into his underpants.

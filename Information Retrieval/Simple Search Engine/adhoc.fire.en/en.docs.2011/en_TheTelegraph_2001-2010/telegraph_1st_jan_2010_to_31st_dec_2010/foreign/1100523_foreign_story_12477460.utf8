          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, May 22: Pakistan has blocked more than 800 Web pages and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to prevent viewing of blasphemous material after the government decided to ban Facebook and YouTube.        
	The two sites had been blocked earlier this week after a user on Facebook invited members to draw blasphemous caricatures.         
	Officials in the telecommunications ministry told The Telegraph that the Web pages and URLs were blocked to ensure that the blasphemous material was not seen anywhere in Pakistan.        
	A Pakistan Telecommunication Authority official said Facebook and YouTube would be restored only after they assured Pakistan that such pages would not be permitted in the future.

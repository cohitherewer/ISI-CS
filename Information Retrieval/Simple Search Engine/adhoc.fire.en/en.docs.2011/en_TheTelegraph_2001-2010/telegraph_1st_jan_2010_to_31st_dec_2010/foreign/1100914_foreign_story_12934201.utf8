	Sept. 13: Carla Bruni-Sarkozy was paid the minimum wage of just 125 a day for filming of her bit-part in Woody Allens new movie.        
	The former supermodel  who once earned thousands an hour as a catwalk model  was paid the base rate for actors during filming in Paris, it has been disclosed. According to the French website Bakchich, the 45-year-old French First Lady only received 125 for her work.        
	The site said: Thats the tiny sum the First Lady of France was paid for the her role on the set of the film, also starring Owen Wilson.         
	It was the minimum wage paid to movie extras for her small part in Woody Allens film. Allen also benefited in others ways from hiring Bruni, as she was accompanied by a large team of security men and he got all his filming authorities in record time.        
	Bruni-Sarkozy is bracing for the release of a new unauthorised biography depicts her as obsessed with plastic surgery and sex. The claims have emerged in a scathing new book by the investigative journalist, Besma Lahouri.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

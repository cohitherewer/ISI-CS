The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Leaks keep Qantas jets grounded
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Leaks keep Qantas jets grounded
                            
	London/Sydney, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Australias Qantas Airways has grounded its A380 fleet for at least three more days as it investigates oil leaks that might have caused the engine explosion on a Sydney-bound flight last week.        
	The incident has rattled the global aviation industry, which is recovering from heavy losses during the global economic downturn, and has been damaging for Rolls-Royce.        
	This latest grounding extends the period of uncertainty and is certainly not good for Rolls stock, which has seen 1.2 billion wiped off its value since the initial blowout, said Nomura analyst Jason Adams.         
	The market wants resolution on the Trent 900-Qantas A380 issue and clarity on the containment of it.

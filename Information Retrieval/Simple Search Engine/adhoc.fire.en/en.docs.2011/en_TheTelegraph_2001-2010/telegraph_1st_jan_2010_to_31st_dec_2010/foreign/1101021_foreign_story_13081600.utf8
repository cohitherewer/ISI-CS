                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Gay Saudi royal jailed for murder
                            
	London, Oct. 20: Gay Saudi prince Saud Abdulaziz bin Nasser al Saud has been jailed for life for beating and strangling his servant to death in the culmination of a campaign of sadistic abuse.        
	He must serve a minimum term of 20 years in jail for murdering Bandar Abdulaziz in a brutal assault at their five-star hotel. The prince bit the 32-year-old hard on both cheeks during the attack at their suite in February.        
	 He was fuelled by champagne and Sex on the Beach cocktails when he began the ferocious beating after a Valentines Day night out.        
	When arrested, he at first wrongly believed he had diplomatic immunity but his special status as a Saudi royal could not save him from British justice.

	Copenhagen, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Police yesterday arrested five people suspected of planning to attack the Danish newspaper that outraged Muslims in 2005 with cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.        
	Denmarks PET security police said the suspects had planned to enter a Copenhagen office block housing several newspapers including offices of the daily Jyllands-Posten to kill as many as possible of those around.        
	Police found a machine gun with a silencer, ammunition and plastic strips that could be used as handcuffs, PET said. It did not say where the items had been seized.        
	On the basis of the investigation, it is the PETs assessment that the detainees were preparing a terror attack against a newspaper, which according to the PETs information was Jyllands-Posten, it said.         
	It is likewise the PETs view that the attack was due to be carried out in the coming days.        
	Jyllands-Posten was the newspaper that first published the cartoons, provoking protests against Danish and European interests in West Asia, Africa and Asia in which at least 50 people died.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 36 killed in Iraq blasts
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      36 killed in Iraq blasts
                                  
	Baghdad, Nov. 2 (Reuters): At least 10 explosions rocked mainly Shia areas of the Iraqi capital today, killing 36 people two days after al Qaida militants caused a bloodbath when they took hostages in a Christian church.        
	Iraq remains in political limbo almost eight months after an inconclusive vote, raising fears that insurgents might exploit tension to try and reignite sectarian war. Todays attack was the third major assault in Iraq since Friday.         
	Ten cars exploded with bombs inside them. There were also four roadside bombs and two sticky bombs, Baghdad security spokesman Major General Qassim al-Moussawi said. (They were) all in Shia neighbourhoods.        
	Health minister Saleh al-Hasnawi told Iraqiya state television that 36 people were killed and most of the wounded had already left hospitals after being cuaght up in at least 10 explosions around Baghdad.         
	One of the biggest blasts appeared to target restaurants and cafes in the Shia slum of Sadr City. A police source in the area said 15 people had been killed and another 23 wounded.        
	On Sunday, gunmen seized a Catholic church in central Baghdad during mass. The siege ended in a raid by security forces that saw 52 hostages and police killed in the bloodiest attack on Iraqi Christians since the 2003 US-led invasion.        
	Violence has subsided significantly in Iraq since the height of sectarian bloodshed in 2006-07 but attacks by Sunni insurgents linked to al Qaida and Shia militia continue daily. On Friday, 22 people were killed when a suicide bomber attacked an Iraqi cafe northeast of Baghdad.

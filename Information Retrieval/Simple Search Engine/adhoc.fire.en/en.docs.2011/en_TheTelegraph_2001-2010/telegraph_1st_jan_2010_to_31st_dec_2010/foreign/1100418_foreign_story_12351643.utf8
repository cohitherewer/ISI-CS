          ALASTAIR JAMIESON                          Cleese: Beat the rush                                  
	London, April 17: John Cleese, the Monty Python and Fawlty Towers star, paid 3,300 to take a cab from Oslo to Brussels after being stranded in Norway by volcanic ash travel chaos.        
	The comedian was stuck after volcanic ash caused airspace across Europe to be closed, forcing the cancellation of all but a small number of flights.        
	After ferries and trains were booked up, his assistant chose to send him in a taxi to Brussels, from where he could get a Eurostar train to London. Cleese, 70, said: We checked every option but there were no boats and no train tickets available. Thats when my fabulous assistant determined the easiest thing would be to take a taxi.        
	Cleese, who was visiting the Norwegian capital to take part in the popular Scandinavian talk show Skavlan. said before setting off: It will be interesting. Im not in a hurry.        
	According to Oslo Taxi, drivers have made numerous trips between Oslo and Stockholm since Thursday and a number of fares have gone even further.

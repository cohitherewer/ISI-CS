	Los Angeles, Dec. 28: Elton John and his partner David Furnish have become parents of a son born to a surrogate mother, it was disclosed today.         
	The boy, who has been named Zachary Jackson Levon Furnish-John, was born on Christmas Day in the US. We are overwhelmed with happiness and joy at this very special moment, they said in a statement issued to magazine Us Weekly.         
	The rock stars spokeswoman confirmed the report but said no details of the surrogacy arrangement would be disclosed and they intended to respect the privacy of the surrogate.         
	The boy weighed 7 pounds 15 ounces and was 22 inches long.         
	John, 63, and Canadian filmmaker Furnish, 48, have been together since the early 1990s. They entered into a civil union in 2005 and tried to adopt an AIDS-infected orphan in Ukraine last year, but were thwarted by government regulations. Their sons middle name Levon is thought to be a reference to Johns 1971 song of the same name, inspired by drummer and singer Levon Helm.

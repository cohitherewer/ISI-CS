The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Vatican ire on skimpy clothes
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Vatican ire on skimpy clothes
                            
	London, July 28 (PTI): The Vatican has banned scantily- clad tourists from entering the Christian state.        
	The ban had previously applied only to St Peters Basilica, but guards manning the official entry point into the tiny, walled state began pulling visitors aside for sporting inappropriate attire.         
	Tourists in skimpy summer clothing are being told to cover up before entering the Vatican, the Italian news agency Ansa reported.        
	The new decree, particularly targeting those in shorts and shoulder-revealing shirts, sent several tourists trudging off to local stores to buy shawls, scarves and pairs of trousers, the report said.

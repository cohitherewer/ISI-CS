	Islamabad, March 1: Security forces today rescued two Sikhs kidnapped from Pakistans troubled Khyber tribal region in January.        
	The duo were among the three Sikhs abducted by militants from the area, a stronghold of the Lashkar-e-Islam. One of the three, Jaspal Singh, was beheaded on February 20, and his body found in Orakzai, known as the hub of the Taliban and militants belonging to other extremist groups, by relatives. The captors had demanded millions of rupees as ransom for their release.        
	The two Sikhs were rescued during an operation early this morning from a compound on the border of the Khyber and Orakzai tribal regions. Some terrorists were also killed during the operation. It was launched on an intelligence tip-off about the presence of the two Sikhs, a senior security official said.         
	Security agencies are now focussing on the release of a Pakistani Hindu, Robin Singh, who had recently been kidnapped.

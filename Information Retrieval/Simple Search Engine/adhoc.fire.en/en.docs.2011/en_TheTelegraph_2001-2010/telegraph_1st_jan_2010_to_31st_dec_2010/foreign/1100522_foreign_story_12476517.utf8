                          Craig Venter                    
	May 21: Craig Venter, the American biologist who has created artificial life in a laboratory for the first time, has defended himself against accusations he was playing God.        
	The creation of the synthetic cell, described as a landmark by one British expert, is a 15-year dream come true for maverick genetics entrepreneur Dr Venter.        
	He breathed life into a bacterium using genes assembled in the laboratory in a development with major implications for genomics, including the manufacture of artificial organisms designed for specific tasks such as making vaccines or cleaning up pollution.        
	But experts recognise that there are potential dangers too. Synthetic life could, for instance, pave the way to biological weapons.        
	Speaking from Washington on BBC2s Newsnight, Venter dismissed suggestions that he was playing God.        
	He said: Thats a term that comes up every time there is a new medical or scientific breakthrough associated with biology. Its been a goal of humanity from the earlier stages to try and control nature.. thats how we got domesticated animals.        
	This is the next stage in our understanding, it is a baby step in our understanding of how life fundamentally works and maybe how we can get some new handles on trying to control these microbial systems to benefit humanity.        
	Asked if the technique could be bought by the highest bidder, he replied: The technology is not for sale, the cells are not for sale. We are trying to use this technology to advance vaccine protection, we are trying to use it to advance the basic understanding of cellular life.        
	He also dismissed the danger of bio-terrorism, stating: Most people are in agreement that there is a slight increase in the potential for harm but theres an exponential increase in the potential benefit to society. Venters researchers explain in the journal Science how they effectively re-booted a simple microbe by transplanting into it a set of genetic code sequences that were built from scratch.        
	The genome was copied from the blueprint contained in Mycoplasma mycoides, a simple bacterium that infects cattle and goats. After first constructing short strands of DNA, the scientists used yeast cells as natural factory assembly lines.        
	The sequence was built in a step-by-step process. DNA repair systems in the yeast attached the pieces together, gradually lengthening the strands to finish up with a chromosome more than a million letters of genetic code long. The final test came when the completed chromosome was transplanted into another bacterium, Mycoplasma capricolum, replacing its native DNA.        
	After a failed first attempt, the scientists brought the cells to life. Driven by the new genome, the bacteria took on the appearance and behaviour of M. mycoides, generating different proteins and multiplying.        
	Describing the achievement, Venter said: This is the first synthetic cell thats been made, and we call it synthetic because the cell is totally derived from a synthetic chromosome.        
	This is an important step we think, both scientifically and philosophically. Its certainly changed my views of the definitions of life and how life works.        
	To prove the recipient bacteria contained the synthetic genome, the scientists effectively signed their names in DNA.        
	Four of the DNA sequences included coded watermarks  strings of letters corresponding to the names of people involved in the project, an email address, and some famous quotations.        
	Commenting on the breakthrough in Science, Prof. Mark Bedau, editor of the journal Artificial Life, called it a defining moment in the history of biology and technology.        
	US biologist Jef Boeke, from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, told the journal: It represents an important technical milestone in the new field of synthetic genomics.

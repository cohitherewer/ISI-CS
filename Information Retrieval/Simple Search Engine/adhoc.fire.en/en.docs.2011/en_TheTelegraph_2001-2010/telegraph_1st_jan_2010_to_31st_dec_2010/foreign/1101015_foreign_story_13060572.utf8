	San Jose Mine, Chile, Oct. 14 (AP): The longest underground nightmare in history ended safely  and faster than anyone expected.        
	In a flawless operation that unfolded before a hopeful, transfixed world, 33 miners who were trapped for more than two months deep beneath the Chilean earth were raised one by one through a smooth-walled shaft of rock.        
	The last man out was the one who held the group together when they were feared lost, shift foreman Luis Urzua who enforced tight rations of their limited food and supplies before help could arrive.        
	We have done what the entire world was waiting for, he said immediately after his rescue. We had strength, we had spirit, we wanted to fight, we wanted to fight for our families, and that was the greatest thing.        
	Not even a full 24 hours after the rescue began, Urzua made the 2,041-foot ascent in a rescue capsule called Phoenix and emerged from a manhole-sized opening in the ground to a joyous celebration of confetti, balloons and champagne.        
	President Sebastian Pinera told him: You are not the same, and the country is not the same after this. You were an inspiration. Go hug your wife and your daughter. With hardhats held to their hearts, the pair led a joyous crowd in singing the national anthem.        
	The first rescue worker down was last up  Manuel Gonzalez, a mine rescue expert with Chiles state-owned Codelco copper company, talked the men through the final hours inside the mine.         
	Then, he spent 26 minutes alone down below before he strapped himself into the capsule for the ride up. He reached the surface at 12.32 am Thursday local time to hugs from his comrades and Pinera.        
	The rescue exceeded expectations every step of the way. Officials first said it might be four months before they could get the men out; it turned out to be 69 days and about 8 hours.        
	Once the escape tunnel was finished, they estimated it would take 36 to 48 hours to get all the miners to the surface. That got faster as the operation went along, and all the miners were safely above ground in 22 hours, 37 minutes.        
	The crowd in Camp Hope, down a hill from the escape shaft, set off confetti, released balloons and sprayed champagne as Urzuas capsule surfaced, joining in a rousing miners cheer. In the capital Santiago, hundreds gathered in Plaza Italia, waving flags and chanting victory slogans in the miners honour.        
	In nearby Copiapo, about 3,000 people gathered in the town square, where a huge screen broadcast live footage of the rescue. The exuberant crowd waved Chilean flags of all sizes and blew on red vuvuzelas as cars drove around the plaza honking their horns, their drivers yelling, Long live Chile!         
	One by one throughout the day, the men had emerged to the cheers of exuberant Chileans and before the eyes of a transfixed globe.        
	Welcome to life, Pinera told Victor Segovia, the 15th miner out. On a day of superlatives, it seemed no overstatement.

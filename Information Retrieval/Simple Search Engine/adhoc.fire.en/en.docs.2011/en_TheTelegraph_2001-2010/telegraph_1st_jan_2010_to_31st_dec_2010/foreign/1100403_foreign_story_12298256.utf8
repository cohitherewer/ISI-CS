	London, April 2: Talking about your pain could actually make it worse, claim scientists.        
	Far from being soothing, words and counselling can actually increase the intensity of physical pain, a study finds. Warnings such as this may hurt a bit or you might feel a little pain can be counterproductive and actually compound feelings of discomfort.        
	The study discovered that certain pain-associated words such as tormenting or gruelling stimulate the pain area of the brain  even when no pain is actually administered.        
	Talking to your doctor about your pain might, therefore, be self-defeating claims the researchers at Jena University in Germany as it stimulates a part of the brain known as the pain matrix.        
	It is possible that those conversations intensify the activity of the pain matrix in the brain, said Maria Richter of Jena University.

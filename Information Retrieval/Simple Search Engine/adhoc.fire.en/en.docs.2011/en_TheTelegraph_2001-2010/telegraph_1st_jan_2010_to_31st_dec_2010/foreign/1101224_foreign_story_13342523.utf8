          PETER BAKER                          Obama in Washington. (AP)                                   
	Washington, Dec. 23: The final approval of a new arms control treaty with Russia may have been a foregone conclusion by the time senators stepped onto the floor yesterday.         
	But that was not the way it looked one afternoon last month when White House officials rushed to the Oval Office to tell President Obama that his treaty might be dead.         
	The President and his team had built their entire strategy for obtaining approval of the treaty on winning over a single Republican senator deputised by his caucus to negotiate an accord  and that Republican, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, had just shocked the White House by pulling the plug on a deal for the year.         
	Some aides counselled Obama to stand down. Losing a treaty vote, as one put it, would be a huge loss. But Obama decided that afternoon to make one of the biggest gambles of his presidency and demand that the Senate approve the treaty by the years end. Weve just got to go ahead, he told aides, who recounted the conversation yesterday.         
	Along the way, he had to confront his own reluctant party leadership and circumvent the other partys leaders. He mounted a five-week campaign that married public pressure and private persuasion.         
	He enlisted the likes of Henry A. Kissinger, asked Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to help and sent a team of officials to set up a war room of sorts on Capitol Hill. Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had at least 50 meetings or phone calls with senators.         
	When a wavering Republican senator told secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton that the President needed to address concerns about missile defence, the senator quickly received a letter from Obama reaffirming his commitment to develop the system.         
	Other senators who were worried about the condition of the nations nuclear stockpile received a letter from the President vowing to stick by a 10-year, $85 billion modernisation plan.         
	Even in the final 10 days, the effort appeared in danger of collapsing. The insistence of Democrats on passing unrelated legislation allowing gay men and lesbians to serve openly in the military upset the Republican conference and may have cost the White House five or more votes on the arms treaty. Administration officials worried last week that they did not have the required two-thirds majority in the Senate, and as late as Sunday, the Presidents aides wondered whether to call off the vote.         
	In the end, the gamble paid off yesterday with a 71-to-26 vote in the Senate to approve the treaty, called New Start, with Russia, culminating what turned out to be the biggest battle over arms control in Washington in more than a decade.         
	No Russian-American arms treaty submitted for a Senate vote ever squeaked through by a smaller margin. But for a President seeking his way after a crushing midterm election, it was welcome validation that he could still win a battle.         
	The President made a gutsy decision that he was willing to lose it, and that was a gutsy decision, said Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who was Obamas chief ally in the Senate. Everybody said it wasnt going to happen. Even colleagues on our side said it wasnt going to happen.         
	The treaty took on such importance to Obama because he had invested so much in it.         
	While it will not reduce nuclear weapons as much as previous treaties have, he has made it the centrepiece of his foreign policy  the Jenga piece, as one aide puts it, critical to a variety of priorities, including a better relationship with Russia, international solidarity against Irans uranium enrichment programme and the Presidents larger vision of eventually ridding the world of nuclear weapons.         
	The challenge of Senate approval always played into the administrations thinking, even while the treaty was being negotiated with the Russians.

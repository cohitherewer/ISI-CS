	Scarlett wedding    
	 London, Feb. 20 (PTI): Actress Scarlett Johansson had a tough time planning her low-key 2008 wedding to Ryan Reynolds and felt like she was conducting a drug deal with all the privacy surrounding the ceremony.       
	Johansson, who married Reynolds in Vancouver, Canada, admits they had to do a lot of sneaking around to keep their big day private.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Key Pak anti-terror official resigns
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Key Pak anti-terror official resigns
                                  
	Islamabad, July 20 (AP): The head of a federal group meant to coordinate Pakistans fight against terrorism resigned today amid a bureaucratic turf battle, officials said.        
	Asif Syed, a senior official at the National Counterterrorism Authority, confirmed that Tariq Pervez resigned today but provided no details.        
	A second government official said Pervez resigned because he could not persuade his superiors to place the organisation under the Prime Ministers office where it would have more power to force intelligence and security services to cooperate.        
	The official said the government decided to place the group under the interior ministry. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Pakistan established the group in early 2009.        
	Pakistan has suffered hundreds of attacks by the Taliban and their allies in the past several years. The government responded by launching several military offensives in the northwest along the Afghan border.        
	But many analysts criticised the lack of coordination between the various intelligence and security services battling the militants, prompting the government to establish the authority.        
	It appointed Pervez, a former police officer and head of the Federal Investigation Agency, to lead the authority shortly after its formation. But many analysts have expressed frustration with the governments slow pace of standing up the group, despite funding from the EU.        
	The resignation comes as the Pakistani Taliban and their allies continue to attack the state, which they deem un-Islamic and too closely allied with the US. Four soldiers were wounded in todays attack at the military firing range in the northwestern city of Mardan, said the army in a statement.        
	The assailants refused to stop for a check at the entrance to the range, prompting the guards to open fire, police official Akhtar Ali Shah said. Three of the men wore suicide jackets that detonated as they were shot at, wounding the soldiers, said Shah.        
	The bombers were given cover by four terrorists, two of whom were killed in a subsequent shooting, said the army. Troops are searching for the two attackers.        
	Meanwhile, gunmen in Pakistans southwestern province of Baluchistan killed nationalist activist Haji Liaquat in Qilat town, said Ghulam Moeenuddin, a security official in the area. Liaquat was a member of the Baluchistan National Party. The partys secretary-general, Habib Jalib, was killed last week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Karzai has lost faith in west
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Karzai has lost faith in west
          DEXTER FILKINS                          Karzai: Not working                                  
	Kabul, June 12: Two senior Afghan officials were showing President Hamid Karzai the evidence of the spectacular rocket attack on a nationwide peace conference earlier this month when Karzai told them that he believed the Taliban were not responsible.        
	The President did not show any interest in the evidence  none  he treated it like a piece of dirt, said Amrullah Saleh, then the director of the Afghan intelligence service.        
	Saleh declined to discuss Karzais reasoning in more detail. But a prominent Afghan with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Karzai suggested in the meeting that it might have been the Americans who carried it out.        
	Minutes after the exchange, Saleh and the interior minister, Hanif Atmar, resigned  the most dramatic defection from Karzais government since he came to power nine years ago. Saleh and Atmar said they quit because Karzai made clear that he no longer considered them loyal. But underlying the tensions, according to Saleh and Afghan and western officials, was something more profound: that Karzai had lost faith in the Americans and Nato to prevail in Afghanistan.        
	For that reason, Saleh and other officials said, Karzai has been pressing to strike his own deal with the Taliban and the countrys archrival, Pakistan, the Talibans longtime supporter. According to a former senior Afghan official, Karzais manoeuvrings involve secret negotiations with the Taliban outside the purview of American and Nato officials. The President has lost his confidence in the capability of either the coalition or his own government to protect this country, Saleh said in an interview at his home. President Karzai has never announced that Nato will lose, but the way that he does not proudly own the campaign shows that he doesnt trust it is working.        
	People close to the President say he began to lose confidence in the Americans last summer, after national elections in which independent monitors determined that nearly one million ballots had been stolen on Karzais behalf.         
	The rift worsened in December, when President Obama announced that he intended to begin reducing the number of American troops by the summer of 2011.        
	Karzai told me that he cant trust the Americans to fix the situation here, said a western diplomat in Kabul, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He believes they stole his legitimacy during the elections last year. And then they said publicly that they were going to leave. Karzai could not be reached for comment yesterday.

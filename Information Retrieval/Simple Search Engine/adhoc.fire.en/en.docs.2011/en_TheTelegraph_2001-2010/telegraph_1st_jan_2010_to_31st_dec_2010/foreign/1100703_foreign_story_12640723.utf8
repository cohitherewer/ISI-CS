	New Jolie tattoo    
	 London, July 2 (PTI): Actress Angelina Jolie has added another tattoo to her collection of body art.       
	The new tattoo was revealed when Jolie, 35, was waving to fans during an event in Cancun, Mexico, to promote her new film Salt.      
	Jolies new tattoo is nothing more than a decorative swirl. However, the motif was clearly visible on the inside of her left arm, reports the Daily Mail. Its right next to her elbow, alongside a tattoo of the Roman numeral 13.     
	Gold Kylie    
	 London (PTI): Pop star Kylie Minogue, who donated her gold hot pants she wore in the video Spinning Around to a museum, is amazed at the care that the garments receive. The hot pants are not on display right now though, theyre in storage in a temperature-controlled room. Im not making this up. Theyre better treated than I am! she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chile jail fire
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Chile jail fire
                            
	Santiago, Dec. 8 (Reuters): Fire engulfed a prison in the Chilean capital early today, killing 81 inmates and critically injuring 14 others, prison officials said, in the worst-ever accident in the countrys jail system.        
	Officials said the fire was deliberately started during an early-morning fight between inmates in one of the crowded prisons five towers. Television footage showed part of the San Miguel prison in flames, with black smoke billowing from the building.        
	Frantic relatives of the inmates flooded to the jails walls, screaming and imploring police to let them in to rescue their loved ones. Many families did not yet know their relatives fate.        
	It is exasperating not to know if they are alive or dead. We have been here for hours, and they havent told us anything! said one woman called Maria, declining to give her surname.        
	Some relatives screamed when officials read out lists of some prisoners who had survived the blaze, assuming those not included were dead. Officials stressed the lists were only partial. Some relatives threw rocks and glass bottles and scuffled with police inside the prison perimeter in frustration.        
	There are 81 dead, and we hope that figure wont rise, said Luis Masferrer, director of the national prison system. This reflects the precarious state of Chiles prison system, which we have been denouncing and working to rectify since we took over (in March). Overcrowding is a factor that will have to be analysed in determining the causes of this incident, he added.

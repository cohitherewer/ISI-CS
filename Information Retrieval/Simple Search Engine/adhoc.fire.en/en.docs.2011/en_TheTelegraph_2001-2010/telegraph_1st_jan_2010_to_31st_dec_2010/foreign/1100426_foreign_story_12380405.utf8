The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK apologises to Pope over mocking list 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      UK apologises to Pope over mocking list 
          JONATHAN WYNNE-JONES                          Pope Benedict XVI                                  
	London, April 25: The UK government has apologised to the Pope over official documents that mocked his forthcoming visit to Britain by suggesting he should bless a gay marriage and even launch Papal-branded condoms.         
	The astonishing proposals, leaked to The Sunday Telegraph, were contained in secret papers drawn up earlier this month by civil servants following a brainstorm.         
	The ideas, included in a memo headed The ideal visit would see..., ridiculed the Catholic Churchs teachings, including its opposition to abortion, homosexual behaviour and contraception. Many appeared to be deliberately provocative rather than a serious attempt to plan an itinerary for the September visit.         
	The proposals, which were then circulated among key officials in Downing Street and Whitehall, also include the Pope opening an abortion ward; spending the night in a council flat in Bradford; doing forward rolls with children to promote healthy living; and even performing a duet with the Queen.         
	In reference to the hugely sensitive issue of child abuse engulfing the Catholic Church, the British government document suggests that the Pope should take a harder line on child abuse  announce sacking of dodgy bishops and launch helpline for abused children.         
	The document was sent out by a junior foreign office civil servant with a covering note admitting that some of the plans were far-fetched.         
	Recipients of the memo were furious at its content and an investigation was launched. One senior official was found responsible and has been transferred.        
	Yesterday, the foreign office issued a public apology after being approached by The Sunday Telegraph, while Francis Campbell, the UK ambassador to the Vatican, met senior officials of the Holy See to express the governments regret.         
	David Miliband, the foreign secretary, was appalled to hear of the proposals, according to a source close to him, and blamed a colossal failure of judgement by officials involved.         
	A foreign office spokesperson said: This is clearly a foolish document that does not in any way reflect UK government or foreign office policy or views. Many of the ideas in the document are clearly ill-judged, naive and disrespectful.         
	The text was not cleared or shown to ministers or senior officials before circulation. As soon as senior officials became aware of the document, it was withdrawn from circulation.         
	The individual responsible has been transferred to other duties. He has been told orally and in writing that this was a serious error of judgement and has accepted this view.         
	The foreign office very much regrets this incident and is deeply sorry for the offence which it has caused.         
	The Rt Rev Malcolm McMahon, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Nottingham, was astonished and angered by the proposals.         
	He said: This is appalling. You dont invite someone to your country and then disrespect them in this way. Its outlandish and outrageous.        
	The ideal visit list was circulated within Whitehall by a junior foreign office official, an Oxbridge graduate in his 20s.

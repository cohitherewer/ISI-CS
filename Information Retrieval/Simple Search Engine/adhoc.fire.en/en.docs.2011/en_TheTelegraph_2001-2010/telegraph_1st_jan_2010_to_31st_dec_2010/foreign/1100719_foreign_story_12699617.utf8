The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | America suspends Toefl in Iran
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      America suspends Toefl in Iran
          YEGANEH JUNE TORBATI                    SANCTIONED: A member of Iran rsquo;s Revolutionary Guard                          
	Washington, July 18: The US Educational Testing Service (ETS) has announced that it is temporarily suspending registration in Iran for its tests including the popular Test of English as a Foreign Language (Toefl), in what may be one of the first tangible effects of the new sanctions levied against the country by the international community.         
	Experts and Iranian expatriates were appalled, saying that if the sanctions prohibited Iranians from studying abroad, they would hurt precisely the kind of outward-looking young Iranians the West would like to help.         
	Toefl is a widely recognised measure of English proficiency and is often used by Western universities in evaluating international students for admission.         
	The statement posted on the testing service website on Wednesday cited the Security Council resolution affecting banks and financial institutions that conduct business in Iran. As a result of this resolution, ETS is currently unable to process payments from Iran, the statement said.         
	In an interview with the Iranian Mehr news agency, Ibrahim Khodai, an official at the organisation that manages student testing in Iran, said the organisation had run into problems paying registration fees to the company, and that currently students could not take the test.         
	However, he said that the tests cancellation was unrelated to the latest sanctions against Iran, and he instead cited problems weve had in paying registration fees to the ETS, an American organisation.        
	The Security Council approved a fourth round of sanctions against Iran in June. The resolution, which aims to press Iran to halt its nuclear enrichment programme, mainly affects military purchases and financial transactions of the Revolutionary Guards Corps, which has been linked to the countrys nuclear programme.         
	President Barack Obama signed into law additional unilateral sanctions, including restrictions on foreign banks that do business with the Revolutionary Guards or other blacklisted Iranian institutions.         
	Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the ETS was exactly the kind of organisation that should be exempt from the sanctions.         
	Prohibiting Toefl from operating in Iran is counterproductive to the spirit of smart sanctions, he said, noting that the exam is often a path to the outside world for young Iranians.         
	The government is not being hurt by Toefl not operating in Iran, he said. Its the people, and precisely the people were hoping to empower.         
	An Iranian student currently studying biochemistry at Yale University, who did not want to be identified because the students family lives in Tehran, said losing the exam would throw another obstacle in the way of Iranians hoping to be educated in the West.         
	Its just going to make it harder for them, said the student, who took the test as a high school student in Tehran.         
	A state department spokesperson, Philip J. Crowley, said the government was exploring whether there are alternative mechanisms to allow the ETS to continue its work in Iran. Our intent remains to apply pressure on the Iranian government without placing an undue burden on the Iranian people, he said.

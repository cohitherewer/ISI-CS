	Woody no to NY    
	 Madrid, Aug. 24 (AP): Woody Allen says he began shooting movies in European cities because he could not afford to do it any more in New York.      
	However, the American film director told reporters today in the northern Spanish city of Oviedo that he finds Manhattan poses fewer limitations than European cities, where more tailoring of the story is required to fit the location.      
	 Allen was in Spain to attend the premiere in Spain of his latest film, You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger, in nearby Aviles.       
	 Allen hit out at American cinema saying the majority of films over the past decade lacked creative spirit. In comparison, he said European films were much more artistic.

	London, Oct. 16: The rescued Chilean miners overcame violent disagreements to work as a team to survive, they have disclosed as they celebrated their freedom and new status as national heroes.         
	The miners who returned home last night spoke of the horrors of the early days after the accident before contact was made with the outside world.         
	The first accounts of life for the trapped men hinted at a complicated period of squabbles, disagreements and even physical confrontations between the group during those first dark days after the San Jose mine collapsed on August 5.         
	The men had separated into three groups because of fighting. There were fist fights, one miner said.         
	But they are reported to have made a blood pact not to speak about the problems between them.         
	What went on in the mine stays between us and always will. Thats what weve agreed, the first man to leave the mine, Florencio Avalos, 31, told The Daily Telegraph last night, as he returned home after the 69-day ordeal, still wearing the dark glasses to protect his eyes.         
	Of the 33 miners, 31 were allowed to leave hospital last night.         
	Most of the miners returned home to colourful street parties.         
	I am so happy to see my wife and children, its wonderful. There were times when I never thought this moment would come, Avalos said, once again clutching his seven-year-old son Bairon, who captured the hearts of millions as he tearfully waited for his father at the entrance to the tunnel on Wednesday morning. Last night Bairon was still wearing the miners helmet his father had worn on his journey to the surface and a Superman outfit.         
	Avalos said the men kept hope of a survival by pulling together to beat hunger, thirst and desperation underground.         
	As a group we had to keep faith, we had to keep hope, we had to all believe that we would survive, he said.         
	Franklin Lobos, a former professional footballer, said he and his fellow miners had acted like a great football team.         
	We pulled together when things got rough, when there was nothing, when we needed to drink water and there wasnt any to drink, he said.        
	Edison Pena, 34, who kept himself fit underground by running daily through the dark corridors of the mine, was among the first three men to be released from hospital.         
	Los 33 as they have become known around the world have called in an accountant to manage their affairs after agreeing to divide all their earnings from interviews, media appearances, films or books.         
	Its logical. The media is earning a lot of money through us so we should get something too, Brunela Avalos, the wife of Renan Avalos, said.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

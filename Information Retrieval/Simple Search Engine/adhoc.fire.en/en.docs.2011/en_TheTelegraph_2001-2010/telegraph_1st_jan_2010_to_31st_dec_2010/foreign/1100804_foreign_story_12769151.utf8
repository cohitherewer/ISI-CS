	New York, Aug. 3 (Reuters): A New York city agency denied landmark status for an old building near the site of the September 11 attacks, clearing the way for the building to be torn down to make room for a Muslim cultural centre.        
	The City Landmarks Commission decision today allows the demolition of a building near where the World Trade Centers Twin Towers stood and paves the way for construction of the Cordoba House. It will include a prayer room and a 500-seat auditorium as part of a 13-storey cultural complex.        
	 Critics hoped to stall the project by having it declared a historic landmark, arguing it deserved protection because pieces from one of the hijacked planes hit the building. But commission members argued that the Italianate building from 1857 held no historic value.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      600,000-iPhone salute
                              An iPhone 4. (AP)                            
	Los Angeles/New York, June 16 (Reuters): Apple Inc sold more than 600,000 of its newest iPhone after a single day of pre-orders, blowing away most expectations and sending its shares up more than 2 per cent today.        
	Analysts said that put the new iPhone on track to surpass sales of the previous model, about 1 million units of which moved in its first three days.        
	Apple, which also makes the iPad and iPod, said it and carrier partner AT amp;T Inc had been forced to turn away many potential customers after the surprising volume of online orders triggered malfunctions in its order and approval systems.        
	Apple apologised for the snafu, asking iPhone faithful to try again. But AT amp;T said the availability of inventory would determine if it can resume taking orders.        
	Apple unveiled the slimmer, $199 iPhone 4 last week, kicking off its fastest-ever global product roll-out to try to stay a step ahead of rivals like Google Inc in a red-hot smartphone market.        
	The device boasts a higher-quality screen and better battery life, video chat via Wi-Fi, and a gyroscope sensor for improved gaming.        
	We apologise to everyone who encountered difficulties, and hope that they will try again ... once the iPhone 4 is in stock, Apple said.        
	AT amp;T, the exclusive US provider for iPhone, said orders of the iPhone 4 yesterday  the first day of online pre-orders  were 10 times higher than for the iPhone 3GS last year.        
	It said it chalked up more than 13 million visits to its website yesterday, including customers checking to see if they were eligible to upgrade to a new phone.

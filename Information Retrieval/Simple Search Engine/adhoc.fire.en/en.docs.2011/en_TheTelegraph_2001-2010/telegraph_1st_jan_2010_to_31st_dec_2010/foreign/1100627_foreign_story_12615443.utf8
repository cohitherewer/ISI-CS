	Dhahir (Iraq), June 26: The looting of Iraqs ancient ruins is thriving again.         
	This time it is not a result of the stuff happens chaos that followed the American invasion in 2003, but rather the bureaucratic indifference of Iraqs newly sovereign government.        
	Thousands of archaeological sites  containing some of the oldest treasures of civilisation  have been left unprotected, allowing what officials of Iraqs antiquities board say is a resumption of brazenly illegal excavations, especially here in southern Iraq.        
	A new antiquities police force, created in 2008 to replace withdrawing American troops, was supposed to have more than 5,000 officers by now. It has 106, enough to protect their headquarters in an Ottoman-era mansion on the eastern bank of the Tigris river in Baghdad and not much else.        
	I am sitting behind my desk and I am protecting the sites, the forces commander, Brig. Gen. Najim Abdullah al-Khazali, said with exasperation. With what? Words?        
	The failure to staff and use the force  and the consequent looting  reflects a broader weakness in Iraqs institutions of state and law as the American military steadily withdraws, leaving behind an uncertain legacy.        
	Many of Iraqs ministries remain feeble, hampered by corruption, the uncertain divisions of power and resources and the political paralysis that has consumed the government before and after this years election.        
	In the case of Iraqs ancient ruins, the cost has been the uncountable loss of artifacts from the civilisations of Mesopotamia, a history that Iraqs leaders often evoke as part of the countrys once and, anticipating archaeological research and tourism, future greatness.        
	The people who make these decisions, they talk so much about history in their speeches and conferences, said the director of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage, Qais Hussein Rashid, referring to the plight of the new police force, but they do nothing.        
	The looting today has not resumed on the scale it did in the years that immediately followed the American invasion in 2003, when looters  tomb raiders, essentially  swarmed over sites across the country, leaving behind moonlike craters where Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Persian cities once stood.        
	Even so, officials and archaeologists have reported dozens of new excavations over the past year, coinciding with the withdrawal of American troops, who until 2009 conducted joint operations with the Iraqi police in many areas now being struck by looters again. The antiquities police say they do not have the resources even to keep records of reported lootings.        
	Here in Dhahir, the looting is evident in the shattered bits of civilisation  pieces of pottery, glass and carved stone  strewn across an expanse of desert that was once a Sumerian trading town known as Dubrum.        
	 The bowls, vases and other pieces are destroyed and discarded by looters who seek gold, jewellery and cuneiform tablets or cylinders that are easy to smuggle and resell, according to Abdulamir al-Hamdani, a former antiquities inspector in Dhi Qar province.        
	For me, for you, it is all priceless, he said, but for them it is useless if they cant sell it in the market.

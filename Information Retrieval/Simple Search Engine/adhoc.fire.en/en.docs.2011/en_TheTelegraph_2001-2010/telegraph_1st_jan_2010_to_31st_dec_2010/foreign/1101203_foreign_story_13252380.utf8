The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 10 Grammy nominations for Eminem
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      10 Grammy nominations for Eminem
                              Eminem: Comeback trail                            
	Los Angeles, Dec. 2 (Reuters): Rapper Eminem, riding high on the comeback trail after spending several years battling drug addiction, led the field of Grammy contenders today with 10 nominations.        
	The 38-year-old hip-hop star will compete for the three big awards of album, song and record of the year, as well as in a host of rap categories.        
	Other leading nominees for the major music awards included rising R amp;B star Bruno Mars with seven nods, while rapper Jay-Z, flamboyant pop star Lady Gaga and country group Lady Antebellum picked up six nominations each.        
	Canadian teen idol Justin Bieber, mobbed by young girls everywhere as one of the hottest new commodities in the music world, led a strong international field for best new artist. He will compete for the coveted award alongside a compatriot, rapper Drake; two British bands, Florence amp; The Machine and Mumford amp; Sons; and American jazz singer Esperanza Spalding.        
	Winners in all 109 categories will be announced during ceremonies in Los Angeles on February 13.        
	Rock bands were largely missing from the leading categories, as pop, hip-hop and country artists grabbed the spotlight.        
	Grammy voters love to reward artists making career comebacks, especially if they have overcome an addiction or other personal setbacks along the way, and Eminem fulfills those criteria.        
	The rapper, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, went almost five years between studio albums. He spent much of his time holed up in his Detroit home battling an addiction to prescription medication, and nearly died of a methadone overdose in 2007.        
	Eminem returned to the limelight in May 2009 with Relapse, one of the biggest sellers of the year. It also won two Grammys in January, bringing his career tally to 11.        
	He returned in June this year with Recovery, which spawned two chart-topping singles, Not Afraid and Love the Way You Lie. The latter tune revolved around a dysfunctional relationship and struck a chord with women, a demographic hitherto underrepresented among Eminems fan base. It spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the US Hot 100 chart during the summer.        
	He has never won the album of the year award, and famously lost the race in 2001 to an unheralded album by veteran rock duo Steely Dan.        
	Bruno Mars, whose real name is Peter Hernandez, reached the top of the Hot 100 with Just the Way You Are in September, days after he was arrested on a cocaine charge in Las Vegas. The song marked his first charting single as a lead artist and it spent four weeks at No. 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | In Disneys Celebration, a murder for the first time
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      In Disneys Celebration, a murder for the first time

	Celebration (Florida), Dec. 3: As if the Thanksgiving murder were not enough to ruin things in this subdivision that Disney designed. Now, tanks and SWAT teams?        
	Here in a community built 14 years ago by the Walt Disney Company as the happiest subdivision on earth  and which, to be fair, has been largely free from urban strife  two major crimes in the span of less than a week have made even the fake snow that blankets the town square every evening hour seem a little less cheery.        
	Late last night, policemen barricaded several blocks in this neo-traditional town of 10,000 people and miles of white rail fencing, trying to talk a despondent and possibly armed man out of his home.        
	Earlier, the schoolhouse near the town square was locked down. Buzzing helicopters interrupted horse-and-carriage rides. Even the holiday cocktail party at the golf course was cancelled.        
	But the situation, which a policeman described as a domestic dispute involving a father who had lost a job and his marriage, was not even the worst of it in Celebration.        
	Sometime over Thanksgiving weekend, Matteo Patrick Giovanditto, 58, was murdered, the Osceola County Sheriffs Office said. It was the first murder in Celebration history. Concerned neighbours who had not heard from him went into his first-floor condo, one block from the artificial ice rink on the town square. He was on the floor covered with a blanket, according to the police.        
	Officers later located his black Corvette in a nearby town, but have yet to make an arrest. Residents were assured that there was nothing to fear. Theyve got some really substantial leads, said a police spokeswoman, Twis Lizasuain. We havent disclosed what we found, but it was a big break in the case to find the vehicle.        
	 Giovanditto, who was from Massachusetts, moved to Florida in the 1980s to teach, his cousin, Theresa Troiano from Tewksbury, Massachusetts. He was a wonderful young man from a big New England family, she said. We hope there is swift justice. Giovanditto moved to Celebration in 2004. He lived with his Chihuahua, Lucy, neighbours said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Beatles Abbey Road receives listed status
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Beatles Abbey Road receives listed status
          AMIT ROY                            (Top) The Beatles walk on the Abbey Road zebra crossing in north London for the iconic picture that was used on the cover of the Abbey Road album and (above) the crossing as it looks today                                 
	London, Dec. 22: If Mamata Banerjee really wants to turn Calcutta into something like London, she could take a tip or two from the way in which Abbey Road, rendered immortal by The Beatles, was accorded listed status today by the government.        
	On the face of it, the zebra crossing at Abbey Road in St Johns Wood in north London, close to Lords cricket ground, is like thousands of others all over the city.        
	But the crossing is just outside the Abbey Road studios where The Beatles recorded the vast majority of their songs. The studios were themselves listed in February this year.        
	Lesson Number One for Mamata: the British would much rather cut their wrists than rename or change Abbey Road.        
	 The world-famous zebra crossing, which features on the cover of The Beatles Abbey Road sleeve, has just been given Grade II listing by tourism and heritage minister John Penrose.         
	It follows advice from English Heritage, which seeks to preserve all that is culturally and historically significant about the past and merge it harmoniously with the new. Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr are seen crossing the road in Ian Macmillans iconic cover shot, later emulated by dozens of other bands.        
	The 1969 album was the last to be completed by The Beatles, although the earlier recorded Let It Be was actually the last to be issued.         
	 On behalf of the government, Penrose said: It is a fantastic testimony to the international fame of the Beatles that  more than 40 years on  this crossing continues to attract thousands of visitors each year, trying to mimic their iconic Abbey Road album cover.        
	 The news was also welcomed by McCartney  now Sir Paul McCartney, survivor of an expensive divorce battle with gold digger second wife Heather Mills  who declared: Its been a great year for me and a great year for The Beatles and hearing that the Abbey Road crossing is to be preserved is the icing on the cake.        
	 Historic listed status is normally granted only to buildings but English Heritage felt that the Abbey Road crossing had exceptional merit. Fans flock to the crossing from all over the world and for the 40th anniversary of the photoshoot on August 8 last year hundreds of people relived the moment.        
	 Penrose pointed out: This London zebra crossing is no castle or cathedral but, thanks to The Beatles and a 10-minute photo-shoot one August morning in 1969, it has just as strong a claim as any to be seen as part of our heritage. And as such it merits the extra protection that Grade II listing provides.        
	 Roger Bowdler, head of designation at English Heritage, added: This is obviously an unusual case, and although a modest structure, the crossing has international renown and continues to possess huge cultural pull the temptation to recreate that iconic 1969 album cover remains as strong as ever. Together with the nearby Abbey Road studios, also listed at grade II on our advice, they remain a mecca for Beatles fans the world over.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Narrow win for Polish moderate
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Narrow win for Polish moderate
                              Bronislaw Komorowski                            
	Warsaw, July 5 (Reuters): Moderate conservative Bronislaw Komorowski has narrowly won Polands presidency, setting the stage for a political alliance with Prime Minister Donald Tusk that will be expected to deliver promised economic reforms.        
	Komorowski, a member of Tusks Civic Platform party, won 52.6 per cent of votes in Sundays poll, according to results based on 95 per cent of the ballots, after a cliff-hanger vote that saw right-wing rival Jaroslaw Kaczynski perform much better than expected.        
	But political analysts said the unexpected tightness of the presidential race, the prospect of looming local elections and a parliamentary vote due in 2011 could lead Tusk to take a cautious approach in introducing potentially unpopular reforms.        
	(Komorowskis win is) market positive, Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients. However, these reforms look increasingly unlikely to happen quickly as local and parliamentary elections are approaching.        
	In Poland, the government sets policies and the ruling Civic Platform faces an elevated budget deficit, high public debt, a public health system in disarray and an inefficient pension system. Changes in the pension system could hit farmers, miners and teachers.        
	The President can propose and veto laws, have a say in foreign and policy issues and appoint key state officials.        
	Kaczynski, who heads the main right-wing opposition party and was vying to succeed his twin brother Lech whose death in a plane crash in April precipitated the vote, scored 47.4 per cent. Lech Kaczynski vetoed some of Tusks reforms in the past.        
	You have all the power now. Show us what you can do, Polands top-selling daily Fakt said on its front page, referring to Tusks office.

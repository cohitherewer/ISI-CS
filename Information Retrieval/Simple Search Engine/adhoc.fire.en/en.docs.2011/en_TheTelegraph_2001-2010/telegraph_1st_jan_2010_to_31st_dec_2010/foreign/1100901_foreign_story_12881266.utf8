	Tehran, Aug. 31 (Reuters): An Iranian newspaper said today that Carla Bruni, the wife of Frances President, deserved to die after she expressed solidarity with a woman sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery.        
	The hardline daily Kayhan called Bruni a prostitute whose lifestyle meant she deserved a similar fate as the Iranian woman who was sentenced to death for adultery.        
	Carla Bruni was one of several French celebrities who published open letters to Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, whose case has caused international outrage and highlighted Irans use of stoning as capital punishment.        
	The wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote: Spill your blood, deprive your children of their mother? Why? Because you have lived, because you have loved, because you are a woman, an Iranian? Every part of me refuses to accept this.

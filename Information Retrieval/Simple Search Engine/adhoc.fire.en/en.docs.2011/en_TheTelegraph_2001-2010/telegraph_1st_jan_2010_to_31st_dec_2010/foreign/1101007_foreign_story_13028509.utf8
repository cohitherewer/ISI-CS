	Stockholm, Oct. 6 (Reuters): A US and two Japanese scientists won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry today for inventing new ways to bind carbon atoms with uses that range from fighting cancer to producing thin computer screens.        
	Richard Heck, Ei-ichi Negishi and Akira Suzuki shared the prize for the development of palladium-catalysed cross-coupling, the Nobel Committee for Chemistry at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement. Palladium-catalysed cross-coupling is used in research worldwide, as well as in the commercial production of, for example, pharmaceuticals and molecules used in the electronics industry, the committee said.        
	Such chemicals include one found in small quantities in a sea sponge, which scientists aim to use to fight cancer cells. Thanks to the scientists chemical tool, researchers can now artificially produce this substance, called discodermolide.        
	Heck, now with the University of Delaware in the US, developed his work on palladium as a catalyst in the 1960s and early 1970s, while the other two came through with their variants of the same process in the late 1970s. Negishi, said he was sound asleep when the academy telephoned him at 5am local time.

          GORDON RAYNER AND ALEX SPILLIUS                          Bradley Manning                                  
	Washington, July 27: The investigation into the biggest leak in American military history centres on a US army intelligence analyst who allegedly boasted online that he was going to reveal the truth about the war in Afghanistan.        
	Bradley Manning, 22, was arrested in Baghdad in May and charged earlier this month with multiple counts of mishandling and leaking classified data, after a computer hacker turned him in.        
	During online chats with the hacker, a man thought to be Manning said he had passed material relating to Afghanistan to Julian Assange, the founder of the Wikileaks website which leaked more than 92,000 secret documents to the media.        
	Manning, who is currently awaiting court martial, is widely assumed to have been the man who passed the documents to Assange, though investigators believe he must have had accomplices.        
	Manning is alleged to be a whistle-blower who used the online name Bradass87 when he contacted a high profile Californian computer hacker, Adrian Lamo, on May 21.        
	Over the following five days, Bradass87 held a series of online conversations with Lamo, in which he identified himself as an army intelligence analyst, deployed to eastern Baghdad with unprecedented access to classified networks.        
	He said his job gave him access to two high security networks: the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, SIPRNET, which carries US diplomatic and military intelligence; and the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System, which carries material up to and including top secret classification.        
	Bradass87 said the networks had enabled him to see incredible things, awful things that belong in the public domain and not on some server stored in a dark room in Washington DC almost criminal political backdealings the non-PR version of world events and crises.         
	Manning said he had downloaded 260,000 classified or sensitive state department cables and transmitted them by computer to Wikileaks.        
	Obama control        
	President Barack Obama today sought to control damage from the explosive leak, saying he was concerned about the disclosure but it revealed little that was not already known. Obama insisted the leak underscored the need to stick to his approach and he urged Congress to approve critical additional funds for the war effort.

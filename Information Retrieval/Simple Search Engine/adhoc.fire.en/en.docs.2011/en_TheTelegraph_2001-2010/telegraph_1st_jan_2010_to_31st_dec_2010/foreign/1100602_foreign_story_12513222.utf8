                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Qaida number 3 killed in missile attack
          ERIC SCHMITT                          Mustafa Abu al-Yazid                                  
	Washington, June 1: The operational leader for al Qaida in Afghanistan was killed in an American missile strike in Pakistans tribal areas in the last two weeks, according to a statement the group issued late yesterday that American officials believe is correct.        
	The militant leader, Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, an Egyptian, was a top financial chief for al Qaida as well as one of the groups founders, and was considered by American intelligence officials to be the organisations No. 3 leader, behind Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, another Egyptian.        
	His death will only be a severe curse by his life upon the infidels, al Qaida said in a statement issued to jihadist websites and translated by the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors statements by jihadists.        
	A US official said American intelligence analysts believed the statement from al Qaida was accurate. They said the death of Yazid, also known as Saeed al-Masri, was a significant setback to al Qaidas ability to help plan and support cross-border attacks against American and allied forces in Afghanistan from its haven in Pakistans tribal areas.        
	Yazid was killed on May 22 in a drone attack in North Waziristan, a senior Pakistani intelligence official said today. The official said he was in the village of Boya, about 26km along a dirt track west from Miranshah, the main town in North Waziristan, when the missile struck.        
	 Yazid was considered to be the overall commander for al Qaida for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the official said.        
	In terms of counterterrorism, this would be a big victory, said the American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         
	Al-Masri was the groups chief operating officer, with a hand in everything from finances to operational planning. He was also the organisations prime conduit to bin Laden and Zawahri.        
	His death would be a major blow to al Qaida, which in December lost both its internal and external operations chiefs, the official said.        
	Yazid, 54, appeared in numerous video releases from as-Sahab, the media arm of al Qaida, since his first appearance on May 26, 2007, when he was formally introduced to the jihadist online community, according to Site.        
	Shortly after the suicide bombing against the CIA base in Khost in December, in which seven operatives and a Jordanian intelligence officer were killed, Yazid issued a statement praising the work of the bomber, Humam Khalil Abu Mulal al-Balawi, and said that the bombing was revenge for the killings of a number of militant leaders in drone attacks.        
	Under President Obama, the CIA has steadily increased the number of missile attacks against targets in Pakistans tribal areas by remotely piloted Predator and Reaper drones.         
	As of May 28, the CIA had carried out 38 strikes this year, compared with 53 for all of 2009, according to The Long War Journal, a website that tracks the number of strikes. The CIA has previously killed many of Yazids predecessors in al Qaidas No. 3 slot. Yazid was reported to have been killed by an airstrike in Pakistan before, in August 2008, only to reemerge and resume his operations.        
	Taliban pushed back        
	The Pakistani army declared victory over the Taliban in part of the tribal belt near Afghanistan.        
	The announcement about the Orakzai tribal region may free the army to send some troops to other districts where Islamist insurgents have bases that threaten the Pakistani state and US troops across the border. But the victory could also be fleeting  the army has declared success in other trouble spots in the past, only to see militants regroup and resurge.

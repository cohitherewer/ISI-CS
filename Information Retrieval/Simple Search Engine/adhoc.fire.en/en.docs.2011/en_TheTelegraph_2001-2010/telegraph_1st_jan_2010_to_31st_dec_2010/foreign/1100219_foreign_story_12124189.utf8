The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Anand Jon: Sex cases have left me broke
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Anand Jon: Sex cases have left me broke
                              Anand Jon Alexander                            
	New York, Feb. 18 (AP): Fashion designer and convicted rapist Anand Jon Alexander says his legal bills have exhausted his fortune.        
	However, Manhattan prosecutors are not so sure.        
	Prosecutors yesterday questioned whether Alexander needs two court-appointed, state-paid lawyers to fight charges of sexually molesting a dozen women in New York.        
	Assistant District Attorney Maxine Rosenthal noted that the former designer of $700 jeans paid lawyers to defend him against similar charges in California.         
	He was charging $700 for a pair of jeans, Rosenthal told a judge. The taxpayers of New York should not be paying for not only one but two lawyers.        
	The hearing in New York is separate from the case against Alexander in California, which concluded in 2008. The designer was convicted of sexually assaulting seven women and girls. He received a sentence of 59 years life- imprisonment.        
	Defence lawyer Adam Freedman said the California case took the vast majority of Alexanders money.         
	Alexander  known professionally as Anand Jon  maintains his innocence in both cases. Ive been incarcerated since 2007, Alexander, 37, told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Richard Carruthers. Ive been out of work since then.         
	Alexander, a former guest designer on Americas Top Model show, called prosecutors claims he is hiding money speculation.         
	One of his city-paid lawyers, Adam Freedman, told the judge his client has no resources left. He said Alexander needs two lawyers  paid $75 an hour each by taxpayers  because the case is complicated.         
	Alexander, who has worked with celebrities like Paris Hilton, pleaded not guilty to the New York charges. He faces 49 counts and up to 25 years in prison if he is convicted.

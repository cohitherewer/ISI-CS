	London, Jan. 8: A young maths prodigy who broke records with his GCSE results is set to achieve a new academic landmark.        
	Arran Fernandez has been offered a place at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, aged just 14. According to his father, Dr Neil Fernandez, it will make him the youngest Cambridge undergraduate since William Pitt the Younger went to the university at the same age in 1773.        
	The conditional offer was made after Arran, from Surrey, passed exams set by the university last summer. Prof. David Cardwell, who will be teaching Arran, said: Fitzwilliam College decided to make Arran a conditional offer after considering his application very carefully, as we do with all students who apply, regardless of background. The college looks forward to welcoming Arran in October 2010 should he meet his offer.

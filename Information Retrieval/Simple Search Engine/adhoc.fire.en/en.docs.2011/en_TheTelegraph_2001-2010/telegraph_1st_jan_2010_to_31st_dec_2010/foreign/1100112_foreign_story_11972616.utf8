The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Women with full lips look younger
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Women with full lips look younger
                              Seductive pout                            
	London, Jan. 11: Women who have plump full lips look younger than their years, scientists have said.        
	 Devotees of collagen injections and silicone implants have long believed it and now research has backed their theory that a bee stung pout can belie their true age.        
	Even if the woman in question has wrinkles, eye bags, sagging jowels and greying hair, a rosy and firm set of lips will make them appear younger.        
	 However, there is little women can do naturally to keep the youthful appearance of their lips because that is determined by genes rather than outside factors such as sun damage. David Gunn, a research scientist at Unilever, which funded the international study at seven universities, including St Andrews, said: When we identified people who looked young for their age, we were struck by the difference in their lips.        
	It is a feature that is strongly genetically determined and relatively easy to measure. The findings confirm the accepted idea of beauty, typified by actresses from Marilyn Monroe to Scarlett Johansson, who have both been noted for their seductive pouts. The lips of both men and women reach their fullest in early adulthood, but then start getting thinner between the age of 30 and 40.

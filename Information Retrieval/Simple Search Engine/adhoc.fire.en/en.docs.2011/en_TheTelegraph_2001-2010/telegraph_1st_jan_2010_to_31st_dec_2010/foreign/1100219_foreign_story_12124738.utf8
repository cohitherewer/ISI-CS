	Peshawar, Feb. 18 (AP): A bomb blast at a mosque in Pakistans northwestern tribal belt killed 29 people including some militants today.        
	The attack in Khyber tribal region came as US special envoy Richard Holbrooke met Pakistani leaders in Islamabad.         
	The bomb explosion tore through a mosque in the Aka Khel area of Khyber, killing at least 29 people and wounding some 50 others, local official Jawed Khan said.         
	Earlier reports had said the blast occurred in the Orakzai area at a cattle market. The two areas border one another, and the market is apparently near the mosque.        
	 Officials were still investigating whether the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber or a planted device. No group claimed responsibility, but Khan said the dead included militants.

	Breast bother    
	 Berlin, Nov. 25 (Reuters): A German woman who splashed out on breast implants with a loan from her then boyfriend now fears her assets could be re-possesed after she failed to fully reimburse him, the 20-year-old woman told Bild newspaper.      
	Her ex-boyfriend is demanding that she return the $5,865 he gave her to pay for her breast enlargement surgery in 2009 or he will call the police and get the repossessors involved, Bild reported yesterday.      
	Its true that Carsten signed a loan agreement shortly before the operation, the woman named only as Anastasia is quoted saying. The condition was that I wouldnt have to pay him back if I stayed with him for a year.      
	But the pair split shortly after she underwent the plastic surgery. The woman said she had transferred 3,000 euros into her ex-boyfriends account last week.    
	Jane knot    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Veteran Hollywood actress Jane Fonda is all set to tie the knot for the fourth time at the age of 72. The Monster-in-Law star, who survived a breast cancer scare recently, wants to seal her romance with music producer Richard Perry in marriage, reports the National Enquirer. Fonda underwent surgery earlier this month to remove a lump from her breast after doctors discovered a small non-invasive tumour during a routine check-up.     
	Rihanna

The 22-year-old, who tops the charts with her latest album Loud, has been dating baseball player Matt Kemp for a year now and is keen to settle down, reports Ace Showbiz. It could be a year from now. Whenever is right.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Interpol red corner notice for Assange
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Interpol red corner notice for Assange
          ALAN COWELL                          Under pressure                                  
	Paris, Dec. 1: Interpol has placed the founder of the WikiLeaks whistle-blowing web site on a so-called red notice wanted list following allegations of sexual misbehaviour by a Swedish prosecutor, according to the police organisations website today.        
	The notice said Assange, 39, was wanted for sex crimes on an arrest warrant brought by the international public prosecution office in Gothenburg, Sweden. Interpol is based in Lyon, France. Assanges whereabouts were not immediately known.        
	The development came as several newspapers, including The New York Times, published confidential documents from a mass of some 250,000 diplomatic cables from the state department in Washington including communications concerning American policy in Iran, Pakistan, Korea and many other places.        
	The Swedish prosecutors office said almost two weeks ago that a court in Stockholm had approved its request for the arrest of Assange to face questioning on charges of rape and other sexual offenses. Assange has strongly denied the accusations.        
	Marianne Ny, director of the Stockholm prosecutors office, said in a statement at the time that she had moved to have Assange extradited to Sweden on suspicion of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion. The accusations were first made against Assange after he travelled to Sweden in mid-August and had brief relationships with two Swedish women that he has described as consensual.        
	Lawyers acting for Assange appealed against the arrest warrant at Swedens highest court yesterday, The Associated Press said in a report that also quoted President Rafael Correa of Ecuador as dismissing an offer of residence in his country made to Assange by a lower official.        
	According to Interpols website, a red notice is not an international arrest warrant and it is up to national jurisdictions to decide how to act on them. Interpols role is to assist the national police forces in identifying or locating those persons with a view to their arrest and extradition, the website said.         
	These red notices allow the warrant to be circulated worldwide with the request that the wanted person be arrested with a view to extradition.        
	The latest leaks  following the release of documents relating to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  have provoked a furore within the Obama administration.        
	Visiting Kazakhstan, secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton called the leaking of the documents a very irresponsible, thoughtless act that put at risk the lives of innocent people all over the world, without much regard for those who are most vulnerable, including journalists.        
	But Assange found a possibly more predictable ally  his mother, Christine Assange, who runs a puppet theatre in Australias Queensland state, who told Australian radio that she was worried about her sons well-being, Reuters reported.         
	The Australian government, following the US, has reportedly launched an investigation into whether Assange and WikiLeaks had broken security or criminal laws.        
	Hes my son and I love him and obviously I dont want him hunted down and jailed. Im reacting as any mother would. Im distressed, she said.         
	According to accounts his accusers gave to the police and friends, they both had consensual sexual encounters with Assange that became nonconsensual. One woman said that Assange had ignored her appeals to stop after a condom broke. The other woman said that she and Assange had begun a sexual encounter using a condom, but that Assange did not comply with her appeals to stop when it was no longer in use.

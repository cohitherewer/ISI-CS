                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Medvedev hails US on arms pact
                            
	Moscow, Dec. 24 (Reuters): Russian President Dmitry Medvedev praised President Barack Obama today for winning US support for an arms treaty at the centre of a reset in ties and lamented the slow pace of his own drive to modernise Russia.        
	In an annual year-end interview with Russias three top television channels, Medvedev said carrying out his ambitious reform agenda would take time, but gave no indication of whether he would seek a second term in 2012.        
	Medvedevs remarks in a live television interview strongly indicated Russian lawmakers will follow the US Senate in ratifying the New Start treaty, despite criticism of wording attached to accompanying documents by their US counterparts.         
	He said Obama fulfills his promises.

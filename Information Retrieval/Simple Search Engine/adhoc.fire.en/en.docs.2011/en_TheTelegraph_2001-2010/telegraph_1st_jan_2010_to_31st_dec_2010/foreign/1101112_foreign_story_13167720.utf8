	Gypsy Anne    
	 London, Nov. 11 (PTI): Actress Anne Hathaway says she has a gypsy soul and would love to own houses all over the world.       
	The actress, who plays a woman suffering from Parkinsons disease who falls in love with a Viagra salesman in her new movie Love and Other Drugs, said: Id like to be a mother. Id like to travel. I would like to own homes in lots of places, because I have the gypsy wanderlust within me. All actors have it, we dont like to stay in one place too long.

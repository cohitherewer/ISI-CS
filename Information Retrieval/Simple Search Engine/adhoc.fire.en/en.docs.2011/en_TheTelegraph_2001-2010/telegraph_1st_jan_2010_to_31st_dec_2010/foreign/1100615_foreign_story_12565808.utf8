	June 14: A growing number of people claim to suffer from Sexsomnia, a type of sleeping disorder where sufferers have sex while they sleep, a new study has claimed.        
	Canadian researchers found almost one in 12 people had admitted engaging or initiating some sort of sexual activity while they slept. Men accounted for three-quarters of the self-reported sexsomniacs, they found.        
	Experts say such sexual behaviour that occurred while sleeping can range from masturbation to physical intercourse. In their study, presented at a recent sleep conference, researchers from the Sleep Research Laboratory at the University Health Network in Toronto, found the disorder was more common than previously thought.        
	In the study, which has not been published, researchers interviewed 832 patients who they suspected of suffering from some sort of sleep disorder. The 428 men and 404 women, who had also been referred to the clinic, also completed questionnaires about their symptoms, fatigue, mood and behaviour during sleep.

	Miami, June 17: An heiress has left her $8.3 million Miami Beach home and a $3 million trust fund to her three dogs.        
	Gail Posner, daughter of the corporate takeover king Victor Posner, died aged 67 in March, but her three dogs continue to have full-time staff, wear $14,803 Cartier necklaces and enjoy weekly spa treatments.        
	However, Conchita, a chihuaha, and two other dogs called April Maria and Lucia, might have to scale back on the luxuries if Posners only son, Bret Carr, a filmmaker, gets his way.        
	He claims his mother was brainwashed into leaving so much of her fortune to her pets by her household staff, who were left a total of 20 million in her 2008 will. The document left him with just a 600,000 inheritance.         
	In a lawsuit filed in Florida, he says his mother should have left the entire estate to him.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

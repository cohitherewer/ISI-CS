	London, Feb. 10: An Arab ambassador has called off his wedding after discovering his wife-to-be, who wears a face-covering veil, is bearded and cross-eyed.        
	The envoy had only met the woman a few times, during which she had hidden her face behind a burqa, the Gulf News reported. After the marriage contract was signed, the ambassador attempted to kiss his bride-to-be. It was only then that he discovered her facial hair and eyes.        
	The ambassador told an Islamic Sharia court in the United Arab Emirates that he was tricked into the marriage as the womans mother had shown him pictures of her sister instead of his bride-to-be.        
	He demanded that the contract be annulled and that the woman pay him 500,000 dirhams (85,000) for clothes, jewellery and other gifts he had bought for her.        
	The court annulled the contract but rejected the ambassadors demand for compensation.        
	The report did not identify the ambassador.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

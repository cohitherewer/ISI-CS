	London, Jan. 2 (PTI): Actress Pamela Anderson let her hair down at a New Years party but ended up having a wardrobe malfunction.         
	The Baywatch actress was hosting a party at Paramount Studios in Hollywood when her white dress slipped down. She had come on stage to count down the final minutes of 2009. However, Anderson did not realise the malfunction until singer Adam Lambert, who too had joined her on stage, pointed it out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hungary toxic spill
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hungary toxic spill
                                  
	Budapest, Oct. 5 (Reuters): Hungary declared a state of emergency in three western counties today, the day after a torrent of toxic red sludge from an alumina plant reservoir tore through local villages, killing four people and injuring 120.        
	The red mud, waste generated during bauxite refining, poured through Kolontar and two other villages yesterday after bursting out of a containment reservoir at the nearby Ajkai Timfoldgyar Zrt plant, owned by MAL Zrt.        
	Today the Natural Disaster Unit (NDU) said four more villages were affected and the death toll had risen to four. Six people were known to be missing. Many others were suffering from burns and eye irritation caused by the lead and other highly corrosive elements.         
	The flood, estimated at about 700,000 cubic metres, threw cars off roads and damaged bridges and homes, forcing the evacuation of about 400 residents. We have declared a state of emergency in Veszprem, Gyor-Moson-Sopron and Vas counties, government spokeswoman Anna Nagy told Reuters.        
	In Veszprem county its because that is the scene of the disaster and the sludge is headed towards the other two counties.        
	The National Disaster Unit (NDU) said clean-up crews were pouring plaster into a nearby river to help neutralise the spill and that attempts were being made to prevent the sludge getting into the Danube river, a major European waterway.        
	MAL Zrt said in a statement today there had been no sign of the impending disaster, adding the last examination of the reservoir pond on Monday had shown nothing untoward.        
	MAL also said the red sludge did not qualify as hazardous waste according to European Union standards and added that 96-98 per cent of the sludge had remained in the reservoir.

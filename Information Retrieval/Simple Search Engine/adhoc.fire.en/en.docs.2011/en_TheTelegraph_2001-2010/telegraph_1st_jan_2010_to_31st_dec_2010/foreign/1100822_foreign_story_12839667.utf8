	Rome, Aug. 21 (AP): Woody Allen said in an interview that Frances First Lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was very professional on the set of his movie Midnight in Paris.        
	Allen told Italian daily Corriere della Sera in the interview published today that working with Bruni-Sarkozy was smooth and pleasant. The ex-supermodel was on set in July for her appearance in Allens romantic comedy, which stars Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard.        
	Corriere said Allen made the comments in a phone interview from Paris.        
	Allen says Bruni-Sarkozy plays a guide at the Rodin Museum and that she was so good hes going to keep all her scenes in, according to the newspaper. He said French President Nicolas Sarkozy came to the set one evening because he was curious to see his wife act.        
	Speaking about her role last year, Bruni-Sarkozy said she was looking forward to a great experience. Id like to, you know, when Im a grandmother, to have done a Woody Allen film, she said.        
	But with only one previous cameo appearance to her name, she admitted that she may not be a natural actress.

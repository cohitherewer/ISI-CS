The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pakistanis end US tour over screening
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pakistanis end US tour over screening

	Islamabad, March 10: A tour of the US arranged by the state department to improve ties to Pakistani legislators ended in a public relations fiasco when the members of the group refused to submit to extra airport screening in Washington.        
	They are now being hailed as heroes on their return home.        
	People should be thankful, you made them so proud, said Hamid Mir, the host of a popular national talk show, during an interview in his studio yesterday with four of the six politicians, who railed against the security precautions at Ronald Reagan National Airport.        
	Meetings with the Obama administrations top policy makers on Pakistan, including the Presidents special representative, Richard C. Holbrooke, and visits to the Pentagon and the National Security Council, did not allay the anger the politicians said they felt at being asked to submit to a secondary screening on Sunday before boarding a flight to New Orleans. They declined to be screened and did not board the flight.        
	The leader of the parliamentary group, Senator Abbas Khan Afridi, said in an interview yesterday that before they were to board the flight for New Orleans, he and his colleagues were selected from a crowd of passengers at the airport and asked to stand aside.        
	They were then asked to accept a full-body scan by a machine, he said. Such body-scanning units are in use at 19 airports across the US, and more are being installed.        
	One of Afridis colleagues, Akhunzada Chitan, told Mir on his Capital Talk programme, Going through a body scan makes you naked, and in making you naked, they make the whole country naked.        
	The lawmakers were chosen to visit the US by the political section of the American embassy. Officials are eager to reach out to political figures from the isolated tribal areas of Pakistan.

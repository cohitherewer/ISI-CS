	May 25: A mobile phone company has suspended the number 0888 888 888  after every single person assigned to it died in the last 10 years.        
	The first owner Vladimir Grashnov  the former CEO of Bulgarian mobile phone company Mobitel which issued the number  died of cancer in 2001 aged just 48. Despite a spotless business record there were persistent rumours that his cancer had been caused by a business rival using radioactive poisoning.        
	 The number then passed to Bulgarian mafia boss, Konstantin Dimitrov, who was gunned down in 2003 by a lone assassin in the Netherlands during a trip to inspect his 500 million drug smuggling empire. Dimitrov, who died aged 31, had the mobile with him when he was shot while eating out with a model. Russian mafia bosses  jealous of his drug smuggling operation  were said to have been behind the killing.        
	The phone number then passed to Konstantin Dishliev, a crooked businessman, who was gunned down outside an Indian restaurant in Bulgarias capital Sofia after taking over the jinxed line. Dishliev, an estate agent, had secretly been running a massive cocaine trafficking operation before his assassination in 2005.He died after 130 million of the drug was intercepted by police on its way into the country from Colombia.        
	Since then, the number is understood to have been dormant while police maintained an open file on Dishlievs killing and his smuggling ring. Now phone bosses are said to have suspended the number for good. Callers now get a recorded message saying the phone is outside network coverage. A Mobitel spokesman would only say: We have no comment to make. We wont discuss individual numbers.

	Lennon lyrics    
	 London, April 29: John Lennons handwritten lyrics to A Day in the Life, considered one of The Beatles greatest songs, are expected to sell for up to $700,000 at an auction in New York, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Sothebys auctioneer, which described it as the revolutionary song that marked the Beatles transformation from pop icons to artists, expects the manuscript to fetch $700,000.      
	The single sheet of paper features a rough draft of the lyrics, including crossings out and a spelling error where film is written as flim.       
	 the reverse side is a neater version written in capital letters and with fewer corrections.      
	Apparently added later is the line: I love to turn you on, for which the song was banned by the BBC when it first came out in 1967 because the words were deemed to be a reference to taking drugs.

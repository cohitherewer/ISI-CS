The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Row over language divides Belgium
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Row over language divides Belgium

	Wemmel (Belgium), July 17: Most of the families living in this well-to-do community on the outskirts of Brussels are French-speaking. But the law for this region of Belgium says that all official town business must be conducted in Flemish.        
	That means that police reports must be written in Flemish. Voting materials must be issued in Flemish. Seventy-five per cent of the books and DVDs purchased for the library must be, yes, in Flemish.        
	When the mayor of Wemmel, Christian Andries, presides over a town council meeting he is not allowed to utter a single French word, even to translate, or the business at hand may be annulled.        
	Of course, he said recently, with a sigh. It is absurd. Belgium is without a government  again. And this picturesque bedroom community with a cobblestone square offers a clear enough picture of why.         
	Europe as a whole may be busy papering over its differences, burying cultural disparities and centuries of feuding. But not Belgium. It seems headed the other way.        
	It was, in fact, a dispute over voting rights for French speakers in Wemmel and a cluster of similar villages that brought down Belgiums last government. Unable to resolve the issue after more than three years of trying, Prime Minister Yves Leterme threw in the towel (for the third time) and the king finally accepted his resignation in April.         
	In the wake of last months elections, talks have begun in hopes of forging a coalition that can lead Belgium. But even the optimists do not expect a new government for months to come.        
	After the countrys 2007 election it took the Belgians about nine months to form a government.         
	Some analysts say that the main parties are even more split this time, and some wonder whether they may even be witnessing the beginning of the end of Belgium.        
	For Andries, this state of affairs comes as no surprise.         
	A friendly man of Flemish descent, he has been juggling the tensions between the two halves of Belgium for more than a decade, running a town that is technically on the Flemish-speaking side of the country, but that has become home to many French speakers looking for trees and backyards not far from Brussels.        
	Andriess house was covered in protest placards once because he was accused of forcing his librarian to write letters in French to French theatres inquiring about materials that might be available for the library. Not allowed. He should have sent the letters in Flemish, which is really just a Belgian variant of Dutch.        
	Last year, he was heavily criticised in local Flemish papers for putting new windows in the school for French-speaking Belgians before replacing those in the Flemish school.        
	But Andriess problems pale compared with those of three other mayors in this Flemish region, called the Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde, or BHV. They were elected more than four years ago but have never been officially installed.         
	The issue? They sent voting information, written in French, to the French-speaking voters in their communities. In one of the towns, Linkebeek, some 80 per cent of the 4,700 inhabitants are French-speaking.

	Mother Gisele    
	 New York, Sept. 23 (PTI): Gisele Bundchen has said she found it difficult to adjust to motherhood initially but has now realised how wonderful it is.      
	Bundchen, 30, who gave birth to son Benjamin, her first child with husband Tom Brady, in December 2009, cant imagine her life without her baby, reports the New York Post.      
	I love being a mother. It is challenging and it is different when everything is not about you and your life  now there is someone much more important. It takes some adjusting, but it is so, so wonderful, said Bundchen. She married New England Patriots quarterback Brady in February.

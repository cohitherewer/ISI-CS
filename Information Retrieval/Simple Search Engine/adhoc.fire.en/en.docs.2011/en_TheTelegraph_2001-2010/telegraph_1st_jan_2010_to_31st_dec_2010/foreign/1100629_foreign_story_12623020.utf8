                              Byrd                            
	Washington, June 28 (Reuters): US Senator Robert Byrd, who evolved from a segregationist to a civil rights advocate in becoming the longest serving member ever of the Congress, died today.        
	First elected to Congress in 1952, Byrd was 92.        
	His death is not expected to have any immediate impact on the Democrats 59-41 control of the Senate. West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin is virtually certain to appoint a fellow Democrat to succeed Byrd.        
	Byrd helped shape much of the nations history and served with a dozen Presidents. He died peacefully at a hospital outside Washington, DC. Byrd was hospitalised last week with what doctors believed was a heat-related illness. I love to serve. I love the Senate. If I could live another 100 years, Id like to continue in the Senate, Byrd said.

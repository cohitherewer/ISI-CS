The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Le Carre: 007 is a gangster

          ANITA SINGH                          John Le Carre: Scathing                                  
	Aug. 17: To his millions of fans around the world, James Bond is the quintessential British spy.        
	Yet to John Le Carr, 007 is a neo-fascist gangster who would ply his trade for any country provided he could get a plentiful supply of beautiful women and dry Martinis.        
	In a 1966 interview with Malcolm Muggeridge, newly re-discovered in the BBC archive, the author and creator of the decidedly unglamorous spy George Smiley was scathing in his assessment of Ian Flemings suave secret agent.        
	 I dislike Bond. Im not sure that Bond is a spy. I think that its a great mistake if ones talking about espionage literature to include Bond in this category at all, Le Carr said.        
	It seems to me hes more some kind of international gangster with, as it is said, a licence to kill... hes a man entirely out of the political context. Its of no interest to Bond who, for instance, is President of the United States or of the Union of Soviet Republics.        
	Reflecting on the interview today, which is to be re-broadcast on BBC Four next week, Le Carr tells the Radio Times: These days I would be much kinder. I suppose weve lost sight of the books in favour of the film versions, havent we? I was a young man and I knew that I had written about the reality in The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and that the Fleming stuff was a deliberate fantasisation of Flemings own experiences when he was safely in New York.        
	But at the root of Bond there was something neo-fascistic and totally materialist. You felt he would have gone through the same antics for any country really, if the girls had been so pretty and the Martinis so dry.        
	Le Carr drew on his own experiences to write his espionage thrillers, including Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, in which Smiley played the central role.

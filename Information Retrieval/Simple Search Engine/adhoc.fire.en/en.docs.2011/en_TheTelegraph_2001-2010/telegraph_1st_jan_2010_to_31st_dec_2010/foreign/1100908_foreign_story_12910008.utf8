                              Obama speaks at a rally in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (AP)                            
	Washington, Sept. 7 (PTI): President Barack Obama has accused his Republican opponents of talking about him like a dog as he launched the Democratic partys election campaign in Wisconsin ahead of the November Congressional mid-term polls.         
	Some powerful interests who had been dominating the agenda in Washington for a very long time are not always happy with me, he said while addressing a Labour Day crowd yesterday in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.         
	They talk about me like a dog. Thats not in my prepared remarks, but its true, the President was quoted as telling the union crowd by the Daily Telegraph newspaper today.         
	Obama accused the Republicans of devastating the middle class and driving the economy into a ditch. They (Republicans) think youll forget what their agenda did to this country. They think youll just believe that theyve changed.         
	These are the folks whose policies helped devastate our middle class and drive our economy into a ditch. And now theyre asking you for the keys back, he said, hinting at the recent accusations carried out by his critics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama ratings drop to 46%
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama ratings drop to 46%
          ALEX SPILLIUS                          Record low                                  
	Washington, March 13: President Barack Obama yesterday delayed a trip to Asia amid falling approval ratings and grave doubts that his 11th hour attempt to push health care reform through Congress will succeed.        
	A new poll by Gallup showed Obamas approval rating at a record low of 46 per cent since taking office. In the optimistic early days of his presidency 69 per cent approved of the job he was doing.        
	Doubts about his ability to pass his flagship domestic policy have affected his popularity among Democratic supporters, while independents and Republicans have grown wary of health care reform as an expensive government venture.        
	 Obama had set Democratic leaders in Congress a deadline of March 18 to coral the votes necessary to pass health care without any support from Republicans, by using a procedure known as budget reconciliation.        
	He was supposed to leave on the same day for Guam, Indonesia and Australia. Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world where the President spent four years as a boy, is expected to be the high point.        
	The decision was made after a meeting between his aides and the Democratic caucus on Thursday made it clear how much work was yet to be done.        
	But with the future of health care change now in critical condition the White House has decided Obama needs to stay in Washington to twist arms in Congress. A likely target will be up to 12 Democrats who say they will not vote for the proposed bill because it doesnt prevent federal funds being used for abortions.

	London, March 4 (PTI): For someone like Uma Thurman, juggling work and family life can be difficult.         
	However, the actress insists that she is a devoted mother for her kids so that they dont feel insecure in life.         
	Thurman, who has daughter Maya, 11, and son Levon, eight, with ex-husband Ethan Hawke, believes she needs to stay steady around her kids to stop them from growing insecure.

	Singapore, Nov. 5 (AP): A Qantas Boeing 747 with 431 people on board landed safely in Singapore late today after reporting an engine problem shortly after takeoff, the airline said.        
	The problem arose just a day after a Qantas Airbus A380 superjumbo jet made an emergency landing at the same airport because of an engine blowout.        
	Flight QF6 from Singapore to Sydney had a snag on its number one engine  one of four  but the problem on the Boeing plane was not immediately specified. The airline indicated it was not a serious problem and the same plane was being used when the flight departs later.        
	Qantas said the captain of the jumbo jet sought priority clearance to return to Singapore as a precaution. There are 412 passengers, three flight crew and 16 cabin crew. According to Qantas website, Flight QF6 is a Boeing 747-400, which is fitted with four Rolls-Royce RB211-524G-T engines. The daily flight operates between Frankfurt and Sydney with a stopover in Singapore.         
	The website said the problem with the engine was not serious and the flight will continue on its onward journey.        
	After the Airbus A380 emergency landing yesterday, Qantas grounded its fleet of A380s and other airlines made checks of their planes that have the same Rolls-Royce engine. The A380 shed debris from the busted engine onto the Indonesian island of Batam.

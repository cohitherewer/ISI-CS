                          New Journey                    
	London, May 10: A piece of Sir Isaac Newtons apple tree is being carried into zero-gravity space on the next Nasa shuttle mission.        
	The section of wood, from the original tree from which the apple fell that inspired Newtons theory of gravity, is normally kept in the Royal Societys archives. It was lent to British-born astronaut Piers Sellers, who will be taking it into orbit, as part of the academic institutions 350th anniversary celebrations.        
	The tree sample will be accompanied on its trip in- to space by an image of Sir Isaac, also donated by the Royal Society. Sellers said: Were delighted to take this piece of Sir Isaac Newtons apple tree to orbit. While its up there, it will be experiencing no gravity.        
	Im pretty sure that Sir Isaac would have loved to see this, assuming he wasnt spacesick, as it would have proved his first law of motion to be correct. After the flight, we will be returning the piece of tree and a flown picture of Sir Isaac Newton back to The Royal Society.        
	Lord Rees, Sir Isaacs successor as the current president of the Royal Society, said: We are both pleased and proud that such an extraordinary part of scientific history and important element of the Royal Societys archive collection can make this historic trip into space.

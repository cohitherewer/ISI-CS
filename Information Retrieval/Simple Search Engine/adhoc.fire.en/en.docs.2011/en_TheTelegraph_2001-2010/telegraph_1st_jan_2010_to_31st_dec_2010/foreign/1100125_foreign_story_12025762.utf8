	Split buzz     
	London, Jan. 24 (PTI): Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have reportedly decided to go their separate ways by ending their five-year-old fairytale romance.      
	The Hollywood stars, known as Brangelina, have reportedly signed a 205 million split deal after meeting a top divorce lawyer.      
	Legal papers, which the pair allegedly signed this week, reveal they plan to share their fortune equally and the custody of their six children, the News of the World has reported.      
	Preparations for the break-up reportedly began in December when they visited a Los Angeles legal firm to carve out a deal, dividing the property between them. Pitt, 45, and Jolie, 34, are expected to announce their break-up soon.    
	Victoria    
	 London: Victoria Beckham seems to have made peace with flat shoes as she stepped out wearing ballet flats. The former spice girl had swore she would never wear ballet flats as she beyond hated them, but she has finally given in, as the years spent wearing her trademark heels take their painful toll.

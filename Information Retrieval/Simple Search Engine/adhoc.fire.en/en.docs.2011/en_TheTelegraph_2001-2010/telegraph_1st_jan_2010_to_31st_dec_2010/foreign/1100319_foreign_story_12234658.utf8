	 London, March 18 (PTI): Fashionista Victoria Beckham wants her seven-year-old son Romeo to take over her fashion as he is very into what he wears.       
	The former Spice Girl turned fashion designer, who has sons Brooklyn, 11, Romeo, seven and Cruz, five, with her husband David Beckham, says designing clothes is now her full-time job and something which may even be carried on by her son.      
	I think that my middle son thinks that he is going to take over. Romeo likes to get involved, Victoria said.

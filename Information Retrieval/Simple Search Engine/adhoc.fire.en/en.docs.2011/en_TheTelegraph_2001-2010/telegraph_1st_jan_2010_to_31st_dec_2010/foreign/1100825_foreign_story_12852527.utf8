                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      George Michael faces jail 
                            
	London, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Singer George Michael admitted today that he had been under the influence of cannabis when he crashed his car into a north London shop in July.        
	The judge at the magistrates court who heard the 47-year-old stars guilty plea warned Michael he could face time in jail when he returns to be sentenced on September 14.        
	I make it clear the options in respect of sentence remain open, including the power to imprison, Robin McPhee told the court. It is a serious matter. Your driving was extremely poor and there was an accident. There is also a conviction from three years ago.

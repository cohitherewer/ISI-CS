	Nov. 15: President Obamas picture book for kids, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters, pays tribute to 13 Americans whose traits he sees in his own children.        
	The 31-page book, for kids ages 3 and up, is filled with lyrical questions for Malia, 12, and Sasha, 9, opening with, Have I told you lately how wonderful you are?        
	The book, out tomorrow, is illustrated with Loren Longs paintings of the Obama girls and their dog, Bo, as well as the 13 famous Americans as kids and grown-ups.        
	A series of two-page spreads asks questions (Have I told you that you are creative?) across from short tributes. He writes of Georgia Keeffe: She helped us see big beauty in what is small: the hardness of stone and the softness of feather. His most controversial choice may be Sitting Bull, who defeated Custer at Little Bighorn: (A Sioux medicine man who healed broken hearts and broken promises.)        
	Obamas publisher says hes not planning interviews or events for the book. His royalties are to go to a scholarship fund for children of soldiers killed or disabled.        
	Obama has written two best sellers: Dreams From My Father, a 1995 memoir reissued in 2004, and 2006s The Audacity of Hope. The first printing for his kids book is 500,000 copies.        
	Long, 46, who has illustrated picture books by Frank McCourt and Madonna, says that after reading Obamas manuscript for the first time, all I wanted to do was share its powerful message with my own two sons.        
	Obamas lawyer, Robert Barnett, says the manuscript was written between the 2008 election and the 2009 inauguration.        
	Republican deal        
	Obama said yesterday he was hopeful of working out a deal with Republicans over tax cuts and of winning ratification of a new nuclear weapons treaty with Russia.        
	On his way back from a 10-day trip to Asia, Obama looked ahead to a dinner he will host on Thursday with leaders of both parties and said he believed opposition Republicans would engage constructively.        
	There are going to be some disagreements. There may be some need for compromise, he told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington.        
	But Obama said he thought he and the lawmakers could hammer out agreements on issues pending for the final weeks of the current session of Congress, including making sure that taxes dont go up for middle-class families starting January 1 and enacting measures to help businesses and spur economic growth.        
	On the treaty with Russia, Obama said there was recognition in Congress of the importance of cooperating with Moscow on a range of issues.        
	My hope and expectation is that, given this is a good treaty, given it has the support of previous Republican senior government officials, that we should be able to get it done, he said.

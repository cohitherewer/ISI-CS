The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | JihadJane tied to plot to kill Swede cartoonist

          CHARLIE SAVAGE AND ANAHAD CONNOR                          Colleen R. LaRose alias JihadJane. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, March 10: A Pennsylvania woman who called herself JihadJane was tied Tuesday to an alleged assassination plot against a Swedish cartoonist who depicted the prophet Muhammad atop the body of a dog.        
	In an indictment unsealed yesterday, federal prosecutors accused Colleen R. LaRose, an American from the suburbs of Philadelphia, of linking up through the Internet with militants overseas and plotting to carry out a murder.        
	LaRose, 46, was arrested in Philadelphia in October, but her case was kept under seal. Although the indictment does not identify the target, a law enforcement official said her case was linked to the arrests yesterday of seven Muslims in Ireland in connection with a scheme to kill the cartoonist, Lars Vilks. A group linked to al Qaida had put a $100,000 bounty on his head for the cartoon, which the group perceived as an insult to Islam.        
	European news reports said the Irish police, who arrested the four men and three women in Cork and Waterford, had coordinated the operation with the US. A justice department spokesman would not confirm whether LaRose had been involved with the Irish assassination plot.        
	Mark T. Wilson and Rossman D. Thompson, federal public defenders in Philadelphia who are representing LaRose, declined to comment.        
	She is one of just a handful of women charged in the US with terrorism offences in recent years. Michael L. Levy, the US attorney for eastern Pennsylvania, said the case illustrated how terrorists were looking for American recruits who could blend in. It shatters any lingering thought that we can spot a terrorist based on appearance, he said.        
	LaRose is white, with blond hair and green eyes, according to the law enforcement official, who was not authorised to share details of the case and spoke only on the condition of anonymity. The official said LaRose was born in Michigan and later lived in Texas and Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.        
	The indictment said that in mid-2008, LaRose, using the aliases JihadJane and Fatima LaRose, began posting on YouTube and other Internet sites messages about her desire to help Muslims. By early 2009, the court papers said, she was exchanging email messages with unidentified co-conspirators in southeast Asia and Europe and expressed a desire to become a martyr for an Islamist cause. The indictment refers to e-mail messages in which a conspirator, citing how LaRoses appearance and American passport would make it easier for her to operate undetected, allegedly directed her in March 2009 to go to Sweden to help carry out a murder.         
	She agreed to do so, writing, I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying, the indictment says. She and another unnamed American later posted online solicitations for money for that project, the document said.        
	 LaRose had attracted the governments attention by then, the indictment said. She was questioned by the FBI agents on July 17, 2009, and falsely told them that she had never solicited money online for terrorism, had never used the alias JihadJane and had never made postings on a terrorist website, the court papers say.         
	She is also charged with making false statements.        
	Despite drawing the FBIs attention, the indictment says LaRose travelled to Europe in August, joined an online community hosted by the intended Swedish victim in September and performed online searches to track him. She apparently never attempted to carry out the killing.        
	The indictment also says LaRose recruited other people on the Internet to wage or support jihadist attacks.

	Aug. 18: Being married or in a long-term relationship improves your ability to deal with stress, a new study suggests.        
	Scientists found students given tests they believed would affect their career prospects had much less of the stress hormone cortisol flowing through their bodies if they had a partner. Cortisol is released when the body is stressed and is part of its fight or flight reaction to danger. It is seen as a measure of how stressed someone feels.        
	What we found is that marriage has a dampening effect on cortisol responses to psychological stress  and that is very new, Prof. Dario Maestripieri, the lead researcher, said.         
	The finding may go some way towards explaining previous studies that have shown married people live longer and have less heart disease and other health problems.        
	Prof. Maestripieris researchers got 500 students  almost half of whom were married or in relationships  to play a series of economic computer games which were said to be part of their exams.         
	Saliva samples were taken before and after to measure hormone levels and changes. Each student was told that the test was a course requirement.        
	Concentrations of the hormone increased in all participants  particularly among the women. But a piece of personal information collected beforehand provided another interesting difference within the subjects.        
	We found unpaired individuals of both sexes had higher cortisol levels than married individuals, Prof. Maestripieri said.

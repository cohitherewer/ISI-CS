The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Zardari wins Swiss case fight
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Zardari wins Swiss case fight

	Islamabad, April 12: Asif Zardari, the President of Pakistan, has won a long-running fight against prosecution in Switzerland after the Swiss attorney-general ruled he holds immunity under international law.        
	The announcement is a victory for Zardaris long-running fight against prosecution but is unlikely to mark the end of the saga, with Opposition leaders insisting they will continue to campaign for his arrest. Zardari and his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, the former Prime Minister, were convicted by a Swiss court in a $15 million money-laundering case in 2003.         
	They denied the charges and appealed.        
	Last month, Pakistans anti-corruption agency said it would ask Switzerland to re-open the cases. However, Daniel Zappelli, Geneva attorney-general, said there was no legal basis for such a move.

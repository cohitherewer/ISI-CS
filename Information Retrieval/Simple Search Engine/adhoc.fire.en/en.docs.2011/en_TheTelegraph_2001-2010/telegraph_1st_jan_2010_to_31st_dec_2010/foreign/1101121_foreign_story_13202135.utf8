                              FBI ROLE                            
	London, Nov. 20 (PTI): Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has teamed up with his father George to produce a new movie about the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy.         
	The father-son duo are adapting the book Legacy of Secrecy: The Long Shadow of the JFK Assassination for the big screen and plan to release the movie in 2013 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Kennedys murder, reports the Daily Star.        
	The former President was shot dead in 1963 while he was riding in a motorcade through Dallas, Texas, with his wife Jacqueline.         
	According to sources, DiCaprio is expected to play the role of FBI informant Jack Van Laningham, who got close to Mafia boss Carlos Marcello to determine if he was involved in a plot against Kennedy.

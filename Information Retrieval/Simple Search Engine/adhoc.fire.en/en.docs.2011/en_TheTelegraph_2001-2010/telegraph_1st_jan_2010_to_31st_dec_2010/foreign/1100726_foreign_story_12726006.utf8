	Duisburg, Germany, July 25 (AP): The Love Parade, the German festival billed the worlds largest techno music party, would never be held again, its founder declared after a stampede killed 19 people on Saturday.        
	The Love Parade was always a peaceful event and a happy party but would forever be overshadowed by the tragedy, Rainer Schaller said. Its over for the Love Parade, he added.        
	Police said the death toll rose to 19. Over 340 people had been injured in a panicked crush of partygoers in an overcrowded tunnel that served as the sole entrance to the festival.        
	Schaller spoke at a media conference where authorities faced tough questions, but provided few details about why hundreds of thousands of people were funnelled through a single highway underpass into the former freight railway station used to host the party.        
	German media reported that there were at least 1.4 million people but police did not confirm that estimate.        
	Detlef von Schmeling, the police chief in Duisburg, said that 16 of the 19 people killed have been identified so far. He said they include an Australian, an Italian, a Chinese citizen and a person from the Netherlands. Von Schmeling said their ages ranged from just over 20 to 40.        
	Witnesses said officers in Duisburg, a city near Duesseldorf in western Germany, closed the end of the tunnel emptying onto the festival grounds after they become overcrowded around 5pm. They told revellers over loudspeakers to turn around and walk back in the other direction. But the entrance to the tunnel did not appear to have been closed and people continued piling in, sparking a panic and then the deadly crush.        
	Witnesses described a desperate scene, as people piled up on each other or scrambled over others who had fallen. Partygoer Udo Sandhoefer told a television channel that even though no one else was being let in, people still streamed into the tunnel, causing a real mass panic.        
	At some point the column (of people) got stuck, probably because everything was closed up front, and we saw that the first people were already lying on the ground, he said.        
	City officials chose not to evacuate the site, fearing it might spark more panic, and many people continued partying, unaware of the deaths. Rescue workers carried away the injured as techno music thundered in the background.        
	Other workers had trouble getting to the victims, hampered by the huge crowds. Local media reported that the cellphone system in Duisburg broke down temporarily.        
	Several media outlets also reported that rescue helicopters had problems taking away the heavily injured because there was not enough space for them to land.        
	The Love Parade, where people from across Europe gather to dance, watch floats and listen to DJs spin, was once an institution in Berlin, but has been held in the industrial Ruhr region of western Germany since 2007.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK will be more expensive for Indians

          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Dec. 10: For Indian students coming to the UK was expensive enough. From 2012, when the annual fee universities can charge will double to 6,000, the UK will be out of reach for all but the very rich  unless the Indian government and the corporate sector put money into thousands of scholarships.        
	 If this were not bad enough, the fine print is worse. In exceptional circumstances, universities (read Oxbridge) can charge up to 9,000 a year.        
	 Multiply by 70 rupees to the pound and the truth will be exceedingly harsh and probably crush a thousand dreams. The Chinese government, meanwhile, has taken a policy decision to send 70,000 students to the UK for long term strategic reasons.        
	 The question is: can India match China? The US is taking many more Indian students but the UK is still better for some subjects. Many Indian students also feel more at home in a country where quite a few have relatives.        
	 The rise in fees applies to domestic students in England but it is unlikely universities can charge one rate for local students and a lower one for Indians and other foreigners.        
	 The government does not appear to have really thought through whether it wishes to have overseas students. They are obviously a valuable source of income, especially as they usually pay a great deal more than domestic students.        
	 In the case of Indians, the brightest also help to raise academic standards in the best universities. British governments also see the virtue of training the leaders of tomorrows India.        
	 There are over 30,000 Indian students who have come to the UK but the Home Office is also deeply concerned about bogus pupils who are seeking ways to evade immigration control. The result is that one part of government is happy to see more Indian students come to the UK, but another part has been charged with the contrary task of reducing immigration drastically.        
	 Although the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government has a notional majority of 84, this came down to 21 last night when MPs voted on whether to raise fees to 6,000 and 9,000 in exceptional circumstances.        
	 Some junior ministerial aides resigned, while 21 Lib Dem MPs defied their leader Nick Clegg by either voting against the bill or abstaining. The issue has serious consequences for the coalition because during the election campaign the Lib Dems had pledged not to raise the fees. But the proposal has been piloted through parliament by a senior Lib Dem, Vince Cable, the business secretary.        
	 The basic problem is that central government grants to universities is being cut by 80 per cent because expenditure is having to be pruned. The shortfall can only be met by raising fees but this means students will graduate with loans of between 30,000 and 50,000 which they will have to pay back when they start earning. But the reality is that many students will be saddled with loans for decades, possibly for the rest of their lives.        
	 Britain is broke and there is no easy solution to university funding. Labour is giving moral support to the demonstrators though not to the violent mobs but if it returned to power it would probably have to adopt very similar policies.        
	 Cable had indicated he would abstain on his own bill but later announced he would support it after all. He is known to be a deeply troubled man who is having to do what he had said he would not do. Much the same goes for Clegg.        
	 Cable now says he is proud of the governments package which he describes as progressive. He argues it would maintain high quality universities in the long run.        
	 It is possible some poor students will be deterred from going to university. They will include some British Indians but probably many from Pakistani, Bangladeshi and West Indian backgrounds. Thus, an unhealthy rift might widen in society. Cameron has also pointed out that if he did not raise the fees, the universities would have to prune the numbers of students they were taking in.

	Bangkok, Nov. 16 (Reuters): Thailand extradited today suspected Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout to the US to face terrorism charges, ending a two-year wrangle between the former Cold War foes.        
	The 43-year-old former Soviet air force officer, dubbed the Merchant of Death, was flown out of Bangkok on a small, chartered US aircraft shortly after Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva cleared the extradition. Bout had been fighting extradition since his March 2008 arrest in Bangkok in a US-led sting operation.        
	Russia said Thailands extradition of Bout to the US was illegal. It is deeply regrettable that the Thai authorities have yielded to political pressure from outside and carried out this illegal extradition of V.A. Bout, Russias foreign ministry said. It added that Bout faced a politically motivated extradition that could undermine strengthening US-Russian ties.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Russia ex-tycoon found guilty

          CLIFFORD J. LEVY AND ANDREW E. KRAMER                          Khodorkovsky in a Moscow court. (Reuters)                                  
	Moscow, Dec. 27: A judge in Moscow today handed down a new conviction against Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former oil tycoon, in a case that has been widely seen as an indicator of the Kremlins tolerance for political dissent.         
	Khodorkovsky, who has already been imprisoned for seven years after feuding with Vladimir V. Putin, was found guilty on embezzlement charges that could keep him behind bars for several more years.         
	Formerly Russias richest man, Khodorkovsky, 47, is the countrys most well-known prisoner, and his treatment has been held up by opponents of the Kremlin as evidence that the justice system here is readily manipulated by those in power.         
	The judge did not immediately pass sentence, and it was unclear when he might do so. While a guilty verdict was expected, the length of the sentence will be scrutinised as a sign of whether the Kremlin wants to loosen or tighten control over the political system.         
	Putin, the former President and current Prime Minister, has often assailed Khodorkovsky as a criminal who ordered his associates to kill people so that he could amass wealth. Just this month, Putin referred to Khodorkovsky as a thief who should sit in jail.         
	A short prison sentence might be considered a victory for Putins protg, President Dmitri A. Medvedev, a former law professor who is thought of as less of a hardliner.         
	Medvedev has been promoting policies to modernise Russia, and analysts say the Khodorkovsky case is an obstacle towards convincing foreign investors that the countrys legal system is fair.         
	 Khodorkovskys co-defendant and business associate, Platon L. Lebedev, was also found guilty today by the judge, Viktor Danilkin.         
	 Khodorkovsky earned his fortune in the rough-and-tumble 1990s after the fall of Communism, snapping up state-owned oil fields at a fraction of their worth and then creating one of the worlds largest oil companies.

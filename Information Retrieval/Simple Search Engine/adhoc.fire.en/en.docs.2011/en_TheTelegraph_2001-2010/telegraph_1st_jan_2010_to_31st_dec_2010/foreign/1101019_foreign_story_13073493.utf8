  - Officials delay announcement; nullification cloud on 1 million votes        ALISSA J. RUBIN                      Hamid Karzai                                
	Kabul, Oct. 18: The results of the September 18 Afghan parliamentary elections, which were to be announced yesterday, have been postponed after an assessment that fraud was widespread and that nearly 25 per cent of the votes are likely to be thrown out.        
	The fraud, which included ballot-box stuffing, citizens forced to cast their votes at gunpoint, corrupt election officials and security forces complicit with corrupt candidates, is expected to mean that 800,000 to a million votes will be nullified, according to two Western officials who are following the election closely.         
	The Afghan Independent Election Commission, which oversees the counting, has refused to disclose the number of votes that could be thrown out, but said in a statement that it had decided to nullify wholly or partially the votes cast at 430 polling places, and that votes at another 830 sites were being audited, suggesting substantial problems.         
	Until now the commission has been praised for endeavouring to run an honest vote-counting process, but the delay at the last minute, as hundreds of candidates have thronged to Kabul clamouring to know the results, has raised questions.         
	In an emailed statement released just two hours before a planned news conference to announce the results, the commission said it would make the announcement on Wednesday.         
	The reason for the delay in results is to be more accurate and precise, the announcement said.         
	People close to the commission said that at least 89 per cent of the votes had been counted and sifted for fraud in all provinces, but that in the majority, a few votes remained to be counted and commission members wanted to wait until the count was complete.         
	Afghan and Western observers said, however, that they were worried that the commission was coming under enormous political pressure to change the outcome, especially for a handful of powerful figures.         
	You can do a lot of mischief in three days, said a Western observer knowledgeable about the election process.         
	The commission worked intensively through the weekend and until 4am yesterday to reach the almost complete results, according to an election commission official, a statement that indicated that, up until the last minute, the commission planned to make the announcement yesterday.         
	At stake is the makeup of the Wolesi Jirga, the lower house of the Afghan parliament and the only body with the power to question the policies of President Hamid Karzai.         
	The lower house must approve his ministers and pass and reject laws proposed by the President and his ministers, and may demand explanations of government policies.         
	Although Karzai and his inner circle backed a number of candidates, it is so far unclear whether they did well enough to guarantee him the 130 seats he sought  enough to be sure of a majority on important issues.         
	The main opposition to the President, Abdullah Abdullahs Coalition for Hope and Change, is watching the moves of Karzais candidates closely to be sure they do not displace any of the coalitions candidates.         
	Whether this election turns out to be another embarrassment for the country because of the rampant fraud, as last years was, rests on the shoulders of the election commission, which is responsible for holding the election and counting the votes, and the Electoral Complaints Commission, which handles accusations against individual candidates.         
	Last year the election commission was accused of bias toward President Karzai and either overlooking or assisting in the widespread fraud.         
	It was the complaint commission that restored a modicum of integrity by ultimately throwing out more than a million votes in last years presidential election.         
	This year, Karzai is perceived to have weakened the complaint commission by changing its structure so that a majority of members were Afghans rather than international representatives.

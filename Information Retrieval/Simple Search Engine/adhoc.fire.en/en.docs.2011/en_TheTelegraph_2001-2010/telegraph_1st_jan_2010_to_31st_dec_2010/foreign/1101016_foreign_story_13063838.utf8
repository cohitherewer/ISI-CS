The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US attacks to nudge Taliban towards deal
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US attacks to nudge Taliban towards deal

	Kabul, Oct. 15: Airstrikes on Taliban insurgents have risen sharply here over the past four months, the latest piece in what appears to be a coordinated effort by American commanders to bleed the insurgency and pressure its leaders to negotiate an end to the war.         
	American pilots pounded the Taliban with 2,100 bombs or missiles from June through September, with 700 in September alone, Air Force officers here said yesterday. That is an increase of nearly 50 per cent over the same period last year, the records show.         
	The stepped-up air campaign is part of what appears to be an intensifying American effort, orchestrated by General David H. Petraeus, to break the military stalemate here as pressure intensifies at home to bring the nine-year-old war to an end.         
	And it seems increasingly clear that he is partly using the attacks to expand a parallel path to the end of the war: an American-led diplomatic initiative, very much in its infancy but ultimately aimed at persuading the Taliban  or large parts of the movement  to make peace with the Afghan government.         
	In recent weeks, American officials have spoken approvingly in public of new contacts between Taliban leaders and the Afghan government.         
	Nato-led forces under Gen. Petraeus acknowledged their involvement by helping the passage of several very senior Taliban commanders to Kabul to hold talks with the Afghan government.        
	On the diplomatic front, Afghan leaders said yesterday that they were seeing what they believed were the first positive signs from the Taliban. In a news conference in Kabul, Burhanuddin Rabbani, the leader of a council charged with making peace, said that discussions with Taliban leaders  carried out through third parties  were under way.         
	The Taliban have not rejected peace completely, said Rabbani, a former Afghan president. They want the talks to take place, he added.         
	For all the efforts, Gen. Petraeus was quick to play down any suggestion that peace was at hand. quot;They certainly would not rise to the level of being called negotiations, he said.        
	However, on the battlefield, there are few indications that the large increase in firepower ordered by President Obama is having the intended effect. With the American-led war moving through its bloodiest phase since 2001, more American and Nato soldiers have been killed this year than at any time since the war began. In the past two days alone, at least 14 members of the Western forces here have been killed.         
	Indeed, senior American officials, gathering at a Nato conference in Brussels, indicated that they were trying to energise a peace process about whose contours and duration they could only guess.         
	President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and his advisers have been trying for months to engage the Talibans leaders about the possibilities of ending the war. In part, Karzai and his team are motivated by concerns about Obamas plan to begin reducing the number of American forces by next July.         
	So far, those diplomatic efforts have come to naught. Pakistani officials helped scuttle an incipient dialogue that was unfolding earlier this year.         
	For their part, the Talibans leaders have mostly dismissed the possibility of making a deal with Karzais government, declaring  not without reason  that time is on their side.         
	Some Afghan experts believe that Natos two-track strategy is flawed  that bleeding the Taliban may actually make the insurgents less inclined to negotiate. Matt Waldman, an independent analyst who has worked extensively in the region, said that it was unlikely that many Taliban leaders could order their men to stop fighting.         
	Its dangerous to assume that you can bring off a senior commander and all his men will follow, Waldman said.

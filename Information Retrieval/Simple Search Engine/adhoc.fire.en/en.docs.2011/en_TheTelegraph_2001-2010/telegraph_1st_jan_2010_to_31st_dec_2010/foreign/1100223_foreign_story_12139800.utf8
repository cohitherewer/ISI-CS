The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pro-monarchy strike in Nepal
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pro-monarchy strike in Nepal

	Kathmandu, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Shops closed and vehicles stayed off the roads in Kathmandu today in response to a strike called by a party supporting Nepals deposed king, the first closure by the royalists since the monarchy was abolished.        
	A special constituent assembly dominated by the Maoist former rebels abolished the 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, turning the majority-Hindu nation into a secular republic and ending a decade-long civil war that caused more than 13,000 deaths.        
	The Rastriya Prajatantra Party-Nepal that called the strike is demanding a plebiscite on whether the monarchy should be reinstated and whether Nepal should again become a Hindu nation.        
	People should be allowed to make a choice through a referendum, said Kamal Thapa, the party chief. Analysts said the royalists were re-asserting themselves.        
	They are exploiting the disarray in politics and peoples disillusionment with the current rulers, said Kunda Dixit, editor of the weekly Nepali Times.        
	Getting rid of a Hindu monarchy and bringing in a secular republic has not improved the peoples lives, Dixit added.        
	Today, hundreds of riot police stood guard at deserted streets but no major incident of violence was reported. The royalists also plan to block entry tomorrow to the Singha Durbar office complex, which houses the Prime Ministers office.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bilawals political baptism on Saturday
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bilawals political baptism on Saturday
                              Bilawal Bhutto                            
	London, Aug. 5 (PTI): President Asif Ali Zardaris son Bilawal Bhutto may face his political baptism here when he formally takes over the reins of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party from his father.        
	Bilawal, 21, described by the BBC as the young heir to Pakistans most important political dynasty, is expected to take over at a rally in Birmingham in central England on Saturday.         
	Bilawal, who has graduated with a degree in history from Christ Church college at Oxford, considered to be cradle of politicians worldwide, has been at his fathers side during his recent visit to France and the UK.         
	The young Bhutto, who is already the chairman of the PPP, is expected to give a speech before several thousands of his party supporters.        
	Because of the floods and terror attacks in Pakistan, the PPP is playing down the significance of the event. Bilawal will be there and will make a speech, the PPP coordinator Waheed Rasab said here. The rally would be a significant pointer, the party leader said in London.

                              Split final                            
	Los Angeles, June 29 (Reuters): Actress Sandra Bullock and her estranged husband Jesse James have filed divorce papers in Texas, ending their nearly five-year marriage after he admitted to infidelity, according to reports yesterday.        
	People magazine said the divorce papers were filed under seal last week, and that a representative for Bullock confirmed the divorce is final.        
	Bullock seemed to be on top of the world several months ago when she won the best actress Oscar for playing a tough-talking Texan socialite in the football film The Blind Side. But only days later her marriage to James was rocked by reports of his cheating.

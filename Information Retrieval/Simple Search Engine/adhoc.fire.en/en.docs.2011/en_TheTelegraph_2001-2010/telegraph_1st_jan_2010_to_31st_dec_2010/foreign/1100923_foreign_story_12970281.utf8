          DUNCAN GARDHAM                          Daniel Craig as James Bond                                  
	London, Sept. 22: The real James Bond was an incorrigible raconteur with a penchant for pretty women and fast cars, a new history of MI6 reveals.        
	Commander Wilfred Dunderdale was known as Biffy because of his prowess as a boxer in the Royal Navy at the end of World War I, according to the first official history of the service.        
	A picture from a false identity card shows he lacked his fictional counterparts good looks but Dunderdale is said to have become close friends with Ian Fleming, author of the James Bond novels in later life, and claimed to recognise some of his own stories in the books.        
	A man of great charm and savoir faire, in old age he became an incorrigible raconteur, according to Prof. Keith Jeffery of Queens University, Belfast, who was given access to all MI6 files from when it was founded in 1909 until 1949.        
	He liked to tell the story of how, while still in his teens, as interpreter for a (Tsarist) White Russian general, he found himself translating outside a railway sleeping compartment where the general and his British mistress were seducing each other. When head of the Secret Intelligence Service Paris station in the 1930s, he had a penchant for pretty women and fast cars.        
	The book, MI6, the History of the Secret Intelligence Service, also relates how the writers Graham Greene, Arthur Ransom, Somerset Maugham and Malcolm Muggeridge worked for MI6 along with the Oxford philosopher A.J. Ayer and the celebrated Sidney Reilly, the ace of spies.        
	The book says Dunderdale was the son of a British naval engineer based in Odessa, spoke fluent Russian and began work on special intelligence duties in the port of Sevastopol in 1919.        
	One of his first important jobs was the debriefing of Georgievitch Bajanov, a secretary to the Soviet politburo who had been an assistant to Joseph Stalin in 1923, who defected in 1928 along with a Russian cavalry officer.        
	Bajanov was taken to Paris, where Dunderdale was based, for interview and the British spy reported back to London that he had extracted 140 pages of information about the organisation of the Soviet communist party and the OGPU secret police, along with lively pen-portraits of around two dozen of the party leaders.        
	The Russians later discovered Bajanov was missing along with some very important documents according to a British agent in Denmark, and they sent out instructions to their agents to render him innocuous.        
	When the Germans invaded France in May 1940, Dunderdale withdrew from Paris to Orleans. In Orleans, he was stationed next to the largest ammunition dump in France. He reported back that if the dump were to be struck, he had been told he would suffer an instantaneous and painless death.        
	Dunderdale escaped back to London where he ran Section A4 and within weeks set about inserting agents into occupied France, eventually helping send 57 agents.        
	Pieter Tazelaar, a Dutch agent not sent by Dunderdale but very much in the James Bond mould, landed at 4.35am on November 23, 1940, at Scheveningen in the Netherlands, near the seafront casino, dressed in a specially designed rubber oversuit which he stripped off to reveal full evening dress. A few drops of Hennessy XO brandy were sprinkled on him to strengthen his party-goers image.        
	Unfortunately at least two of Dunderdales networks, nicknamed Felix and Fitzroy, were uncovered by the Germans and their radio operators captured.        
	Claude Lamirault, one of Dunderdales agents who was in Britain at the time, insisted on being dropped blind into France where he salvaged the remains of his group and managed to evacuate six important agents through Spain and Gibraltar, according to the book.

	Baghdad, April 23 (Reuters): A series of bombs targeting Shia areas rocked Baghdad today, killing at least 56 people in an apparent backlash after Iraq touted a series of blows against a weakened al Qaida-led insurgency.        
	Eight people were also killed by bombs in the Sunni west of the country, less than a week after Iraqi security forces backed by US troops killed al Qaidas top two leaders in Iraq.        
	Thirteen blasts hit different areas of the Iraqi capital around the time of Muslim prayers, mostly near Shia mosques and at a marketplace.         
	Three bombs targeted worshippers outside the main office of anti-American Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr in the crowded Sadr City slum. Those blasts killed 39 people and wounded 56, generating denunciations of the security forces. Some youths threw stones at an Iraqi army vehicle.        
	Why do they always target us? We are peaceful people. We come to pray and then go on our way, one survivor said.        
	The attacks, one of Iraqs deadliest in recent weeks, also wounded around 120 people and signalled the possibility of a rise in violence after a March national election produced no clear winner and left a power vacuum for insurgents to exploit.        
	Targeting prayers in areas with a certain majority, Baghdad security spokesperson Qassim al-Moussawi said, referring to Iraqs Shia Muslim majority, is a revenge for the losses suffered by al Qaida. We expect such terrorist acts to continue.        
	Last Sunday, al Qaidas leader in Iraq, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the purported head of its affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq, were killed in a raid in a rural area northwest of Baghdad by Iraqi and US forces.        
	The strike against al Qaidas Iraq leadership has been accompanied by a string of smaller battlefield victories in which more than 300 suspected al Qaida operatives have been arrested and 19 killed.        
	In another of todays attacks, 11 were killed by a car bomb and a suicide bomber near a Shia mosque in al-Ameen district in southeastern Baghdad. A car bomb killed five near a mosque in the northwestern neighbourhood of al-Hurriya, police said.        
	These are acts of revenge that are intended to send a message to the Iraqi government and the world that al Qaidas existence will not be affected by the killing of specific leaders, Iraqi political analyst Hameed Fadhel.        
	Several hours earlier, seven members of one family were killed in a series of blasts in Khalidiya, a town in Iraqs turbulent western province of Anbar. One police officer died trying to defuse a bomb.        
	The mainly Sunni province of Anbar has been relatively quiet since tribal leaders in 2006 started turning on Sunni Islamist groups such as al Qaida who had once dominated it. But insurgents continue to operate in the vast desert province.        
	At four in the morning, I heard a movement behind my house and found some barrels nearby, so I took my family out of the house, said Fadhil Salih, a judge at the Khalidiya courthouse.        
	An hour later the bomb went off and destroyed my house but, thank God, there were no casualties in my family, Salih said.        
	At least 10 people were wounded, including two policemen. Authorities imposed a vehicle ban after the blasts.        
	Iraqi officials say they have been expecting revenge attacks after the victories against al Qaida in the past month.

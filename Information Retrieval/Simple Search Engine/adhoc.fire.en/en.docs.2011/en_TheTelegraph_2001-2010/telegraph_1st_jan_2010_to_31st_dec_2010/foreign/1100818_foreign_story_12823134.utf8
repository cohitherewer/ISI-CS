                              Rooney Mara: Big chance                            
	Los Angeles, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Little-known American actress Rooney Mara has landed the lead role opposite Daniel Craig in Hollywoods version of Stieg Larssons best-selling book The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Columbia Pictures said yesterday.        
	Mara, 25, will play Lisbeth Salander  the smart but anti-social pixie-haired hacker and investigator  in the sought-after role that reportedly saw the likes of Ellen Page, Natalie Portman and Carey Mulligan as possible contenders.         
	Craig will play journalist and amateur sleuth Mikael Blomkvist in the movie, which starts shooting next month.

	Islamabad, April 2 (PTI): Pakistan Attorney General Anwar Mansoor Khan today resigned citing a lack of cooperation from the law minister Babar Awan.        
	Khans resignation comes a day after he accused Awan of blocking efforts to implement the Supreme Courts order to re-open graft cases against President Asif Ali Zardari in Switzerland. He told an apex court bench, headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, that he was facing obstacles in reopening the cases and that he was not being allowed to work properly.         
	Khan said the law ministry had not given him many documents which he required to re-open the cases. On being asked by the judges as to who was creating the obstructions, Khan named the law ministry, law secretary Aqil Mirza and Awan, a close aide of Zardari.

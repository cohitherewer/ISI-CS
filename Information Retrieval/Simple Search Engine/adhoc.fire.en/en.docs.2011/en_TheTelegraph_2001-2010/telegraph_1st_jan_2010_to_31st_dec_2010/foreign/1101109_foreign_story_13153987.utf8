The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bush critical of Barack
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bush critical of Barack
                                  
	New York, Nov. 8 (PTI): Former President George W. Bush criticised the policies of his successor Barack Obama, saying he has made a mess of relations with Pakistan and is worried about Americas strategy on Afghanistan, the Daily News said.        
	Bush, who generally has a policy of not criticising Obama, thinks he has failed as President and made a mess of relations with Pakistan, a Republican official close to Bush was quoted as saying by the Daily News. He thinks the policy is adrift, the official said.         
	While worried about the present Afghanistan strategy, Bush supports the troop surge and more muscular drone strikes against terrorist targets, he said. I want my President to succeed because if my President succeeds my country succeeds, and I want my country to succeed, Bush said when asked about Obama.         
	He had earlier dubbed Republican leader Sarah Palin as unqualified to be the next head of state. Naming Palin makes Bush think less of McCain as a man. He thinks McCain ran a lousy campaign with an unqualified running mate and destroyed any chance of winning by picking Palin, the Republican official was quoted as saying. Following its take-over of the House of Representatives in the mid-term elections, the Republican Party is assessing its chances at winning the 2012 presidential race, and political heavyweight Sarah Palin is being considered as a front-runner.

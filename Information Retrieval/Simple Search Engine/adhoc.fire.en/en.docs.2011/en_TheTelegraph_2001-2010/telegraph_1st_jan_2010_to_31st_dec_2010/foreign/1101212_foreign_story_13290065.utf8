The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Depp amp; Jolie are the real Tourist attractions
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Depp amp; Jolie are the real Tourist attractions
  - ITS LIKE BEING IN A ROCK CONCERT          ANTHONY BREZNICAN                          Depp and Jolie in a scene from The Tourist. (AP)                                        
	Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie may be living tourist destinations. Whenever they appear in public, a crowd gathers  a big one  which is news to no one, except perhaps director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who found himself trying to film a scene with them at a Venice train station before an audience of thousands of spectators.        
	Why is it we go so crazy about actors? he says. What is it that makes 70,000 people stand around a train station while were shooting a little scene there, shouting Angie! and Johnny! at the top of their lungs? Seventy thousand? The filmmaker laughs. Thats what it felt like. It felt like being at a rock concert.        
	The two stars of The Tourist are among only a handful of actors who count these days as global figures. Depp is the titular tourist, with Jolie playing a mysterious woman who draws him into her dangerous world. As the films producer Graham King (The Departed) says, they connect with people whether its Venice, California, or Venice, Italy.        
	To be successful in this business, youve got to have chemistry with the audience, King says. Part of the reason may be their wandering personalities  a nomadic tendency that may lend each of them a cross-cultural familiarity. Each has a rebellious spirit, a defiance and individuality, all virtues that arent restricted to any border.        
	Here we have people who will not let themselves be defined by anyone except themselves, says von Donnersmarck, an Oscar winner for the German drama The Lives of Others. (As actors) they have the ability to make that spirit visible.        
	One of Johnny Depps favourite things to do is go people-watching, which is inconvenient because a favourite activity of many people is Johnny Depp-watching. There was a strange moment, and I dont quite know when it happened, but for an actor, like a journalist in a way, the initial ingredient to the gig is to observe the situation youre in, to observe people, Depp says.        
	Im still fascinated watching people. But at a certain point, the coin flipped and I became the one being observed. It sort of puts a damper on me being the observer.When he visits a place, he says: I still get the opportunity to at least soak up as much of the place and culture as possible.                            USATODAY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thai red shirts offer compromise path
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Thai red shirts offer compromise path
                            
	Bangkok, April 23 (Reuters): Red shirt protesters offered a compromise to the Thailand government today, a day after a series of grenade attacks in Bangkok, saying they would accept dissolution of the parliament in 30 days rather than immediately.        
	They also called on Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to begin an independent probe into a deadly clash between protesters and the army on April 10 that killed 25 people, and said troops must be withdrawn from areas around their protest site.        
	The government must stop all threats against our movement, Weng Tojirakarn, a red shirt leader, said from a stage at their protest site in the heart of Bangkoks commercial district.        
	The new demands came shortly after army chief Anupong Paochinda told a meeting of his commanders there would be no crackdown on the protesters camped out in the capital because it would do more harm than good.        
	Five grenade attacks in Bangkoks bustling business district yesterday night killed one person and wounded more than 80 people, fueling concern over the escalating crisis and putting the city of 15 million people on edge.        
	Thousands of red-shirted supporters of ousted Premier Thaksin Shinawatra remain in a fortified encampment at a ritzy shopping area of central Bangkok, vowing to stay until Vejjajiva dissolves the parliament for new elections.        
	The grenade blasts near the racy bars of Patpong came 12 days after a failed army attempt to evict protesters from a rally site, which killed 25 and injured over 800 in the countrys worst street violence in 18 years.        
	The violence and the deepening political divide have spurred talk of civil war in Southeast Asias second-biggest economy.        
	The government is far from controlling the situation, Thailands largest broker, Kim Eng Securities, said in a note to clients. Reds have denied their involvement. But if they are indeed behind the (grenade) attacks, these powerful explosions right in the army-barricaded area demonstrate they are well-prepared to wage a full-scale war.        
	Today morning, police demanded the red shirts dismantle their barricade of tyres, bamboo poles and chunks of concrete near the entrance to Silom Road and the business district.         
	They pulled back after the red shirts poured fuel on the barricade, but remained on alert in the area. Troops are also stationed there.

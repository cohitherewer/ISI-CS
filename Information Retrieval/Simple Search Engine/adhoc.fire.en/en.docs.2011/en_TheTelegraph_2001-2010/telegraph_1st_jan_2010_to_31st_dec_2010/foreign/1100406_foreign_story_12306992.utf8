	 London, April 5 (PTI): At 4 feet 3 inches from nose to tail and weighing over 22kg, Darius is the worlds biggest rabbit and he is still growing.      
	Darius is just over 12 months old and his breeder Annette Edwards expects him to add to his size and weight during the next six months. His diet comprises of 12 carrots, six apples and two cabbages per day, said Edwards who is also a former pet shop owner.

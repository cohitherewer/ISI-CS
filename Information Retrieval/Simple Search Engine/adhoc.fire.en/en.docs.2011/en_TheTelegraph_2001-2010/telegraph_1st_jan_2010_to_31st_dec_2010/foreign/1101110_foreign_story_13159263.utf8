The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China asks Japan not to attend Nobel meet
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China asks Japan not to attend Nobel meet
                            
	Tokyo/Beijing, Nov. 9 (Reuters): China has asked Japan not to attend a Nobel Peace Prize ceremony honouring Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, Japans foreign minister said, in a move that could further strain Sino-Japanese ties after a recent territorial row.        
	Beijing has already warned European nations that supporting the jailed Chinese democracy activist would be seen as an affront to Chinas legal system. Diplomatic sources said China had sent letters to ambassadors in Oslo discouraging them from showing up at the December 10 ceremony.        
	However, European countries are planning to attend the ceremony, France said today, rebuffing calls from China for its trade partners to boycott the event.        
	Beijing is already preventing Lius associates from leaving the country, with his lawyer Mo Shaoping stopped by police today after trying to board a plane to London for a conference.

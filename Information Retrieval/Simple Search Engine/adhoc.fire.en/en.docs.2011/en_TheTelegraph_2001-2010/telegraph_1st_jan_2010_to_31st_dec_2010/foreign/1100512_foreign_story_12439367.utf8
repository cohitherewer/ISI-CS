	New York, May 11 (Reuters): A Chilean wine bested two of Bordeauxs Premier crus, two California cult wines and Super Tuscan in a blind tasting by about 100 of New Yorks top critics, sommeliers and retailers on Monday.        
	In an experiment similar to the famedJudgment of Paris in which California wines were blind tasted against the best of France  and won, the Chileans had a similar, if not quite as surprising result.        
	The New York tasting was actually a repeat of tastings that had been conducted for critics and connoisseurs in Berlin, Tokyo, Beijing, Amsterdam and London.        
	The red that captured first place: Errazuriz KAI. Napa Valleys cult classic Opus One was ranked second and Bordeauxs Chateau Haut-Brion came in third. All the wines competing  including Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, Tuscanys Sassicaia and Napas Stags Leap SLV  were of the 2006 vintage.        
	None of the wines tasted were cheap, but the five Chileans which included Errazuriz Don Maximiano, which placed fourth, La Cumbre, number six and Vinedo Chadwick  tied for ninth place  cost less; sometimes a lot less.        
	Errazuriz Kai, which is made mostly of Carmenere grape, retails for about $80 a bottle in the US, while Opus One 2006, a Bordeaux blend, costs about $160.

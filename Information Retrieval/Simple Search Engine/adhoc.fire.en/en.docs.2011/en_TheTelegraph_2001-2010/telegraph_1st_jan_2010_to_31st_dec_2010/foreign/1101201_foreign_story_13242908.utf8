	Nov. 30: The Chinese government is losing patience with North Korea and has described the regime as a spoiled child.        
	A senior South Korean minister is alleged to have been told by Beijing officials that the Chinese government would support the reunification of Korea under the control of Seoul.        
	The sensitive documents were released by WikiLeaks last night ahead of crucial international talks in Washington next month to discuss how to tackle North Korea. Last week, the regime fired missiles at its South Korean neighbour.        
	One diplomatic cable disclosed that Chinas vice-foreign minister told US officials that Pyongyang was behaving like a spoiled child to get Americas attention in April 2009 after carrying out missile tests.        
	However, the documents also outline a complicated relationship between China and North Korea  with other cables exposing US frustration at how North Korea was able to send weapons equipment to Iran via China.        
	A senior Chinese official, speaking off the record to American officials, insisted that Chinese influence over North Korea was frequently overestimated.        
	One of the most crucial conversations is recorded as taking place in February earlier this year between Chun Yung-Woo, the then South Korean vice-foreign minister and Kathleen Stephens, the US ambassador in Seoul.        
	Chun claimed that younger generation Chinese communist party leaders would not risk renewed armed conflict on the Korean peninsula. Chun also alleged that two senior Chinese officials told him that they believed the Korean peninsular should be reunited under South Koreas control.        
	Citing private conversations during previous sessions of the six-party talks, Chun claimed [the two high-level officials] believed Korea should be unified under ROK [South Korea] control, the US ambassador reported.        
	Chun also told the Americans that the two Chinese officials were ready to face the new reality.        
	The latest leaked documents also disclose growing Chinese concerns over North Koreas growing nuclear ambitions.         
	A Chinese ambassador told the Americans that the regime was a threat to the whole worlds security.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

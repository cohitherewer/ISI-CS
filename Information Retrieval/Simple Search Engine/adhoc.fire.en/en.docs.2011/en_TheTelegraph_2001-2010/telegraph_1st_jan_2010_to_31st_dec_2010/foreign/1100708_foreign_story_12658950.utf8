                          Igor Sutyagin                    
	Moscow, July 7 (Reuters): In an espionage drama worthy of the Cold War, Russia wants a spy swap to return home its suspected agents arrested in the US last month, a lawyer involved in the affair said today.        
	The swap plans include exchanging a Russian nuclear expert jailed for passing secrets to the West. They add a new twist to a cloak-and-dagger saga that both Moscow and Washington hope will not undermine improving diplomatic relations.        
	Russia wants to swap its national Igor Sutyagin, who was sentenced to 15 years in jail in 2004 for passing classified military information to a British firm, which prosecutors said was a front for the US Central Intelligence Agency.        
	They want to exchange Sutyagin for one of those arrested in the United States for spying, Anna Stavitskaya, a lawyer acting for Sutyagin, told Reuters. It is a one-for-one exchange. So each of those detained in the United States will be swapped for one person from Russia.        
	US counter-intelligence agents arrested 10 people last month on suspicion of being members of a Russian spy network that was trying to infiltrate policymaking circles in America.        
	In court documents that read like the spy novels of John le Carre, FBI counter-intelligence agents explained that many of the accused Russian agents were living under false identities and communicating with Moscow by concealing invisible text messages in photographs posted on public Internet sites.        
	One of the most famous cases from the Cold War was in 1962 when the US released Russian spy Rudolf Abel in exchange for Francis Gary Powers whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960.        
	A swap could prevent a long drawn out trial of the Russian suspects and avoid a possible row that both the White House and the Kremlin say they are eager to avoid.

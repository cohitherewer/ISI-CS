	Los Angeles, Sept. 15: Twitter has redesigned its website for the first time in its four-year history to draw more users and get them to stay longer as it competes for advertising dollars with Internet rivals Google and Facebook.        
	The redesign, which will roll out to the websites 160 million users over the next several weeks, is intended to make the site easier and faster to use and to serve more relevant content to users, executives said at a news conference at Twitters San Francisco headquarters.        
	Company chief executive Evan Williams said the changes would allow users to get more out of Twitter in a lot less time.        
	As Twitters popularity has spread since its 2006 introduction, the website has got a reputation for being difficult to use and for crashing too frequently.         
	Twitter has lagged in finding ways to boost revenue. It recently launched new advertising formats and ramped up its sales force.         
	Users of the redesigned site will be able to see more information about the authors of Tweets  the Twitter messages that can be no more than 140 characters in length.         
	Also, conversations between users will be able to be viewed, as will photos and videos referenced in updates.        
	One of the biggest changes to the Twitter site is that users will be able to see two panes instead of a single timeline of updates. They will be able to scroll through the timeline in the left pane without clicking back and forth to see more information about updates or their authors.

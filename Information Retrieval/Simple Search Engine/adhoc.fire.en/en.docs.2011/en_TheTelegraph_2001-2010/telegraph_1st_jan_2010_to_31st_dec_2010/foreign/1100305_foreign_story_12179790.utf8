          AMIT ROY                              
	London, March 4: Armed gunmen in Pakistan have demanded a 100,000 ransom for the safe release of a five-year-old British Pakistani boy who was kidnapped while visiting his grandmother in Jhelum with his father.        
	The five robbers left with jewellery, money and Sahil Saeed, who was due to return to his home in Oldham, Greater Manchester, with his father Raja Naqqash Saeed, after a routine family holiday.        
	The initial deadline of noon today local time passed without any further information about the boy.        
	Last night the robbers subjected Sahils father and other relatives to an ordeal, beating and slapping them for six hours.        
	Saeed said: They took me into a separate room and they tortured me. They said, We will take your son and you will have to pay 100,000.         
	A spokesman for the British High Commission in Islamabad said: I can confirm that he was taken after robbers broke into the property at 11pm last night. The kidnappers held the family at gunpoint overnight and left with the boy as well as some household possessions. We cannot confirm details of the ransom amount but the father has said it is 100,000.        
	At Sahils home in Oldham, meanwhile, his mother Akila Naqqash, 31, said there was no way her family could raise the ransom.        
	Breaking down in tears, Akila appealed to the kidnappers not to hurt her son: He is just a really sweet little boy, he is really tiny, he would not harm anyone.        
	 Akila, who also has two daughters, Anisha, four, and Hafsah, 21 months, said: I found out at 7.45am when my sister knocked on the door, I was just making breakfast for my daughter. She said, You need to sit down Ive got some bad news. I just broke down and thought it cant be true so I phoned my husband and he said it was true. I just cried and cried. That was the last time I spoke to him, I cant get through to him. We havent heard anything from the kidnappers. All we can do is wait.        
	The boys aunt, Amrana Iftikhar, called for Gordon Brown to intervene. I just cant imagine life without Sahil. We just want him home safely. I would say to the prime minister do as much as you can to get him back because we need him home with us.        
	Sahil seems no different from the majority of British boys his age.        
	His mother said: I phoned him every day of the last two weeks. When I last spoke to him he just said he couldnt wait to come home and have a jacket potato, he was fed up of the chapatis. He loves jacket potatoes with sweetcorn, cucumber, salad.        
	Jane Sheridan, head teacher at Rushcroft Primary School where Sahil is a pupil, said: Rushcroft is a very close-knit and friendly school community and Sahil and his family are very much in all our thoughts. I have informed the children, staff and governors about the situation today and clearly they are all very worried. Everyone at the school is deeply concerned about Sahils welfare and we are doing all we can to support his family during this extremely difficult time.

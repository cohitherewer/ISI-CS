	Super sale    
	 Los Angeles, Feb. 23 (Reuters): A very rare, first edition Superman comic book in top condition sold today for a record $1 million in a public sale held by website ComicConnect.com.      
	Owners of the website said the book, Action Comics , was first published in June 1938 and introduced the crime-fighting superhero to fans. It described how he was born on a different planet and came to Earth. The book also introduces his alter ego Clark Kents love interest, Lois Lane.      
	Stephen Fishler, ComicConnect.com founder, said the comic is one of only around 100 in existence.    
	Kate Oscar    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Winning an Oscar is a rare feat for most people. However, actress Kate Winslets academy award is up for grabs for anyone who visits her bathroom. Winslet, who won the Oscar for her role in The Reader last year, keeps her trophy in the bathroom so that guests can sneakily have a little (hold) and put it back down again, reports People.

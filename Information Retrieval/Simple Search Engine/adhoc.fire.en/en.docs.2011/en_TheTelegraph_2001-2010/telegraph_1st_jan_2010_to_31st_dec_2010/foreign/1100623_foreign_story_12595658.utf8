	June 22: Hilton has been severely embarrassed in China after one of its flagship hotels was closed down by the police over an alleged brothel operating in the basement.         
	The Hilton hotel in the central Chinese city of Chongqing was closed down by the police, who said the premises would remain shut indefinitely. A receptionist at the hotel confirmed it was not taking any bookings until mid-July at the earliest.         
	The vice squad raided the Diamond Dynasty karaoke club in the basement of the hotel on Saturday, arresting 102 people, of whom 22 were formally charged with offences.         
	A statement by Chongqing police said that a probe had uncovered a complete chain of people involved in prostitution involving the hotel managers, security guards, luggage carriers, receptionists and staff.

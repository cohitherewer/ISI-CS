The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Continental blamed for Concorde crash

	Paris, Dec. 6: A French judge ruled today that Continental Airlines and one of its mechanics were guilty of involuntary homicide for their role in the 2000 crash of an Air France Concorde jet that killed 113 people.        
	Judge Dominique Andrassier of the court in Pontoise, northwest of Paris, ordered the American carrier to pay a fine of $265,000. John Taylor, 42, the mechanic, was fined $2,650 and given a suspended 15-month prison sentence.        
	Henri Perrier, 81, considered the father of the iconic supersonic jet and an executive of Arospatiale, the company that built the Concorde, and two other French officials, Jacques Hrubel, and Claude Frantzen, formerly of the French airline regulator who certified the planes airworthiness, were acquitted.        
	A 2002 report by French air accident investigators concluded that a small strip of metal had fallen off a Continental DC-10 that took off minutes earlier and that the piece punctured a tire of the Concorde as it accelerated down the runway on July 25, 2000. The tire disintegrated in seconds, investigators said, sending shards of rubber into the fuel tanks and causing a catastrophic fire. All 109 passengers and crew members were killed, along with 4 people on the ground.        
	Olivier Metzner, the French lawyer for Continental in the case, vigorously challenged the investigators findings in court, however, and presented a starkly different scenario. Metzner argued that the investigators disregarded accounts of the accident from more than 20 witnesses who said the plane appeared to have caught fire at a point on the runway several yards before it reached the metal strip.        
	The decision to proceed with criminal charges in the Concorde case has alarmed airlines and aviation safety experts worldwide, who contend that the threat of prosecution can dissuade some witnesses from cooperating in crash investigations. France is one of a handful of countries that routinely seeks criminal indictments in transportation accidents, regardless of whether there is clear evidence of criminal intent or negligence.        
	Air France itself was not accused of wrongdoing and joined the case as a civil party in the hope of recouping damages from Continental. The ruling today awarded the French carrier $1.3 million. The airline reached a $150 million settlement in 2001 with the families of the victims, most of whom were German citizens. The verdict could also open the door to a suit against Continental by Air Frances insurers to recover the settlement payments, legal experts said.

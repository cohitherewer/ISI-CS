The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Russia airport staff beaten up
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Russia airport staff beaten up
                                  
	Moscow, Dec. 28 (Reuters): Irate holidaymakers beat up Aeroflot staff at a Moscow airport today as thousands were stranded with little food or information, after icy rain and blackouts disrupted traffic for a third straight day.        
	At Sheremetyevo where Russias flagship carrier is based, Aeroflot personnel were now scared of dealing with agitated passengers, saying the airport did not have enough security guards, state-run RIA quoted an airline employee as saying. Police told Reuters they were not involved in the reported violence at Sheremetyevo and declined to comment.        
	Yesterday a group of passengers stormed passport control at Moscows Domodedovo, Russias biggest airport, where OMON riot police have since been dispatched. People are desperate. Fights have broken out. It feels like there is no air in here, one woman at Domodedovo told Vesti 24 television today.        
	Russias transport minister issued blistering criticism of the management of the countrys largest airport, Domodedovo, saying it should have shut because of the power cuts instead of keeping passengers hostage waiting for their flights. Here is a question for the airports management  why did they keep receiving passengers? Igor Levitin was quoted by the Itar-Tass news agency as saying. After the lights went out, they should have shut!        
	Prosecutors launched a probe today into the widespread delays at the Russian capitals two main airports. Only 150 flights took off overnight at Domodedovo, which typically runs some 700 flights a day, after freezing rain snapped power lines leaving it in the dark for more than 10 hours over the weekend.        
	Arrival and departure information boards were almost all red, warning of delays and cancellations as passengers slept on baggage conveyor belts and departure hall floors.        
	Russias aviation agency chief Alexander Neradko said in televised comments that it would take another two to three days to normalise transport at Domodedovo and that priority was being given to passengers stuck since Sunday. Shortages of de-icing fluid at Moscows second airport, Sheremetyevo, grounded about half its flights.

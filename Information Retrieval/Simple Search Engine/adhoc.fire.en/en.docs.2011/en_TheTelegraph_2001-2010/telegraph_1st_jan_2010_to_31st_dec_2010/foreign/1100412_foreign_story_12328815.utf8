          RICHARD GRAY                              
	London, April 11: Apple is developing electronic spectacles that will allow the wearer to watch 3-D films while on the move.         
	The computer giant, which manufactures the iPod, iPhone and the newly released iPad, has revealed plans for a new device that will give users the kind of three dimensional film experience that they can currently only get from specially equipped cinemas.         
	Worn like a pair of glasses, the gadget has already been nicknamed iSpecs by technology fans.         
	Plans for the device have been revealed in a patent application, published this month by Apple. The document shows how users would slot their iPod or iPhone, on which the film is shown, into the head-mounted gadget.         
	A special smart lens in the iSpecs then projects the image from the screen so that it can be comfortably viewed by the user.         
	The lens will also be able to split the image into two different frames, one for each eye, so that it appears the picture is being seen from slightly different angles.         
	This will produce a stereoscopic image, giving the illusion that the film being watched is three-dimensional.         
	The device is also to be fitted with a camera that will stream video of the outside world into a smaller screen in the glasses.         
	If someone approaches the user or tries to get their attention, this will be detected by infrared sensors and the video stream will pop up inside the glasses, allowing the wearer to see what is happening.         
	The company hopes this will enable people to feel comfortable about wearing the device in public situations, such as when travelling on a train or an aircraft.

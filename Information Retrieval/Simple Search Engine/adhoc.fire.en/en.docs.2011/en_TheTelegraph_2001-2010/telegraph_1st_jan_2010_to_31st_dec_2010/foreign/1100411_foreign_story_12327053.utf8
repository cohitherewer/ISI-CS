The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Live bomb removed from brain
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Live bomb removed from brain

	Washington, April 10: The patient arrived in critical condition last month at the Bagram Air Base hospital in Afghanistan, with what American military doctors at first thought was an all too typical war injury: metal shrapnel from an improvised bomb lodged in his head.        
	A CAT scan showed that the piece of metal, about two and a half inches long, was probably a cartridge fragment  again, not at all unusual.         
	But as the patient, an Afghan soldier in his 20s, was prepared for surgery, the chief radiologist, Lt. Col. Anthony Terreri, took a closer look at the CAT scan. Stunned, he realised the object was an explosive round, primed to go off.        
	In a joint telephone interview from Bagram yesterday, members of the air force medical team recounted the hours that followed Dr Terreris discovery.        
	Maj. John Bini, a trauma surgeon and a veteran of homemade-bomb injuries from two previous deployments in Iraq, immediately evacuated the operating room. Only the anaesthesiologist, Maj. Jeffrey Rengel, who put on body armour, was left to watch the patient.        
	 All electrical monitoring devices in the operating room were turned off for fear of detonating the round. To keep track of the patients vital signs, doctors turned to manual blood pressure cuffs and a battery-operated heart monitor. They began counting drips per minute to estimate the amount of the intravenous anaesthesia they were giving the patient. It was taking anaesthesia back about 30 years, Dr Rengel said.        
	Within 30 minutes, the bomb disposal team arrived and confirmed, based on the CAT scan, that the patient had unexploded ordnance in his head. They said, the way these things are set up, this type of round has an impact detonator on the front of the charge, Dr Bini said. They just said, Dont drop it.        
	With that for reassurance Dr Bini put on body armour and began the process of surgically removing the round from the patients head. He was joined in the operating room only by Dr Rengel and a member of the bomb team. He cut through scalp tissue and made a large incision encircling the round, which was lodged under a piece of skull bone and jutted down the right side of the patients head. Within 10 minutes, he pulled out the live round. With care, he handed it to the bomb technician, who put it in a bag and left.

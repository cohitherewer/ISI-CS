                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Killers cant hide: Hasina
          
	Dhaka, Jan. 31 (PTI): Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has vowed to bring back from abroad six former armymen convicted of the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and send them to the gallows, days after the other five accused were hanged.        
	Making her first public appearance after the executions, Hasina said: Where will they hide? The world is big and also too small  they have nowhere to hide.         
	Twelve armymen have been convicted of carrying out the August 15, 1975, putsch in which Mujib, the founder-President and Hasinas father, was killed along with most of his family members.        
	Five of the 12 sentenced to death were executed early Thursday. One of the convicts had already died in Zimbabwe eight years ago.         
	Hasina said she would have been unhappy were she to die without seeing the convicted executed while the entire nation also waited 34 years to see it.        
	Her comments came as Bangladesh intensified a diplomatic campaign, also engaging the Interpol, to bring back the six killers. They are former Lt Cols Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Shariful Haque Dalim, A.M. Rashed Chowdhury, Noor Chowdhury, former captain Abdul Majed and army risaldar Moslehuddin.

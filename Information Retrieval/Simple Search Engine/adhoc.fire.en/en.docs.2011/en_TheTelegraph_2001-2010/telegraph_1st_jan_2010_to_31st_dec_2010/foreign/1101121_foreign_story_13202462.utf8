The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nato backs Afghan plan
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Nato backs Afghan plan
                            
	Lisbon, Nov. 20 (Reuters): Nato endorsed a plan today to hand control of security in Afghanistan to Afghan forces by the end of 2014 and the alliances leader said the Nato-led force would cease combat operations by then.        
	But senior US officials cast doubt on whether the US, the dominant power in the 28-nation alliance, would end its own combat mission before 2015 because President Barack Obama has not yet set a date for this. Some Nato officials also fear a rise in violence could make it hard to meet the target date set by Afghan President Hamid Karzai for the security handover, which would leave a vastly reduced number of foreign troops.

	July 8: CNN on Wednesday removed its senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs, Octavia Nasr, from her job after she published a Twitter message saying that she respected the Shia cleric, the Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, who died on Sunday.        
	Nasr left her CNN office in Atlanta on Wednesday.         
	Parisa Khosravi, the senior vice-president for CNN International Newsgathering, said in an internal memorandum that she had a conversation with Nasr on Wednesday morning and that we have decided that she will be leaving the company.        
	Nasr, a 20-year veteran of CNN, wrote on Twitter after the cleric died on Sunday: Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah  One of Hezbollahs giants I respect a lot.        
	Ayatollah Fadlallah routinely denounced Israel and the US, and supported suicide bombings against Israeli civilians. Ayatollah Fadlallahs writings and preachings inspired the Dawa Party of Iraq and a generation of militants, including the Hezbollah.        
	Some supporters of Israel seized on the tweet. A Web site called Honest Reporting that says it is dedicated to defending Israel against prejudice in the media asked: Is Nasr a Hezbollah sympathiser? This is disturbing enough given that the group is designated a terrorist organisation by the US and is committed to the destruction of Israel.

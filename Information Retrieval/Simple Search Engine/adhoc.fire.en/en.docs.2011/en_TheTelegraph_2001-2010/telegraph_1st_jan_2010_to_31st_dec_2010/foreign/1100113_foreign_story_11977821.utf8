	Dubai, Jan. 12 (Agencies): Dubai police said today they had found no evidence to support a British womans report that she was raped by a waiter in the Gulf Arab emirate, but have arrested her and her boyfriend for having sex outside marriage.        
	The woman, a Muslim of Pakistani descent, was celebrating her engagement to her 44-year-old boyfriend, and was allegedly attacked when she passed out in a hotel lavatory.        
	Despite approaching police about the attack, she was arrested after admitting to illegal drinking outside licensed premises as well as having sexual intercourse outside marriage. Her fianc was also charged with the same offences.        
	The couple from London are now reportedly on bail and understood to be awaiting trial after having their passports confiscated. Should they be found guilty, they could face up to six years in jail.

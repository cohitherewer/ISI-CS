The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pill reduces infection rate of HIV
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pill reduces infection rate of HIV
                            
	Washington, Nov. 23 (Reuters): A once-a-day pill combining two AIDS drugs reduced the HIV infection rate by nearly 44 per cent in high-risk gay and bisexual men, researchers reported today.        
	Men who took the pill the most consistently had more than a 70 per cent lower risk over two years, the US government study in Peru, Thailand, South Africa and elsewhere found. It is the first study to show that taking drugs before infection can reduce the risk of HIV transmission and has the potential to be a weapon in the fight against the fatal and incurable virus, the researchers said.        
	It makes for a trifecta in AIDS prevention research, coming months after a study released in July showing a gel could help protect women against the virus and one last year showing a vaccine had a partially protective effect.        
	These results represent a major advance in HIV prevention research, Dr Kevin Fenton of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.

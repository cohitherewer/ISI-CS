                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Beautys title lost after lies
                            
	London, June 29 (Reuters): A British beauty queen has been stripped of her title after pageant organisers discovered she lied about her age and place of residence on the application form for the contest.        
	Hopefuls must be between the ages of 15 and 24 to participate in the Miss Cornwall pageant and 27-year-old English teacher Laura Anness claimed to be 22 on all the entry forms she submitted between 2006 and 2010, British papers reported.        
	Competition organiser Becky Chapman discovered the old applications while cleaning her office.        
	When she went to confront Anness at her home, she found that the beauty queen lived not in Saltash, Cornwall, as she had written on the application form, but in Plymouth, Devon.         
	According to the rules of the contest, entrants must either live, work or study in Cornwall. Anness apologised for the incident, explaining that she had lied about her age to follow her dream. Chapman expressed pity for Anness.        
	I feel sorry for her, shed been entering these contests for years and never won, and now she has finally won she gets her title taken from her, Chapman told the Daily Mail.        
	As well as the prized crown and sash, Anness has given up 2,000 worth of prizes, a 12-month modelling contract and a chance to compete for the Miss England title.

	Voiceless Andrews    
	 London, May 10 (PTI): She was the voice that became a part of many childhood memories with films like Sound of Music and Mary Poppins.      
	But when Julie Andrews took to the stage for her much hyped comeback show, it became plain that she was lip-synching.      
	During her first performance in London in over 30 years, Andrews left the 14,000 strong audience disappointed, reports the Daily Mail.      
	Her fans had spent upto $170 for the tickets but nearly a decade-and-a-half after a botched operation on her vocal cords, the icon had to lip- sync through the show. When the interval to the two-hour long show came, the information desk at the arena was thronging with confused and angry audience members.

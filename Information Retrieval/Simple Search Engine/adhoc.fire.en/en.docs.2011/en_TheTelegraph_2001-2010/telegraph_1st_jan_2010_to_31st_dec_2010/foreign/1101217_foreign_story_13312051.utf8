	Cupertino / Calcutta , December 16: Following on the foot steps of the chrome web store Apple today announced that the Mac App Store for PCs and Macs will open for business on January 6.               
	By bringing the revolutionary App Store experience to Mac OS X, the Mac App Store makes discovering, installing and updating Mac apps easier than ever. The Mac App Store will be available in 90 countries at launch and will feature paid and free apps in categories like Education, Games, Graphics amp; Design, Lifestyle, Productivity and Utilities.        
	The App Store revolutionized mobile apps, said Steve Jobs, Apples CEO. We hope to do the same for PC apps with the Mac App Store by making finding and buying PC apps easy and fun. We cant wait to get started on January 6.        
	What is intriguing is that Bengali can be displayed very well on iPad, iPhone and iPod that run on a different operating system called iOS but not on Macs ( run on operating system called OS X). Apps like GoodReader and Safari display Bengali well on iOS. Now the challenge is to display Bengali too on OS X for this apps and on Safari. For instance you can read Bengali News Paper like Anandabazar Patrika very well on unicode. The url for Anandabazar Patrika for your iPhone or iPad is http://anandabazar-unicode.appspot.com/m        
	The Mac App Store lets you browse new and noteworthy apps, find out whats hot, view staff favorites, search categories and read customer ratings and reviews. Like on iPhone, iPod touch and iPad, you can purchase, download and install apps in just one click and start using them immediately. Purchased apps can run on all of your personal Macs and updates are delivered directly through the Mac App Store so its easy to keep all of your apps up to date. The Mac App Store is available to Mac OS X Snow Leopard users as a free download through Software Update.                
	Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork, and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple is reinventing the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store, and has recently introduced its magical iPad which is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices.

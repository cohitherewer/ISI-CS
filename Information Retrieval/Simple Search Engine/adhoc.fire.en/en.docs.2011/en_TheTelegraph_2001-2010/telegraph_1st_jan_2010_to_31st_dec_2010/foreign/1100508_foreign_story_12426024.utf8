The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Maoists call off strike
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Maoists call off strike
                            
	Kathmandu, May 7 (Agencies): Maoist supporters today ended their general strike after six days because of the hardship it had caused in the Himalayan country.        
	The top Maoist leaders decided to end the strike as it was making life difficult for the common people, the party chief, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, told reporters.        
	Considering the difficulty faced by the people because of the strike, the party has decided to end the shutdown but will continue with other protests, Prachanda said.        
	Earlier, tens of thousands of anti-Maoist protesters poured into the streets of Kathmandu, handing the former rebels a 48-hour ultimatum to end their strike amid growing shortages of essential food items. The Maoists have called a meeting tomorrow to inform the people why they have ended the strike.              
	traditionally back strike calls with the threat of        
	violence against those who defy them, and their supporters have        
	tried to forcibly shut shops that owners opened for business.        
	Thousands of police in riot gear have guarded the streets to prevent        
	violence.        
	 Police reported at least two clashes in Katmandu on Friday, and        
	officers shot weapons into the air and fired tear gas canisters to        
	restore control. No information on casualties was immediately        
	available.        
	 An estimated crowd of 20,000 - including doctors, lawyers,        
	business executives, singers, teachers and laborers - demanded a        
	halt to the six-day strike during a rally in the capital that was        
	the largest since Sunday.        
	 In the western town of Lekhnath, about 125 miles (200 kilometers)        
	west of Katmandu, shots were fired in clashes that wounded at least        
	five people. Police are investigating the volleys origins.        
	 The Maoists - who ended their bloody insurgency in 2006 and        
	joined the political process - won the countrys most recent        
	elections, but a dispute split their coalition, forcing their        
	government to disband and ushering in the current leaders. The        
	Maoists now want power back, but the government has refused to step        
	aside.        
	 The crisis had raised fears of renewed bloodshed after the        
	insurgency claimed an estimated 13,000 lives over a decade.        
	 The unrest comes as Nepals Constituent Assembly, elected to draw        
	up a new constitution, struggles to draft the charter before its        
	term expires May 28.

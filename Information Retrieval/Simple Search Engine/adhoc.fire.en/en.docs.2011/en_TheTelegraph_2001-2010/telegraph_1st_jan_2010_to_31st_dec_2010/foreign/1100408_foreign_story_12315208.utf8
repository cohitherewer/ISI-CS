The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US approves killing of US cleric
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US approves killing of US cleric
          SCOTT SHANE                              (From top) President Obama and radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki				                                 
	Washington, April 7: The Obama administration has taken the extraordinary step of authorising the targeted killing of an American citizen, the radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who is believed to have shifted from encouraging attacks on the US to directly participating in them, intelligence and counterterrorism officials said yesterday.        
	Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico and spent years in the US as an imam, is in hiding in Yemen. He has been the focus of intense scrutiny since he was linked to Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in November, and then to Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian man charged with trying to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on December 25.        
	American counterterrorism officials say Awlaki is an operative of al Qaida in the Arabian peninsula, the affiliate of the terror network in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. They believe that he has become a recruiter for the terrorist network, feeding prospects into plots aimed at the US and at Americans abroad, the officials said.        
	It is extremely rare, if not unprecedented, for an American to be approved for targeted killing, officials said. A former senior legal official in the administration of George W. Bush said he did not know of any American who was approved for targeted killing under the former President.        
	But the director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, told a House hearing in February that such a step was possible. We take direct actions against terrorists in the intelligence community, he said. If we think that direct action will involve killing an American, we get specific permission to do that. He did not name Awlaki as a target.        
	The step taken against Awlaki, which occurred earlier this year, is a vivid illustration of his rise to prominence in the constellation of terrorist leaders. But his popularity as a cleric, whose lectures on Islamic scripture have a large following among English-speaking Muslims, means any action against him could rebound against the US in the larger ideological campaign against al Qaida.        
	The possibility that Awlaki might be added to the target list was reported by The Los Angeles Times in January, and Reuters reported yesterday that he was approved for capture or killing.        
	The danger Awlaki poses to this country is no longer confined to words, said an American official, who like other current and former officials interviewed for this article spoke of the classified counterterrorism measures on the condition of anonymity. Hes got involved in plots.        
	The official added: The US works, exactly as the American people expect, to overcome threats to their security, and this individual  through his own actions  has become one. Awlaki knows what hes done, and he knows he wont be met with handshakes and flowers. None of this should surprise anyone.        
	As a general principle, international law permits the use of lethal force against individuals and groups that pose an imminent threat to a country, and officials said that was the standard used in adding names to the list of targets. In addition, Congress approved the use of military force against al Qaida after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. People on the target list are considered to be military enemies of the US and therefore not subject to the ban on political assassination first approved by President Ford.        
	Both the CIA and the military maintain lists of terrorists linked to al Qaida and its affiliates who are approved for capture or killing, former officials said. But because Awlaki is an American, his inclusion on those lists had to be approved by the National Security Council, the officials said.        
	Indian faces trial        
	India-born Noshir Gowadia, a former engineer who worked on the B2 stealth bomber and has been accused of selling sensitive American defence technology to China for $110,000, will face trial in a US court this week for spying.         
	Gowadia, 66 has pleaded not guilty to 21 counts, including conspiracy and violating the arms export control act.

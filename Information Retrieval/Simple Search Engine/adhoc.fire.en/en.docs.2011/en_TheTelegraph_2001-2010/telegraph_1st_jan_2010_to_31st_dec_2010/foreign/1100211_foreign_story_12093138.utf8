The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Zardari tells unruly audience to shut up
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Zardari tells unruly audience to shut up
                              Forceful                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 10 (PTI): Pakistanis are unhappy after the authorities blocked Youtube for some hours to prevent people from watching a video in which President Asif Ali Zardari told an unruly section of a gathering to shut up.        
	The video, that was posted at several websites, shows Zardari saying a forceful shut up to members of the audience while speaking at a recent rally.        
	The blocking of Youtube by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority figured prominently on Twitter and several new versions of the shut up video have surfaced and are being circulated.         
	One remixed clip has Zardari talking to the audience with a dialogue by Amitabh Bachchan playing in the background followed by the Black Eyed Peas song Shut Up. Adil Najam, editor of a popular magazine, wrote: If authentic, and it seems to be, the video is striking, but also sad to see.        
	There is not much that one can say by way of comment. Such behaviour is embarrassing for any politician, but especially for the President of a country.         
	Najam was the first to post the video on his website.

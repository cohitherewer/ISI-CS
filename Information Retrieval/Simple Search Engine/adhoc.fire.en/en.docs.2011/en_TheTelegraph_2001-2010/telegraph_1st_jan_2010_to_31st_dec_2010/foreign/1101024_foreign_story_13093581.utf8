The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | More than Channel divides France, UK
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      More than Channel divides France, UK
          ALAN COWELL                          French striking workers block the entrance to the oil refinery of Grandpuits, southeast of Paris. (Reuters)                                  
	Paris, Oct. 23: If there is one quality that unites France and Britain, it is a shared history of mutual divergence, verging on derision.        
	And so it was instructive this past week to observe the responses on both sides of the Channel to Europes economic malaise spreading like a dark fog obscuring the future.        
	Faced with the prospect of a longer working life until a minimum retirement age of 62 (up from the current 60), a million French citizens took to the streets, as strikers closed refineries and blockaded fuel depots, leaving motorists to fume in line for petrol and diesel.        
	But, confronting government measures promising not only a longer working life but 19 per cent cuts in public spending, the loss of almost half a million public-sector jobs, steep reductions in welfare payments and five bleak years of austerity, the British barely seemed to blink.        
	That, of course, may change, as it did in the late 1970s when a previous generation of Britons struggled through the so-called winter of discontent. Strikes then were so widespread that garbage piled up outside homes, cemetery operators considered mass burials at sea (the gravediggers had downed shovels) and dark thoughts gathered in British hearts.        
	But since those days, a legacy of labour unions weakened by the Conservative Margaret Thatcher has dampened the appetite for the collective struggle still cherished in France.        
	French people tend to like to demonstrate, the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said when asked to compare French and British national reflexes.        
	Taking to the streets, some argue, is a rite of passage for the young and, for the older, a right at the heart of the French way of democracy since the toppling of the aristocracy in 1789.        
	Whats at stake here is not the retirement age, or jobs for students, but the very nature of power in this country, said Lucy Wadham, a British novelist and blogger living in France.        
	But that is not to say that the latest unrest is hewn from the same political flagstones as the revolutionary barricades of 1968 that defined an era: It is a cents-and-euros struggle to avert the inevitable moment when decades of cumulative benefits  from short work weeks to long vacations, from state health care to early retirement  begin to unravel. As la retraite  retirement  so the nation.        
	Frances problem is that, for too long, the economy has been run as a kind of job club for French workers, said an editorial in The Spectator, a conservative British magazine. Britain and France believe in liberty, but have different definitions of it. While the British believe in liberty from government, the editorial said, the French still like the big state and squeal at the prospect of being removed from its teat.The French also pay higher club dues and expect commensurate rewards. French pensions can reach three-quarters of a working wage, compared with just over two-fifths in Britain. So, if French workers and teenagers strike over their pensions, theres plenty to protest about.        
	The British do, of course, demonstrate. Protests spilling to violence changed the national course most notably in riots against Thatchers poll tax in 1990. In 2000, truckers protests starved the entire country of fuel. People turned out in huge numbers  and in vain  to protest the war in Iraq in 2003, when Tony Blair dispatched more than 40,000 Britons to fight alongside the Americans.         
	Demonstrators confronted the police to rail against globalisation at the Group of 20 summit meeting in London in 2009.        
	But the legacy is defined more by the weakening of protest than its vindication.        
	If Britain falls prey to protest, there will be sharper overtones of class struggle than solidarity. Britain is a more divided society than France. Wealth is more ostentatious, poverty more visible. People in Britain have learned to have sharper elbows in pursuit of individual gain, while France prides itself on a broader concordat.        
	Of course, there is an inherent stoicism in Britain, woven into the World War II spirit of bulldog resolve in the face of hardship. When suicide bombers attacked London in July 2005, killing 52 people, the response was not rage but quiet resolve.         
	The British no longer do strikes, and certainly do not take to the streets in the same way as our confreres on the Continent. Or is that about to change? the columnist Mehdi Hasan wrote in the Leftist New Statesman. We are now a nation divided. The axe has fallen. The bloodletting has begun. And, of course, a winter is approaching  if not of discontent, then certainly of cold comfort and complaint.

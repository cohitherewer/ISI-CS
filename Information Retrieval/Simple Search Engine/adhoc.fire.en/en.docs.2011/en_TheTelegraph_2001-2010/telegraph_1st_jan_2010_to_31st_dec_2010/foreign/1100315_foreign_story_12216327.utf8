The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Buzz beats Armstrong to moon 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Buzz beats Armstrong to moon 
          PATRICK SAWER                          Neil Armstrong				                                 
	London, March 14: Buzz Lightyear, the enthusiastic animated hero in Disneys Toy Story, was the first man on the moon, according to one in 10 school students.         
	Buzz Lightyear has finally found the true recognition he craves throughout the animated childrens film Toy Story.         
	According to one in 10 school pupils, the character was the first man on the moon.         
	In their minds it was Buzz, not Neil Armstrong who first took one small step for man.         
	They could be forgiven. At least Buzz, with his motto To Infinity and Beyond, is an astronaut  of sorts.         
	Other children taking a science test thought Richard Branson, American cyclist Lance Armstrong and even Star Wars hero Luke Skywalker were the first to the moon.         
	Pam Waddell, of Birmingham Science City, looked at answers given by 1,000 primary and secondary school children in the test.         
	She said: It suggests that school kids arent tuned into our scientific heroes in the same way that they might be to sporting or music legends.         
	Thats something of an understatement when it comes to the question of who invented the telephone. Three quarters of pupils gave the correct answer: Alexander Graham Bell.         
	But others said Charles Darwin, Noel Edmonds and even Queen Elizabeth.         
	A third of boys thought Isaac Newton discovered fire, while others said it was DNA, the Internet or the US.                     THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

	London, Sept. 21 (Reuters): Hampshire police have defended releasing an e-fit of a suspected burglar after critics said it looked like a bald man with a lettuce on his head.        
	Yesterday, detectives issued the image of the suspect wanted in connection with a burglary at an elderly womans house But the picture appeared to give the man, described as having wavy blonde/greying hair, a bright green hairstyle which made him appear to have a lettuce on his head.

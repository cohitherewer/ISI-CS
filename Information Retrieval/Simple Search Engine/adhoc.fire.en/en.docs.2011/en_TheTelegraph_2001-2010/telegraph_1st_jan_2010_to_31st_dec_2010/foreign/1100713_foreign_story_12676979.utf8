                              Punjab sweep                             
	Lahore, July 12 (Agencies): Pakistani police rounded up scores of activists of banned militant organisations in a fresh crackdown in Punjab, officials said today.        
	The arrests were made less than two weeks after suicide bombers killed 42 people at the countrys most popular Sufi shrine in Punjabs capital Lahore.        
	The latest crackdown came days before the visit of foreign minister S.M. Krishna and an expected visit by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton. We have clear-cut instructions from the government that these militant groups cannot operate, police official Akram Naeem Bharoka said.        
	Several militant outfits involved in sectarian strife as well as fighting against India in Kashmir and against coalition troops in Afghanistan are based in Punjab.        
	Though no one claimed responsibility for the July 1 twin suicide bombings at the shrine of Syed Ali Hajvairi, officials have blamed the Punjabi Taliban, a term used for militants based in Punjab, for similar attacks in the past.        
	He said figures of detained suspects were being compiled.        
	Most of the suspected militants detained in the crackdown belonged to the Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP), an outlawed pro-Taliban Sunni militant group accused of involvement in violence against minority Shias.         
	The group now operates under the name of Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat which has also been officially banned.        
	Around 100 members of our organisation have been arrested throughout the province since last night, Mohammad Younis, an MIP spokesman told Reuters.        
	Some members of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, an Islamic charity seen as a front for the Lashkar-e-Toiba militant group blamed for the 2008 attack on the Indian city of Mumbai militant group, were also detained.        
	A security official said dozens of suspects had been rounded up under a public maintenance law which allows authorities to detain people up to 90 days without charge.        
	These people are already under surveillance and they have been detained for one month for now, he said.        
	The unannounced police operation began last night, The News reported.         
	Police conducted raids in Rahimyar Khan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar and Layyah districts and arrested 170 activists of the SSP and Jaish-e-Mohammed.         
	During the operation, 22 SSP offices were sealed.         
	The operation also targeted facilities and members of the banned groups in Lahore, Multan, Sahiwal, Khanewal, Jhang, Bhakkar, Gujrat, Vehari, Rawalpindi and other cities. The arrested activists were taken to unknown locations. Allama Ahmad Ludhianvi, chief of the SSP, condemned the arrests.         
	In a statement, he said, preparations were afoot to play a heinous game across the country at the behest of foreign forces.         
	Ludhianvi said the unjustified arrest of his partys workers had created an environment of tension and the governments steps had provoked activists.         
	I have asked the government to identify terrorists in my party and they would be handed over to the authorities, he said.         
	Ludhianvi urged activists of his party to show restraint.        
	Militants have unleashed a wave of suicide and bomb attacks across Pakistan in recent months in retaliation for military offensives against their strongholds in the northwest of the country bordering Afghanistan.        
	In the deadliest attack in the country since 2007, around 107 people were killed in a suicide bombing in the northwestern Mohmand tribal region on the Afghan border last Friday.        
	More than 200 suspects were picked up in the northwestern city of Peshawar, near Mohmand, today but police said innocent people would be released after screening.        
	While most of the reprisal attacks have taken place in the northwest, the militants have also stepped up bombings in Punjab in recent weeks.        
	Security officials say many Punjabi Taliban have joined ranks with the Pashtun Taliban  often referred to as the Pakistani Taliban  in the northwest and some have even forged ties with al Qaida.        
	More than 80 Ahmadis, a minority religious sect, which calls itself Muslim but has been declared heretical by Pakistan, were killed in twin attacks on their mosques in late May in Lahore.

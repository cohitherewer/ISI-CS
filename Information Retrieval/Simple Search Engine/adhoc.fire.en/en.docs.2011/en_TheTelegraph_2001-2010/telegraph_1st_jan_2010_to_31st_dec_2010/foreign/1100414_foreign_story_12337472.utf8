	Brosnan Bond    
	 London, April 13 (PTI): Actor Pierce Brosnan feels he never managed to get James Bond completely right because he could not forget the actors who had previously played the suave British spy.       
	Brosnan, 56, who took over the role from Timothy Dalton, said: It was one of those things I always struggled with. I never felt that I really nailed it. There was always a hint of Sean Connery and Roger Moore that was so indelible in my own mind.       
	The star also says he knew the script for Tomorrow Never Dies, his second film as Bond, was not as good as many had hoped it would be. When I did Tomorrow Never Dies I knew the movie wasnt up to speed, it wasnt as good as Goldeneye, he said. However, he is still glad he had the opportunity to play the iconic movie character, reports Venice magazine.    
	Monroe ray    
	 London (PTI): An X-ray of Hollywood icon Marilyn Monroe is set to be auctioned in Las Vegas in June. The X-ray was taken at a Florida hospital in 1954 when she was being treated for a womb condition called endometriosis. The X-ray, which shows Monroes ribs and the outline of her cleavage, was printed with her married name DiMaggio. The bizarre lot is one of many Monroe items up for sale at the auction.    
	JLo diva    
	 New York (PTI): Singer and actress Jennifer Lopez says she is hurt by claims that she is a demanding diva and is adamant it isnt part of her personality. Lopez, 40, says she is not the difficult star many assume she is and admits that she gets upset by the accusations, reports the New York Daily News. I never like stories where people say I misbehave or act like a diva, because I dont. Or that I make terrible demands, because those are always fabricated stories, and always have been, Lopez said.

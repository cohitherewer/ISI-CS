	London, March 17 (Reuters): Many may beg to differ but according to a new survey, the average Briton believes youth ends at 36 and old age starts at 58.        
	The good news for those feeling a little long in the tooth though is that those two landmarks vary considerably according to the age of the beholder. The findings come from the European Social Survey, which took in 21 European countries and more than 40,000 respondents.

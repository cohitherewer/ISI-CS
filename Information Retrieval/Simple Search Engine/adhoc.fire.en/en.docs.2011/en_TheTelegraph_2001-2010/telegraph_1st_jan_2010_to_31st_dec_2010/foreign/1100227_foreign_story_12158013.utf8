	Kabul/New Delhi, Feb. 26 (Agencies): Six Indians, including two army officers, were among 16 killed as Taliban suicide bombers carried out coordinated attacks on two Kabul hotels.        
	They struck mainly at the Park Residence hotel rented out by the Indian embassy for its staffers and those linked to Indias developmental work in Afghanistan. A car bomb levelled the Arya Guesthouse used mainly by Indian doctors.        
	The dead Indians were identified as Major Dr Laishram Jyotin Singh of the Army Medical Corps, Major Deepak Yadav of the Army Education Corps, engineer Bhola Ram, tabla player Nawab Khan, Kandahar consulate staffer Nitish Chibber and Indo-Tibetan Border Police constable Roshan Lal, Indian embassy sources said.        
	Also among the dead were eight Afghans, including three police officers, the Afghan interior ministry said. The French foreign ministry said one French national had died and one Italian diplomat was also among the deceased.        
	Earlier, the Indian government had said nine people had died which sources said was incorrect as it was based on an assessment by the Afghan interior ministry.        
	According to the Indian ambassador in Afghanistan, Jayant Prasad, the terrorists targeted Indians who were helping Afghans and building partnership between the two countries.        
	Major Singh was in Kabul to train local doctors at the Indira Gandhi hospital while Major Yadav taught English at the Afghan Military Academy.        
	Nawab Khan, who was killed in the Park Residence, was part of a three-member troupe sent by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations to Afghanistan.        
	Bhola Ram was project director at the Afghan Power Grid Corporation and was instrumental in bringing electricity to Kabul from Uzbekistan, sources said. He was in the process of handing over responsibilities to the Afghans.        
	Roshan Lal from Himachal Pradesh was deployed as a guard at the Indian consulate in Herat. He was on leave and on his way back home.        
	Hours after the bombings, Afghan foreign minister Zalmay Rassoul called up external affairs minister S.M. Krishna who assured Rassoul that India will not be deterred by such incidents.        
	Krishna said India firmly stood by Afghanistan in confronting the common enemy of terrorism. Rassoul assured India that increased security measures will be taken to ensure the safety of Indians in Afghanistan.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned in the strongest possible terms this senseless act of violence and barbarism which strikes at the core of everything a civilised society holds dear.         
	The Indians, who have lost their lives, were on a mission of goodwill and friendship, helping to construct the peaceful, democratic Afghanistan that our Afghan friends desire.        
	This is the third attack on Indians in Kabul since July 2008 when 60 people, including four Indian officials, were killed in a massive attack on the embassy building.        
	Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attacks on behalf of the Islamist militants.        
	Our mujahideen fighters managed to attack in the heart of Kabul city once again, Mujahid told Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location.        
	Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attacks, which fell on a holiday. He said it would not hurt Afghan-Indian relations.         
	The four-hour assault began at 6.30am. A series of explosions and gunbattles left blood and debris in the rain-slickened streets.        
	Dr Subodh Sanjiv Paul said he was holed up in his bathroom for three hours inside a hotel where he lived with other Indians.        
	Todays suicide attack took place in our residential complex, Paul said at a military hospital where his wounded foot was bandaged. When I was coming out, I found two or three dead bodies. When firing was going on, the first car bomb exploded and the full roof came on my head.        
	 Kabul police chief Abdul Rehman Rahman said two militants entered the Park Residency. One of them holed himself up in a room and then blew himself up, killing three police officers. The other attacker was shot dead by police.

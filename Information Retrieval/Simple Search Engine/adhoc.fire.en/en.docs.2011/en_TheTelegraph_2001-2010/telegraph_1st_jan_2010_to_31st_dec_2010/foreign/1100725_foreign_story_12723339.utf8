The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Some feel left out of Chelsea wedding

	July 24: So, just what does it take to score an invitation to the hottest  not to mention most secretive  political wedding of the summer?        
	More than a cross-country ride on a private jet, apparently. Im good enough to borrow a plane from, but not good enough to be invited to the wedding? complained one Clinton friend, who remembered the times he handed over his jet and his pilot to take Bill Clinton around the country but had not landed a coveted invitation to Chelsea Clintons nuptials.        
	Next Saturday, Clinton, 30, and her fianc, Marc Mezvinsky, 32, are expected to marry in Rhinebeck, New York. But not everyone these days is feeling the love.        
	While most friends and acquaintances of the former President and secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton say they understand that the wedding is a private affair of 400 or so guests, each with a direct connection to the bride or bridegroom, some are privately grumbling about who made the cut. And the whole affair has left donors, supporters, aides and even true A-listers wondering just how inside the inner circle they really are.        
	Would people who said they were close to the Clintons and not invited feel bad? Sure, said Hank Sheinkopf, a political consultant who worked on Clintons presidential re-election in 1996 (and who, for the record, was not invited). But with the hindsight of 30 years in politics, he added: It is dangerous to presume closeness to people in power, and it is very rare when there are real, unbreakable friendships.        
	 Sheinkopf stressed that the Clintons have always done a good job of guarding their daughters privacy. This is not another meeting of power for those who want to get close to the former President to figure out what they can get out of him, he said.

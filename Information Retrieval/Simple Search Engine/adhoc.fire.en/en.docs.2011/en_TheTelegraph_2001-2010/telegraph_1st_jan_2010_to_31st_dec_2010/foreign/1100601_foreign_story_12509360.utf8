The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | German President quits
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      German President quits

	Berlin, May 31 (Reuters): German President Horst Koehler unexpectedly resigned today after a wave of criticism over his comments about military action abroad.        
	Already battling a euro zone debt crisis, sinking poll ratings and policy scraps with an increasingly awkward coalition partner, Chancellor Angela Merkel must now quickly find a successful candidate for President.        
	A failure to get her candidate installed would be widely seen as a blow to her authority. Merkels conservatives had backed Koehler for re-election last year but her waning popularity means Merkel may find it difficult to push through her  as yet unknown  candidate if the Opposition Centre-Left camp puts up a strong rival.        
	Though responsible for signing bills into law, the German President has traditionally had little influence on the business of politics in Berlin, even if Koehler himself did offer criticism of the government that was unusually direct at times.        
	I regret that my comments could lead to a misunderstanding about an important and difficult question for our nation, Koehler said. In office since 2004, he said in a radio interview on his return from a trip to Afghanistan this month that German military action abroad also served economic interests.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Test flights raise hopes
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Test flights raise hopes
                              Motorists drive against the backdrop of a mountainous wall of volcanic ash from Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland. Experts said on Saturday that the eruption could soon start tapering off. (AFP picture)                            
	London, April 18: A sprawling cloud of volcanic ash paralysed air travel across much of Europe for a fourth day today, but test flights with empty airliners showed no sign of damage and offered some hope of respite.        
	British transport minister Andrew Adonis said European Union transport ministers would examine the results of the test flights on Monday and consider whether air space might be reopened despite ash from an Icelandic volcano.        
	Volcanic ash is abrasive and can strip off vital aerodynamic surfaces and paralyse an aircraft engine. Aircraft avionics and electronics, as well as windshields, can also be damaged.        
	British Airways and Irish Aer Lingus highlighted uncertainty over any reopening of air space in the immediate future by cancelling all of their flights for Monday.         
	Dutch airline KLM said inspection of an airliner after a test flight showed no damage to engines or evidence of dangerous ash concentrations. Germanys Lufthansa also reported problem-free test flights, while Italian and French carriers announced they would fly empty airliners today.        
	The Association of Dutch Pilots said it believed that a partial resumption of flights was possible despite the continuing eruption spewing black ash high over Europe. The concentration of ash particles in the atmosphere is in all likelihood so little it poses no threat to air transport, the association said.        
	Fly around cloud        
	The imaginative traveller sometimes found a way, weaving at the edges of the sprawling cloud. Reuters correspondent Mark Meadows flew over two days from St Petersburg to Rome, via Istanbul and Athens, then homewards by train to Milan.        
	Its possible to fly around the cloud, and the fact I could still find seats suggests not everyone has seen that possibility, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Its cheaper to stay at home when Obama flies
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Its cheaper to stay at home when Obama flies
  - MEDIA FLIGHTS SHARPLY CURTAILED      BRIAN STELTER                          President Obama waves as he boards Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. (AFP)                                        
	The news media has found a new area of coverage ripe for cost-cutting: the President of the United States.        
	For decades it was understood that whenever the President travelled, a charter plane packed with members of the press would travel with him. But the press flights have been sharply curtailed in recent months, a victim of cost-cutting by news organisations that are struggling to stay profitable. As a result, fewer reporters are tagging along with President Obama and his aides, limiting the number of news sources at a time when Americans are acutely interested in White House policies.        
	The sole reason is money, said Edwin Chen, the senior White House correspondent for Bloomberg News and the president of the White House Correspondents Association, who called the cutbacks alarming.         
	The budget restrictions  by news organisations as varied as USA Today and ABC News  are catching up with White House coverage, traditionally job No. 1 of the news bureaus here. It is the latest sign of retrenchment, years after many regional newspapers stopped assigning reporters to the White House. Im looking every day at ways we can cut here, cut there, said Christopher Isham, the Washington bureau chief for CBS News.        
	When Obama visits San Francisco on Tuesday and Wednesday, for fund-raisers and a tour of a solar panel company, there will be no charter. There is growing concern within the press corps that the result of all these cutbacks is less reporting about the President, coming from fewer and fewer sources. In its place, probably not coincidentally, come more shouting heads, meaning that citizens still hear and see their President constantly  but with fewer facts attached.        
	This would have been unthinkable a while ago, said Frank Sesno, a former White House correspondent and Washington bureau chief for CNN. Sesno, now the director of the school of media and public affairs at George Washington University, said the cutbacks paralleled the ebbing of the major networks and newspapers themselves. Isham and other news executives say they remain committed to the White House beat, but they are looking for new and less expensive ways to work.               
	Mark Whitaker, the Washington bureau chief for NBC News, said, We still         
	cover the president as thoroughly and responsibly as we always have; we         
	just have to look at the best way to do it, both logistically and         
	financially.              
	Presidential trips cost the press about $18 million last year, according to         
	the correspondents association.              
	The prices are exorbitant, said David Westin, the president of ABC News.         
	Seats on a press charter plane can run $2,000 for a domestic flight and         
	tens of thousands overseas. ABC appears to be watching costs as it reshapes         
	the news division, which eliminated 25 percent of its staff positions this         
	spring.              
	The news outlets vote on whether to charter a plane, but its not easy to         
	get the majority: The big television networks  ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox News and         
	NBC  represent five of seven votes. (Mr. Chen casts the other two votes on         
	behalf of other correspondents.) When the networks choose not to travel in         
	a pack, reporters of all stripes have to make other arrangements.              
	The skimping on charters started in the tail end of the George W. Bush         
	administration and has deepened during Mr. Obamas 16 months of office,         
	particularly in the last three months, news executives say.              
	In these cases  be they in Buffalo this month or in Prague, where Mr.         
	Obama traveled last month without a press charter for an important nuclear         
	arms deal  the only reporters who are in the so-called presidential bubble         
	are the dozen in a travel pool that fly on Air Force One and take notes and         
	pictures for the rest of the press corps.              
	The rest have to buy tickets on commercial flights and hope they make it to         
	the presidential event in time. Some decide to stay in Washington, and         
	their newsrooms send local reporters instead, though its hard to say how         
	often this occurs.              
	For reporters, the lack of the charter planes severely expands the         
	inconvenience and time away from actually covering the news, said Mark         
	Knoller, the longtime White House correspondent for CBS Radio.              
	To cover Mr. Obamas two-hour visit to the Kennedy Space Center last month,         
	Mr. Knoller said it took the lions share of three days, because he had         
	to catch a commercial flight to Florida a day early and stay there until         
	the morning after the speech. Still, he saved CBS hundreds of dollars; a         
	seat on a charter to Florida would have cost $2,400.              
	Mr. Knoller said he understands that news outlets are under enormous         
	pressure to spend less.              
	The presidents travel has a direct impact on the profit-and-loss         
	statements of Washington bureaus. When the administration scrapped a trip         
	to Indonesia and Australia in the midst of the health care debate, news         
	outlets faced cancellation fees of roughly $7,500 a seat.              
	Mr. Sesno said some may view the reporting from the trips as a commodity,         
	given that the presidents words echo so widely in the media. But he said         
	that by not traveling with him, you lose the flavor, you lose the         
	context.              
	The decrease in charters has piqued attention at the White House, where the         
	press secretary, Robert Gibbs, relayed his concerns to Mr. Chen in a recent         
	meeting. Asked about the concerns, the deputy press secretary, Bill Burton,         
	said, You could certainly make the argument that if fewer reporters         
	travel, fewer will have firsthand knowledge and insight to cover the         
	president and his policies.              
	Domestically, some 30 to 40 people fly on the charters when they are still         
	ordered.              
	For the charters, I dont want to say death spiral, but its definitely a         
	downward spiral, Mr. Chen said. The fewer organizations that travel, the         
	higher the costs of those that do travel. The higher the costs, the more         
	that drop out.              
	News outlets also pay for seats on press planes during presidential         
	campaigns, but network executives say it is too early to assess how they         
	will approach the 2012 campaign.              
	For their part, some of the network bosses say that White House charters         
	were probably ordered too freely in the past. Now, they happen on a         
	case-by-case basis. For example, the planes are more imperative when the         
	president makes multiple stops on a trip; for reporters flying commercial,         
	it can be close to impossible to keep up.              
	Were trying to apply a little common sense to how we spend money, David         
	Bohrman, the Washington bureau chief for CNN, said.              
	Common sense, or common penny-pinching, put 11 members of the press corps         
	on a bus to a commencement speech delivered by Mr. Obama in southern         
	Virginia early this month.              
	When the networks vetoed a charter plane for the trip, I suggested it out         
	of sheer frustration and sarcasm, Mr. Chen said of the bus. And you know         
	what? The networks said, Hey, not a bad idea. At a cost of only $200 a         
	seat, the price could not be beat.              NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

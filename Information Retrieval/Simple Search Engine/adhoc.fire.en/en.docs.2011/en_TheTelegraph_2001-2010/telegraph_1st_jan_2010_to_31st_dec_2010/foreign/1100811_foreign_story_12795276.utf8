The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Being lazy is a disease, say experts
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Being lazy is a disease, say experts
                            
	Aug. 10: Physical inactivity should be classed as disease in its own right, a pair of leading public health experts have proposed.        
	Dr Richard Weiler and Dr Emmanuel Stamatakis have put forward the idea because they say the the link between inactivity and poor health is strong.        
	Writing in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, they explained: Given the significant associated mortality and morbidity, we propose that perhaps physical inactivity should also be considered for recognition as a disease in its own right.        
	 Obesity is already classed as a disease by the WHO, noted Dr Weiler, a specialist in sports and exercise at Imperial College Healthcare. But he said obesity was often at least partially the result of a deeper cause  not doing enough exercise.

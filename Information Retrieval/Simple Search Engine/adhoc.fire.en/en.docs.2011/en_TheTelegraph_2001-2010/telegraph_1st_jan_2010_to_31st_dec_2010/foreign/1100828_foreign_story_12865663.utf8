	Aug. 27: Scientists working with Nasas Kepler satellite reported today that they might have spotted a planet just 1.5 times the diameter of Earth around a Sun-like star 2,000 light-years away.        
	Were still in the process of confirming this candidate is a planet, said Matthew Holman, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, at a Nasa-sponsored news conference today. Holman is the lead author of an article describing the discoveries that the journal Science published on its website.        
	This is the first announcement of a candidate Earth-size planet by the Kepler mission, which in March 2009 launched a one-ton spacecraft to search for planets like ours that just might harbour life. The planet was among more than 700 candidate planets that the team announced in June. Astronomers are quickly closing in on Earth-size planets elsewhere in the galaxy as they find planetary systems that look more and more like our solar system.        
	The Kepler team also observed, more definitively, two giant, Saturn-size gas planets around the same star, known as Kepler-9.         
	On Tuesday, a European team reported what may be a smaller planet, with mass as little as 1.4 times that of Earth, around a star 127 light-years away.        
	In the 15 years since the first extrasolar planet orbiting a Sun-like star was discovered, astronomers have found close to 500 more.

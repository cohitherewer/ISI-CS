The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Heavy snow disrupts northern Europe
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Heavy snow disrupts northern Europe

	London, Dec. 1 (Reuters): Heavy snow and sub-zero temperatures disrupted road, rail and air transport in many parts of northern Europe today while the Mediterranean island of Cyprus suffered in the heat after its driest November in more than a century.        
	Britain laboured under its worst early winter weather in almost two decades, with Edinburgh airport and Londons Gatwick airport closed. Snow blanketed much of the country, causing delays on major roads and railway lines.        
	British gas and power prices rose sharply on increased domestic consumption and demand for electrical power from neighbouring countries such as France and Belgium which have also been hit by the cold. Its insane, theres a lot of panic, one gas market broker said. If we have the smallest supply issue its going to be worrisome.        
	Temperatures in parts of Germany reached a record -18 degrees Celsius and there has been heavy snowfall. Flights at Frankfurt airport, one of Europes chief hubs, were disrupted.        
	Geneva airport was closed due to heavy snow and the city set up shelters overnight for 300 people stranded at the airport and main railway station.        
	Eurostar rail services between London and continental Europe were suffering delays of up to 30 minutes.        
	In Belgium, criticised by the UN for its lack of accommodation for asylum seekers, many took refuge in public places such as train stations. The military started up its winter action early to provide shelter for some asylum seekers, partly in military facilities. We have to act swiftly because the situation is serious, especially in Brussels, said Waut Es, a spokesman at the social security ministry.

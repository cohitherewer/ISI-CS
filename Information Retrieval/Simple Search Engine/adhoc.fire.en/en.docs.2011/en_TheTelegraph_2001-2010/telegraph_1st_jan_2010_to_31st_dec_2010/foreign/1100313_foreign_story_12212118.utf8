	London, March 12: French President Nicolas Sarkozy has angrily rebuked a journalist for asking about rumours surrounding his marriage to Carla Bruni.        
	At a joint Downing Street news conference with Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Sarkozy was twice pressed on the recent flurry of speculation that his marriage was in trouble. He snapped at a French journalist who raised the subject calling his question idiotic. Minutes later when a British member of the press asked him to deny the rumours the French President simply refused to answer before Brown called the briefing to an end.         
	Sarkozy told the journalist: You must know very little about what the President of the Republic actually has to do all day long. I certainly dont have time to deal with these ridiculous rumours, not even half a fraction of a second. I dont even know why you use your speaking time to put such an idiotic question.

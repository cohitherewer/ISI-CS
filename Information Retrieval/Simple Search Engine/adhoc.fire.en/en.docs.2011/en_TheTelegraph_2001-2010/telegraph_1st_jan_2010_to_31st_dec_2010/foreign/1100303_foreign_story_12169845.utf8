	London, March 2 (AP): Two Royal Air Force fighter jets were dispatched after reports that a passenger was trying to get into the cockpit of an American Airlines jet bound for Heathrow Airport, airline officials said today.        
	The ministry of defence said the Typhoon fighters were scrambled from the RAF Coningsby base in central England this morning. They were recalled to the base after the incident.        
	Police say the Boeing 767 jet  AA Flight 78 from Dallas/Fort Worth  carrying 161 passengers and 12 crew members landed safely at 1100 GMT and a woman was arrested on suspicion of endangering an aircraft. American Airlines said the woman became distressed during the flight and reportedly attempted to gain access to the flight deck.

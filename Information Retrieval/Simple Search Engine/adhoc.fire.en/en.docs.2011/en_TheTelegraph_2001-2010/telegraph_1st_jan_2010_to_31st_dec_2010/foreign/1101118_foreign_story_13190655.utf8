The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Britons bet on likely wedding date
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Britons bet on likely wedding date

	London, Nov. 17 (Reuters): Royal courtiers are already pondering how to tailor the ceremony to the austere times and Britons have started betting in earnest on the likely date for the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton.        
	The wedding  which according to one estimate will boost Britains economy by nearly $1 billion  has been widely hailed as a welcome respite from budget cuts and belt-tightening.        
	But amidst the celebrations and the flood of congratulations from around the world, it has also raised the awkward question of who should foot the bill.        
	In their first broadcast interview yesterday, William, second in line to the throne after his father Prince Charles, confessed: Were like sort of ducks, very calm on the surface with little feet going under the water.        
	Buckingham Palace confirmed they were due to sit down with royal advisers to work out the details, but both were tight-lipped on a likely date or whether the ceremony could be held at the kind of regal venues which hosted his fathers and his grandmothers nuptials.        
	The queen married at Westminster Abbey. Charles and Diana tied the knot at St Pauls Cathedral. William and Kate, both 28, have so far revealed only that the wedding will take place in either the spring or summer next year with bookmakers tipping July and August as favourites.        
	Bookmaker Graham Hill said July was marginally ahead on 15/8 with August at 2/1. July 29  the 30th anniversary of the spectacular wedding of his parents Charles and Diana  is another hot favourite.        
	The Daily Mail newspaper said royal aides had made discreet overtures to senior staff at Westminster Abbey about the possibility of August 12 or 13th.        
	A spokesman for William said the couple would be mindful of the economic situation in a move clearly designed to show the palace remained in touch with the people.         
	International media also picked up on the economic angle.        
	The Daily Telegraph in Sydney noted that an overly ostentatious occasion would leave a sour taste. But it added: In a kingdom forced to tighten its belt, a showpiece royal wedding could lift the national mood.        
	Canadas National Post said signs suggested that the British public wanted the Queen to foot the bill for the wedding. Back at home republican sentiment was already beginning to rear its head. Anti-monarchy group Republic said taxpayers should not pay for the wedding.        
	Stephen Haseler, professor of government at London Metropolitan University, accused the British establishment of using the occasion to distract the public from the downturn. They are seeing this as something to distract people from the coming unemployment queues, he told BBC radio.

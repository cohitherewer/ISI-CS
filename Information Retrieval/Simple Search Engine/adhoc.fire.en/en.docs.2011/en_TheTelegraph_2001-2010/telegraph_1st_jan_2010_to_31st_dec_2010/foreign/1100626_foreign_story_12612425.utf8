	Sydney, June 25 (Reuters): Michael Jackson fans around the world lit candles today to mark the death one year ago of the pop star.        
	Fans in Hanoi, Vietnam, held a night of performances of Jacksons songs while 50 Japanese admirers  one for each year of his life  were picked from 10,000 people to spend a night at Tokyo Tower among the singers possessions in the Neverland Collection.         
	Jacksons sudden death at age 50 on June 25 last year in Los Angeles sparked an outpouring of grief internationally for the former child star.

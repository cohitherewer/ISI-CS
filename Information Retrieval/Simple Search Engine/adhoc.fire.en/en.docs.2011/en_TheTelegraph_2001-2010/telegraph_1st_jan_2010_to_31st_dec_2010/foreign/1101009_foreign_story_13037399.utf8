	London, Oct. 8: Sunday will be 10.10.10, a date whose symmetry has occurred once a year since 2001 and will do so until 2012.         
	The date has set off alarm bells with some superstitious people on the Internet who fear it could cause their computers internal clocks to either jam, or for a virus to be let loose.         
	A Facebook page has been set up with the title Will my computer still work on 10/10/10 at 10.10am?, while other sites talk about the possibility of hackers unleashing viruses at that time.         
	Graham Cluley, computer safety expert at Sophos, said: Theres been a long history of virus scares related to specific dates and its not that surprising to hear people whispering about the possible risks looming on October 10, 2010.         
	But with more than 60,000 new pieces of malware (malicious software) being discovered every day you should realise that you need to be careful about attacks every day of the year.         
	The biggest computer fear over dates was in the year running up to the millennium, when the majority of computer experts warned that clocks and equipment based on those clocks would fail to work. In the event all the equipment worked perfectly well.

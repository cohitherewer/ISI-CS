The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Buyers send iPhone on long relay to Beijing
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Buyers send iPhone on long relay to Beijing
          NICK BILTON                          A woman looks at an iPhone in Seoul. (Reuters)                                  
	Sept. 23: They show up in the early-morning hours: Chinese men and women, waiting silently and somewhat nervously outside of Apple stores in New York. On some days the lines they form can be a block long.        
	These are not typical Apple fans. Instead they are participants in a complex and curious trade driven by Chinas demand for Apples fashionable gadgets  products that are made in China in the first place and exported, only to make the long trip back.        
	Participants in New York and Shanghai say the process works like this: People wait in line at an Apple store to buy the newest iPhone for $600, paying a premium to skip the AT amp;T contract. They then sell the phones to middlemen, usually at electronics stores in Chinatown, for about $750.        
	The phones are shipped off to China, where the iPhone 4 is not yet on sale, and are distributed to local shops and e-commerce sites, where they sell for as much as $1,000. Once the phones have been unlocked to break their ties to AT amp;T, they can be used with local carriers.        
	But a change to this practice is coming. On Saturday, the iPhone 4 will go on sale in China, priced at about $750 for the 16-GB version.        
	Most people in China can only dream of being able to afford an expensive phone. But millions of Chinese are developing a taste for luxury goods, and Apple products have joined Louis Vuitton bags as totems of wealth, said Shang-Jin Wei, director of the Jerome A. Chazen Institute of International Business at Columbia Business School.        
	These trading networks have been around for a long time, Prof. Wei said.         
	An Apple spokesman would not discuss the systematic iPhone purchases at Apple stores, but the company has tried to put a stop to them  and has found it difficult to do so.

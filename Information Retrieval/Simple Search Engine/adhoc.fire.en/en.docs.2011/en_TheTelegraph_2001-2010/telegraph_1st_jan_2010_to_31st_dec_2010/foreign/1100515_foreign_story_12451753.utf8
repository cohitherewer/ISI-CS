	New York, May 14: Three Pakistani men taken into custody during a series of raids across the northeast as part of the investigation into the failed Times Square car bombing may have provided money to the man who has admitted carrying out the unsuccessful attack, Attorney-General Eric H. Holder Jr. said yesterday.        
	Holder said it was unclear if the men knew that the funds they provided were going to be used for an act of terrorism  one that Obama administration officials have said was aided and directed by the Pakistani Taliban. As of late yesterday, they were being detained on civil immigration violations and had not been charged with a crime.        
	Several people briefed on the case said that Faisal Shahzad, the naturalised Pakistani immigrant who the authorities say drove the crude car bomb into Times Square, travelled to the suburban Long Island community of Ronkonkoma in the days before the failed May 1 attack to collect several thousand dollars in cash.        
	But the people could not say whether the person who provided that money was one of the men taken into custody, and it was unclear whether the person was aware of what Shahzad intended to do with the money.        
	Two of the men taken into custody in the early morning raids were picked up after one of two searches in the Boston area, part of a sweep in which FBI agents and local police officers executed six search warrants there, in New Jersey and on Long Island. A third man was taken into custody in Maine. Holder called the development a significant step.        
	He said the men were connected to Shahzad, 30, but investigators were trying to determine exactly what the nature of the connection was. Theres at least a basis to believe that one of the things that they did was to provide him with funds, Holder said.

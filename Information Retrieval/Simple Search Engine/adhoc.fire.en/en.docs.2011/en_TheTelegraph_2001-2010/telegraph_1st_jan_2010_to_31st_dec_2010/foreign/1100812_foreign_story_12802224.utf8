The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Russia missiles in Georgia
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Russia missiles in Georgia
                            
	Moscow, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Russia said today it had deployed high-precision air defence missiles in the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia, sending a defiant signal to Tbilisi and the west two years after a war with Georgia.        
	The S-300 missile system bolstered Moscows military presence in the disputed territory and drew an angry response from Georgia.        
	Gen. Alexander Zelin, the commander of Russias air force, said that air defences of other types had been deployed in Georgias other Russian-backed rebel region, South Ossetia.        
	His comments, two years after Russia routed Georgian forces in a five-day war that strained Moscows ties with the US and Europe, were reported by Russian news agencies.         
	The task of these air defences is not only to cover the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, but also to avert violations of their state borders in the air and destroy any vehicle illegally penetrating their air space, Zelin said.        
	Zelin said the air defence systems would also protect Russian bases in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.        
	At the same time, the task of air defence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia will be also implemented by frontline and army aviation carrying out combat duties there, Zelin said.

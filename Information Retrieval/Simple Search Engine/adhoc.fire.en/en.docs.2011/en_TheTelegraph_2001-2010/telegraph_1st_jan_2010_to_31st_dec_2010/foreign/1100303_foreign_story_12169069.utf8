	Colombo, March 2 (Reuters): Sri Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa will reconvene the island nations dissolved parliament on March 9 to extend an emergency law by another month ahead of parliamentary polls in April, officials said today.        
	The government has yet to lift the powerful wartime emergency regulations that give it wide powers of arrest and detention without trial.

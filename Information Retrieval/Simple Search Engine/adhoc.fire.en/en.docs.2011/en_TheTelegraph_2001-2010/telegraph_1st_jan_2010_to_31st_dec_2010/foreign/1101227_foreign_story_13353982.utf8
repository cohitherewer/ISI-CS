The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama end-of-life care law in New Year
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama end-of-life care law in New Year
          ROBERT PEAR                          Last laugh                                  
	Washington, Dec. 26: When a proposal to encourage end-of-life planning touched off a political storm over death panels, Democrats dropped it from legislation to overhaul the healthcare system. But the Obama administration will achieve the same goal by regulation, starting January 1.        
	Under the new policy, outlined in a Medicare regulation, the government will pay doctors who advise patients on options for end-of-life care, which may include advance directives to forgo aggressive life-sustaining treatment.        
	Congressional supporters of the new policy, though pleased, have kept quiet. They fear provoking another furore like the one in 2009 when Republicans seized on the idea of end-of-life counselling to argue that the Democrats bill would allow the government to cut off care for the critically ill.        
	The final version of the healthcare legislation, signed into law by President Barack Obama in March, authorised Medicare coverage of yearly physical examinations, or wellness visits. The new rule says Medicare will cover voluntary advance care planning, to discuss end-of-life treatment, as part of the annual visit.        
	Under the rule, doctors can provide information to patients on how to prepare an advance directive, stating how aggressively they wish to be treated if they are so sick that they cannot make healthcare decisions for themselves.        
	While the new law does not mention advance care planning, the Obama administration has been able to achieve its policy goal through the regulation-writing process, a strategy that could become more prevalent in the next two years as the President deals with a strengthened Republican opposition in Congress.        
	Advance care planning improves end-of-life care and patient and family satisfaction and reduces stress, anxiety and depression in surviving relatives, the administration said, quoting research published this year in the British Medical Journal.        
	The administration also cited research by Dr Stacy M. Fischer, a University of Colorado School of Medicine assistant professor who found that end-of-life discussions between doctor and patient help ensure that one gets the care one wants. In this sense, Dr Fischer said, such consultations protect patient autonomy.        
	Opponents said the Obama administration was bringing back a procedure that could be used to justify the premature withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from people with severe illnesses and disabilities.

	Washington, Feb. 16: The Talibans top military commander was captured several days ago in Karachi in a secret joint operation by Pakistani and American intelligence forces, according to American government officials.        
	The commander, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, is an Afghan described by American officials as the most significant Taliban figure to be detained since the American-led war in Afghanistan started more than eight years ago. He ranks second in influence only to Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Talibans founder and a close associate of Osama bin Laden before the September 11 attacks.        
	Mullah Baradar has been in Pakistani custody for several days, with American and Pakistani intelligence officials both taking part in interrogations, according to the officials.        
	It was unclear whether he was talking, but the officials said his capture had provided a window into the Taliban and could lead to other senior officials. Most immediately, they hope he will provide the whereabouts of Mullah Omar, the one-eyed cleric who is the groups spiritual leader.        
	Disclosure of Mullah Baradars capture came as American and Afghan forces were in the midst of a major offensive in southern Afghanistan.        
	His capture could cripple the Talibans military operations, at least in the short term, said Bruce . Riedel, a former CIA officer who last spring led the Obama administrations Afghanistan and Pakistan policy review.        
	Details of the raid remain murky, but officials said that it had been carried out by the ISI, and that CIA operatives had accompanied the Pakistanis.        
	The New York Times learned of the operation on Thursday, but delayed reporting it at the request of White House officials. American officials believe that besides running the Talibans military operations, Mullah Baradar runs the groups leadership council. A spokesman for the Taliban insisted today that Baradar was still free.

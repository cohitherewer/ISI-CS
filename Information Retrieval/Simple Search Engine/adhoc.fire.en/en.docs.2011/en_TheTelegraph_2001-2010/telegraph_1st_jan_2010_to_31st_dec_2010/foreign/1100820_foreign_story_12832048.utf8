	Palo Alto (California), Aug. 19: Facebook introduced a long-anticipated service called Places yesterday that could help the company tap local and small-business advertisers and sharpen its competition with Google.        
	Facebooks Places borrows heavily from location-based social networks like Foursquare and Gowalla, which allow users to check in at places and broadcast their location to friends.         
	Using Places on hand-held devices like the iPhone and other smartphones, users will be able to check in, for example, at a restaurant, bar or museum, alerting their friends on Facebook of their presence.         
	They will then be able to see, using the service, any friends that are nearby, as well as other people who have checked in at the same location and have agreed to have their location broadcast widely.        
	Users will also be able to tag friends who are with them, and the service will suggest other nearby locations that users may be interested in. Check-ins will be broadcast in status updates that will appear in a variety of places.        
	This is not a service to broadcast your location at all times, but rather one to share where you are, who you are with, when you want to, said Michael Sharon, product manager for Places.

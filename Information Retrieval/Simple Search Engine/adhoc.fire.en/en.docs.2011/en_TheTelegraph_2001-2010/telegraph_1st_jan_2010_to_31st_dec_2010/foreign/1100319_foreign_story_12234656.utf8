	New York, March 18: What is the sound of an awkward silence on Facebook? If you have to ask, then you probably dont have friends like James Gower and Ashley Andrews, high school sweethearts from Spring, Texas, who are both 22 and engaged to be married this May.        
	Gower, a master of the passive-aggressive status update, lobbed this one in January: How is it my birthday is only one day, but my womans last a whole damn week? Andrews, seemingly not one to watch a ball go by, took a full swing with this comment: GET OVER IT!!! UGH!!!!!! Gower replied by calling his fiance a name that cant be printed here, until the exchange became the social networking equivalent of shattered china at a dinner party.        
	Eventually, Skyler Hurt, 22, a friend and a bridesmaid, intervened: Hey, you guys know we can still see this right ...?        
	Its a question being asked a lot these days as couples, who once had to leave the house to fight in public, take their arguments onto Facebook. Whether through nagging wall posts or antagonistic changes to their relationship status, the social networking site is proving to be as good for broadcasting marital discord as it is for sharing vacation photos. At 400 million members and growing, Facebook might just replace restaurants as the go-to place for couples to cause a scene.        
	As score-settling on Facebook has grown commonplace, sites like Lamebook have begun documenting the worst spats (which also happen to be the most humorous). On Facebook itself, people can join several groups with names like I Dislike People/Couples Who Argue Publicly on Facebook.        
	For most couples, the temptation to publicly slander each other is overpowered by the instinct to prove to their friends how happy they are, reality notwithstanding. But for others, arguing in front of others comes as naturally as slamming doors.         
	While a hot temper (or two) is often to blame, there are people, like Gower, who view Facebook as an opportunity: How better to show everyone what his future wife puts him through?

          MATT WARMAN                          Mark Zuckerberg                                  
	May 24: Founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook sometimes moves too fast but is working to fix mistakes made on privacy.        
	Zuckerberg admitted that users find the social networks controversial privacy controls too complex, but has said that the website will move to adjust them so that they are simpler as soon as possible.        
	Writing in the Washington Post, Zuckerberg said that the sites 400 million users were a challenge to keep satisfied, but continued to claim that if people share more, the world will become more open and connected. And a world thats more open and connected is a better world.        
	However, he said user reactions to new changes to privacy settings suggested that sometimes we move too fast  and after listening to recent concerns, were responding.         
	Our intention was to give you lots of granular controls; but that may not have been what many of you wanted. We just missed the mark.        
	Zuckerberg conceded that there needs to be a simpler way to control your information, and said that in the coming weeks, we will add privacy controls that are much simpler to use.        
	He added that the site operates under five principles, which give users control over their own information, and which also ensure that Facebook is free and does not provide access to private information for advertisers or users or services that individuals do not wish to permit.        
	Some campaigners, such as those behind the website Quitfacebookday, may continue to be worried by Zuckerbergs commitment to keep focused on achieving our mission of giving people the power to share.

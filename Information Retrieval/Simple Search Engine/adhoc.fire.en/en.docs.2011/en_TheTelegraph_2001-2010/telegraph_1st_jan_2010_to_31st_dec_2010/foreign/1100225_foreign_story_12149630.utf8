	Feb. 24: Angie Sanselmente Valencia, a former lingerie model, is believed to be heading one of the worlds largest drug gangs.        
	An international arrest warrant has been issued for the 30-year-old, who is suspected of recruiting beautiful women and using them to move drugs to Europe and North America.        
	Many of these women are believed to be other lingerie and glamour models who compete in international beauty pageants, whom Valencia describes as unsuspicious, beautiful angels.         
	Her drug syndicate was exposed in December last year after a 21-year-old woman blew the whistle after being caught with 55kg of cocaine at Buenos Aires airport. The woman began to talk within 12 hours of her arrest. The police had also nabbed three more persons.        
	The drug mule had made no attempt to hide the cocaine in her suitcase because she had been told no one would stop her at the airport, according to the Argentine newspaper, La Nacion.         
	Police are now investigating the gangs links to people working at the airport.        
	Following the arrests, Valencia promptly disappeared from a four-star hotel in Buenos Aires and is now thought to be on the run somewhere in either Mexico or Argentina.        
	Investigators believe the beauty pageant winner quit modelling and left her native Colombia for Argentina to set up the empire last year. They tried to trace her via her Pomeranian lapdog but found it was registered to a disused warehouse.         
	Her drug runners were paid 1,300 to board flights from Colombia to Cancun, Mexico, with bags of cocaine every 24 hours, according to The Sun. From there they would smuggle them into Europe.         
	Valencia was crowned Columbias Queen of Coffee in 2000 and is said to have split from a Mexican drug baron nicknamed The Monster to rival his empire.

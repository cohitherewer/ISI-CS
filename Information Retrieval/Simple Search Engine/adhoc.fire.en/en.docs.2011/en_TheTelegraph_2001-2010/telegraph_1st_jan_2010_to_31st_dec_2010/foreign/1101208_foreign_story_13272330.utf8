                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Baywatch star singled out for body scan
                              Donna DErrico                            
	Dec. 7: A former Baywatch actress has claimed she was singled out for a naked body scan at an airport because she was attractive.        
	Donna DErrico, who also modelled for Playboy, believes she was deliberately targeted by Transport Security Administration security officials because of her figure and career as a swimsuit pin up.        
	It is my personal belief that they pulled me aside because they thought I was attractive, she said.        
	After the search, I noticed that the male TSA agent who had pulled me out of line was smiling and whispering with two other TSA agents and glancing at me. I was outraged.        
	DErrico, who appeared in Baywatch from 1996 to 1998, was flying from Los Angeles airport to Pittsburgh with her boyfriend and 17-year-old son Rhyan.

                              Assange: Dirty tricks                            
	Stockholm, Aug. 21 (AP): Swedish prosecutors withdrew an arrest warrant for the founder of WikiLeaks today, saying less than a day after the document was issued that it was based on an unfounded accusation of rape.        
	 They said that for the moment Julian Assange remains suspected of the lesser crime of molestation in a separate case.        
	The accusations have been lableled a dirty trick by Julian Assange and his group, who are preparing to release a fresh batch of classified US documents from the Afghan war. Swedish prosecutors had urged Assange  a nomadic 39-year-old Australian whose whereabouts were unclear  to turn himself in to police to face questioning in the case involving suspicions of rape and the other based on an accusation of molestation.        
	I dont think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape, chief prosecutor Eva Finne said, in announcing the withdrawal of the warrant. Karin Rosander, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Prosecution Authority, said Assange remains suspected of molestation. The prosecutor hasnt made a decision on that count, Rosander said.         
	Assange had dismissed the allegations in a statement on WikiLeaks Twitter page, saying: The charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing.        
	He was in Sweden last week seeking legal protection for the whistle-blower website, which angered the Obama administration for publishing thousands of leaked documents about US military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan.        
	The first files in Wikileaks Afghan War Diary revealed classified military documents covering the war in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2010.         
	Assange said on Wednesday that WikiLeaks plans to release a new batch of 15,000 documents from the Afghan war within weeks. The Pentagon says the information could risk the lives of US troops.         
	Assange has no permanent address and travels frequently  jumping from one friends place to the next. He disappears from public view for months at a time, only to reappear in the full glare of the cameras at packed news conferences.        
	 to discuss his sites latest        
	disclosure.        
	 Assange declined to talk about his background at a news        
	conference in Stockholm a week ago. Equally secretive is the small        
	team behind WikiLeaks, reportedly just a half-dozen people and        
	casual volunteers who offer their services as needed.        
	 A WikiLeaks spokesman, who says he goes by the name Daniel        
	Schmitt in order to protect his identity, told The Associated Press        
	in a telephone interview from Iceland that the quot;extremely serious        
	allegations quot; came as a complete surprise.        
	 Apart from the comment from Assange, WikiLeaks Twitter page had        
	a link to an article in Swedish tabloid Expressen, which first        
	reported the allegations.        
	 quot;We were warned to expect dirty tricks. Now we have the first        
	one, quot; it said.        
	 Assange was in Sweden partly to apply for a publishing        
	certificate to make sure the website, which has servers in Sweden,        
	can take full advantage of Swedish laws protecting whistle-blowers.        
	 He also spoke at a seminar hosted by the Christian faction of the        
	opposition Social Democratic party and announced he would write        
	bimonthly columns for a left-wing Swedish newspaper.

          ANDREW HOUGH                          Hard to stretch                                  
	July 16: Women who claim they can wear high heels all day but only experience pain when they take them off can prevent the problem by using a simple exercise technique, according to scientists.        
	Researchers found women who regularly wore high heels for extended periods suffered more aches because their muscles were overstretched and could not relax. They found that wearing a pair of shoes shortened fibres in their calve muscles as the heel of the foot was elevated.        
	 Scientists at Manchester Metropolitan University then discovered the Achilles tendon became thicker and stiffer meaning it was harder to stretch the feet out to walk.        
	They said it could explain why women could wear high heels for hours but experience feet aches after removing them.         
	In their study, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, the team used volunteers aged between 20 and 50 who had regularly worn 5cm high heels for two years or more. They tested a final group of 11 who felt uncomfortable walking without their heels and recruited a second group of women who did not wear high heels.        
	Using ultrasound to measure the length of muscle fibres in the womens calf muscles, they found high heel wearers were 13 per cent shorter than those who wore flat shoes.        
	This confirmed the hypothesis that when you place the muscle in a shorter position, the fibres become shorter, said Prof. Marco Narici, who led the study.

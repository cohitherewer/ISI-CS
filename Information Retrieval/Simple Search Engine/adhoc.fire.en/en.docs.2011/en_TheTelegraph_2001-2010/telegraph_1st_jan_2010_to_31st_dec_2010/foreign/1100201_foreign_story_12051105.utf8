The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Elitist mantra of Steven Jobs 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Elitist mantra of Steven Jobs 
          STEVE LOHR                              
	New York, Jan. 31: The more, the better. Thats the fashionable recipe for nurturing new ideas these days. It emphasises a kind of Internet-era egalitarianism that celebrates the wisdom of the crowd and open innovation. Assemble all the contributions in the digital suggestion box and the result will be collective intelligence.         
	Yet Apple, a creativity factory meticulously built by Steven P. Jobs since he returned to the company in 1997, suggests another innovation formula  one more elitist and individual.         
	This approach is reflected in the companys latest gadget, the iPad tablet. It may succeed or stumble but it clearly carries the taste and perspective of Jobs and seems stamped by the companys earlier marketing motto: Think Different.         
	Apple represents the auteur model of innovation, says John Kao, a consultant to corporations and governments on innovation. In the auteur model, he said, there is a tight connection between the personality of the project leader and what is created. Movies created by powerful directors, he says, are clear examples, from Alfred Hitchcocks Vertigo to James Camerons Avatar.         
	At Apple, there is a similar link between the ultimate design-team leader, Jobs, and the products. From computers to smartphones, Apple products are known for being stylish, powerful and pleasing to use. They are edited products that cut through complexity, by consciously leaving things out  not cramming every feature that came into an engineers head, an affliction known as featuritis that burdens so many technology products.         
	A defining quality of Apple has been design restraint, said Paul Saffo, a technology forecaster and consultant in Silicon Valley.         
	That restraint is evident in Jobss personal taste. His black turtleneck, beltless blue jeans and running shoes are a signature look. In his Palo Alto home years ago, he said he preferred uncluttered, spare interiors and then explained the elegant craftsmanship of the simple wooden chairs in his living room, made by George Nakashima, the 20th-century furniture designer and father of the American craft movement.         
	Great products, according to Jobs, are triumphs of taste. And taste, he explains, is a byproduct of study, observation and being steeped in the culture of the past and the present, of trying to expose yourself to the best things humans have done and then bring those things into what you are doing.        
	His is not a product-design philosophy steered by committee or determined by market research. The Jobs formula, say colleagues, relies heavily on tenacity, patience, belief and instinct. He gets deeply involved in hardware and software design choices, which await his personal nod or veto.         
	In choosing key members of his team, Jobs looks for the multiplier factor of excellence. Truly outstanding designers, engineers and managers, he says, are not just 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 30 per cent better than merely very good ones, but 10 times better. Their contributions, he adds, are the raw material of aha products.        
	Real innovation in technology involves a leap ahead, anticipating needs that no one really knew they had and then delivering capabilities that redefine product categories, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. Thats what Steve Jobs has done.

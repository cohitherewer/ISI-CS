The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Church abuse sermon irks Jews
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Church abuse sermon irks Jews
                                  
	Vatican City, April 3 (Reuters): Jewish groups around the world have reacted with shock after Pope Benedicts personal preacher compared the attacks on the Church and the Pope over a sexual abuse scandal to collective violence against Jews.        
	I am absolutely, totally astounded by this. This is folly, said Amos Luzzatto, a former president of Italys Jewish communities. Rome chief rabbi Riccardo Di Segni said: This is really in bad taste.        
	The Popes personal preacher, Father Raniero Cantalamessa, in a sermon yesterday in St Peters Basilica, said attacks on the Catholic Church and the pope over a sexual abuse scandal were comparable to collective violence against Jews.        
	Jewish leaders around the world used words like repugnant, obscene and offensive to describe the sermon, particularly, as Di Segni noted, it came on the day that for centuries Christians prayed for the conversion of the Jews, who were held collectively responsible for Jesuss death.        
	How can you compare the collective guilt assigned to the Jews which caused the deaths of tens of millions of innocent people to perpetrators who abuse their calling by sexually abusing children?

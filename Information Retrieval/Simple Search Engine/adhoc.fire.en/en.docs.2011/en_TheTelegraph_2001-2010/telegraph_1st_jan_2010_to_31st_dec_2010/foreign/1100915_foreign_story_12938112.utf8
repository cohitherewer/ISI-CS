The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cuba signals change with PSU layoffs
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Cuba signals change with PSU layoffs

	Mexico City, Sept. 14: The Cuban government plans to lay off more than half a million people from the public sector in the expectation that they will move into private businesses, Cubas labour federation said yesterday.        
	This is the clearest sign yet that economic change is gathering pace in Cuba.        
	Over the past several months, President Ra Castro has given stern warnings that Cubas economy needs a radical overhaul, beginning with its workers. With as many as one million excess employees on the state payroll, Castro has said the government is supporting a bloated bureaucracy that has sapped motivation and long sheltered a huge swathe of the nations workers.        
	We have to erase forever the notion that Cuba is the only country in the world where one can live without working, he told the National Assembly last month. Since permanently taking over from his brother Fidel two years ago, Castro has often pledged to make Cubas centralised, Soviet-style economy more efficient and open up opportunities for people. The government has handed tens of thousands of acres of state-held farmland to private farmers and begun freeing up a market for agricultural supplies.         
	It has loosened restrictions on mobile phones and other electronics, and created a few areas for private business, allowing barbers shops to become cooperatives and giving more licenses to private taxi drivers.        
	But these initial reforms have been comparatively limited, many analysts contend, and Cubas economy  grappling with the fallout from the global financial crisis and the aftermath of devastating hurricanes in 2008  appears to be in dire shape.        
	Tourism revenues have flagged, the country has faced rice shortages and its sugar crop has been disastrous. Last year, as the government tried to hold on to desperately needed hard currency, imports fell by 37 per cent.        
	In its statement yesterday, the Cuban Workers Central, the countrys only recognised labour federation, openly acknowledged the nations troubled economy, saying that changes were necessary.        
	Cuba faces the urgency to advance economically, the statement said. Our state cannot and should not continue supporting companies and other state entities, with inflated payrolls, losses that damage the economy, which are counterproductive, generate bad habits and deform the workers conduct, the labour federation added.        
	To that end, the government has previously said that it would grant new licenses to entrepreneurs, vastly expanding the kinds of businesses that can be run privately.

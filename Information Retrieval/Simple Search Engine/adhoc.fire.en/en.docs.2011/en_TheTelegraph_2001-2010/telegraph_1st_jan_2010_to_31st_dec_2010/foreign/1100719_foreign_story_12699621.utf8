	Tehran, July 18 (Reuters): Irans prosecutor called on Sunday for tighter checks on women who fail to observe the Islamic dress code in public, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.        
	Under Irans Sharia law, imposed after the 1979 Islamic revolution, women are obliged to cover their hair and wear long, loose-fitting clothes. Violators can receive lashes, fines or imprisonment.

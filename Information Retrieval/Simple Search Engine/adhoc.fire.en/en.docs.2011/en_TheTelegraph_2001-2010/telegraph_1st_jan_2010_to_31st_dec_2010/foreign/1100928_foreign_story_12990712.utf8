	Seoul, Sept. 27 (Reuters): North Korean leader Kim Jong-ils son, Jong-un, has been given the rank of general, the countrys official media said today in the first mention of the young son who is considered heir to the dynastic state.        
	Leader Kim, who is believed to be in deteriorating health, also named his sister, Kyong-hui, general in appointments, KCNA news agency said.        
	Jong-un, thought to be born in 1983 or 1984 and educated in Switzerland, is the youngest of Kims three known sons and had never been mentioned in the secretive Norths official media.        
	North Koreas ruling Workers Party of Korea has called a rare meeting tomorrow in a move analysts had expected would signal the start of the succession process of the leaders son.         
	Analysts say tomorrows conference will provide a platform for the young Kims political debut, and present him for the first time to the isolated countrys 23 million residents.        
	The biggest concern is any signs of regime collapse that could result in internal unrest, massive refugee flows and military exchanges.

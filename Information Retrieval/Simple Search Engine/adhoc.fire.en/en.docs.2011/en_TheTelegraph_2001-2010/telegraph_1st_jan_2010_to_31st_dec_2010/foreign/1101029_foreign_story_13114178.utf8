The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Paper rejects reform call, chides Wen
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Paper rejects reform call, chides Wen
          MICHAEL WINES AND SHARON LAFRANIERE                          Wen: Sideways swipe                                  
	Beijing, Oct. 28: Chinas main Communist Party newspaper bluntly rejected calls for speedier political reform yesterday, publishing a front-page commentary that said any changes in Chinas political system should not emulate western democracies, but consolidate the partys leadership so that the party commands the overall situation.        
	The opinion article in Peoples Daily, signed with what appeared to be a pseudonym, appeared at least obliquely aimed at Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. He has argued in speeches and media interviews that Chinas economic progress threatens to stall without systemic reforms, such as an independent judiciary, greater oversight of government by the media and improvements in Chinas sharply limited form of elections.        
	It also may have been directed at countering recent demands for democratic reforms by Chinese liberal intellectuals and Communist Party elders, spurred in part by Wens remarks and timed to this months award of the Nobel Peace Prize to an imprisoned Chinese democracy advocate, Liu Xiaobo.        
	Wens comments have fuelled a debate among analysts over whether he is advocating western-style changes in Chinas governing system or merely calling for more openness inside the ruling Communist Party.        
	Yesterdays commentary, which closely followed the ruling partys annual planning session, ran to 1,800 words and delved into topics only occasionally discussed in the state media.         
	The article emphatically repeated past declarations that changes modelled on American or European political systems were inappropriate for China. It also appeared to directly reject Wens warning that economic progress and political reforms were inseparably linked.        
	The idea that Chinas political reform is seriously lagging behind its remarkable economic development is not only contrary to the law of objectivity but also to the objective facts, it stated.        
	It later added: In promoting political reform, we shouldnt copy the western political system model; shouldnt engage in something like multiparty coalition government or separation of powers among the executive, legislative and judicial branches. We should stick to our own way.        
	A Chinese political historian who asked not to be named in discussing the issue said: Obviously, this is a criticism of Wen. He later qualified his remark, saying the editorial amounted to a sideways swipe, noting that Wen was not explicitly named.        
	Still, the notion of a link is bolstered by a leaked October 19 directive from Communist Party censors that ordered Internet sites and news organisations to delete all references to a recent interview of Wen by CNN. In that September 23 interview, Wen said that the peoples wishes for and needs for democracy and freedom are irresistible.        
	Wen has made similar statements in previous years, and the partys more conservative majority has appeared to bristle. In 2007, after Wen publicly embraced universal values like human rights, the state-controlled press reacted with what seemed nationalistic vigour, and the term has since become taboo.        
	Some analysts said yesterday that the partys brusque reaction this time points to a growing debate over the future direction of Chinas political system.        
	It does appear to be a direct swipe at Wens statements, David Shambaugh, who heads the China Policy Programme at George Washington University in Washington, said in an email. It is more evidence of a division of views within higher levels of the party on the scope and pace of democratic reform.        
	Still unclear, he said, is what democratic reform means to members of the party hierarchy. Publicly, at least, virtually all debate on democracy in party journals and speeches has been limited to ways of making the party bureaucracy more responsive to ordinary citizens rather than giving those citizens a direct voice.        
	A Beijing scholar of the leadership, Russell Leigh Moses, called the editorial a reminder to cadres that the party will set the tone and terms of the debate on political reform.        
	Within the system, some are sceptical that hints of a split amount to much.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Catalan House bans bullfighting
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Catalan House bans bullfighting
                                  
	Barcelona, July 28 (Reuters): The Catalan parliament dealt the death blow to bullfighting in the region today, outlawing the centuries-old spectacle for the first time on mainland Spain.        
	The result of 68 in favour, 55 against the ban was expected, after Catalonias parliament in December accepted a petition by citizens to stop bullfighting, as activists concerned about animal cruelty battled devotees of the Spanish tradition.        
	In the debate, some lawmakers cited the declining popularity of bullfighting in Spain, where fewer people go each year to the arena to watch toreros in their elaborate suits of lights engage enraged bulls at close range with red capes and swords.         
	There are some traditions that cant remain frozen in time as society changes. We dont have to ban everything, but the most degrading things should be banned, said Josep Rull, an MP for the Catalonian Nationalist Party.        
	Lawmakers denied the debates outcome reflected separatist aspirations, but many Spaniards saw the vote as having more to do with Catalonias drive to reduce Madrids political influence over their region than with the protection of animals.        
	Nine lawmakers abstained from voting in the debate in which animal activists concerned about the bulls suffering argued against those who revere bullfighting, celebrated by Ernest Hemingway in Death in the Afternoon.

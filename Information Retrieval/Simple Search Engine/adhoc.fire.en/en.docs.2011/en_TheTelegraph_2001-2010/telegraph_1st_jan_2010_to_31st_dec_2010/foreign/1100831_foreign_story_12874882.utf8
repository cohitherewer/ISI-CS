	Dubai, Aug. 30 (PTI): Six Saudi sisters have decided to file a lawsuit against their father for repeatedly rejecting their suitors and not allowing them to get married.         
	The women, all in their 30s, have written a letter to Sultan Bin Zahem, chairman of Saudi Arabias Advocacy Committee, demanding that they be given the authority to get married.        
	They allege that their father always rejected their suitors, saying that there is no woman in his family to negotiate the marriage terms. In the letter, the sisters alleged that their suitors were pious men and of good conduct, Saudi Okaz newspaper reported.         
	Bin Zahem said the women can file a lawsuit against their guardian and the judge will summon him to ask him why he has not allowed his daughters to get married.

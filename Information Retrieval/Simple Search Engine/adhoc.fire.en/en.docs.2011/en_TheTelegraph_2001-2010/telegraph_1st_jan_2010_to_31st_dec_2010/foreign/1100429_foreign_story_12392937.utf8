	London, April 28: British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been caught unawares calling a Labour-supporting pensioner who confronted him on the election campaign trail a bigot.        
	The Prime Minister was also heard describing an exchange he had with the female voter as a disaster, although, unknown to him, the woman felt that they had a very good conversation.        
	Gillian Duffy, a 66-year-old widow, told Brown that she was concerned about immigration from eastern Europe.        
	Brown chatted to her for five minutes and appeared to end the conversation amicably, telling her she came from a good family.        
	But he was unaware that his microphone was still on as he got into his car and sped away, and was heard berating his staff for allowing the encounter.        
	He told an aide: That was a disaster. Should never have put me with that woman. Whose idea was that?        
	When the aide said they did not know who was responsible, the Prime Minister snapped: Ridiculous.        
	His companion suggested that television crews who filmed the encounter, in a residential street in Rochdale, would not broadcast it. But Brown said: They will use it.        
	The aide asked what Duffy had said, and Brown replied: Everything. Shes just a sort of bigoted woman who says she used to be Labour.        
	Ironically, Duffy, a former council worker, had said that she had been happy with Browns responses and would be voting for him.        
	She said their conversation had been very good, adding: Seems a nice man.        
	The pensioner had been talking to reporters at the back of a crowd, observing Browns visit to a community payback scheme, where offenders were picking up litter, when Sue Nye, his long-term aide and gatekeeper summoned her over to discuss her concerns with the Prime Minister. When she heard of Browns remarks, Duffy said that she was very upset and angry.        
	The widow from Rochdale said: I havent had a chance to listen to it yet but if thats what he said, Im very upset. When she heard of Browns remarks, Duffy said that she was very upset and angry.        
	During their conversation, she had told the Prime Minister that she was concerned that vulnerable people were missing out on support while those who did not deserve them where able to claim benefits.         
	She went on: All these Eastern Europeans, where are they coming from?        
	Brown said that a million Europeans had come to the UK, but that a similar number of Britons were now living on the continent. Duffy told him that she felt that the issue of immigration was not being discussed properly for reasons of political correctness.         
	You cant say anything about immigrants, she said.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	New York, Aug. 24: For professors, publishing in elite journals is an unavoidable part of university life. The gruelling process of subjecting work to the up-or-down judgment of scholarly peers has been a cornerstone of academic culture since at least the mid-20th century.        
	Now some humanities scholars have begun to challenge the monopoly that peer review has on admission to career-making journals and, as a consequence, to the charmed circle of tenured academe. They argue that in an era of digital media there is a better way to assess the quality of work. Instead of relying on a few experts selected by leading publications, they advocate using the Internet to expose scholarly thinking to the swift collective judgment of a much broader interested audience.        
	What were experiencing now is the most important transformation in our reading and writing tools since the invention of movable type, said Katherine Rowe, a Renaissance specialist and media historian at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. The way scholarly exchange is moving is radical, and we need to think about what it means for our fields.        
	That transformation was behind the recent decision by the prestigious 60-year-old Shakespeare Quarterly to embark on an uncharacteristic experiment in the forthcoming autumn issue  one that will make it, Rowe says, the first traditional humanities journal to open its reviewing to the World Wide Web.        
	Mixing traditional and new methods, the journal posted online four essays not yet accepted for publication, and a core group of experts  what Rowe called our crowd sourcing  were invited to post their signed comments on the website MediaCommons, a scholarly digital network. Others could add their thoughts as well, after registering with their own names. In the end 41 people made more than 350 comments, many of which elicited responses from the authors. The revised essays were then reviewed by the quarterlys editors, who made the final decision to include them in the printed journal, due out on September 17.        
	The Shakespeare Quarterly trial, along with a handful of other trailblazing digital experiments, goes to the very nature of the scholarly enterprise. Traditional peer review has shaped the way new research has been screened for quality and then how it is communicated; it has defined the border between the public and an exclusive group of specialised experts.        
	Today a small vanguard of digitally adept scholars is rethinking how knowledge is understood and judged by inviting online readers to comment on books in progress, compiling journals from blog posts and sometimes successfully petitioning their universities to grant promotions and tenure on the basis of non-peer-reviewed projects.

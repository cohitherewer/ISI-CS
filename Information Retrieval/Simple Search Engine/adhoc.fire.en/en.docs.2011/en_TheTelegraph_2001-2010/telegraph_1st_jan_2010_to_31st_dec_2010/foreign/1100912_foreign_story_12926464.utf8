The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | No war with Islam: Obama
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      No war with Islam: Obama

	Washington, Sept. 11: Barack Obama marked the ninth anniversary of the September 11 attacks by declaring that America will never be at war with Islam in a speech aimed at reducing tensions sparked by a pastors plan to burn copies of the Quran.        
	The US President said at a memorial service at the Pentagon, where 184 people were killed: As Americans, we will not and never will be at war with Islam. It was not a religion that attacked us that September day. It was al Qaida, a sorry band of men which perverts religion.        
	The Reverend Terry Jones, who single-handedly created an international crisis with his planned International Burn a Koran day, finally confirmed he had pulled back from the brink after flying to New York from his home in Florida.         
	Having initially only postponed the event in protest at plans for an Islamic Centre and mosque close to Ground Zero, the Rev Jones said he had now cancelled it.        
	His publicity stunt overshadowed a series of solemn ceremonies held at Ground Zero in New York, the Pentagon and a crash site in Pennsylvania. Rival rallies by groups supporting and opposing the disputed project were expected to take place once the official ceremonies at Ground Zero were over.        
	In New York, Vice-President Joseph Biden joined thousands of people attending the annual ritual of reading the names of all 2,752 people killed when two hijacked airliners destroyed the Twin Towers.        
	The ceremony began with a youth choir singing the national anthem at Ground Zero, where reconstruction work has recently begun to gather pace for the first time.        
	Bereaved relatives held up portraits of their lost loved ones, as a bell was rung in remembrance ahead of moments of silence marking the times when the two airliners slammed into the Twin Towers  and again when the towers collapsed.        
	A third memorial service was held in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the fourth hijacked plane crashed into a field. First Lady Michelle Obama spoke at that service.        
	Secretary of state Hillary Clinton said she joined all Americans in honouring those who lost their lives on that terrible day, noting that lasting health effects continued to plague emergency responders and survivors. Let today never, ever be a national holiday. Let it not be a celebration, said Karen Carroll, who lost her brother, firefighter Thomas Kuveikis. Its a day to be sombre; its a day to reflect on all those thousands of people that died for us in the United States.        
	Standing before microphones, stifling sobs, some family members who read names sought to emphasise sentiments on all sides of the mosque argument.        
	Some  like Elizabeth Mathers, whose father, Charles Mathers, worked at Marsh amp; McLennan at the trade centre  stressed that ground zero is hallowed. New York, please be mindful this is a sacred site, she said.        
	Many sought to embrace unity and a spirit of reaching out, which is what the developers of the Islamic centre have said is their goal. May we share your courage as we build bridges with other people to prevent this from happening again and to preserve human dignity for all, said Robert Ferris.

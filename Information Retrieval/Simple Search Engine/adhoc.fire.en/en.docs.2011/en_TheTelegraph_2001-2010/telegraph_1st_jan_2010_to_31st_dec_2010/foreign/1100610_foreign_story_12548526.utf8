	United Nations, June 9: The US, moving firmly away from the Obama administrations previous emphasis on wooing Iran, pushed through a new round of UN sanctions against the nation today.        
	The new sanctions, a modest increase from previous rounds, took months to negotiate but still did not carry the symbolic weight of a unanimous Security Council decision. Twelve of the 15 nations voted for the measure, while Turkey and Brazil voted against and Lebanon abstained.        
	Beyond the restrictions imposed by the sanctions themselves, the vote sets stage for harsher measures that the US and the EU have promised to enact on their own once they had the imprimatur of the UN.        
	Iran has defied repeated demands from the Council to stop enriching nuclear fuel.         
	Susan E. Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, said the body had risen to its responsibilities by approving the measure, and that now Iran should choose a wiser course.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Qaida turncoat in plot alert 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Qaida turncoat in plot alert 
                              Jabir al-Fayfi: Double agent                            
	Sanaa (Yemen), Nov. 1 (AP): A leading al Qaida militant in Yemen who surrendered to Saudi Arabia last month provided the tip that led to the thwarting of the mail bomb plot, Yemeni security officials said today.        
	The officials said Jabir al-Fayfi, a Saudi militant who had joined al Qaida in Yemen, told Saudi officials about the plan. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the press.        
	Several tribal leaders with knowledge of the situation, who similarly spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed al-Fayfis role.        
	US officials have said an alert from Saudi Arabia led to the interception on Friday of two explosive devices, hidden in packages addressed to Chicago-area synagogues, on planes transiting in Britain and Dubai. Al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror groups affiliate in Yemen, is suspected in the attempted bombing.        
	The Saudi newspaper Al-Watan today cited Saudi security officials as saying that the kingdom gave US investigators the tracking numbers of the packages.        
	Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia announced that al-Fayfi had turned himself in. Al-Fayfi, who is in his mid-30s, had been captured by US forces in Afghanistan following the 2001 toppling of the Taliban there. He was held at the US prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, until early 2007, when he was released to Saudi Arabia.        
	There, he was put through the kingdoms rehabilitation programme for militants. But soon after his release, he fled to neighbouring Yemen and joined al Qaida there, according to the Saudi interior ministry. In September, he contacted Saudi authorities saying he wanted to turn himself in. A private jet was sent to the Yemeni capital Sanaa to retrieve him, Saudi security officials told the daily, Al-Hayat, at the time.        
	The Yemeni security officials said they suspect that the Saudis planted al-Fayfi in al Qaida in Yemen as a double agent.        
	Saudi security officials could not immediately be reached for comment whether al-Fayfi had a role in tipping them off to the mail bomb plot.        
	But al-Fayfis surrender may have revealed other plots as well. In mid-October, Saudi Arabia warned European authorities of a new terror threat from al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, saying the groups operatives were active on the continent, particularly in France.        
	Saudi Arabia has for years been working to infiltrate al Qaida in its unstable neighbour to the south, Yemen. Saudi intelligence has recruited hundreds of informers in Yemen, gives powerful tribal chiefs generous stipends to ensure their loyalty and even passes out money within Yemens security forces.        
	The Saudis, who have fought a brutal war against al Qaida militants at home over the past decade, have been unhappy about how President Ali Abdullah Salehs government in Yemen has handled the growing threat in the poor Arab nation in their backyard. The kingdom sees Yemens security forces as incompetent and their intelligence gathering inadequate.        
	Greece parcel        
	Greek police intercepted a booby-trapped parcel addressed to French President Nicolas Sarkozy today, after another package exploded at a courier company in Athens, slightly wounding an employee. Police suspect the parcels were linked to Greek Leftist groups. Shortly after the explosion, police arrested two suspects and detonated two more makeshift parcel bombs.

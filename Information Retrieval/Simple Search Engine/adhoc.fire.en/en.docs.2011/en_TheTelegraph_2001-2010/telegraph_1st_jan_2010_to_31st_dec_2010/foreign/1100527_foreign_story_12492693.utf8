The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US top villain in Pak conspiracy talk

	Islamabad, May 26: Americans may think that the failed Times Square bomb was planted by a man named Faisal Shahzad. But the view in the Supreme Court Bar Association here in Pakistans capital is that the culprit was an American think tank.        
	No one seems to know its name, but everyone has an opinion about it. It is powerful and shadowy, and seems to control just about everything in the American government.        
	They have planted this character Faisal Shahzad to implement their script, said Hashmat Ali Habib, a lawyer and a member of the bar association.        
	Who are they?         
	You must know, you are from America, he said smiling. My advice for the American nation is, get free of these think tanks.        
	Conspiracy theory is a national sport in Pakistan, where the main players  the US, India and Israel  change positions depending on the ebb and flow of history. Since 2001, the US has taken centre stage, looming so large in Pakistans collective imagination that it sometimes seems to be responsible for everything that goes wrong here.        
	When the water stops running from the tap, people blame America, said Shaista Sirajuddin, an English professor in Lahore.        
	The problem is more than a peculiar domestic phenomenon for Pakistan. It has grown into a narrative of national victimhood that is a nearly impenetrable barrier to any candid discussion of the problems here. In turn, it is one of the principal obstacles for the US in its effort to build a stronger alliance with a country to which it gives more than a billion dollars a year in aid.        
	It does not help that no part of the Pakistani state  either the weak civilian government or the powerful military  is willing to risk publicly owning that relationship.        
	One result is that nearly all of American policy towards Pakistan is conducted in secret, a fact that serves only to further feed conspiracies. American military leaders slip quietly in and out of the capital; the CIA uses networks of private spies; and the main tool of American policy here, the drone programme, is not even publicly acknowledged to exist. The lynchpin of US relations is security, and its not talked about in public, said Adnan Rehmat, a media analyst in Islamabad.        
	The empty public space fills instead with hardline pundits and loud Islamic political parties, all projected into Pakistani living rooms by the rambunctious new electronic media, dozens of satellite television networks that weave a black-and-white, prime-time narrative in which the US is the central villain.        
	People want simple explanations, like evil America, Zionist-Hindu alliance, said a Pakistani diplomat, who asked not to be named because of the delicate nature of the topic. Its gone really deep into the national psyche now.        
	One of those pundits is Zaid Hamid, a fast-talking, Right-wing television personality who rose to fame on one of Pakistans 90 new private television channels.         
	He uses Google searches to support his theory that India, Israel and the US  through their intelligence agencies  are conspiring to destroy Pakistan.

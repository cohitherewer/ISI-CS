                          Hows it going?                    
	Caracas, April 28 (AP): Hugo Chavez is starting to use Twitter to counter his opponents online, forcing a President who often talks for hours to sum up each thought in 140 characters or less.        
	Chavez urged Venezuelans to watch his newly created account  chavezcandanga  after midnight yesterday, saying at that point is when I let loose.        
	His first tweet in Spanish popped up at 14 minutes after midnight: Hey hows it going? I appeared like I said I would: at midnight. Im off to Brazil. And very happy to work for Venezuela. We will be victorious!!

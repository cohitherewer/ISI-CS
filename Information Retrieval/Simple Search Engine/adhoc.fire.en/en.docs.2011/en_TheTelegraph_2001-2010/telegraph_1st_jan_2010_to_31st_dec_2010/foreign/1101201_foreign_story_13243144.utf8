The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Medvedev warns of new arms race
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Medvedev warns of new arms race

	Moscow, Nov. 30 (Reuters): President Dmitry Medvedev warned today that a new arms race would erupt within the next decade unless Russia and the West forged an agreement to cooperate on building a missile defence system.        
	In his annual state of the nation address, Medvedev called for closer cooperation with the US and the EU, holding out the prospect of closer ties two decades after the Soviet Unions collapse ended the Cold War. He said tension would ratchet up fast, forcing Russia to bolster its military arsenal, if western offers of cooperation on a system to defend against missile threats failed to produce a concrete agreement.        
	The warning appeared to reflect wariness in the Kremlin over uncertainty about US Senate ratification of New START, the nuclear arms limitation pact Medvedev signed with President Barack Obama in April. In the coming decade we face the following alternatives: Either we reach agreement on missile defence and create a full-fledged joint mechanism of cooperation, or ... a new round of the arms race will begin, Medvedev said.        
	And we will have to take a decision about the deployment of new offensive weapons. It is clear that this scenario would be very grave.

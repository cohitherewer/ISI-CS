The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Resolution hint in US-Russia spy swap
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Resolution hint in US-Russia spy swap
                          Igor Sutyagin                    
	Moscow, July 8 (AP): The largest Russia-US spy swap since the Cold War appeared to be in motion today, with a Russian convicted of spying for the US reportedly plucked from a Moscow prison and flown to Vienna.         
	Defence lawyers in New York said they expected an immediate resolution for their 10 clients charged with spying in the US. A swap would have significant consequences for efforts between Washington and Moscow to repair ties chilled by a deepening atmosphere of suspicion.        
	Ten people accused of spying for Russia were set to go before a New York judge later today at a hearing in the federal court. An 11th person charged in the case is a fugitive after jumping bail in Cyprus.        
	Igor Sutyagin, a Russian arms control analyst serving a 14-year sentenced for spying for the US, had told his relatives he was going to be one of 11 convicted spies in Russia who would be freed in exchange for 11 people charged in the US with being Russian agents. They said he was going to be sent to Vienna, then London.        
	In Moscow, his lawyer Anna Stavitskaya said a journalist called Sutyagins family to inform them that he was seen walking off a plane in Vienna today.         
	Special riot police had beefed up security around Moscows Lefortovo prison early today and a gaggle of TV cameras and photographers jostled for the best position to see what was going on.         
	A convoy of armoured vehicles arrived at the prison, thought to be the central gathering point for people convicted of spying for the West, including Sutyagin. Police cars and jail trucks left the prison all morning but it was unclear if they carried any passengers.        
	A swap seems very much on the cards. There is political will on both sides, and actually by even moving it as far as they have, Moscow has de facto acknowledged that these guys were spies, intelligence analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said. Five suspects charged with spying in the US were hurriedly ordered to New York yesterday, joining five others already behind bars.        
	Dmitry Sutyagin said his brother remembered only one other person on the Russian list of spies to be exchanged  Sergei Skripal, a colonel in Russian military intelligence who in 2006 was sentenced to 13 years on charges of spying for Britain.        
	In a federal indictment unsealed yesterday in New York, the 11 suspects were charged with conspiring to act as secret agents. Nine of them were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering.

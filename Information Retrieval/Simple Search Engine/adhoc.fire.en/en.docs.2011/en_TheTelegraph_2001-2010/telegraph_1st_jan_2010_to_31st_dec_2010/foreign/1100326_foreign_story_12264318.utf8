          NICHOLAS WADE                          The Denisova cave in southern Siberia. (AP)                                  
	New York, March 25: A previously unknown kind of human group vanished from the world so completely that it has left behind the merest wisp of evidence that it ever existed  a single bone from the little finger of a child, buried in a cave in the Altai mountains of southern Siberia.        
	Researchers extracted DNA from the bone and reported yesterday that it differed conspicuously from that of both modern humans and of Neanderthals, the archaic human species that inhabited Europe until the arrival of modern humans on the continent some 44,000 years ago.        
	The child who carried the DNA lineage was probably 5 to 7 years old, but it is not yet known if it was a boy or a girl. The finger bone was excavated by Russian archaeologists in 2008 from a place known as the Denisova cave.        
	The researchers, led by Johannes Krause and Svante Paabo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, are careful not to call the Denisova child a new human species, though it may prove to be so, because the evidence is preliminary.        
	But they say the genetic material extracted from the bone, an element called mitochondrial DNA, belonged to a distinct human lineage that migrated out of Africa at a different time from the two known archaic human species.         
	Homo erectus, found in East Asia, left Africa two million years ago, and the ancestor of Neanderthals emigrated some 500,000 years ago. The number of differences found in the childs DNA indicate that its ancestors left Africa about one million years ago, the researchers say. Their report is published online in the journal Nature.        
	Paabo, a pioneer in decoding ancient human DNA, said at a news conference that before asserting that the Denisova child was a new species, he needed to rule out the possibility that it belonged to a population formed by interbreeding between the new lineage and a known species.

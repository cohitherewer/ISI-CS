	Padma privacy    
	 Los Angeles, March 19 (PTI): The whole world is waiting for her to confirm that the father of her baby is venture capitalist Adam Dell, but Indian supermodel Padma Lakshmi wants the media to stop hounding her.       
	I have a newborn! I just want some peace and privacy, she told People magazine. The Top Chef host, who gave birth to her daughter Krishna last month, has been quiet about the identity of the father ever since she announced her pregnancy in January.      
	But a source close to her admits it is indeed Dell who has fathered the child.     
	Kate move

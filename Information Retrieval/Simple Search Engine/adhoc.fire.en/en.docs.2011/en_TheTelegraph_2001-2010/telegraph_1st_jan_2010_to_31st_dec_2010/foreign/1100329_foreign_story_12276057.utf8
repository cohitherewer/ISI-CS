                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hunt in lake for Arab fund boss
                            
	Rabat/Abu Dhabi, March 28 (Reuters): Rescuers today were searching a Moroccan hillside lake for the boss of the worlds largest sovereign fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), two days after his plane crashed into it.        
	The aircraft of Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahayan, the younger brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, who is also President of the United Arab Emirates, crashed into a reservoir 10km south of the Moroccan capital Rabat on Friday.        
	The search is still going on, that is all that I can tell you, Moroccan communications minister Khalid Naciri said.        
	Sheikh Ahmed is in his early 40s and was ranked No. 27 on Forbes list of the worlds most powerful people last year.        
	His sovereign wealth fund is believed to have assets of around $500 billion to $700 billion, ranging from Citigroup bonds to a stake in Britains Gatwick airport to residential property in major cities.        
	Few details have emerged about the accident except that the pilot of the craft was rescued after it crashed near Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdallah Dam.         
	Residents of the area said the sheikh was a regular visitor and that the Abu Dhabi royal family had a palace overlooking the reservoir, which is swollen because of high rainfall and estimated to be about 60 meters deep.        
	Dozens of police today blocked roads leading to the lake.

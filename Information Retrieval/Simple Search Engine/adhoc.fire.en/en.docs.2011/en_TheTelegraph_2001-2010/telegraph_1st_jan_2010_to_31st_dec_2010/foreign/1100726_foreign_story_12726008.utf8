The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China human tide in Tibet

          EDWARD WONG                              
	Lhasa (Tibet), July 25: They come by new high-altitude trains, four a day, cruising 1,200 miles past snow-capped mountains. And they come by military truck convoy, lumbering across the roof of the world.         
	Han Chinese workers, investors, merchants, teachers and soldiers are pouring into remote Tibet. After the violence that ravaged this region in 2008, Chinas aim is to make Tibet wealthier  and more Chinese.         
	Chinese leaders see development, along with an enhanced security presence, as the key to pacifying the Buddhist region. The central government invested $3 billion in the Tibet Autonomous Region last year, a 31 per cent increase over 2008. Tibets gross domestic product is growing at a 12 per cent annual rate, faster than the robust Chinese national average.         
	Simple restaurants located in white prefabricated houses and run by ethnic Han businesspeople who take the train have sprung up even at a remote lake north of Lhasa.         
	About 1.2 million rural Tibetans, nearly 40 per cent of the regions population, have been moved into new residences under a comfortable housing programme. And officials promise to increase tourism fourfold by 2020 to 20 million visitors a year.         
	But if the influx of money and people has brought new prosperity, it has also deepened the resentment among many Tibetans. Migrant Han entrepreneurs elbow out Tibetan rivals, then return home for the winter after reaping profits. Large Han-owned companies dominate the main industries, from mining to construction to tourism.         
	Why did I come here? To make money, of course! said Xiong Zhahua, a migrant from Sichuan Province who spends five months a year running a restaurant on the shores of chilly Nam Tso, the lake north of Lhasa.         
	A rare five-day official tour of Tibet, though carefully managed by the Chinese foreign ministry, provided a glimpse of life in the region during a period of tight political and military control.         
	Tibet is more stable after security forces quelled the worst uprising against Chinese rule in five decades. But the increased ethnic Han presence  and the uneven benefits of Han-led investment  have kept the region on edge. Some Chinese officials acknowledge the disenfranchisement of Tibetans, though they defend the right of Han to migrate here.         
	One high school student complained that Tibetans could not compete for jobs with Han migrants who arrived with high school diplomas. Tibetans just get low-end jobs, he said.

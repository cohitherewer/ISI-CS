The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Varsity fee row in UK 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Varsity fee row in UK 
                            
	London, Oct. 12 (Reuters): Britains government gave broad backing today to proposals that could lead to a doubling of university fees, further squeezing millions of families and potentially fuelling tensions in the two-party coalition.        
	The proposals, in a government-ordered review, would remove the cap of 3,290 a year that universities are allowed to charge students for their tuition, and take Britain closer to a US-style fees model.        
	They go to the heart of a fierce political debate over the role of the state and the fairness of tax and benefits as the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition tries to cut spending by 25 per cent over the next four years        
	By transferring a big chunk of costs from the state to the student, the plan will help the governments efforts to curb a peacetime record budget deficit, equivalent to 11 per cent of gross domestic product.        
	But it will hit many families already hurt by last weeks decision to scrap child benefit from 2013 for households where either parent earns over 44,000 a year.        
	The Liberal Democrats, left-leaning junior partners in the coalition, pledged at Mays general election to abolish university tuition fees, but leading figures in the party admitted today they now needed to reverse that stand.        
	My own party consistently opposed graduate contributions but in this current economic climate we accept that the policy is simply no longer feasible, business secretary Vince Cable, a Liberal Democrat said.        
	The government would invite suggestions in coming weeks before making recommendations to parliament, with a view to implementing the changes in 2012, he said.        
	Some Liberal Democrat lawmakers vowed to fight the fees plan, exposing potential cracks in the coalition with the centre-right Conservatives.        
	Im going to resist any attempt to increase fees and I believe there are other colleagues who will do the same, said Liberal Democrat parliamentarian Greg Mulholland.        
	Leading universities say they need the freedom to charge higher fees to retain the best academics and keep pace with top US institutions.

	Girls are welcome    
	 Rome, Feb. 14: Silvio Berlusconi has said that while illegal immigrants are not welcome in Italy he will make an exception for beautiful girls, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	The Italian Prime Minister, who is renowned for making jokes of questionable taste, was speaking to journalists after holding talks with the Prime Minister of Albania, Sali Berisha.      
	Berlusconi, 73, said an accord between Italy and Albania had successfully clamped down on the trafficking of illegal immigrants across the Adriatic Sea by people smugglers.      
	He then joked: I said to Sali  wed make exceptions for anyone bringing over beautiful girls. Berlusconi, whose wife is divorcing him for his alleged philandering, also joked with female Albanian journalists: You know Im single now.

	Jakarta, Oct. 26: Indonesian authorities scrambled to deal with two deadly disasters today after a tsunami and volcanic eruptions struck in separate regions of the vast Indonesian archipelago.        
	In the first, rescue workers and fishermen scoured for survivors through waters west of Sumatra island after a powerful earthquake and resulting tsunami killed at least 113 people and left hundreds missing, including at least eight foreigners, officials said.         
	The tsunami, triggered by a 7.7-magnitude undersea quake, slammed into the remote Mentawai islands late yesterday, wreaking havoc in villages in the south of the island chain and, the authorities believe, sweeping scores out to sea. The islands are a popular destination for foreign surfers.        
	The disaster recalled the series of tsunamis set off by a much more powerful earthquake in December 2004. Those waves killed over 230,000 people in 14 countries, but hit hardest in the northern Sumatran province of Aceh.        
	The surge late yesterday was not as powerful, but it reached as high as 10 feet and advanced as far as 2,000 feet inland, according to officials at the health ministrys crisis centre. At one surf resort, a wall of water smashed apart wooden bungalows and left one tour boat flaming on the beach, said Rini Arif, a booking agent in the nearby city of Padang, on Sumatra.        
	Everyone survived because when the quake struck they ran into our cafe, which is three stories high, she said.         
	Meanwhile, on the island of Java, to the east, thousands of villagers were fleeing multiple eruptions of Indonesias most volatile volcano, Mount Merapi, after it began spewing clouds of hot ash in the early this evening. One person was killed and at least 10 people were injured, some with severe burns, as thousands living on the slopes of the volcano were evacuated.        
	In 1994, the volcano spewed an avalanche of blistering gases and rock fragments killed 60 people; 1,300 people died in a 1930 blast.        
	It was not immediately clear why the two Indonesian disasters occurred within hours of each other. Indonesia, an archipelago of 237 million people, is prone to earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic activity because of its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire  a series of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere to Japan and southeast Asia.

	Islamabad, July 29 (AP): Relatives desperate to find the bodies of loved ones joined emergency teams today at the scene of Pakistans worst-ever plane crash.        
	However, recovery work was badly hampered by thick mud, rain and slippery hillsides.        
	The Airbus A321 operated by local carrier Airblue crashed into hills overlooking Islamabad during stormy, monsoon weather, killing all 152 people on board. Wreckage was strewn over about a third of a one-square kilometre section of the forested slopes.        
	The Civil Aviation Authority said the plane had been ordered to take an alternative approach to the runway, but had veered off course. Finding out why will be a key task of the investigation team, said Riazul Haq, director general of the agency.        
	The fact remains it flew where it should not have done, he said. Army troops and civilian rescue workers searched a large stretch of the hills scorched by the crash, but the tough conditions slowed the pace of operations. Helicopters could not fly in the heavy rain and low clouds, said a spokesman for the Capital Development Authority.        
	An Associated Press Television News cameraman in the hills saw relatives of passengers working with soldiers and other rescuers at one crash site, where the undercarriage of the jet had come to rest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Surge in teen hearing loss cases
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Surge in teen hearing loss cases

	Aug. 18: One in five American teenagers now suffer from some type of hearing loss, an increase of 31 per cent since the mid-Nineties, new research shows.        
	Most cases of hearing loss are slight, affecting only one ear and involving mostly high-frequency sounds, according to a study in todays Journal of the American Medical Association. Many teens may not even notice the hearing change. About one in 20 have mild or worsening hearing loss, which can make them struggle to follow conversations or teachers at school.        
	An Australian study of kids with mild to moderate hearing loss found that using a portable music player, such as an iPod, was linked to 70 per cent increased risk of hearing loss. And in a study of New York college students, Brian Fligor, director of diagnostic audiology at Childrens Hospital, Boston, who wasnt involved in the study, found that more than half were listening to an MP3 player above the recommended exposure levels, which are 90 minutes a day at 80 per cent of the maximum volume.        
	Its very concerning, says study author Josef Shargorodsky, an otolaryngology/head and neck surgery resident at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston. Other studies show that even a small hearing loss can harm a childs school performance, language development and social interactions, he said.        
	Parents may have trouble spotting the change as well, given that teens often tune their parents out, says Shargorodsky, whose research was conducted at the Channing Laboratory at Brigham and Womens Hospital, also in Boston.        
	Parents may notice other changes  such as an unexplained drop in grades  that could signal hearing loss, he said.        
	Because hearing loss is cumulative, these teens are at high risk for significant hearing problems as adults, says Fligor. Instead of developing noticeable hearing problems at age 50 or 60, these teens may have trouble hearing beginning at age 40.        
	Researchers based their findings on records of and interviews with nearly 4,700 kids aged between 12 and19, led by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.        
	They found no link between hearing loss and ear infections. Kids who reported being exposed to loud noise for at least five hours a week were no more likely to have hearing problems than others, says Shargorodsky, although he notes that teens usually arent very good at accurately keeping track of their noise exposure.        
	Children living below the poverty level were much more likely to have hearing loss, possibly because poor kids have worse health in general, Fligor says. Shargorodsky says his research does not explain why hearing loss is becoming more common. But doctors say the study points out the need to do more to protect childrens hearing. Kids are growing up in a noisier world, Fligor notes.        
	But iPods and rock concerts are not the only source of noise in a childs world. Kids are also at risk if they fail to protect their ears when mowing the lawn, hunting with a rifle or attending noisy events, such as Nascar races, Fligor says.

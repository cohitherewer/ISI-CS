The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | MP hides cash in bra
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      MP hides cash in bra

	London, Feb. 8: Britains politicians have already been shamed for exploiting the Westminster expenses system to subsidise their sometimes-lavish lifestyles.         
	Now a high-profile Conservative backbencher has been caught cheating in a social experiment designed to help MPs understand how poorer sections of society live.         
	Nadine Dorries, MP for Mid Bedfordshire, is one of five politicians who agreed to be filmed living with families on council estates for Tower Block of Commons, a Channel 4 reality television show.         
	The politicians are asked to survive for a week while spending no more than 64.30  a weeks job seekers allowance.         
	I know what I have to live on, the 52-year-old MP told the cameras as she began her stint. I wouldnt be much of an MP if I didnt.         
	However, after spending only one night in the flat it emerged that she had broken the rules by hiding a 50 note down her bra.         
	Describing the moment at which the MPs hidden cash was revealed, the host told the camera: Last night after everyone had gone, she (Dorries) comes into the bedroom and puts her hand into her bra and pulled out 50.         
	Dorries wrote in her blog: When the camera crew left on the first night, I told my host I had the money. I didnt have to, she would never have known.         
	Challenged by the woman who saw her retrieving the cash, Dorries confessed she had stowed away some extra money somewhere safe.         
	I did, I did have money in my bra, she says. I brought it to get things for the kids.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Deadly blast traps miners in China
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Deadly blast traps miners in China
                                      Rescuers get ready to enter the mine in Yuzhou   on Saturday. (AP)        
	Beijing, Oct. 16 (AP): Rescuers battled dangerous levels of gas, tons of coal dust and the risk of falling rocks as they worked to free 16 miners trapped by an explosion at a mine in central China early today. Twenty-one miners were confirmed killed.        
	The blast in Yuzhou, in central Chinas Henan province, happened as the world still was celebrating Chiles dramatically successful rescue of 33 miners trapped for more than two months.        
	Rescuers have located the 16 Chinese miners but must clear tons of coal dust from the mine shaft to reach them, the state-run Xinhua News Agency cited a rescue spokesman as saying. It wasnt clear if the miners were alive or how far underground they were trapped.        
	The blast unleashed more than 2,500 tons of coal dust, an engineer for one of the mines parent companies, Du Bo, told Xinhua.        
	The report said ventilation has resumed in the mining pit but gas levels remain high.        
	The gas level inside the mine was 40 per cent, far higher than the normal level of around 1 per cent, China Central Television reported.        
	The gas wasnt specified, but methane is a common cause of mine blasts, and coal dust is explosive.        
	The more than 70 rescuers on the scene also must clear chunks of coal loosened by the blast that fell into the shaft, the state-run broadcaster said.        
	Twenty bodies had been retrieved by the afternoon, Xinhua said.        
	Chinas state-run media had joined the breathless global coverage of the Chilean mine rescue, and the countrys propaganda and mine officials likely will face pressure to be just as open about the progress of its rescue efforts.        
	Ecuador rescue        
	Scores of rescuers began excavation work today at a mine in southern Ecuador where a cave-in trapped four workers 500 feet underground, reports Reuters. There was still no word on whether the four night-shift workers had survived the tunnel collapse early yesterday.

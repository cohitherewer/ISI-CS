The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Women more vulnerable to stress
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Women more vulnerable to stress
          RICHARD ALLEYNE                              
	June 16: Women are twice as vulnerable to stress as men because of greater sensitivity to a substance produced at times of anxiety, new research suggests.        
	Neuroscientists believe that the study could provide a biological reason why women are more likely to suffer from depression and stress disorders than their male counterparts.        
	The team found that the brains of females are more sensitive to a hormone produced at times of anxiety and thought to be involved in stress management.        
	They found that they are not only more sensitive to low levels of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRT) but less able to cope when levels are high.         
	The research was carried out in rats but CRT is known to play a role in all mammals including humans.        
	Although more research is certainly necessary to determine whether this translates to humans, this may help to explain why women are twice as vulnerable as men to stress-related disorders, said the study leader Rita Valentino, a neuroscientist. Women have higher rates of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety problems.

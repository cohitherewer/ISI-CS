The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 3 UK youths held for Sikh murder
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      3 UK youths held for Sikh murder
          AMIT ROY                      Gurmail Singh: Battered                          
	London, Feb. 25: Three youths, one aged 18 and two seventeen year olds, were arrested today by police hunting the murderers of 63-year-old shopkeeper Gurmail Singh in Huddersfield, Yorkshire.        
	The arrests were made by police acting on information coming in to detectives.        
	The three, all from Huddersfield, will undergo forensic examination before they are questioned.        
	Singh died in hospital after he was battered, at least, nine times on the head with a hammer by four teenagers who had broken into his shop, Cowliffe Convenience Stores.        
	 Two of the boys escaped while the other two were tackled to the ground by witnesses from a nearby pub who suspected a robbery was in progress. But they, too, managed to wriggle free and run away. Only a paltry amount of cash, cigarettes and sweets was taken.        
	The attack took place at 8.30pm last Saturday. Singh died at 3.30am on Sunday.        
	The shopkeeper, who came to the UK in 1963, had celebrated his 63rd birthday on Friday. He leaves behind a wife, two adult sons and a daughter.        
	The killing might not have been an opportunist crime though that would have been serious enough. It seems Singh had stopped two boys from stealing from his shop earlier in the week and that they returned with two more of their gang to wreak vengeance on the shopkeeper.        
	It is a sad reality that most Indian shopkeepers are vulnerable to attacks by youths, many alienated, who feel they have almost a right to help themselves without having to pay. Over the years, a number of Indian shopkeepers have been killed for seeking to defend their properties.        
	Singh, like many others like him, was prepared to put in the hours the youths were not. For seven days a week, he worked from 6am to 9pm. He even delivered papers before the shop opened, police said admiringly.        
	But, in a curious way, the more prosperous Indian shopkeepers have become, the more it has often enraged the unemployed and uneducated unemployable. That might explain why Singh was hit nine times when a single blow might have been deemed sufficient to stun him and allow the youths to escape.        
	 Speaking outside the shop today, Detective Superintendent Dave Pervin, who is heading the investigation, stressed: My appeal for information in this investigation stands and it is imperative that we still receive information from the public into the incident.        
	Mr Singh worked extremely hard, he commented. He was well liked by everyone. Hes described as extremely jolly, would do absolutely anything for anyone. There was absolutely, absolutely no need for them to do what they did. The support and the comments that have come from this community in these last two days, everybody is saying exactly the same  what a wonderful, wonderful man this was and what an absolute tragedy and shame this is.        
	More than 30 bunches of flowers have been laid outside Singhs home, a short distance from his store. One notes read: In memory of a gentle gentleman.        
	The murder even came up in the Commons today when the Labour Party deputy leader, Harriet Harman, told MPs: I want to express my sincerest condolences to the family for what is an absolutely tragic loss of life, an absolutely tragic situation. I know that its something obviously felt not only very deeply by his immediate family but by the whole neighbourhood and I pay tribute to those who, from the local pub, went to his aid.        
	Her remarks came during Commons exchanges after Barry Sheerman, Labour MP for Huddersfield, said Singh had been much-loved and respected and asked whether it would be an appropriate time to debate the value of small shops.        
	Harman, leader of the Commons, said the government took every step to ensure that corner shops were supported. But her point of view may not be shared by Indian shopkeepers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | No qwerty keypad in new Berry
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      No qwerty keypad in new Berry
          HARRY WALLOP                          A BlackBerry Pearl 8100 with a qwerty keypad                                  
	London, April 26: Blackberry has manufactured its first handset using a normal mobile phone keypad: the Pearl 3G.        
	Research in Motion, the manufacturer of Blackberry, unveiled the phone today at its WES2010 conference in Orlando, Florida, saying the device was its smallest ever handset.        
	The Pearl 3G weighs 93g compared with the Bold 9700, which is 122g. It measures 4.25 inches by 1.96 inches and is 0.52 inches thick, making it look like a normal mobile phone, rather than a classic BlackBerry.        
	 It has also, for the first time ever, completely ditched its normal qwerty keypad  which allowed business users to write long emails or documents on the move  in favour of a standard mobile phone layout. Blackberrys apeing of a traditional typewriter layout has helped win over 40 million BlackBerry users around the world. The number 2 button doubles up as the A, B, C letter button; number 3 is D, E, F and so on.        
	The Pearl 3G with this new alphanumeric keypad will only be available in Europe and West Asia. American customers will carry on using the hybrid qwerty keypad, where the first button (the punctation button) is also Q and W.        
	Kat Hannaford, contributing editor to the gadget website Gizmodo, said: Thats quite a change for BlackBerry. You can tell from their advertising that they are going for the youth market and break away from being a device for suited businessmen. The alphanumeric keypad will certainly be more accessible for younger users.        
	The Pearl 3G also has a 3.2 megapixel camera, a considerable upgrade from the original Pearls 2MP camera. It also has an optical trackpad, rather than the trackball, which was the common navigation tool on old BlackBerries.        
	It uses GPS, enabling BlackBerry maps, as well as Wi-Fi and 3G networks.        
	Mike Lazaridis, president of Research In Motion, said: Considering the fast growing consumer interest in smartphones and the fact that more than three-quarters of the people in the global mobile phone market are still buying handsets with a traditional alphanumeric keypad, we think the new BlackBerry Pearl 3G addresses a market opportunity. It allows consumers to upgrade their mobile phone to a full-featured, easy-to-use and fashionable 3G BlackBerry smartphone.

          HEIDI BLAKE                          Christ Church college in Oxford                                  
	London, Feb. 20: Students at one of Oxfords most highly regarded colleges have been accused of dealing heroin as part of a considerable drugs culture.        
	Authorities at Christ Church circulated an email warning students that they would be handed over to police if they were caught with the class A drug after an anonymous tip-off that undergraduates were allegedly selling heroin.        
	Christ Church, among the largest of the universitys 38 colleges, became entangled in a drugs scandal in 1986 when Olivia Channon, the daughter of the Conservative cabinet minister Paul Channon, died on campus from a heroin overdose at the age of 22. Channon was celebrating the end of her finals when she died after a drugs party in the rooms of Count Gottfried von Bismarck.        
	The count died in 2007 following a two-day heroin and cocaine binge. Ian Watson, the junior college censor in charge of discipline, sent students an email over the latest incident this month, with the subject line: Urgent warning concerning drugs.        
	The law applies just as rigorously within college as elsewhere. The censors have neither the power nor the wish to protect anyone who breaks it, he wrote in the message.        
	Setting out the allegations, he added: Last week the censors received an anonymous letter alleging the existence in Christ Church of a considerable drugs culture, including the supplying of class A drugs such as heroin.

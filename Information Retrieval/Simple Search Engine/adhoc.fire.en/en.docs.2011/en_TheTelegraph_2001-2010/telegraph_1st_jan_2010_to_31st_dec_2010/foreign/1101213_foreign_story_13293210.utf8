	Washington, Dec. 12 (Reuters): New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has said there is no way, no how that he will run for the US presidency.        
	Appearing on NBCs Meet the Press, Bloomberg said he intends to remain focused on being mayor, and that those urging him to seek the presidency should cease and desist.        
	The bottom line is that Ive great job, Bloomberg said. I want to go out being, having a reputation, as a very good, maybe the greatest mayor ever.        
	Im not going to run for president, Bloomberg said.

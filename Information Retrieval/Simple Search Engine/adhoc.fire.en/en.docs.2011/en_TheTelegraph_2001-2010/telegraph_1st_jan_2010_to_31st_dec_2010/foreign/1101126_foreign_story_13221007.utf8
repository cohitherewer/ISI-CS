The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Passengers unmoved by scan protests
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Passengers unmoved by scan protests

	Atlanta, Nov. 25: Americans celebrated National Opt-Out Day in relative quiet yesterday, standing peacefully in the traditional running of the airport security line, even when that tradition included full-body scans and pat-downs.        
	The Web-driven protest campaign encouraging holiday fliers to opt out of the body scanners and choose the more time-consuming and physical pat-downs passed largely unobserved in key airports around the country.        
	Lines moved fairly quickly at security checkpoints, passengers generally refrained from complaint, and the chaos and congestion anticipated by many in the news media and feared by many travellers did not materialise. As for the new security measures, travellers for the most part accepted them with resignation or indifference.        
	Weve had 10 years to be desensitised; Im not sure why people are freaking out now, said Dr Janice Manjuck, 50, a physician from San Francisco who was travelling with her husband and 11-year-old son to Norfolk, Virginia. Dr Manjuck said she doubted the efficacy of the pat-downs and body scanners, but did not particularly object to them. Were from San Francisco, so were used to nudity, she said.        
	Others considered them a necessary inconvenience in the name of security. If its going to keep me and others safe, Im all for it, said the Rev. George Oberle, a Lutheran minister who said he had gladly submitted his body for a scan on his way to New York from Detroit. Im 50, he said. Im proud of what Ive got.        
	There were a handful of protests, small groups of people handing out leaflets, reading aloud from the Constitution or wearing signs that riffed profanely on the abbreviations for the Transportation Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security. A man walked around a terminal in the Salt Lake City airport wearing only a swimsuit, boots and a cap.

	Peshawar, Dec. 24: Eleven members of Pakistans paramilitary Frontier Corps were killed and nine were wounded today when about 150 militants launched simultaneous attacks on five security posts in the northwestern Mohmand tribal region close to the Afghan border.         
	The official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said that the security forces had received a tip about an impending assault, but frankly, we didnt expect an attack of this scale and magnitude.         
	He said that 24 militants were killed in the clashes that went on for several hours but displayed the bodies of only eight militants to the local media. Our assessment is based on militants intercepts and chatter, the official said.         
	The simultaneous attacks in the Baizai area close to the Afghan border were the biggest in recent months after Pakistani forces launched operations in the lawless tribal regions along the border.         
	A government official said that militants in the Mohmand region have largely been confined to a small area that adjoins Pakistans Bajaur tribal area.

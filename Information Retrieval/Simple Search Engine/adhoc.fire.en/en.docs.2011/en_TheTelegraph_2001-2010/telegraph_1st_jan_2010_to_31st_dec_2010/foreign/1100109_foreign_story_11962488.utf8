	United Nations, Jan. 8 (Reuters): A trio of forensic experts believe that video footage that, according to an advocacy group, shows Sri Lankan soldiers summarily executing Tamils appears genuine, a UN investigator said yesterday.        
	Britains Channel 4 television aired a video last year that, according to the Journalists for Democracy group, shows government troops killing unarmed, naked, bound and blindfolded Tamils during the armys final assault to smash Tamil Tiger rebels last year. Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, told reporters a forensic pathologist, a forensic video analyst and a firearms expert had all concluded that the video showed no evidence of having been doctored or staged and appears to be genuine.        
	In light of these conclusions and of the persistent flow of other allegations concerning alleged extrajudicial executions committed by both sides ... I call for an independent inquiry to be established to carry out an impartial investigation, Alston said.        
	Sri Lankas government has dismissed the Channel 4 video as a fake, though it did announce the creation of what it described as an independent inquiry to look into allegations of possible war crimes raised by the US state department and Alston.

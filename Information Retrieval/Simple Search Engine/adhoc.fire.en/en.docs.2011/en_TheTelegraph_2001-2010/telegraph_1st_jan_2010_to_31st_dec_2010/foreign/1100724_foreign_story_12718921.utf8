                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Apple says white iPhone will be delayed
                              A white iPhone                            
	New York, July 23 (Reuters): Customers will not be able to get their hands on Apple Incs white iPhone 4 until later this year, the company said today, conceding that making the model has proven surprisingly difficult.        
	Apple, in a brief statement, said that its black iPhone 4 had not been affected. As for the white iPhone, the company said it has continued to be more challenging to manufacture that we originally expected.        
	Apple did not provide further details in its statement or give a precise date when the white model would be available. The newest iPhone, while selling quickly, has created a series of headaches for Apple, the biggest being the suggestion that its design was flawed because of a problem with the antenna.

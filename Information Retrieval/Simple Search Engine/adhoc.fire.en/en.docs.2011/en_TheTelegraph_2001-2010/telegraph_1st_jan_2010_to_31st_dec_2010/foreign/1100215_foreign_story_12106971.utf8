The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Zardari, court in showdown
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Zardari, court in showdown
                          Zardari                    
	Islamabad, Feb. 14 (Reuters): A judicial crisis loomed in Pakistan today after the Supreme Court blocked an order from President Asif Ali Zardari appointing two judges.        
	The confrontation has been brewing for some weeks over appointments to the Supreme Court and provincial high courts.        
	Zardari yesterday issued an order appointing two judges, Khawaja Sharif and Saqib Nisar, as judges of the Supreme Court and chief justice of Lahore High Court respectively. But hours later, the Supreme Court blocked the appointments.        
	An apex court panel said the Presidents appointment order had been suspended because Zardari had apparently violated the constitution by not consulting Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry.        
	The Dawn newspaper said in an editorial that the country was facing a highly arcane and technical dispute over constitutional prerogatives between the executive and the head of the superior judiciary.        
	(The dispute) nevertheless carries the potential for having seriously destabilising effects on the polity, the newspaper said today.        
	Historically, clashes between these two institutions have led to disastrous consequences for democracy and constitutional continuity, it said.        
	The row occurred two months after the Supreme Court threw out an amnesty that had protected Zardari, several top aides and thousands of political activists and civil servants, mostly from corruption charges.        
	The end of the amnesty sparked a political storm and raised questions about Zardaris future.        
	The Supreme Court, in blocking Zardaris appointments late yesterday, said that according to the constitution, the President should make Supreme Court appointments after consultation with the chief justice. According to the record of this court, no consultation had taken place, the court said in a statement.        
	But Zardaris spokesperson, Farhatullah Babar, denied any impropriety, saying the chief justice had been consulted.

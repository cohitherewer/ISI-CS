                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      12 held in UK terror swoop
          ALAN COWELL AND RAVI SOMAIYA                                    
	London, Dec. 20: In the latest of several European terrorism alerts, the British police arrested 12 men before dawn today in raids in three cities under counter-terrorism laws  the biggest operation of its kind for months.         
	The action, designed to ensure public safety, as the police put it, followed a suicide bombing in Sweden earlier this month and alarms in Germany over the reported threat of a terror attack modelled on the onslaught by gunmen in Mumbai.         
	But a Scotland Yard spokesman, speaking in return for anonymity under police rules, said the arrests were not linked to an unfolding terrorism investigation in Luton, just north of London, where Taimour Abdulwahab Al-Abdaly, a 28-year-old Swedish-Iraqi man who killed himself and wounded two others when he detonated two bombs in Stockholm on December 11, is said to have lived and studied. The spokesman said that no arrests have been made in Abdalys case, and that the inquiry continues.         
	The BBC said the 12 men arrested today were involved in a plot to bomb unspecified targets in Britain, inspired by al Qaida. Some of the suspects were said to have Bangladeshi origins.         
	John Yates, Britains ranking counter-terrorism police officer, said the detained men were from London, the Welsh city of Cardiff and Stoke-on-Trent in the English Midlands. The operation is in its early stages so we are unable to go into detail at this time about the suspected offences, Yates said in a statement. However, I believe it was necessary at this time to take action in order to ensure public safety.         
	He described the raids as a large scale, pre-planned and intelligence-led operation involving several police forces. The officers who made the arrests  apparently after weeks of surveillance  were not armed, the police said, suggesting that they had not moved to thwart an imminent terror attack.         
	Newark scare        
	Security forces began allowing passengers back into Newark Airports Terminal A after it was shut for more than half an hour early today because of a suspicious package, a Reuters witness said. The package contained a computer monitor, 1010 WINS radio said.

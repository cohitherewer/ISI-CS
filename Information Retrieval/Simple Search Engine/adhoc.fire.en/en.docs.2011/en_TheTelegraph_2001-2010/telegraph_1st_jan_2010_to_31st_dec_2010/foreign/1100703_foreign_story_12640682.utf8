The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Russia scraps vodka tax
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Russia scraps vodka tax
                            
	Moscow, July 2 (Reuters): Russia has scrapped the idea of hiking taxes on vodka, the latest in a string of rejections of revenue-raising proposals that are raising the chan- ces Moscow may have to borrow to plug its budget deficit.        
	Prime Minister Vladimir Putins spokesman said today the idea was ditched in a closed-door session on Tuesday. There will not be a sharp, one-time rise (in excise duties on alcohol), Dmitry Peskov said.        
	Such a rise will have many negative side effects, including an increase in counterfeit alcohol production, which poses a threat to peoples health.         
	Renaissance Capital analyst Ulyana Lenvalskaya said the move was politically motivated ahead of the 2012 presidential election.

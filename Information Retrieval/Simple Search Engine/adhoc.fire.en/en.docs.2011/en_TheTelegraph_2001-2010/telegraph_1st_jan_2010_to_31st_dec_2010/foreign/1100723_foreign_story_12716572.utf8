	 New York, July 22 (Reuters): Its guitars at 20 paces as New York street musician, The Naked Cowboy, lassoed his Times Square rival, The Naked Cowgirl, with a lawsuit.      
	Muscular Robert Burck, who earns money playing his guitar and posing for photos in Manhattan wearing just white briefs, a cowboy hat and cowboy boots, sued Sandy Kane in Manhattan federal court yesterday for trademark violation.      
	Burck, 39, says Kane  who wears a similarly skimpy outfit to busk in Times Square  has copied his look and sapped his profits. He demands unspecified damages.

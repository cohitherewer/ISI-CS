	Las Vegas, Aug. 28 (AP): Paris Hilton was arrested late yesterday after a police motorcycle officer smelled marijuana smoke wafting from a black Cadillac Escalade driven by her boyfriend on the Las Vegas Strip, then found cocaine in her purse, authorities said.        
	A crowd quickly gathered when Hilton and Las Vegas nightclub mogul Cy Waits were stopped shortly before midnight in the vehicle near the Wynn Las Vegas resort, police said.        
	The 29-year-old celebrity socialite was taken into the hotel to keep her safe during the initial investigation, police Lt. Wayne Holman said.        
	Police Officer Marcus Martin said the motorcycle officer pulled the Escalade over on Las Vegas Boulevard after noticing smoke that smelled like marijuana. Police later found a substance in Hiltons purse that tests showed to be cocaine, Martin said.         
	Hilton was arrested on suspicion of felony cocaine possession. Waits, 34, was arrested on misdemeanour suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.        
	Both were booked into the Clark county jail, where Martin said Hilton was released without bail about 2:45am today. Less than an hour later, Hiltons Twitter account was updated with a posting that said the actress was in bed watching the television show Family Guy, and then that she was going to sleep.

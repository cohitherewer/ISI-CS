                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Powerful quake hits Sumatra
                            
	Jakarta, Oct. 25 (AP): A powerful earthquake hit off western Indonesia late today, briefly triggering a tsunami warning that sent thousands of panicked residents fleeing to high ground. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.        
	The 7.7-magnitude temblor struck at a depth of 20km off Sumatra island, said the US Geological Survey. At least five towns in the provinces of Bengkulu and West Sumatra were badly jolted, officials and witnesses said, as were the nearby Mentawai islands.        
	Everyone was running out of their houses, said Sofyan Alawi, a resident in the city of Padang, adding that, with loudspeakers from mosques blaring out tsunami warnings, the roads leading to surrounding hills were quickly jammed with cars and motorcycles.        
	We kept looking back to see if a wave was coming, said 28-year-old resident Ade Syahputra.        
	Areas closest to the epicentre of the 1442GMT quake were sparsely populated, and there were no immediate reports of damage or casual- ties, said Ade Edward, a disaster management agency official.        
	A 5.0-magnitude hit less than an hour after the original quake, and the region remained on alert for more.

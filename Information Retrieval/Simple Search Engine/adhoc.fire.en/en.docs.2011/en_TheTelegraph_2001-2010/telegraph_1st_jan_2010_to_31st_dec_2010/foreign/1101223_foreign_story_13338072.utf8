The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Apple removes WikiLeaks application
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Apple removes WikiLeaks application
                                  
	Boston, Dec. 22 (Reuters): Apple Inc has joined a growing number of US companies that have severed ties with WikiLeaks, removing an application from its online store that gave users access to the controversial websites content.        
	But Google Inc, which operates the second-largest online mobile applications store, has kept more than half a dozen apps available on its Android Marketplace that make it easier to access the confidential US government documents WikiLeaks had released on its site.        
	The two distinct approaches highlight how it is far tougher for developers to get on the iPhones platform than Androids. Some of the Android programmes provide direct access to the WikiLeaks cables, and one of them even alerts users whenever a new leaked document from the WikiLeaks repository is made public.        
	In past weeks, a host of companies from Amazon.com Inc to Bank of America has withdrawn services for WikiLeaks, which has outraged US authorities by releasing thousands of confidential state department cables.        
	But in a backlash against organisations that have cut off the site, cyberactivists have taken to targeting companies  such as Visa Inc  seen as foes of WikiLeaks.         
	Is it likely that Apple could become a target? Of course, said John Bumgarner, chief technology officer for the US Cyber Consequences Unit, and an expert in such attacks.        
	We removed the WikiLeaks App from the App Store because it violated our developer guidelines, Apple said in a statement today. Apps must comply with all local laws and may not put an individual or group in harms way.

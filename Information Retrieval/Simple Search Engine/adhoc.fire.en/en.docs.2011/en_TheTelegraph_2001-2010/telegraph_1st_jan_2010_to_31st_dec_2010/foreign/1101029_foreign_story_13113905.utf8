	Mariah child    
	 New York, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Mariah Carey, one of the worlds top selling singers, said today that she is pregnant with her first child.      
	The Grammy Award winning singer and her husband, rapper Nick Cannon, made the announcement at an interview broadcast on NBCs Today Show.      
	Yes, were pregnant, this is true. Its still early, were expecting in the spring, said Carey, confirming rumours that had been swirling for several months. Its been a long journey, but its been tough because I have been trying to hold on to a shred of privacy.

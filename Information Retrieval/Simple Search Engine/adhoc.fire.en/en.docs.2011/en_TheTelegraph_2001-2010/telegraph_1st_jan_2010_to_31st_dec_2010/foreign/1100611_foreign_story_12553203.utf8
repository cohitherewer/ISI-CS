                              not seductive                            
	Los Angeles, June 10 (PTI): She once seductively danced with a python in From Dusk Till Dawn, but actress Salma Hayek became hysterical when she spotted a snake at a TV interview.         
	Hayek, 43, jumped out of her seat and climbed on her Grown Ups co-stars when she saw the serpent on the set while taping an interview with Extra to promote the film, reports Us magazine.        
	Hayek shrieked: Somebody do something! Nooo! She climbed on to Rudolphs lap to get as far away as possible from the snake.

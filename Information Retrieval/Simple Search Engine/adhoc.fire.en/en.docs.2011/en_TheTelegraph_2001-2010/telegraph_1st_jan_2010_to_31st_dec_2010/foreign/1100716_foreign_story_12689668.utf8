	Chaplin film    
	 Arlington (Virginia), July 15 (AP): A short silent comedy that was lost for decades holds a big surprise for film buffs when a familiar face emerges from the bushes in police uniform and that unforgettable moustache.      
	The 1914 film, A Thief Catcher, was missing for so many years that everyone forgot Charlie Chaplin made a brief cameo as a buffoon cop, with all his familiar twitches and gestures.      
	Out of nowhere, the 10-minute film turned up late last year at a Michigan antiques sale. Chaplin is on screen for all of three minutes.

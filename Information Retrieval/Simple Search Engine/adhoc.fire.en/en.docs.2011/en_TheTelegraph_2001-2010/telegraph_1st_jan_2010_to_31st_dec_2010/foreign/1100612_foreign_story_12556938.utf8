The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | A labour movement spreads in China

          KEITH BRADSHER                      Striking workers at   the Honda plant in   Zhongshan. (Reuters)                                
	Zhongshan (China), June 11: Striking workers at a Honda auto parts plant here are demanding the right to form their own labour union, something that is officially forbidden in China.        
	They even held a protest march this morning.        
	Other scattered strikes have begun to ripple into Chinese provinces previously untouched by the labour unrest.        
	A near doubling of wages is the primary goal of the approximately 1,700 Honda workers on strike here in this southeastern China city, at the third Honda auto parts factory to face a work stoppage in the last two weeks.        
	A chanting but non-violent crowd of workers gathered outside the factory gates this morning and held a short protest march before dissolving into a large group of milling young workers who filled the two-lane road for more than a block outside the factory.        
	They were met by black-clad police with helmets, face masks and small round riot shields. But the workers showed no signs of being intimidated. The police marched off at midmorning, leaving the workers to block the road into the small industrial park next to a eucalyptus-lined muddy canal that runs past the factory.        
	The workers dispersed about an hour after the police left and remained on strike.        
	Management helped defuse the march by distributing a flier that essentially offered 50 renminbi, or about $7.30, for each of the eight days that the factory was closed beginning in late May as part of a nationwide shutdown of Honda manufacturing set off by a transmission factory strike. The management previously wanted to treat the shutdown as unpaid leave, workers said.        
	Only 50 or so striking workers showed up outside the factory after lunch today. Managers distributed a new flier urging them to return to work in the afternoon and saying that all would be forgiven if they did.

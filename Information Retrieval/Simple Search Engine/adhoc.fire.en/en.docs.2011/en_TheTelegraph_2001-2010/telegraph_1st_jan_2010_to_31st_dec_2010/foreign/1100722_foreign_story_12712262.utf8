	July 21: Facebook has reached 500 million members  the equivalent of connecting with eight per cent of the worlds population.        
	The milestone figure comes only five months after the social network signed up its 400th million user. The pace of its growth has accelerated rapidly  Facebook had only 150 million registered users in January 2009. If Facebook was a country, its 500 million members would make it the third-largest in the world.        
	To mark the half a billion milestone, the site has launched a new application called Facebook Stories, a website within Facebook, that encourages users to share their experiences of the social network.

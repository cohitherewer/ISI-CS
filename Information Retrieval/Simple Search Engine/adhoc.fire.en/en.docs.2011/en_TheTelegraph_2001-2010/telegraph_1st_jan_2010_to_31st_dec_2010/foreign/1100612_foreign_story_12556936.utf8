                              A file picture of Shawn and Larry King                            
	June 11: The wife of TV personality Larry King attempted suicide late last month in Utah by overdosing on prescription drugs as she battled depression, according to a police report.        
	The report, which was posted at celebrity news website TMZ.com, describes an officer with the Provo, Utah, police, entering 50-year-old Shawn Kings residence on May 2, going to a bedroom where paramedics were treating her and seeing multiple pill bottles, all of which were empty on the bed.        
	The report noted scriptures, a purse, other various books and a letter which appeared to be a note left by the victim.        
	It is unknown whose writing this letter was in, however wording on the letter led me to believe that (King) had intentionally taken the quantity of pills, the officer wrote in the report, which is labelled attempted suicide.        
	Labels on the bottles indicated multiple drugs including Ambien, Klonopin and Clonazepam, and many of them were empty, according to the report. One witness told police that Shawn King is always depressed, but she had not mentioned anything that she would want to hurt herself or take her own life.

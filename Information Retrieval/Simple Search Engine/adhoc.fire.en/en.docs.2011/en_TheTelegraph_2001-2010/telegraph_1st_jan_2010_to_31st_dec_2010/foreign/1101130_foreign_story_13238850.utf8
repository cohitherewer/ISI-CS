The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Leak reveals Singhs peace push
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Leak reveals Singhs peace push
          K.P. NAYAR                          Hopeful                                  
	Washington, Nov. 29: The massive leak of quarter million American diplomatic cables yesterday has unexpectedly thrown new light on prime minister Manmohan Singhs unwavering determination to resolve Indias outstanding disputes with Pakistan and realise his vision of a peaceful South Asia.        
	A confidential cable sent by the US embassy in Ankara to the state department nine months ago has revealed that the prime minister asked Turkish President Abdullah Gul during the latters visit to New Delhi in early February to use his good offices in making Pakistan see reason in its disputes with India.        
	Accordingly, Gul spoke to Pakistans President Asif Ali Zardari and conveyed Singhs message. But Zardari rejected the Turkish overture out of hand, according to what officials in Ankara told visiting US under-secretary of state for political affairs, William Burns on February 18.        
	Turkeys foreign ministry deputy under-secretary for South Asian Affairs, Engin Soysal, told Burns that Indian Prime Minister Singh had requested President Guls assistance with Pakistan during the latters visit to New Delhi the previous week.        
	Sosyal, who was Ankaras ambassador to Islamabad until a short while before the Burns visit, added that acting on that request, Gul had phoned Pakistani President Zardari, who (significantly) was skeptical of Indian intentions, the cable added.        
	This information is valuable for public discourse in India on relations with Pakistan although it will not be news for the government in New Delhi. The Turkish foreign ministry would, doubtless, have briefed the Indian ambassador in Ankara on Guls phone call to Zardari.        
	For those Indians who publicly campaign for patching up with Pakistan at any cost, it may come as a surprise that Zardari was negative in his reaction to the Turks, who are valued as friends in Islamabad for a variety of reasons, including Ankaras one-time support for Pakistan on Kashmir.        
	The popular view in India is that it is the Pakistan army which is blocking any settlement with India and that civlian leaders, including Zardari, are more amenable to peace. The cable, however, paints a different and more realistic picture.        
	The information is valuable also because it reveals the prime ministers mind. Although he was tough on Pakistan even in a joint press conference with President Barack Obama during the latters visit to New Delhi this month, Singh has clearly not yet given up hopes that Pakistan can be persuaded to see reason in its dealings with India and he continues to use diplomatic channels to pursue a goal of peace, which he has clearly set for his time in office.        
	Turkeys frank admission in the cable that it did not invite India to a neighbours summit on Afghanistan because it was mindful of Pakistani sensitivities may, however, be painful for New Delhi, which has been wooing Turkey in the hope of weaning it away from Islamabad.        
	Soysal said Turkey had not invited India to the neighbours summit in deference to Pakistani sensitivities. However, he claimed, Pakistan understands attempting to exclude India from the nascent South Asian regional structures would be a mistake, the cable quoted the Turkish official as telling Burns.        
	When the neighbours summit took place this January, there was much breast-beating in New Delhi that India had been excluded and it was widely speculated that Pakistan had blocked an invitation to India. But this is the first concrete evidence that Turkey had, indeed, caved in to pressure from Islamabad on this score.        
	An equally worrying revelation in the cable quotes Soysal as telling Burns that Iran is proposing a quadrilateal summit (on the Afghan problem), which would include Turkey, Afghanistan and Pakistan, but that proposal had yet to generate enthusiasm.        
	It is a statement which shows that even Iran does not consider India as important to a solution in Afghanistan, where New Delhis interests are deep and strategic.        
	The statement also acquires a significance which New Delhi must take note of considering that its relations with Tehran are clearly deteriorating. Any Indian action which may push Iran closer to Pakistan would have consequences for sensitive Indian interests in Kabul.        
	A crucial element in the dispatch throws light on Turkeys ambition to play a role in South Asia. In their discussions with Burns, Turkish officials described the Ankara Process and the recent Turkey-sponsored Afghanistan neighbours summit as Turkish efforts to assert regional responsibility for South Asias inter-linked problems.        
	That may explain Indian efforts in recent years to move closer to Turkey, which is a secular state in an increasingly radicalised Islamic region.        
	It would appear from the cable that the idea of Turkey as a player in South Asia is a role the US is not averse to since Ankara is a NATO member and is also active in Afghanistan.        
	In fact, unnoticed by the Indian public, Turkey may already be playing such a role. The cable quotes Turkish foreign ministry under-secretary Feridun Sinirlioglu as telling Burns that his country had chosen to focus on...the chronic antagonsim between Afghanistan and Pakistan...by pursuing its trilateral Ankara Process, which sponsors meetings of senior Afghan and Pakistani ministerial and intelligence counterparts.

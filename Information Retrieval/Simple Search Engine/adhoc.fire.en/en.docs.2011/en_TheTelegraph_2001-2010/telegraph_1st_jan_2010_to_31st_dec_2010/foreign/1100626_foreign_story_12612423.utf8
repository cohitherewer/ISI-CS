The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Yawning is a sign of sexual attraction 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Yawning is a sign of sexual attraction 
                            
	June 25: Yawning can be a sign of sexual attraction rather than a desire to sleep, scientists have claimed.        
	In fact, it can demonstrate a range of emotions including interest, stress and even wanting to have sex. Unfortunately scientists are not yet able to differentiate between a yawn that signifies arousal and the need to catch some sleep.        
	 The new theory was introduced at the first International Conference on Yawning, held in Paris yesterday. Much about yawning remains a mystery, despite the fact that the average person yawns 240,000 times in a lifetime.        
	Scientists still dont know exactly why we do it, although it is certain that the favourite theory that it provides extra oxygen to the brain is completely wrong.        
	Wolter Seuntjens, a Dutch academic who is a pioneer in chasmology (the science of yawn studies) said: We can send a man to the Moon but we cannot explain this most trivial of acts. The concept of the erotic yawn was created after Seuntjens noted that many sexologists were consulted by people who yawned during sex or foreplay.

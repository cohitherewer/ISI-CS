	Washington, Jan. 1: The deaths of seven CIA operatives at a remote base in the mountains of Afghanistan are a pointed example of the civilian spy agencys transformation in recent years into a paramilitary organisation at the vanguard of Americas far-flung wars.        
	Even as the CIA expands its role in Afghanistan, it is also playing a greater role in quasi-military operations elsewhere, using drone aircraft to launch a steady barrage of missile strikes in Pakistan and sending more operatives to Yemen to assist local officials in their attempts to roll back al Qaidas momentum in that country.        
	The CIA operatives stationed at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost province, where Wednesdays suicide bombing occurred, were responsible for collecting information about militant networks in Afghanistan and Pakistan and plotting missions to kill the networks top leaders.         
	In recent months, American officials said, CIA officers at the base had begun an aggressive campaign against a radical group run by Sirajuddin Haqqani, which has claimed responsibility for the deaths of dozens of American troops.        
	Over the past year, the CIA has built up an archipelago of firebases in southern and eastern Afghanistan, moving agency operatives out of the embassy in Kabul and closer to their targets. But the push to the front lines carries great risk.        
	In 1983 in Beirut, it took a car bomb loaded with 2,000 pounds of explosives to kill eight CIA officers stationed at the heavily fortified American embassy in the city. In Khost yesterday, all it took was one man bent on martyrdom to slip into a remote base and inflict a similar toll on the spy agencys relatively small work force.        
	Among those killed, officials said, was the chief of the Khost base, who was a mother of three and a veteran of the agencys clandestine branch. Besides the seven CIA operatives who died, the blast also wounded six agency employees, according to a CIA statement.        
	Current and former intelligence officials said yesterday that early evidence indicated that the bomber, in Afghan military fatigues, might have been taken onto the base as a possible informant and might not have been subjected to rigorous screening. But details about the episode remained murky, and a Nato official said the bomber had managed to elude security and reach an area near the bases gym.        
	CIA personnel regularly take foreign agents onto the base before sending them on intelligence collection missions in eastern Afghanistan and across the border into Pakistan, said one Pentagon consultant who works closely with the CIA in Afghanistan.        
	You must to some degree make yourself known to people you dont trust, said one American intelligence official who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke anonymously to discuss classified information.

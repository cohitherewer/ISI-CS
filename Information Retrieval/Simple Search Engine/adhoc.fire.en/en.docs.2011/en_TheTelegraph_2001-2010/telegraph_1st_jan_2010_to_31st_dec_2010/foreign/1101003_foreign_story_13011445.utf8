	Scent of Eva    
	 London, Oct. 2 (PTI): Actress Eva Longoria Parker thinks her newly launched perfume is the perfect way to attract a man as it smells so sensual.      
	She launched her debut fragrance Eva in April. I want him to devour the woman thats smelling my fragrance. If he smells my fragrance he should jump on that woman, said Longoria.      
	 One man who is definitely impressed with the fragrance is Evas husband, basketball player Tony Parker. He loves it. He also is not a very big fan of overpowering scents and so he loves it because this one is really light and subtle, said Longoria.

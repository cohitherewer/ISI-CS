The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 300,000 iPads sold on debut
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      300,000 iPads sold on debut
                            
	New York, April 5 (AP): Apple Inc. said today that it sold more than 300,000 iPads on its opening day, meeting the expectations of some analysts.        
	The figures, which included pre-orders that were picked up or delivered on Saturday, were hardly exceptional despite weeks of hype about the revolutionary nature of a new class of device that falls somewhere between the phone and computer.        
	In a research note earlier today, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster had doubled his initial forecast of first-day sales to 600,000 to 700,000, saying that lines were longer than expected and supply was also better than expected. But the actual numbers announced by Apple were closer to his original estimates.        
	Still, first-day US sales of the iPad exceeded those of the original iPhone in 2007, he said. He expects Apple to sell 1.3 million iPads in the current quarter compared with the 1.1 million for the iPhone in its first full quarter.

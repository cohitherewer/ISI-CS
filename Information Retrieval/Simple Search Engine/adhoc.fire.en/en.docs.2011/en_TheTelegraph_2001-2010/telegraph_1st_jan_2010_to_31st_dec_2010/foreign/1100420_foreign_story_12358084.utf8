	Implant weight    
	 New York, April 19 (AP): Celebrity Sharon Osbourne says she is removing her breast implants this summer and will give them to her husband, rocker Ozzy Osbourne, as a paperweight.      
	The 57-year-old reality TV star says the implants will be better on Ozzys desk than on my chest cause theyre awful.      
	She confirmed reports of her plans to do so during an appearance today on the Today show. Osbourne is competing on NBCs The Celebrity Apprentice.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Madonnas gym has no permits
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Madonnas gym has no permits
                                  
	Mexico City, Dec. 1 (AP): Madonna may be touched by bureaucracy the very first time she opens a gym.        
	The club she launched this week in Mexico City is in danger of being shut down because it lacks a security plan and a land use permit, local authorities said today.        
	Officials from the singers Hard Candy Fitness have until Friday to get a land use permit, though they will be allowed to turn in other necessary documents later, said Demetrio Sodi, the chief of the Miguel Hidalgo municipality where the gym is located.        
	If they dont have a land use permit, they will not be able to operate,: Sodi told the Spanish-language station Televisa. Madonna was in Mexico City on Monday night for the ribbon cutting and taught a dance class.

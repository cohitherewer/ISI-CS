	Feb. 11: President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran confronted opponents at home and abroad today on one of the most momentous days of his countrys political calendar.        
	He sent security forces onto the streets to break up Opposition protests and taunted western adversaries by claiming advances in Tehrans nuclear capacity.        
	Speaking on the 31st anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, which toppled Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Ahmadinejad told a huge and closely orchestrated crowd of supporters in Tehrans Azadi Square that Iran was now a nuclear state.        
	When we say we do not manufacture the bomb, we mean it, and we do not believe in manufacturing a bomb, Ahmadinejad told the crowd, according to news reports.        
	But, apparently addressing the US and its allies, he continued: The Iranian nation is brave enough that if one day we wanted to build nuclear bombs we would announce it publicly without being afraid of you.        
	Ahmadinejad brushed aside western calls for more stringent sanctions, declaring that Iranian scientists had, for the first time, processed uranium to a level of 20 per cent enrichment this week. He also claimed that Tehran could now attain much higher levels of enrichment.        
	In Washington, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the US does not believe Iran is capable of enriching uranium to the degree the Islamic Republic claims.        
	Western experts have said that once Iran is able to enrich uranium to 20 per cent it could theoretically move relatively quickly towards the manufacture of weapons-grade fuel, usually reckoned at 90 per cent.         
	As Ahmadinejad spoke, Opposition websites carried reports of a crackdown on anti-government protesters as the anniversary celebrations unfolded, with accounts of gunfire, tear gas and attacks on Opposition leaders. Videos posted online showed protesters calling for the release of political prisoners and carrying green banners  the colour of the Opposition  through the streets.        
	The reports and authenticity of the videos could not be confirmed independently because the Iranian authorities imposed severe restrictions on news coverage after last Junes flawed presidential elections.         
	News reports said pro-government Iranians gathered to hear Ahmadinejad outnumbered his opponents who faced a crackdown by security forces that broke up many attempts to protest.        
	It was unclear whether Ahmadinejads comments represented gamesmanship or a step towards acknowledging suspicions that it is pursuing a weapons programme.         
	The thrust of his remarks reflected the central role played by Irans nuclear programme in domestic politics. The anniversary of the revolution was seen as a test of strength between Ahmadinejad and an Opposition movement that took root after the elections.

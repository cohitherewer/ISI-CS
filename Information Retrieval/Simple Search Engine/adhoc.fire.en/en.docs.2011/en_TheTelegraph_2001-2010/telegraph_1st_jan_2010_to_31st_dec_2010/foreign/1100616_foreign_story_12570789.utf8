The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK sorry for Ireland killings
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      UK sorry for Ireland killings
                              Cameron                            
	London/Londonderry, June 15 (Reuters): Prime Minister David Cameron apologised today for the 1972 killings by British troops of 13 protesters on Northern Irelands Bloody Sunday after a long-awaited report said those shot were unarmed.        
	Quoting from the 5,000-page Saville report as he presented it to parliament, Cameron said the findings unequivocally showed that there was no justification for the shootings of civilians during a civil rights march in the city of Londonderry.        
	What happened should never, ever have happened ... Some members of our armed forces acted wrongly, Cameron said. For that, on behalf of the government, and indeed our country, I am deeply sorry, he said.        
	A huge crowd gathered in Londonderrys Guildhall Square, the intended destination of the 1972 march, to watch Camerons statement on a giant screen. At the point when he made the apology, the crowd cheered.        
	Bloody Sunday changed the course of Northern Irelands Troubles pitting nationalists, mostly Catholics, who wanted to secede and become part of Ireland, against unionists, mostly Protestants, who wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom.        
	On January 30, 1972, British troops opened fire during an unauthorised march in the Bogside, a staunchly nationalist area of Londonderry. They killed 13 people and wounded 14 others, one of whom died later. The victims were all unarmed Catholics.        
	None of the casualties was posing a threat of causing death or serious injury, or indeed was doing anything else that could on any view justify their shooting, the Saville report said. The great lie has been laid bare. The truth has been brought home at last, Mickey McKinney, whose brother Willie was among the dead, said.

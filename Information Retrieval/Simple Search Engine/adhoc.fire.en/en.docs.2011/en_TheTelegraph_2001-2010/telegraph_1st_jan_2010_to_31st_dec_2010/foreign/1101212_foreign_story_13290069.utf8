The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Holbrooke critical after surgery
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Holbrooke critical after surgery
                              Holbrooke: Veteran diplomat                            
	Washington, Dec. 11 (Reuters): Richard Holbrooke, President Barack Obamas special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, was in critical condition today after doctors performed surgery to repair a tear in his aorta, the state department said.        
	The 69-year-old veteran US diplomat, who brokered the 1995 accord that ended the Balkans war, has been a key player in Obamas efforts to turn around the 9-year-old war in Afghanistan.        
	Holbrooke fell ill at the state department yesterday. It issued a statement saying Holbrooke was admitted to nearby George Washington University hospital yesterday.        
	This morning, doctors completed surgery to repair a tear in his aorta, the statement said. He is in critical condition and has been joined by his family.        
	The aorta is the major artery carrying blood out of the heart to other parts of the body. Upon leaving the heart, the aorta moves up through the chest towards the head then bends and moves down through the chest and abdomen.        
	With a meteoric career that included stints in Vietnam as well as serving as the top US diplomat for East Asia, for Europe and at the UN, Holbrookes most notable achievement has been bringing all sides in the Bosnia conflict to the negotiating table at an air base in Dayton, Ohio. The resulting 1995 Dayton accords ended the conflict.        
	Holbrooke, who has worked as an executive in the financial sector when not at the state department, was said to be a candidate for secretary of state before the job went to Hillary Clinton.        
	He travels regularly to Afghanistan and Pakistan in his role as Obamas special envoy, and also has sought to allay concerns in the US Congress over the course of the war.        
	During congressional testimony on July 28, Holbrooke conceded that fighting a resurgent Taliban and helping to rebuild Afghanistan were massive tasks. But he repeatedly defended the Obama administrations strategy.        
	He called the Afghanistan mission the most difficult job Ive had in my career. But, he said: Number one, on a personal note, I wouldnt be in this job if I thought it was impossible to succeed.        
	Were not delusional, Holbrooke added, listing problems in Afghanistan from high illiteracy to trying to help its government be accountable to its own people.         
	A book by journalist Bob Woodward published this year depicted an internal battle over Afghan policy among members of Obamas national security team.        
	The book quoted Holbrooke as saying Obamas approach cant work, while Vice-President Joe Biden called Holbrooke the most egotistical bastard Ive ever met.        
	15 killed in blast        
	Fifteen Afghan civilians died when their vehicle hit a roadside bomb in southern Afghanistan and seven road construction company employees were killed in an airstrike in an eastern province, authorities said today.        
	There was also a suicide bomb attack today in northern Kunduz province, one of several areas that were relatively peaceful for many years but where the insurgency is now spreading fast. It is also used as a springboard to launch other attacks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK visa to attract Indian job creators
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      UK visa to attract Indian job creators
                              DAVID CAMERON                            
	London, Nov. 7 (PTI): Britain will lure entrepreneurs from countries including India with a new category of visa  called the entrepreneur visa  to catalyse its economic recovery, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.         
	Speaking before a gathering of businessmen and entrepreneurs, Cameron said not enough was being done to attract the next generation of wealth creators and job makers to Britain.        
	He said the Tier I (highly skilled) type of visas was a total failure because many foreign professionals, including several from India, who entered Britain under the category were doing unskilled work.        
	Cameron said: I can announce today that we will create a new entrepreneur visa. These entrepreneur visas will mean that if you have a great business idea, and you receive serious investment from a leading investor, you are welcome to set up your business in our country.        
	He added: So, as we act to bring net migration to Britain down to the tens of thousands, I want this message to be heard loud and clear the whole world over: In every classroom or laboratory where a bright idea is born, every bedroom where a business case is put together, if youve got an idea, if you want to create jobs, and if you have the ambition to build a world beating company here in the UK.        
	He continued: We want you; well make it easy for you; well put out the red carpet for you. With our new entrepreneur visa we want the whole world to know that Britain wants to become the home of enterprise and the land of opportunity.        
	Professionals entering Britain under the highly skilled category and ending up doing unskilled work is wrong and its got to change, Cameron said.        
	The ruling Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition introduced the controversial cap of 24,100 on non-EU migrants until April 2011, by when a permanent limit will be imposed.

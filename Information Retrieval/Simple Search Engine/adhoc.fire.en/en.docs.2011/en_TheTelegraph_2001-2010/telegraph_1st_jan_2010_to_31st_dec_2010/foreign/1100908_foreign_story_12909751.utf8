                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jolie meets Pak victims
          
	Jalozai (Pakistan), Sept. 7 (AP): Actress Angelina Jolie met flood victims in northwestern Pakistan today and appealed to the international community to provide aid needed to help the country recover from its worst natural disaster.        
	The flow of aid money has stalled in recent days, and officials expressed hope the two-day visit by Jolie  who is a goodwill ambassador for the UNs refugee agency  will convince foreign countries and individuals to open their wallets.        
	Jolie, 35, said she met many people whose lives had been devastated by the floods, including mothers who lost their children and an elderly Pakistani couple who feared they would never be able to rebuild the home they lost.        
	I am very moved by them and I hope that I am able to, today and tomorrow, be able to do something to help bring attention to the situation for all of the people in need in Pakistan, Jolie told reporters after visiting a refugee camp in the Jalozai area.        
	She toured Jalozai wearing a long black robe and a black headscarf adorned with a thin red stripe  the kind of conservative clothing worn by many women in Pakistan.

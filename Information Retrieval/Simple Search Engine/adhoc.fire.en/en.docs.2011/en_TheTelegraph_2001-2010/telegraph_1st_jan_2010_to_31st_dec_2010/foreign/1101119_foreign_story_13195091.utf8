                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jolie chased out of Bosnia
          JON SWAINE                          Not the truth                                  
	New York, Nov. 18: Angelina Jolie has been chased out of Bosnia after a rumour spread that the film she was making there contained an inter-ethnic rape scene.        
	The Hollywood actress had planned to spend 10 days in the country filming her directorial debut, which is about a Serb man and a Bosnian Muslim woman in love during the 1992-95 war.        
	But she has moved most of the production of the as-yet-untitled picture to Hungary following protests from women who were sexually assaulted during the conflict. Jolie was accused by two victims associations of attempting to falsify the historic truth about the crimes of mass gang rapes of Bosnian women by Serbian forces during the war.        
	She and her producers vehemently denied this and insisted the film featured no depiction of rape. According to their synopsis, it features a young couple who are separated as the war starts and meet again when the woman is held in a detention camp where her former boyfriend now works as a guard.        
	The pressure groups said Jolie was seeking to depict a loving surrender by women to crimes of sexual abuse by Serbs. In an open letter published by local media, the victims associations told her: We can and will do everything in our power to publicly proclaim your movie as compromising the truth.

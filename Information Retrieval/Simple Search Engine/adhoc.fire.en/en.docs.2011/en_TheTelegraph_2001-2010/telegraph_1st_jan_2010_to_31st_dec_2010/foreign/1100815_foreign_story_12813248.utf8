                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama strongly backs NY mosque
                              taking a stand                            
	Washington, Aug. 14 (AP): President Barack Obama, after skirting the controversy for weeks, is weighing in forcefully on the planned mosque near the site of the destroyed World Trade Center, saying a nation built on religious freedom must allow it.        
	As a citizen, and as President, I believe that Muslims have the same right to practice their religion as everyone else in this country, Obama told an intently listening crowd gathered at the White Houselast evening to observe Ramazan.        
	That includes the right to build a place of worship and a community centre on private property in lower Manhattan, in accordance with local laws and ordinances, he said. This is America, and our commitment to religious freedom must be unshakable.        
	The White House had not previously taken a stand on the mosque, which would be part of a $100 million Islamic community centre two blocks from where nearly 3,000 people perished when hijacked jetliners slammed into the twin towers.

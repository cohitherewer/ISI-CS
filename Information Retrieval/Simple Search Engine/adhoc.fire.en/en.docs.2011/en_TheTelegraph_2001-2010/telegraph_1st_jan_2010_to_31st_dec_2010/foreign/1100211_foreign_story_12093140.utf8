	New Tom Mission    
	 Los Angeles, Feb. 10 (Reuters): Paramount Pictures yesterday said Tom Cruise will star in a new Mission: Impossible movie set for release in 2011 and produced by Cruise and J.J. Abrams.      
	Cruise and Abrams last teamed up in 2006 for Mission: Impossible III, with Cruise in the role of super agent Ethan Hunt who battles bad guys and saves the world from evil. The first two Mission: Impossible movies made a combined $1 billion at global box offices.

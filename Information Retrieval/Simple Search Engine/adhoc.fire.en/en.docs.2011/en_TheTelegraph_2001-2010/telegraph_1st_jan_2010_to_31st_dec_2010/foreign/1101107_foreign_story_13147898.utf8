The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Airlines cancel Jakarta flights 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Airlines cancel Jakarta flights

	Mount Merapi (Indonesia), Nov. 6 (AP): International airlines cancelled flights into Indonesias capital today after a volcano hundreds of kilometres to the west unleashed its most powerful eruption in a century, incinerating villagers as they fled a searing gas cloud.        
	President Obama is scheduled to arrive at Jakarta on October 9 after a three-day India visit.        
	The number of people killed by Mount Merapi in the last two weeks climbed to 138, as a tiny hospital at the foot the mountain struggled to cope with survivors, some with burns on up to 95 per cent of their bodies.        
	The only sign of life in one man, whose eyes were milky grey in colour and never blinked, was the shallow rising and falling of his chest. Others, their lungs choked with abrasive volcanic ash, struggled to breathe.        
	Indonesias most volatile mountain unleashed a surge of searing gas, rocks and debris yesterday that raced down its slopes at highway speeds, mowing down the slope-side village of Bronggang and leaving a trail of charred corpses in its path.        
	It continued to rumble and groan today, at times spitting ash up to 8km in the air, dusting windshields, rooftops and leaves on trees hundreds of kilometres to the west.        
	Just days before Obamas visit to Indonesia, international carriers cancelled flights to Jakarta over concerns about the volcano, 450 km away.        
	The volcanic ash presence in the airways surrounding Jakarta could cause severe damage to our aircraft and engines which could impair the safety of our operations including passengers and crew, said Azharuddin Osman, director of operations for Malaysia Airlines.        
	Among the other carriers temporarily suspending flights were Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Lufthansa, Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia.         
	Domestic flights were unaffected.         
	 The eruption of Icelands Eyjafjallajokul volcano in April forced the closure of most European airports for a week and led to the cancellation of over 100,000 flights.        
	The biggest threat is the Code river, which flows into the city of 400,000 from the 3,000-metre mountain and could act as a conduit for deadly volcanic mudflows that form in heavy rains.

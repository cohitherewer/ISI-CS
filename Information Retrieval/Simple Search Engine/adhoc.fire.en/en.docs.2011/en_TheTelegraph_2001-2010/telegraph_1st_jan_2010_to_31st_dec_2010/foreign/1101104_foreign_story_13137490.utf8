          KATE ZERNIKE                                    
	New York, Nov. 3: The energy of the Tea Party, an anti-government, grassroots political movement that began in 2009, has propelled the Republican sweep in the US House of Representatives and captured the mood of a significant chunk of the electorate.        
	But in the Senate, the effect was exactly what establishment Republicans had feared: while Tea Party energy powered some victories, concerns about Tea Party extremism also cost them what could have been easy gains. Even more painful for Republicans was the result in Nevada. In Nevada, Harry Reid, once considered the most vulnerable Democrat, fought off Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favourite.        
	Now, as it tries to make the transition from a protest movement to a power on Capitol Hill, the Tea Party faces the challenge of channelling the energy it brought to the election into a governing agenda when it has no clear mandate, a stated distaste for the inevitable compromises of legislating, and a wary relationship with Republican leaders in Congress.         
	For many voters, the Tea Party has been a blank screen on which they have projected all kinds of hopes and frustrations  not always compatible or realistic.         
	To many in the movement, the singular goal is to stop an expanding government in its tracks, to hold the line at all hazards, as Jennifer Stefano, a Tea Party leader in Pennsylvania, put it.         
	But the movement is also animated by a belief that the entire political system has become disconnected from the practical needs and values of Americans, suggesting that its voting power stemmed as much from a populist sense of outrage in a tough economic moment as it did from ideology.        
	 What many of its adherents want as much as anything is for the two parties to come together to solve problems.        
	The Tea Party movement burst onto the scene in 2009 in protest of the economic stimulus package.         
	Its supporters have vowed to purge the Republican Party of officials they consider not sufficiently conservative and block the Democratic agenda on the economy, the environment and health care.        
	The immediate focus for the movement will be on the big legislative issues facing Congress.         
	But as attention inevitably shifts to 2012, the Tea Party will also have the chance to exert potentially substantial influence on the race for the Republican presidential nomination, with a variety of potential candidates, including Sarah Palin, manoeuvring to lead it into the next elec- tion.         
	But as much as the Tea Party allowed the Republicans to win in enthusiasm, it will still have a relatively small caucus in the House and the Senate. With control of Congress split, Republicans will have to work with Democrats to get things done.         
	Tea Party lawmakers who refuse to go along may find they become irrelevant  certainly not the goal of all the noise and passion of the last two years.

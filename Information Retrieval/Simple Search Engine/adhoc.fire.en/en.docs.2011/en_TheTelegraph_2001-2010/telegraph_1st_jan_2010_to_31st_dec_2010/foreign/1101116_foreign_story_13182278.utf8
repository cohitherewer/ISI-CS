	Shanghai, Nov. 15 (AP): Fire engulfed a high-rise apartment building under renovation in Shanghai today, killing 42 people and sending residents scrambling down scaffolding to escape, city authorities said.        
	The official Xinhua news agency cited a witness saying the blaze started when building materials caught fire. It spread to the scaffolding and then to the 28-storey apartment block itself. The building houses a number of retired teachers, Xinhua said.        
	The government said more than 100 fire trucks were called to battle the blaze, and streams of water could be seen flowing into the building which was shrouded in plumes of thick black smoke. The fire was largely under control about four hours later, the government said. Firefighters could be seen taking bodies from the building.        
	Earlier reports put the toll at eight dead and more than 90 injured. The death toll had risen by tonight to 42, the Shanghai government said in a statement.

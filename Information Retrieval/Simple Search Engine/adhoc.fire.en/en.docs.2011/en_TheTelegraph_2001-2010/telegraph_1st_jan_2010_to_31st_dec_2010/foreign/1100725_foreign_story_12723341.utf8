                              Renn: Digitally reduced                            
	London, July 24 (PTI): Crystal Renn, the worlds most successful plus-sized model has spoken up against airbrushing after she was digitally reduced from a size ten to a size zero for a new ad campaign.        
	The 24-year-old who is a prominent campaigner against the skinny trend in fashion, was stunned when she saw the final results of her shoot for the Fashion for Passion campaign by photographer Nicholas Routzen, reports the Daily Mail.        
	When I saw the pictures I was absolutely shocked. I sat in silence for a good five minutes.         
	It was not an accurate portrayal of my body in any way. Im a size 10 and that was a size zero, said the model.        
	Im known for my body and Im proud of my body. Some people scoff at the name plus size but I think its an amazing thing to be a part of, said Renn.

  - Cameron govt suffers cabinet and House jolts        AMIT ROY                              David Laws (top) and James Lundie				                                       
	London, May 30: David Laws, who yesterday quit Britains new coalition government because he was caught fiddling his expenses, said in his resignation statement that my recent problems were caused by my desire to keep my sexuality secret.        
	Laws, who admitted he had been wrong in claiming 40,000 in expenses that he is now paying back, is having to witness the deepest recesses of his private life turned over by the media.        
	He has been in a homosexual relationship for some years with James Lundie, a young public relations lobbyist. Lundie was once a deputy press secretary to Charles Kennedy, a former leader of the Liberal Democratic party that is in the coalition government now with the Conservatives.        
	While few would say Laws lost his job because he is gay, it is also true that since so many MPs have abused the expenses system, one more would not have shocked the country.         
	Of course, as chief secretary of the treasury  effectively the number two man in the finance ministry after George Osborne, the Tory chancellor of the exchequer  Laws, who is a Liberal Democrat, could not have kept his job.        
	Under parliamentary guidelines introduced in 2006, it is illegal for an MP to pay rent to a partner or relative  and Laws was claiming between 750 and 900 a month for a room rented from Lundie.        
	Some in parliament now say they did suspect Laws was gay for he was invariably seen on his own without a female escort but his sexuality was not a subject for gossip so long as he remained a backbench MP.         
	But when Cameron formed his government, Laws was rewarded with a senior post.        
	I have been thinking carefully about what action I should take in the interests of the government, my constituents and  most important of all  those whom I love, he said in his letter to Cameron.         
	 Finally, and most importantly, he added, I have an overriding responsibility to those I love most, and who I feel I have exposed to scrutiny in this way. I have pursued a political career because of my sense of public duty, but I have too often put this before the interests of those I love most. It is time to redress the balance.        
	 An investment banker and a millionaire who joined the Lib Dems because he wanted to make a difference to society, Laws had a brilliant academic career at Cambridge where he graduated with a double first in economics.

	Los Angeles, March 6 (PTI): Sarah Palin may not have been nominated for an Academy Award, but that did not stop the politician-turned-author from invading the Oscars gifting suite and walking away with a ton of free goodies.        
	The nominated artistes are given away designer goodies worth millions of dollars every year at gifting suites where they can take their pick from a variety of products.        
	Palin showed up at the Silver Spoons Oscar Suite in West Hollywood with daughter Willow and grandson Tripp, reports E! Online. They were like locusts. She showed up with like 20 people, and they immediately swarmed the place taking everything! a hostess said.

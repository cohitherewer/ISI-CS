	Fox diet drama    
	 New York, Jan. 7 (PTI): Megan Fox may be one of the sexiest stars in Hollywood but she is definitely not an authority when it comes to diets.      
	Health experts have warned dieters against taking advice from the Transformers star who has been blasted for hailing the benefits of drinking vinegar, reports the New York Post.      
	It (vinegar) just cleanses out your system entirely. For women who retain water weight from your menstrual cycle, it gets rid of it really fast, the 23-year-old actress said when asked about her fitness routine.       
	Im not one for dieting or exercising, because Im lazy and I have a really big sweet tooth, so I drink vinegar to clean every once in a while, Fox had said.      
	However, experts have dismissed the actresss claims.       
	Dietician Lucy Jones said: As attractive as it sounds, there is no magic pill, lotion or potion for a quick fix to weight loss. The body will not be improved by vinegar, whether it be organic, apple cider, unfiltered, or your bog-standard malt vinegar.

	Jolies tattoos    
	London, Sept. 14 (PTI): She is a dedicated mother now but actress Angelina Jolie had a crazy past and says that her tattoos are reminders of her hell-raising days.       
	Jolie said she did not plan most of her tattoos, reports The Sun.      
	I was in Amsterdam and got a little crazy, dropping my pants at a tattoo parlour and woke up the next morning and saw this really funny dragon. Ive always wanted a dragon but this one had a funny blue tongue. To me a dragon is very much a woman, strong and elegant, said Jolie.

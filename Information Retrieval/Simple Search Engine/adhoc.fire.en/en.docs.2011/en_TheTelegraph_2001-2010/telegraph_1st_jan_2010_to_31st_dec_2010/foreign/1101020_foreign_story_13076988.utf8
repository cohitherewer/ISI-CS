The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | DNA mist to keep crooks away
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      DNA mist to keep crooks away

	Rotterdam, Oct. 19: When the McDonalds down from City Hall here was burglarised a few years ago, its managers decided they needed a new security system.        
	It was just about that time that local police officers were offering something totally different that they hoped would stem a rising tide of robberies that occur mainly in the immigrant neighbourhoods of this rough-and-tumble port city. The new system involved an employee-activated device that sprays a fine, barely visible mist laced with synthetic DNA to cover anyone in its path, including criminals, and simultaneously alerts the police to a crime in progress.        
	The mist  visible only under ultraviolet light  carries DNA markers particular to the location, enabling the police to match the burglar with the place burgled. Now, a sign on the front door of the McDonalds prominently warns potential thieves of the sprays presence: You Steal, Youre Marked.        
	The police acknowledge that they have yet to make an arrest based on the DNA mist, which was developed in Britain by two brothers, one a policeman and the other a chemist. But they credit its presence  and signs posted prominently warning of its use  for what they call a precipitous decline in crime rates (though they could not provide actual figures to back that up).        
	But the goal is not so much capturing crooks as scaring them away. The whole thing is prevention, not about recovering stolen goods or capturing criminals, said Donald van der Laan, whose company, the Rhine Group, distributes the spray. As far as the DNA is concerned, the material is identical to human DNA, he said, though there is a different sequence of components. Much of the sprays effectiveness, he said, comes from the mystique surrounding DNA.        
	No one really knows what it is, he said. No one really knows how it works.        
	At this McDonalds the DNA liquid is contained in an orange box the size of a large paperback book, mounted over an entrance door. You dont smell it; you dont see it; nobody knows its there, said Jean-Paul Fafie, who has managed the McDonalds for the last 12 years.        
	The system and the all-important warning sign seem to have successfully warded off any potential robbers. But there were kinks to be worked out.

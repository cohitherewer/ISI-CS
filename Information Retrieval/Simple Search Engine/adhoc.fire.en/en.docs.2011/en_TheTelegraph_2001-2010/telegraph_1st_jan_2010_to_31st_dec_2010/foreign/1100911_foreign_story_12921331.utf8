	London, Sept. 10: A new picture autobiography by former Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page is to go on sale for 445  to the anger of some of his fans.        
	 The 512 page visual documentary contains more than 700 photographs and is printed on fine art paper. The tome is also bound with leather and silk-wrapped. Copies of the limited edition book, titled Jimmy Page by Jimmy Page, are personally signed by the rock legend.         
	 Instead of a written autobiography, the memoir is only made up of mostly unseen and personal photographs, which took Page, 66, a year to select.        
	This price is beyond the price that we mere mortals, who helped make him and supported him when he was less well off, can possibly pay for, one fan wrote online.

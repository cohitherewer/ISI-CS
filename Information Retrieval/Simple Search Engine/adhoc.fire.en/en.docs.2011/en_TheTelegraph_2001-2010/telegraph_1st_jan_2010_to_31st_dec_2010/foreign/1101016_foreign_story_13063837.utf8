	Copiapo, Chile, Oct. 15 (AP): The first three rescued Chilean miners out of the hospital celebrated their new lives as national heroes today, as word emerged that the 33 want to closely guard their story so they can fairly divide the spoils of their overnight media stardom.        
	That could explain why none of them have spoken publicly at any length or provided any dramatic details of their 69 days trapped 1km beneath the Atacama desert.        
	A daughter of Omar Reygadas, a 56-year-old electrician, said in an interview early today that he told her just hours earlier that the miners have agreed to divide all their earnings from interviews, media appearances, movies or books.        
	He also said we cant say things to the media without their permission, said Ximena Alejandra Reygadas, 37. He said they need to decide what we can tell the media.        
	Hundreds of reporters abandoned the mine and descended on this gritty provincial capital yesterday after the world watched in awe the mens nearly flawless rescue through a narrow hole it took a month to drill.        
	A shift foreman at the San Jose mine who is close to many of the men said they have hired an accountant to track their income from public appearances and equitably distribute it.        
	More than anything, I think the idea is to charge for the rights to everything thats been shown about their personal life, of their odyssey. That way, theyre safe, said Pablo Ramirez.        
	Ramirez, 29, had lowered himself deep into the mines bowels right after its August 5 collapse in a vain attempt to reach his comrades.        
	He is out of a job with the roughly 360 other San Jose miners now that the government has decided to close it as unsafe.        
	And while he said hes got good job prospects as an experienced miner, his buddies were probably the most in-demand people on the planet.        
	A Greek mining company wants to bring them to the sunny Aegean islands. Soccer teams in Madrid, Manchester and Buenos Aires want them in their stadiums.        
	The cause of the collapse remains under formal investigation, although one senior Codelco official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the mines owners had cut corners for years. It lacked even a minimal amount of support beams.

	Villain Weisz    
	 Los Angeles, March 30 (PTI): Actor Daniel Craig has some tough times ahead with Hollywood actress Rachel Weisz reportedly being tipped to play a villain in the next 007 movie.      
	The super spy has to deal with the femme fatale in Bond 23 as Weisz is in line to play the chief of Quantum in the film. Quantum also figured in the plots of Casino Royale and Quantum Of Solace.      
	If Weisz does play its chief, then she could be the first woman to play the main villain in a Bond film.

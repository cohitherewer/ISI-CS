	Sydney, April 28: Internet search giant Google has threatened an Australian businessman with legal action if he tries to register his company Groggle as a trademark.        
	Cameron Collie has spent two years setting up the alcohol price comparison website, and was in the process of getting the name Groggle trademarked when he received a letter from Google claiming the name was substantially identical with and deceptively similar to its own trademarks.        
	The letter came after Collie, 36, had spent thousands of dollars setting up the company and buying the relevant domain names on the Internet.        
	 The site, which allows consumers to search for the cheapest price alcohol  or grog  in their area, was in the beta test phase and Collie was planning a formal launch within weeks, as well as an accompanying iPhone app.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

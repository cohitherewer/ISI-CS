The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kafkas lost manuscripts in centre of Swiss row
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Kafkas lost manuscripts in centre of Swiss row
                              Kafka: Burning issue                            
	July 19: Manuscripts and drawings by Franz Kafka that have been hidden in the vaults of Swiss bank UBS for more than 50 years are to be extracted amid a lawsuit over ownership rights of the estate.        
	Four safes holding manuscripts and drawings by the author are to be opened, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung. UBS declined comment when contacted by AFP.        
	The move in Zurich follows similar action at two Tel Aviv banks last week, after they were ordered by an Israeli tribunal to extract Kafkas works from their vaults.         
	The documents are at the heart of a legal fight over ownership between the Israeli authorities and the Hoffe sisters  who say they had inherited the estate from their mother, Esther Hoffe. Hoffe was the secretary of Max Brod, a close friend whom the author had entrusted with burning all manuscripts and works after his death.        
	However, Brod had ignored The Metamorphosis writers wishes and instead published the works. He also bequeathed the originals to Esther Hoffe.        
	As Brod had migrated to Israel in 1939 when fleeing the Nazis, the state of Israel now claims that Kafkas documents are property of the state. A trial is, therefore, ongoing in Israel to determine if the Hoffe sisters are the rightful heirs of the estate.

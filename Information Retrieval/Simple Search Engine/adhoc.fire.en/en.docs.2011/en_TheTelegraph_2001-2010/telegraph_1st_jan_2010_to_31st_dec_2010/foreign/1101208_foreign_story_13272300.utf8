	Dec. 7: Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, has denied that he set up the company in order to get girls.        
	The worlds youngest billionaire was giving his verdict on The Social Network, the Hollywood movie which portrayed him in an unflattering light and suggested he was motivated by having been dumped by a girlfriend.        
	Zuckerberg, 26, who refused to collaborate on the film project, disclosed that he had taken his entire staff to see it and thought it was pretty fun. He told the CBS show 60 Minutes: Its pretty interesting to see what parts they got right and what parts they got wrong. I think that they got every single T-shirt that they had the Mark Zuckerberg character wearing right. I think I actually own those T-shirts. And they got the sandals right.        
	But I mean, there are hugely basic things that they got wrong, too. They made it seem like my whole motivation for building Facebook was so I could get girls, right?        
	And they completely left out the fact that my girlfriend, Ive been dating since before I started Facebook. The film also focused heavily on a dispute between Zuckerberg and twin brothers Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss over the genesis of Facebook.        
	The twins, who attended Harvard with Zuckerberg, reportedly received a $65 million settlement after claiming that he used their idea for a social networking website.

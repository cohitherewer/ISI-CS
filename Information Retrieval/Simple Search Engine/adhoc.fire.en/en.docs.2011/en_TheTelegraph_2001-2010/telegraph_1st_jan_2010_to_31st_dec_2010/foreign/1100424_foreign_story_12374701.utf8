The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US priest abuse victim sues Pope
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US priest abuse victim sues Pope
                            
	London, April 23: The alleged victim of a US priest accused of being a serial paedophile is suing the Pope and the Vatican in an attempt to gain access to secret files containing internal investigations into sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church.         
	There is a painful and long history of the Vatican and the top officials... muffling and suppressing the truth and protecting themselves and their own reputation instead of protecting the children, lawyer Jeff Anderson said at a news conference.         
	This suit demands further action by the Vatican and the removal of every single priest that has offended a single child and every single bishop and cardinal that has been complicit in those crimes.         
	Anderson, who has spent decades pursuing justice for victims of child sex abuse, said the case was unprecedented in its scope and demands.         
	That case is currently before the Supreme Court to determine whether the Vatican, which claims sovereign immunity, can be sued in a US court.         
	The lawsuit was filed on behalf of an unnamed alleged victim of a serial paedophile priest called Father Lawrence Murphy, who is accused of molesting up to 200 boys at a school for the deaf in Wisconsin.         
	It is the fifth case Anderson has brought forward on behalf of Murphys victims.         
	He released documents in March showing that Pope Benedict XVI, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was made aware of the allegations against Murphy in 1996 but took no action.

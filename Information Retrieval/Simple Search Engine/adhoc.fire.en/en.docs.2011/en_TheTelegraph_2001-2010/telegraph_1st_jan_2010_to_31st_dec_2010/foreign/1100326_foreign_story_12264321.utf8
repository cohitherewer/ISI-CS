The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bruni not keen on Sarkozy second term

	Paris, March 25 (Reuters): French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy is not keen to see her husband President Nicolas Sarkozy run for a second term in office, worried that the job might damage his health, she told Figaro magazine.        
	As a spouse, I do not wish for it. Maybe I am afraid that his health will be affected. Maybe I want to live what time we have left together in a certain peace, she said.         
	But whatever the situation and whatever my husband decides, I will quietly accept it, she added, according to an advance copy of the interview released ahead of Saturdays publication.        
	Sarkozy came to power in 2007 and is expected to run for a second term in 2012, although he has yet to confirm this. Bruni and Sarkozy married in 2008 after a whirlwind romance, but there was wild media speculation earlier this month that their marriage was in difficulty after a French blog reported rumours that both Bruni and her husband were having affairs.        
	I despise so-called journalists who use blogs as if they were a credible source, Bruni told the magazine.        
	She once described herself as a man tamer and has had a number of affairs with intellectuals and rock stars. She has often been quoted as saying, in a 2007 interview, that she was crazily bored by monogamy, but Bruni said she treasured her marriage to Sarkozy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Turkey blast in tourist spot
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Turkey blast in tourist spot
                            
	Istanbul, Oct. 31(AP): A suicide bomber blew himself up today beside a police vehicle in a major Istanbul square near tourist hotels and a bus terminal, wounding 32 people, including 15 policemen.        
	The attack in Taksim Square, which was followed by police gunfire and sent hundreds of panicked people racing for cover, coincided with the possible end of a unilateral cease-fire by Kurdish rebels, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility. Turkey, a Nato ally that has deployed troops in a non-combat role in Afghanistan, is also home to cells of radical Leftists and Islamic militants.        
	Istanbul police chief Huseyin Capkin said the bomber tried but failed to get into a parked police van and detonated the bomb just outside the vehicle, blowing himself to pieces. Riot police are routinely stationed at Taksim, a popular spot for street demonstrations that abuts a major pedestrian walkway whose shops and restaurants are usually packed.        
	At least 32 people, including 15 police officers, were injured, at least two of them seriously, Istanbul governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu said.        
	After the blast, he said, investigators at the scene found and defused a package of plastic explosives that could have been detonated with the push of a button.        
	It was a terrifying, very loud explosion, said Mehmet Toz, a coffee stall owner who was in the square at the time of the blast.        
	Everyone started to run around, people fell on the ground. There was panic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Austerity is 2010s word of the year
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Austerity is 2010s word of the year
                            
	Boston, Dec. 20 (Reuters): It provoked protests in European capitals from Athens to Brussels, hurt sales of Heineken beer and stole the spotlight at a June G20 summit in Canada. Austerity is now Merriam-Websters top word of 2010.        
	Austerity, which the Springfield, Massachusetts-based publisher defines as enforced or extreme economy, spiked to the top of the companys top ten list based on the number of searches at its website, www.merriam-webster.com.        
	Coupled with No. 2 pragmatic, the list reflects a year when searchers were still worried about a rocky world economy, said Peter Sokolowski, the dictionarys editor-at- large. Its a serious list for a serious year, Sokolowski said in a phone interview today.        
	Austerity cropped up most in connection with European governments efforts to chop spending. Merriam-Webster did not disclose numbers on individual searches.        
	Because it has such a clear implication for personal finance, it is easy to apply this to yourself, Sokolowski said. That makes it a word that people look up.

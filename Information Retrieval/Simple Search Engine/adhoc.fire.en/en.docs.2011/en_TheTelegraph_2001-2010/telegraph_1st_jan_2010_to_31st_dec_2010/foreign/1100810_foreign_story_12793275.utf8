The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Woman hurt by HP bosss loss
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Woman hurt by HP bosss loss
                              Mark Hurd                            
	San Francisco, Aug. 9 (Reuters): The woman whose sexual harassment accusation against Mark Hurd led to his ouster as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard came forward yesterday, saying she never intended Hurd to lose his job.        
	Jodie Fisher, a former actress who appeared on an NBC reality TV show in 2007, revealed her identity for the first time through a statement released by her attorney, Gloria Allred. I was surprised and saddened that Mark Hurd lost his job over this, said Fisher, 50. That was never my intention.        
	Hurds resignation, announced on Friday, stunned the business world. HP accused him of falsifying expense reports to conceal a close personal relationship with Fisher.        
	In the companys first public comments in two days, HP said yesterday it has received an extremely supportive response from investors following the ouster of Hurd, one of the most widely admired CEOs in the world.        
	The saga began in late June when Fisher levelled a sexual harassment charge against Hurd. She worked as a contractor for HP from late 2007 to 2009.        
	An HP investigation found no violation of the companys sexual harassment policy, but turned up inaccurate expense reports filed by Hurd or on his behalf, and instances where Fisher received compensation for no legitimate business purpose, HP said.        
	Fisher, who is not married and has a son, said yesterday she has resolved her claim against Hurd privately, but did not provide any further details. She said she did not have an affair with Hurd.        
	Fisher has worked in commercial real estate, as a saleswoman, and appeared in movies such as Blood Dolls and Sheer Passion in the 1990s, according to the website imdb.com. Most recently, Fisher appeared on the NBC reality show Age of Love, which aired in 2007.        
	She has also worked on the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, according to Allred.        
	At HP, I was under contract to work at high-level customer and executive summit events held around the country and abroad, Fisher said. I prepared for those events, worked very hard and enjoyed working for HP.

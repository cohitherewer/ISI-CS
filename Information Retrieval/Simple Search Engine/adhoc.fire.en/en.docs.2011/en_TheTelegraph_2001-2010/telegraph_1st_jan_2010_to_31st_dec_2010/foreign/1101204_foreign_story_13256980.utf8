	Kate 007 move    
	 London, Dec. 3 (PTI): Actress Kate Winslet is moving back to London with her two children, so that they can be close to her estranged husband Sam Mendes.      
	The Oscar-winning director is expected to direct Daniel Craig in the latest 007 adventure towards the end of next year, with the production based at Pinewood film studios.       
	Winslet and their son Joe, 7, and her daughter Mia, 10, will move to London for the period of shooting, reports the Daily Mail.      
	Sam is doing the next Bond film, all being well, and well all be in England if that happens. Its such a massive commitment for him and its not fair for him to commute backwards and forwards between New York and London. It would be impossible. The children will be there with me, said Winslet.       
	The couple separated last year after seven years of marriage, but have remained on as friendly terms as possible, primarily because of the children.

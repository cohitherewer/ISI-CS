The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Woman executed in Virginia
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Woman executed in Virginia
                              Teresa Lewis                            
	Jarratt (Virginia), Sept. 24 (AP): The state of Virginia carried out a rare execution of a woman, despite international criticism and claims by her attorneys that she was borderline retarded.        
	Teresa Lewis, 41, died by injection last night, authorities said.        
	The Lewis execution stirred an unusual amount of attention because of her gender, claims she lacked the intelligence to mastermind the killings of which she was convicted and the post-conviction emergence of defence evidence that one of the triggermen manipulated her.        
	Lewis enticed two men through sex, cash and a promised cut in an insurance policy to shoot her husband, Julian Clifton Lewis Jr, and his son, Charles, as they slept in October 2002. Both triggermen were sentenced to life in prison and one committed suicide in 2006. Lewis became the first woman executed in Virginia in nearly a century.

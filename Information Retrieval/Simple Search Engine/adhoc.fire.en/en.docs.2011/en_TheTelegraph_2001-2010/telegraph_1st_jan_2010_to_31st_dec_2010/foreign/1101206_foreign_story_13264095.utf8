The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Grassland fire kills 22 in Tibet
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Grassland fire kills 22 in Tibet
                            
	Beijing, Dec. 5 (PTI): A wildfire in Tibets mountainous Sichuan province today killed at least 22 people, including 15 Chinese soldiers, during rescue operations, officials said.         
	Of the 22 killed, 15 were soldiers, two workers with the grassland administration while five others were residents, officials said.         
	Three others who suffered severe burn injuries were rushed to hospital, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.         
	The grassland fire, which spread fast, proved deadly when it trapped soldiers and residents trying to put it out. This is one of the highest casualties the Peoples Liberation Army suffered in recent years.         
	The wild fire was raging through a grassland atop a plateau in Daofu county, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Garze, Sichuan province. Daofu sits in a forest-covered area at the eastern edge of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It has a population of 45,000, about 89 per cent of whom are ethnic Tibetans.         
	Around 33.3 hectares of the grassland had caught fire, while 13 hectares are still ablaze, officials said. The fire broke out at noon and was brought under control around 3pm.        
	However, gusting winds re-ignited the flames and trapped those fighting the fire.        
	Last month, 58 people were killed in a Shanghai high-rise fire.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Enduring symbol of Stalins Great Terror 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Enduring symbol of Stalins Great Terror 
                                              
	April 10: Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader and former President, who presided over Polands transition from communism, summed up what todays plane crash meant for his people: This is the second disaster after Katyn.        
	They wanted to cut off our head there, and here the flower of our nation has also perished. Regardless of the differences, the intellectual class of those on the plane was truly great, Walesa said soon after the air tragedy wiped out a part of the Polish leadership.        
	Katyn is a place and event that no Pole can ever forget.         
	The mass murder of thousands of Polish prisoners of war and intellectuals at Katyn in spring 1940  just months after Nazi Germany and Josef Stalin carved up Poland  is an enduring symbol for Poles of their suffering under totalitarian Soviet rule.        
	For many decades, Moscow blamed the Nazis for the deaths and only acknowledged its responsibility in 1990, a year after the fall of communism in Poland.         
	The Kremlin has resisted Polish calls to brand the Katyn massacre a genocide.        
	The tranquil site, set among pine and birch trees in western Russia, also contains the graves of many Russians executed on Stalins orders, including during the Great Terror of the 1930s.        
	Some of the people on board the plane that crashed today were relatives of those slain in the Katyn massacre. The uncle of Maria Kaczynska, Polands First Lady who died in the crash, was killed at Katyn.        
	Also among the plane accident victims was Anna Walentynowicz, whose dismissal in August 1980 from the Lenin Shipyards in Gdansk sparked a workers strike that spurred the eventual creation of the Solidarity freedom movement.        
	Last Wednesday, the leaders of Russia and Poland paid tribute to the victims of Stalins orders and vowed to overcome painful historic memories that still hamper their bilateral relations.        
	At a sombre ceremony in the Katyn forest, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin urged Poles not to blame the Russian people for the murder of 22,000 Polish officers by Stalins NKVD secret police in 1940 and to look to the future, not just the past.        
	We cannot change the past but we can establish and preserve the truth and that means historical justice. Polish and Russian historians are now working to uncover this truth and to allow an opening between our countries, said Putin.        
	As expected, Putin, a former agent in the KGB, a successor organisation to NKVD, did not apologise for the Katyn murders, and he stressed the common suffering of Russians, Poles and other ethnic groups under Stalins rule.        
	With decades of cynical lies, they tried to blot out the truth about the Katyn shootings. It would be a similar kind of falsehood to... place the blame for these crimes on the Russian people, Putin said. However hard it may be, we must try to... come to terms with a common historical truth and realise that we cannot go on living in the past alone.        
	Wednesdays commemoration crowned a steady improvement in relations between Russia and Poland, though differences remain over energy security, missile defence and Nato enlargement.  
	A Russian lie            
	Germany had invaded Poland from the west in 1939, and Soviet forces occupied the eastern half of Poland. As a consequence of this occupation, tens of thousands of Polish military personnel fell into Soviet hands and were interned in prison camps inside the Soviet Union.   
	 However, after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Polish government-in-exile (located in London) and the Soviet government agreed to co-operate against Germany, and a Polish army on Soviet territory was to be formed.
    
	When Poland requested the return of 15,000 prisoners of war from the Soviets, the Soviet government informed Poland in December 1941 that most of those prisoners had escaped to Manchuria and could not be located.
    
	On April 13, 1943, the Germans announced they discovered the mass graves of Polish officers in the Katyn forest near Smolensk.   
	A total of 4,443 corpses were recovered. The fate of the remainder is still unknown. They had apparently been shot from behind and piled in stacks and buried.
  Investigators identified the corpses as the Polish officers who had been interned at the Soviet camp near Smolensk and accused the Soviet authorities of having executed the prisoners in May 1940.
    
	The Soviet government then claimed that the Poles had been engaged in
  construction work west of Smolensk in 1941 and the invading German army had killed them after overrunning that area in August 1941.
    
	However, both German and Red Cross investigations of the Katyn corpses produced firm physical evidence that the massacre took place in early 1940, at a time when the area was still under Soviet control.
    
	The Soviet government refused demands by the Red Cross to investigate, and in April 1943, the Soviets broke diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile in London. The Soviet Union then set about establishing a Polish government-in-exile composed of Polish communists.
    
	After blaming Nazi Germany for the Katyn massacre for decades, the Soviet Union admitted in April 1990 that its forces were responsible but none of the culprits has ever been identified and investigations have been shelved.

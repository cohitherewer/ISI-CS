The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US seeks balance in airport checks
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US seeks balance in airport checks

	Nov. 22: Caught between complaints that airport screening has become too intrusive and threats of new terror attacks on aviation, Obama administration officials say they are sensitive to criticisms that security measures go too far, but they are insisting that the measures now in place are justified by the risks.        
	With the Thanksgiving travel crush imminent, the chief of the Transportation Security Administration, John S. Pistole, said his agency would try to make screening methods as minimally invasive as possible. But he gave no indication that the agency would reverse its move to full-body scanners, now deployed in 70 of 450 airports in the US, and physical pat-downs for passengers who object to the scans.        
	This has always been viewed as an evolving programme that will be adapted as conditions warrant, and we greatly appreciate the cooperation and understanding of the American people, Pistole said.        
	Security officials said the new procedures were the only way to detect explosives hidden under clothing. We cannot forget that less than one year ago a suicide bomber with explosives in his underwear tried to bring down a plane over Detroit, Pistole said.        
	The debate over the proper balance of security and privacy was unfolding as al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group responsible for the Detroit airliner bomb last Christmas and for placing explosive devices aboard cargo planes last month, threatened similar plots to sow fear, disrupt travel and transport, and impose huge costs on the US.        
	This strategy of attacking the enemy with smaller but more frequent operations is what some may refer to as the strategy of a thousand cuts, the Yemen-based group said in a new issue of its English-language magazine, Inspire, which resembles a glossy publication but is available for download on militant websites. The aim is to bleed the enemy to death.        
	The TSA, which screens about two million air passengers a day, began testing the full-body scanners in 2007, installed them more widely starting last year and accelerated their use after the failed plot last Christmas. If a screener spots something suspicious on a scan, which shows an outline of the unclothed body, or if a passenger prefers to skip the scan, the passenger must undergo a physical search that many passengers have found intrusive.        
	The furore began after November 1, when the agency introduced the more aggressive pat-down procedure.         
	Despite the storm of criticism from passengers, pilots and members of Congress, agency officials point to opinion polls showing that about 80 per cent of the public supports the use of body scanners. About 1 per cent of passengers have opted out of the scanner and undergone pat-downs so far this month, officials said.        
	Congressional leaders have promised to hold hearings on the issue.        
	Still, the administration has appeared to be caught off guard by the outrage of some passengers.         
	Pistole agreed on Saturday to demands from pilots that they be exempted from the searches, after critics noted that a pilot who wants to destroy a plane hardly needs explosives to do so.        
	On Saturday in Lisbon, President Obama acknowledged public complaints but said he had been told by TSA and counterterrorism advisers that at this point the measures are the only ones right now that they consider to be effective against the kind of threat that we saw in the Christmas Day bom- bing.

	Vatican City, June 11: Addressing the sex abuse crisis for the first time from the seat of the Catholic Church, Pope Benedict XVI begged forgiveness today, saying the church would do everything possible to prevent priests from abusing children.        
	We, too, insistently beg forgiveness from God and from the persons involved, while promising to do everything possible to ensure that such abuse will never occur again, Benedict told thousands of priests and faithful gathered in Saint Peters Square for celebrations marking the end of the Vaticans Year of the Priest. The popes remarks did not substantively go beyond what he had already said in a letter to Irish Catholics in March and in a private meeting with victims of sex abuse on Malta in April.        
	However, it was the first time Benedict had mentioned the crisis from Saint Peters Basilica, the heart of the church itself, and on an occasion focused on priests.        
	In this very year of joy for the sacrament of the priesthood, the sins of priests came to light  particularly the abuse of the little ones, the pope said.        
	He added that the church, in admitting men to priestly ministry and in their formation we will do everything we can to weigh the authenticity of their vocation and make every effort to accompany priests along their journey, so that the Lord will protect them and watch over them in troubled situations and amid lifes dangers.        
	 The pope did not mention any specific actions the church was planning to take to combat abuse, as some had hoped, and victims groups said Benedicts remarks did not go far enough.        
	The root cause of this horrific and on-going clergy sex abuse and cover up crisis remains the nearly limitless power of bishops, said Barbara Blaine, the president of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, in a statement.        
	Yet the popes remarks today seemed to signal a growing awareness of the extent of the crisis. They came weeks after the pope had said in Portugal that the greatest threat to the church came from the sin inside the church rather than outside         
	Earlier this spring, the Vatican newspaper, LOsservatore Romano, dismissed media reports questioning the popes role handling abuse as archbishop of Munich in 1980 and as prefect for the Vaticans doctrinal office as a calumnious attack. On Thursday, it said in a front-page editorial that, the infidelity, even profound, of some priests in some parts of the world has in fact cast a shadow over the credibility of the church in the eyes of many people.

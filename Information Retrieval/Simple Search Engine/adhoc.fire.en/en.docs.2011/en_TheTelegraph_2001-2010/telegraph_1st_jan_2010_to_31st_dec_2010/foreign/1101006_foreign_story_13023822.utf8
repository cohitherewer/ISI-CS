The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | AQ Khan was characterless: Pervez
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      AQ Khan was characterless: Pervez
                              Musharraf during a TV show in Birmingham. (Reuters)                            
	Washington, Oct. 5 (PTI): Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has called disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan as characterless and rejected his claims that the Pakistani army had monitored and organised clandestine atomic deals with Iran and North Korea.        
	Mr (A.Q.) Khan is a characterless man, Musharraf told German magazine Der Spiegel when asked about the scientist who was put on house arrest on charges of proliferation of nuclear technologies to rogue countries.        
	On Khans claims that the army monitored and organised such nuclear deals, he said that is wrong, absolutely wrong.        
	I would be a traitor if I had ever given our nuclear weapons to the United States. This capability is our pride and it will never be compromised, he said.        
	Khan, considered a pioneer of the Pakistani nuclear programme, had also claimed that he was forced to confess his role in nuclear proliferation by the then military regime.        
	Musharraf, who is living in London on self-imposed exile, said the days of the army rule in Pakistan are over.        
	Whenever the country is in turmoil, everybody looks to the army. But I would suggest that the times of military coups in Pakistan are over. The latest political developments have shown that the Supreme Court has set a bar on itself not to validate a military takeover, he said.        
	We poisoned Pakistani civil society for 10 years when we fought the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s. It was jihad and we brought in militants from all over the world, with the West and Pakistan together in the lead role. After the withdrawal of the Soviet troops, the West left Pakistan with 25,000 mujahideen and al Qaida fighters, without any plan for rehabilitation or resettlement, he said.        
	Blaming the West for the present fundamentalism in the country, he argued: Now you expect Pakistan to pull out a magic wand and make all of this suddenly disappear? That is not doable  this will take time.               
	Musharraf said the West has made three blunders so far. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, they abandoned the region in 1989, he said.        
	Then, after 9/11, they fought the Taliban instead of strengthening the Pashtuns who could have taken on the radical Taliban. Now you try to negotiate with so-called moderate Taliban but there is no such thing as a moderate Taliban. There are Taliban and Pashtuns.        
	But as I have always said: All Taliban are Pashtun, but not all Pashtun people are Taliban. Again, you should reinforce the ancient Pashtun clans who are not ideologically aligned with the Taliban to govern Afghanistan and to fight the Taliban. Thats my strong advice, he said.        
	The fourth and worst blunder would be to quit without winning, Musharraf said. Then militancy will prevail not only in Pakistan, India and Kashmir, but perhaps also in Europe, the United Kingdom and in the United States. Thats my belief, he said.         
	Foreigners killed        
	A suspected US drone strike killed eight militants of German nationality in northwest Pakistan yesterday, Pakistani intelligence officials said.        
	They died when two missiles from a suspected CIA pilotless aircraft struck a mosque in Mirali in North Waziristan. The attack came a day after the US warned of an increased risk of terrorist attacks in Europe.

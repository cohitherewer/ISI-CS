	On the very exclusive guest list was Winfrey, joined by Gayle King, her good friend and editor-at-large at magazine. Also attending were Obamas senior White House adviser, Valerie Jarrett, and close friends Eric Whitaker and Marty Nesbitt. A crowd of bystanders waited for hours outside the restaurant for a glimpse of the President until he left with a smile before heading back to his house in the Kenwood-Hyde Park area.        
	Even as Winfrey was celebrating with this President, she was on Chicago television in a pre-taped show interviewing Laura Bush, wife of the last President.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      3 million iPads sold in three months
                              Less geeky                            
	June 23: How many iPads can Apple sell in three months?        
	Three million, to be exact.        
	Apple Inc. announced it had reached the 3-million mark on Monday, just 80 days after its launch in the US. The touch-screen tablet computer, that boasts more than 200,000 apps, blew past analysts expectations even in its first month when it sold 1 million, and the 3-million mark seems to suggest there is no slowing it down.        
	People are loving iPad as it becomes a part of their daily lives, said Steve Jobs, Apples chief executive, in a statement. Were working hard to get this magical product into the hands of even more people around the world, including those in nine more countries next month.        
	The news came as iPad competitors Amazons Kindle and Nook slashed its e-reader prices on Monday by 25 per cent, both dropping to just under $200. The iPad starts at $499.        
	But it seems price is not an issue when it comes to some of the hottest, and coolest, pieces of technology on the market, said Richard Doherty, analyst at Envisioneering Group. Its fashionable and its in and its less geeky than a keyboard, he said.

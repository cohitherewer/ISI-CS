The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Stalemate fear in UK polls
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Stalemate fear in UK polls
                            
	London, April 24 (Reuters): Britains Conservatives today warned that a stalemate in the upcoming election would threaten the countrys economy as polls showed the tightest election race in nearly 20 years was likely to produce no outright winner.        
	A surge in support for the Liberal Democrats has increased the prospect of a hung Parliament, with no single party in control, for the first time since the days of the global oil crisis in 1974.        
	The opposition Conservatives once commanding lead in the polls has withered in recent weeks and they now lack the support needed to guarantee a return to power in the May 6 vote.        
	The latest surveys today gave the Conservatives a five-point lead over their rivals. The Liberal Democrats and Prime Minister Gordon Browns Labour Party were neck and neck on 29 per cent in one, while the other showed Labour trailing in third.         
	The election race has been thrown wide open by a rise in support for the Liberal Democrats, following the strong performances of the partys leader Nick Clegg in Britains first US-style live televised debates.        
	Conservative leader David Cameron focused a campaign speech today almost totally on the risk he said a hung Parliament would pose, particularly to the economy as Britain slowly emerges from the worst recession since World War II.        
	Polls say the economy is far and away the voters biggest concern and the issue has dominated the campaign.        
	A hung Parliament isnt a change for the better, it would be a change for the worse, Cameron said.

	June 26: Pornographic websites will now have a special suffix after Internet regulators gave the .xxx domain the go-ahead        
	ICANN, the Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, which is responsible for overseeing the creation and distribution of Web addresses, finally gave the go-ahead for the special .xxx domain name at a meeting in Brussels.        
	The adult entertainment industry has long campaigned in favour of a special .xxx suffix. Critics believe the so-called sex.com domain would create the internet equivalent of a red light district, while supporters argue that it will make it easier for people to filter or block unwanted adult content.              
	, as well as to help with the self-regulation of the web porn         
	industry.        
	ICANN, which is appointed by the US government to oversee the internet, ruled that in order to         
	maintain neutrality in dealing with new domain names, it should create the .xxx suffix and         
	allow adult entertainment websites to sign up to the scheme on a voluntary basis.        
	 quot;If expedited due diligence results are successful, then staff will proceed into contract         
	negotiations over .xxx, quot; said John Jeffrey, general counsel for ICANN.        
	According to Internet Pornography Statistics, which measures adult entertainment web traffic,         
	more than $3,000 is spent on internet pornography every second, while sex is the number one         
	search term in the world, accounting for a quarter of all internet searches.              THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

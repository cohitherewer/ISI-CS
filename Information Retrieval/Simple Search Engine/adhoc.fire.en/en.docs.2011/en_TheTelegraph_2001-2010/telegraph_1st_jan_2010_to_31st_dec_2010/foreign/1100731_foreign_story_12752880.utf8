	Rhinebeck (New York), July 30 (Reuters): With a day to go before Chelsea Clintons multimillion-dollar wedding, the tiny town of Rhinebeck, 161km north of New York city, was bustling with activity today.        
	Tourists and reporters from all over the world have descended on the picturesque Hudson river valley village to catch a glimpse of the former first daughter. Chelsea will marry longtime beau Marc Mezvinsky.        
	Police were directing traffic on Rhinebecks normally quiet main street, which was jammed with television trucks. Some roads will be closed from tomorrow afternoon till early Sunday. Airspace over the wedding site will be closed tomorrow to fend off potential paparazzi.        
	We expect a significant influx of people into the Rhinebeck area, New York state police commander Maj. Michael Kopy told reporters yesterday. State police were working with the US Secret Service on security for former President Bill Clinton, US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and more than 400 expected guests.

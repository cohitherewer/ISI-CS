	London, Aug. 29 (PTI): The world-famous Gurkha regiment, part of the British army for almost 200 years, may be among those axed unless the ministry of defences demands for money to fund the replacement of Trident nuclear missile submarines are met.        
	Last night, hopes for extra funding were fading as chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander rejected demands for extra money from Tory defence secretary Liam Fox and insisted the 20-billion cost of replacing Trident had to be met fully by the ministry, the Observer reported today.        
	After actress Joanna Lumleys campaign last year for welfare of the Gurkha soldiers, the cost of running the regiment has increased.

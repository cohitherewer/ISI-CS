The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama: Yes we can but...

	New York, Oct. 28: President Obama took his campaign get-out-the-vote blitz to The Daily Show yesterday, telling the host, Jon Stewart, that he never promised drastic change overnight.        
	When we promised during the campaign change you can believe in, it wasnt change you can believe in in 18 months, Obama said. It was change you can believe in but were going to have to work for it.        
	The 30-minute interview, before a wildly enthusiastic crowd of 550 at the Harman Center for the Arts in downtown Washington, a short drive from the White House, was Obamas first appearance on the show as President, though he was also a guest during his run for the White House in 2008.         
	The President used the appearance to defend his agenda and make a pitch for people to get out and vote; Stewart used the interview to press the President with the critique he often hears from the Left, by characterising his agenda as timid  a characterisation the President fiercely resisted.        
	You ran on very high rhetoric, hope and change, and the Democrats this year seem to be running on, Please baby, one more chance, Stewart said at one point. At another, he asked the President if he was now running on Yes we can, with certain conditions.        
	Obama replied: I think I would say: Yes we can, but         
	Stewart, laughing, cut the President off. Obama jumped in again, finishing his sentence: But its not going to happen overnight.        
	For Stewart, the interview was part of the run-up to the Rally to Restore Sanity and the March to Keep Fear Alive that he and his fellow Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert are hosting on the National Mall in Washington DC this Saturday. For Obama, it was another step in an intense effort to get Democrats  and especially young people  to the polls, and Obama closed the interview by making a pitch for them to do just that.        
	Can I just make a plug just to vote? the President asked, as Stewart tried to wrap up. Go out there and vote November 2. A lot of you have early voting in your states; make sure you make use of it.        
	Of course, when you are President of the US and you appear on a fake news programme, you can expect to get tweaked, and Stewart did not disappoint.        
	So here you are, two years in, and the question that raises in my mind is: Are we the people we were waiting for? Stewart asked  a play on Obamas much-repeated campaign line. Or, Stewart went on, as the audience laughed, Does it turn out those people are still out there and we dont have their number?        
	The interview went longer than Stewart expected  so long, in fact, that the shows producers decided to cut out the original introduction Stewart taped, which include a riff of him fiddling with a pen and drumming his fingers on the table while making the President wait, and his introduction of Obama as White House chairman of the council of Economic Advisers Austan Goolsbees boss. A spokeswoman for the show said it was the first time the show consisted of a single interview.        
	Last, year, Obama became the first sitting President to appear on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

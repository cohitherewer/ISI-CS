	London, Jan. 22: YouTube has entered the online film rental market having signed a deal with the Sundance Film Festival to show independent films.        
	 Only US YouTube users will be able to rent the initial five films on offer for $3.99 each for a period of 48 hours. However, Google, YouTubes parent, has confirmed that it is in talks with other studios and producers about securing other similar deals for its different territories. Last week YouTube ranked sixth among all websites in the US and came second behind MomoMesh, another movie site.

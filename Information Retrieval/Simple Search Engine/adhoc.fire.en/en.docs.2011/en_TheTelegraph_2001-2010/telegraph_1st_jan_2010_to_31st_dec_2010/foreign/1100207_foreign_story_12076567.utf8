	Hitler Viagra    
	 London, Feb. 6: Adolf Hitler took a primitive form of Viagra when he tried to have sex with Eva Braun, a new book on the Fuhrers fragile health has claimed, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Based on long-dormant medical archives and formerly classified military documents, it claimed the dictator was so afraid of pills that most of his medication was injected.      
	The authors of the book, titled Was Hitler Ill?, claimed he took 82 different sorts of medication during his rule of Nazi Germany including the primitive Viagra, which was a testosterone extract.      
	 The book is largely based on papers from Dr Theodor Morrell, regarded as a quack among many in the upper echelons of Nazism, who Hitler came to rely on with increasing urgency during the war.    
	Kerr ogler    
	London (PTI): David Kiely, the banker, who was caught looking at Miranda Kerr on his computer screen at work during a TV interview, will be staying in his job after the Australian supermodel lent her support. After Kerr lent her support to a Save Dave petition doing the rounds, he has clung on to his job. I am told there is a petition to save his job and of course I would sign it, Kerr had said. The bank said Kiely would keep his job.

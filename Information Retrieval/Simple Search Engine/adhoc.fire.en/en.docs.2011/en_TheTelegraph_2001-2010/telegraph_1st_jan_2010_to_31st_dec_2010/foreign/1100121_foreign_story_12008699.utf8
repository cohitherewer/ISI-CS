The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Apple tablet sale could be delayed
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Apple tablet sale could be delayed
          EMMA BARTNETT                          iphone features                                  
	London, Jan. 20: The Apple tablet might be delayed from going on sale for six months, according to a new note to investors.        
	 The much anticipated tablet-style computer, expected to be announced at an event in San Francisco on January 27, might not hit shelves until June because of battery life issues and durability.        
	According to a new note to investors, written by analyst Shaw Wu, from Kaufman Bros, the actual sale of the device could be delayed due to these minor issues.        
	 The note, as seen by appleinsider.com, said the launch of the tablet could follow the same pattern of the launch of the original iPhone in 2007  with a January unveiling and then shipping to consumers following six months later.        
	Wu said the product was like a super iPod touch. This tablet product has been described to us as a hybrid between an iPhone/iPod touch and a Mac but in terms of software and components, it appears closer to the former, he wrote.        
	From our understanding, it is not intended to replace a Mac but be somewhat of a super iPod touch where video, gaming, Web browsing, e-books and the ability to run multiple apps would be enhanced with the much larger screen.        
	However, a different report in The Wall Street Journal, citing people briefed on the matter as its source, said the tablet was due to go on sale two months after being unveiled  which would mean consumers could purchase and receive the tablet by March.        
	Wu estimated the tablet will cost $999, which includes a $100 incremental cost for a large touchscreen. But other analysts have said the price will be lower, costing an average of $600. There is a common consensus that it will definitely cost less than $1000.        
	Wu also predicted that Wi-Fi would be the most likely option for network access as opposed to 3G  which he said was already strained. The January 27 event is taking place in San Francisco.

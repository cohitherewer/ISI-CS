	Oct. 5: Would you like to see your flight attendants deliver the safety demonstration on your next flight to the tune of Lady Gaga  complete with dance moves. Or, how about Katy Perry? Thats just what passengers were treated to on a recent Cebu Pacific flight.        
	The move to liven up the in-flight announcement surfaced on YouTube on Thursday, apparently recorded by a passenger on one of the Philippines-based airlines flights. The video post may have started innocuously enough, but it quickly went viral, logging more than 5.1 million views during the past five days.         
	The video  which shows attendants performing to Lady Gagas Just Dance and Perrys California Gurls  was an online hit almost from the beginning, chalking up one-and-a-half million hits in just over 36 hours, according to the Daily Mail of London.        
	Cebu Pacific has always been known as a fun airline, Candice Iyog, the airlines vice president for marketing and distribution, says in an interview with GMA News of the Philippines.         
	We were looking for something new and different, to show that flight safety doesnt have to be boring.                    USA TODAY

          HENRY SAMUEL                          Sarkozy                                  
	Paris, July 31: Nicolas Sarkozys dream of having his own presidential jet to rival Americas Air Force One are about to come true with Air Sarko One, a 150 million aircraft complete with bedroom, air filter system so he can smoke cigars, and a shower.        
	The specially upholstered Airbus A330-200, has just been taken on its first test flight in Bordeaux, southwestern France, with all internal fittings supposed to be completion by October.        
	The plane will also include a 12-man meeting room, 60 business class seats, top-grade encrypted communications systems, a reinforced fuselage and missile decoy system.        
	Presidential air force officials have dubbed it Air Carla One after his ex-supermodel wife.        
	The French leader is understood to have long envied the luxurious conditions in which President Barack Obama flies across the world in his Boeing 747-200B, and has complained that his two smaller Airbus A319s lacked the necessary presidential stature.        
	Air Sarko One as the plane has been dubbed, will have a wingspan a good two feet longer than the US model.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

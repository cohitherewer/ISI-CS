	Seoul, March 13 (AP): A hospital official said former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger is recovering after being hospitalised in the South Korean capital with stomach pain.        
	Severance Hospital spokesman Lee Sung-man said today that Kissinger would be released tomorrow. As of now, former secretary Kissinger is admitted and receiving treatment. His condition is improving and he is not in serious condition, the spokesman said.        
	Kissinger, 86, arrived in Seoul earlier in the week to attend a security forum. He also met South Korean President Lee Myung-bak.

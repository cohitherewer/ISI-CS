	Mir Ali (Pakistan), Aug. 26 (AP): The Taliban hinted today they may launch attacks against foreigners helping Pakistan respond to the worst floods in the countrys history, saying their presence was unacceptable. The UN said it would not be deterred by violent threats.        
	The militant group has attacked aid workers in the country before, and an outbreak of violence could complicate a relief effort that has already struggled to reach the 8 million people who are in need of emergency assistance.        
	Pakistani Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq claimed the US and other countries that have pledged support are not really focused on providing aid to flood victims but had other motives he did not specify.        
	Behind the scenes they have certain intentions, but on the face they are talking of relief and help, Tariq told The Associated Press by telephone from an undisclosed location.         
	No relief is reaching the affected people, and when the victims are not receiving help, then this horde of foreigners is not acceptable to us at all.        
	He strongly hinted that the militants could resort to violence, saying when we say something is unacceptable to us, one can draw ones own conclusion.         
	Foreign countries have pledged nearly $800 million and provided aid workers to help Pakistan cope with floods that began almost a month ago with the onset of the monsoon and have ravaged a massive swathe of Pakistan.        
	The US military has also stepped in to help, flying helicopters that have evacuated flood victims and delivered relief supplies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the northwest province that was hit hardest by the floods. It is unclear how many foreigners are operating on the ground in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Pakistans tribal area where the Pakistani Taliban are strongest.

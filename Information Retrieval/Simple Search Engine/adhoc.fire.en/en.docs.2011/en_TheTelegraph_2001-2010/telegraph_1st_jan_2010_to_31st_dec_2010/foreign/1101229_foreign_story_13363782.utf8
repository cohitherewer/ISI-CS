	Dhaka, Dec. 28 (AFP): A television channel in Bangladesh has stopped broadcasting a series of interviews with the countrys most famous hangman after a government order, officials said today.         
	The private channel, Banglavision, ran the first episode in its three-part series on hangman Babul Miah last week. However, the channel later said it would not show the remaining two episodes.         
	We were summoned to the information ministry and told to stop, a Banglavision official told AFP on condition of anonymity.         
	Miah, who has hanged nine people since he started working as an executioner seven years ago, was trained for the job when he himself was in prison for murder.         
	After being convicted when he was 16 years old, Miah was released in August after having served 21 years of a 30-year jail term  including 18 months working as a hangman.         
	Speaking from his village in Netrokona district in northern Bangladesh, Miah told AFP today he was delighted to have been on television and was not aware that the series had been stopped. I was honoured they made a television show about me and let me tell my story. I did not know it had been cancelled, Miah, 37, said.

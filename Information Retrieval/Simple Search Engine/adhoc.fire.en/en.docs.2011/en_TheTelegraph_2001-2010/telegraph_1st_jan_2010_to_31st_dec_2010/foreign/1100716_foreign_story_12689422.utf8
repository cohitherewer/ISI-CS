The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | CIA paid $5m to Iran scientist

	Washington, July 15 (Reuters): The Iranian nuclear scientist, who said he was abducted by US agents, was paid more than $5 million by the CIA for information about Irans nuclear programme, The Washington Post reported today, citing US officials.        
	Shahram Amiri, who arrived back in Iran early today, is not obligated to return the money but might not be able to access it after ending significant cooperation with the CIA and returning home, the newspaper reported.        
	Anything he got is now beyond his reach, thanks to the financial sanctions on Iran, a US official said. Hes gone, but his moneys not. We have his information, and the Iranians have him.        
	Intelligence about the Iranian nuclear programme is at a premium for the US, which fears a nuclear-armed Iran would threaten its close ally, Israel, as well as oil supplies from the Gulf, and friendly nations in Europe. Iran insists its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes.        
	US officials speculated that Amiri may have abruptly left the US because of concerns that the Iranian government might harm his family, the Post said.        
	The CIA had no immediate comment on the report.        
	Amiris request this week to be sent home stunned US officials who said he had been working with the US intelligence agency for more than a year, the Post reported.        
	Iran accuses the CIA of kidnapping Amiri a year ago while he was on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. Amiri, who worked for Irans Atomic Energy Organisation, surfaced at the Iranian interests section of the Pakistani embassy in Washington on Monday.        
	Washington denied kidnapping Amiri and insisted he had lived freely in the US. But a US official said yesterday the US, eager for details of Tehrans nuclear programme, had obtained useful information from him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thanks to iPod, sound quality has taken a step back
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Thanks to iPod, sound quality has taken a step back
          JOSEPH PLAMBECK                          NOT FINETUNED                                  
	May 10: At the ripe age of 28, Jon Zimmer is sort of an old fogey. That is, he is obsessive about the sound quality of his music.        
	A one-time audio engineer who now works as a consultant for Stereo Exchange, an upscale audio store in Manhattan, Zimmer lights up when talking about high fidelity, bit rates and $10,000 loudspeakers.        
	But iPods and compressed computer files  the most popular vehicles for audio today  are sucking the life out of music, he says.        
	The last decade has brought an explosion in dazzling technological advances  including enhancements in surround sound, high definition television and 3-D  that have transformed the fans experience. There are improvements in the quality of media everywhere  except in music.        
	In many ways, the quality of what people hear  how well the playback reflects the original sound  has taken a step back. To many expert ears, compressed music files produce a crackly, tinnier and thinner sound than music on CDs and certainly on vinyl. And to compete with other songs, tracks are engineered to be much louder as well.        
	In one way, the music business has been the victim of its own technological success: the ease of loading songs onto a computer or an iPod has meant that a generation of fans has happily traded fidelity for portability and convenience. This is the obstacle the industry faces in any effort to create higher-quality  and more expensive  ways of listening.        
	If people are interested in getting a better sound, there are many ways to do it, Zimmer said. But many people dont even know that they might be interested.        
	Take Thomas Pinales, a 22-year-old from Spanish Harlem and a fan of some of todays most popular artists, including Lady Gaga, Jay-Z and Lil Wayne. Pinales listens to his music stored on his Apple iPod through a pair of earbuds, and while he wouldnt mind upgrading, he is not convinced that it would be worth the cost. My ears arent fine tuned, he said. I dont know if I could really tell the difference.        
	The change in sound quality is as much cultural as technological. For decades, starting around the 1950s, high-end stereos were a status symbol. A high-quality system was something to show off, much like a new flat-screen TV today.        
	But Michael Fremer, a professed audiophile who runs musicangle.com, which reviews albums, said that today, a stereo has become an object of scorn. The marketplace reflects that change. From 2000 to 2009, Americans reduced their overall spending on home stereo components by more than a third, to roughly $960 million.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak link in disappearance of rebels

          ERIC SCHMITT                          A Pakistani soldier in Islamabad. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Dec. 30: The Obama administration is expressing alarm over reports that thousands of political separatists and captured Taliban insurgents have disappeared into the hands of Pakistans police and security forces, and that some may have been tortured or killed.         
	The issue came up in a state department report to Congress last month that urged Pakistan to address this and other human rights abuses. It threatens to become the latest source of friction in the often tense relationship between the wartime allies.         
	The concern is over a steady stream of accounts from human rights groups that Pakistans security services have rounded up thousands of people over the past decade, mainly in Baluchistan, a vast and restive province far from the fight with the Taliban, and are holding them incommunicado without charges.         
	Some American officials think that the Pakistanis have used the pretext of war to imprison members of the Baluch nationalist opposition that has fought for generations to separate from Pakistan. Some of the so-called disappeared are guerrillas; others are civilians.         
	Hundreds of cases are pending in the courts and remain unresolved, said the Congressionally mandated report that the state department sent to Capitol Hill on November 23. A Congressional official provided a copy of the eight-page, unclassified document to The New York Times.         
	Separately, the report also described concerns that the Pakistani military had killed unarmed members of the Taliban, rather than put them on trial. Two months ago, the US took the unusual step of refusing to train or equip about a half-dozen Pakistani Army units that are believed to have killed unarmed prisoners and civilians during recent offensives against the Taliban. The most recent state department report contains some of the administrations most pointed language about accusations of such so-called extrajudicial killings.         
	The Pakistani government has made limited progress in advancing human rights and continues to face human rights challenges, the state department report concluded. There continue to be gross violations of human rights by Pakistani security forces.         
	The Obama administration has largely sought to confront Pakistan in private with evidence of human rights abuses by its intelligence and security forces, fearing that a public scolding could imperil the countrys cooperation in combating al Qaida, the Taliban and other extremist groups.         
	After the September 11 attacks, the administration of President George W. Bush urged Pakistan to capture militants and Islamic extremists linked to the Taliban and al Qaida. Since then, human rights groups have said that Pakistans security forces used that campaign as a cover to round up hundreds, if not thousands, of political activists and guerrilla fighters in Baluchistan.         
	Precise numbers of disappearances are difficult to pin down, human rights advocates say, partly because family members fear that reporting missing relatives could endanger the relatives or even themselves.

                              Gates in Islamabad. (AP)                            
	Islamabad, Jan. 21 (Reuters): Pakistan ruled out any new offensive against militants today, even as US defence secretary Robert Gates began meetings aimed at persuading the country to expand its military campaign to take on Afghanistans Taliban.        
	Gates, on his first trip to Pakistan since President Barack Obama took office last year, is visiting after a period of tense relations marked by a significant degree of distrust on both sides.        
	Islamabad has mounted big offensives against Pakistani Taliban factions attacking the state, but has resisted US pressure to go after Afghan Taliban in border enclaves who do not strike in Pakistan but cross the border to fight US troops.        
	Analysts say Pakistan sees the Afghan Taliban as tools to counter the growing influence of India in Afghanistan and as potential allies if US forces withdraw and leave the country in chaos.        
	Gates said in a commentary published in The News daily that making a distinction between Pakistani Taliban and their Afghan allies was counterproductive. What I hope to talk about with my interlocutors is this notion and the reality that you cant ignore one part of this cancer and pretend that it wont have some impact closer to home, Gates said.

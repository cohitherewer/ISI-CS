The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Italy fine for woman in burqa
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Italy fine for woman in burqa
                            
	Milan, May 4 (Reuters): A 26-year-old Tunisian woman has been fined for wearing a burqa while walking to a mosque in northern Italy, stoking an increasing debate on the integration of Muslim minorities in Europe.        
	Police in the city of Novara, a stronghold of Italys anti-immigration Northern League, stopped the woman on Friday while she was walking with her husband to prayers wearing a burqa that covered her face but left her eyes exposed.        
	Italian police handed the Tunisian woman a 500-euro fine under a bylaw introduced in January by the mayor of Novara which bans clothing in public that prevents identification by police.        
	We just enforced a local law that stops people from covering their face near sensitive places like schools, hospitals or post offices, inspector Leonardo Borghesani told Reuters. We understand the fine is hefty, but she can appeal.

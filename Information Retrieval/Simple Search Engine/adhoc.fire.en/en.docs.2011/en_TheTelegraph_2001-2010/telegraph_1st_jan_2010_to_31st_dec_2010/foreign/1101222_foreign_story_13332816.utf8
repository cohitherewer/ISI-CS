	United Nations, Dec. 21 (Reuters): A sewage backup caused a big stink at the UN today, forcing diplomats and their staff to evacuate the Security Council and General Assembly.        
	Spokesman Farhan Haq said the evacuation was a precautionary measure after a strange smell was noticed in parts of the UN secretariat building. He said the odour was due to sewage backup possibly caused by high tides in the nearby East River.        
	There were gases released from the sewage but theyre not harmful, Haq said. Firefighters and hazardous materials experts had been called to the scene. UN management officials were working to deal with the sewage problem, he said. Security officials had earlier said that there was a gas leak.

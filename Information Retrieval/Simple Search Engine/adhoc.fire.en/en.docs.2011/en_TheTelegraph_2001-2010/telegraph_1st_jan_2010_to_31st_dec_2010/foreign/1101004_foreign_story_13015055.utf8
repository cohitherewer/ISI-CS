The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US, Britain flash Europe alert
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US, Britain flash Europe alert
                                          
	Oct. 3 (Reuters): The US and Britain warned their citizens today of an increased risk of terrorist attacks in Europe, with Washington saying al Qaida might target transport infrastructure.        
	The US state department issued a warning directed at American citizens travelling in Europe, without singling out any specific countries.        
	Britain raised the terrorism threat level in its advice for citizens travelling to Germany and France to high from general. It left the threat level at home unchanged at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely, and said it agreed with the US assessment for the continent as a whole.        
	The moves came after a week in which a number of European officials had broadly confirmed media reports that new intelligence indicated possible attacks on the continent.        
	Western intelligence sources said militants in hideouts in north-west Pakistan had been plotting co-ordinated attacks on European cities, the plans apparently surviving setbacks from a September surge in drone strikes and an arrest.        
	The plot involved al Qaida and allied militants, possibly including European citizens or residents, the sources said. In Washington, US officials said Osama bin Laden and the top al Qaida leadership were likely behind the plot.        
	Some security officials have drawn comparisons to the brazen Mumbai attacks in 2008 that targeted landmarks and killed 166 people.        
	The state department travel alert said public transportation systems and other tourism-related facilities could be targets, noting that past attacks had struck rail, airline and boat services.        
	The state department alerts US citizens to the potential for terrorist attacks in Europe, it said in an advisory on its website, adding that current information suggested al Qaida and affiliated groups were planning attacks.        
	A US official said President Barack Obama held meetings on Friday night and last morning about the European security threat and was briefed on the situation again today morning.        
	The alert was posted on the state department website at http:/travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_europe.html.        
	Europe is worried about how reports of the threats might affect tourism. The US alert falls short of a more severe one in which the state department might have warned citizens against travelling to Europe. Instead, the alert urges them to take precautions when they do travel.        
	US tourist Tom Steier said: You should take these threats seriously, but right now I feel very safe in Paris.        
	French foreign ministry spokesman Bernard Valero said France had taken the US warning into account: The terrorist threat remains high in France... the alert level remains unchanged at red, he said. That is the second highest level.        
	A spokesman for Britains foreign and Commonwealth office (FCO) declined to detail why the travel advice for France and Germany had been updated. Like other large European countries, they have a high threat of terrorism, which is reflected in our updated advice.        
	Advice is under constant review and draws on a variety of sources, the FCO said.        
	British home secretary Theresa May said Washingtons decision to change its advice for Europe was consistent with our assessment.        
	As we have consistently made clear, we face a real and serious threat from terrorism. Our threat level remains at severe, meaning that an attack is highly likely, she said.

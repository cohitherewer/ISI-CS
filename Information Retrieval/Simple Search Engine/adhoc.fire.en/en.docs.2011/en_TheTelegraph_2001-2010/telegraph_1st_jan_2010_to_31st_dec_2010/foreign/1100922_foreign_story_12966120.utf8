                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Warrant out for Lohan
                              Abuse battle                            
	Los Angeles, Sept. 21 (Reuters): Lindsay Lohan was ordered today to appear in court after admitting that she failed a court-ordered drug test a few weeks after being released from jail and a subsequent stint in drug rehabilitation.        
	Los Angeles court officials said Lohans probation had been revoked and a formal warrant for her arrest had been issued, but held until Friday, when she must appear in court. Fridays hearing is expected to determine whether the Mean Girls actress will return to jail.        
	Lohan, 24, whose career has been derailed by drugs and alcohol problems, admitted in a Twitter message that she had failed a random drug test but said she was working hard to overcome her battle with substance abuse.

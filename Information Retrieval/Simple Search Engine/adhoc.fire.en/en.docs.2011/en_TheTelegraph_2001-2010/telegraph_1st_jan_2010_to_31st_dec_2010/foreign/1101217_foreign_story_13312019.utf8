The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Assange freed on bail, to continue work
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Assange freed on bail, to continue work

	London, Dec. 16: The High Court in London granted bail today to Julian Assange, the founder of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, while he fights extradition to Sweden on a warrant connected with alleged sex offences. He emerged onto a London street late in the day.         
	Well, its great to feel the fresh air of London again, he said in a brief statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice. I hope to continue my work and continue protesting my innocence in this matter.         
	But Judge Duncan Ouseley added more restrictive bail conditions to those imposed by a lower court two days ago, when the prosecutors filed an appeal and said Assange was a flight risk.         
	In dismissing the appeal by prosecutors, Judge Ouseley said he accepted arguments by the prosecution that many of those who were posting bail for Assange were doing so because they supported WikiLeaks and might regard absconding as a right and justified act to keep the beleaguered website running.         
	Dressed in a white shirt open at the collar and a dark suit, Assange sat with legs crossed through the two-hour hearing in the High Court, which is near the London theater district. He reacted impassively when the Judge Ouseley pronounced his ruling.         
	Bail of $315,000 was granted by the lower court on Tuesday after a friend of Assange offered to allow him to stay at a mansion in Suffolk, an hours drive from London in eastern England.         
	According to the bail conditions set by the lower court, Assange must spend every night at the mansion, Ellingham Hall, a 10-bedroom Georgian home on a 650-acre estate owned by Vaughan Smith, the wealthy founder of the Frontline journalists club in London.         
	The conditions include a curfew, daily visits to the police and electronic tagging to enable the police to track his movements.         
	Today, Judge Ouseley said that in addition, Assange would be restricted to a small area around Ellingham Hall rather than be given free access to the entire estate. The judge also sought additional financial guarantees from at least two of Assanges closest associates, Sarah Harrison and Joseph Farrell. The newest demands for bail and sureties brought the total to $370,000.         
	Geoffrey Robertson, one of Britains most prominent lawyers, who is assisting Assanges defence team, joked today that during his stay at Ellingham Hall, Assange would also be under the scrutiny of the estates gamekeepers.         
	The hearing today was formally separate from Assanges role in the publication of some 250,000 American diplomatic documents and came as federal prosecutors in Washington looked for evidence that would enable them to charge him with helping an army intelligence analyst suspected of leaking the information.         
	The American prosecutors believe that if he did so, they could charge him as a conspirator rather than a passive recipient of the documents.         
	WikiLeaks said on its website today that it had so far released 1,606 of the 251,287 diplomatic cables.         
	Assanges court appearance in London is related to allegations of sexual misconduct on three occasions with two young Swedish women in Stockholm last August, something he denies. Swedish prosecutors say they want him to be returned to their country to question him in connection with accusations that he broke Swedish rape and other laws.

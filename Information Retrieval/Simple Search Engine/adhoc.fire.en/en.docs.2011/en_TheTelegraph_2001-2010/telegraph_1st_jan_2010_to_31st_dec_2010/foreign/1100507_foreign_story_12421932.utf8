	Kathmandu, May 6: With the peoples patience wearing thin following the Maoist sponsored indefinite nationwide strike which entered the fifth day today, several clashes between the former rebels and the affected people were reported in Kathmandu and elsewhere in Nepal.         
	The authorities were forced to declare curfew in Parbat, Simikot, Humla and Dhankuta district headquarters following violent clashes between the agitating Maoists cadres and those defying the general strike.         
	In the border town of Birgunj in the South nearly a dozen Maoists including a lawmaker were injured when armed activists of the Vishwa Hindu Yuva Sangathan swooped on a Maoist camp and set it ablaze. Hundreds of Maoist cadres who were brought into the industrial township from the nearby villages to enforce the bandh were being housed in the camp.         
	The Hindu activists destroyed the kitchen and torched the tents after attacking the Maoist cadres were sticks. Police had to lob teargas shells to disperse the clashing mob and restore order.         
	In Kathmandu valley clashes between the locals and the Maoists were reported from Jorpati, Bashundhara, Pul Chowk and Budhanilkanta areas. Several Maoist workers who were enforcing the bandh were injured in the clashes when the locals sought to drive them out.         
	Following the clashes the Maoist the militant youth wing Young Communist League (YCL) issued a statement accusing the government of instigating the attacks.         
	YCL coordinator Ganesh Man Pun alleged that the Nepali Congress, CPN (UML) and MJF (Loktantrik) were hiring criminals from the Indian border town of Raxaul to attack his party cadre. quot;YCL will counter any move by vigilantes to defy the peaceful demonstration by the protestors, he said and appealed to the youth not to be misled by certain vested interest groups.         
	Meanwhile even as the political parties continued with their discussions with the Maoists to break the prevailing deadlock, Indian Ambassador Rakesh Sood held consultations with Maoist chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda for nearly an hour. The Maoist supremo reportedly informed the Indian diplomat that his party was still in favour of a negotiated settlement.         
	The meeting comes a day after the former rebels despatched senior leader Ram Karki to New Delhi to hold discussions with the Indian leadership and seek their help to break the political impasse.

                              Enviable figure                            
	London, Feb. 3 (PTI): The secret to actress Cameron Diazs enviable figure is out  it is beach yoga.         
	The Charlies Angels star was spotted in a bikini in the Caribbean doing a strenuous yoga session, reports the Daily Mail. While her friends lazed about in the sun, the 37-year-old balanced on one leg and held herself in the plank position.         
	Diaz has said in the past that she hates the gym and tries to stay active outdoors instead. I hike, snowboard and surf. I admit I do hire a personal yoga trainer as well, but for me working out is a big part of keeping mind and body together, she said.

          ANDREW HOUGH                                    
	London, Jan. 9: The family of a British student, Philip Pain, launched an urgent Facebook appeal for blood donors to save his life after falling from a Mexico hotel balcony on New Years Day.        
	The 20-year-old Southampton University student plunged from a seventh-floor balcony while on holiday in Mazatlan, Mexico. Pain, who is studying Spanish and working as a language assistant during his year abroad, was left with broken legs and lower back while his internal organs were crushed.        
	He had been out celebrating with friends and returned to his hotel at 3am on New Years Day but a toxicology report showed no signs of drugs or excessive alcohol consumption.        
	But after doctors initially feared his rare -negative blood type would leave them with not enough pints to operate, his desperate friends and family at home in Bexleyheath, Kent, launched the campaign on the social networking site.         
	Set up from the other side of the world the day after the accident, The Facebook group, called Urgent: Blood donors needed in Mexico to Save British students life, now has more than 12,000 members. Within hours twelve pints of blood were flown in from Florida, eight pints were donated at the hospital in Mazatlan and other -negative donors have signed up to an emergency blood list.        
	The response meant doctors could give Pain a vital transfusion and will be able to continue with a series of operations to save his life. So far his heart is continuing to get better, the drain on his lungs has been removed, blood oxygen levels are improving and he has begun receiving food via a tube.

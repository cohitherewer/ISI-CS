The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Second storm lashes US

	New York/Washington, Feb. 10 (Reuters): A blizzard lashed the US east coast for the second time in less than a week, wreaking havoc from Washington to New York by forcing government agencies, the UN and schools to close.        
	Some northeast cities ground to a halt as large amounts of snow fell, coupled with powerful winds that created whiteout conditions. That led the city of Baltimore to order all vehicles off the streets except for emergency personnel.        
	Hundreds of flights were cancelled and airlines relaxed ticket policies to allow passengers to change their plans without penalty, moves that could cloud the outlook for an industry already hard hit by the battered economy.        
	The UN said its New York headquarters would be closed today because of the storm.        
	I was as excited as all the school kids when I found out the UN was having a snow day. But I dont really get the day off, I am still working from home, said Stephanie Dunstan, 33, an Australian who works for the UN Development Programme.        
	While government offices in Washington were also closed for the third straight day  at a cost of some $100 million in lost productivity per day  President Barack Obama was trying to maintain his schedule with a meeting with black leaders to discuss the economy and jobs.        
	The US House of Representatives cancelled votes for the week. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the Senate would not be in session today but would resume work tomorrow. He said he doubted the Senate would have any votes this week. Many congressional hearings were also called off.        
	In New York the storm was expected to worsen later. Some companies were allowing employees to leave the office early and many people worked from home. The busy Metro-North train line between New York and Connecticut said there were 21 per cent fewer passengers than usual this morning.        
	The New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, which put some key personnel in hotels last night ahead of the storm, said they planned regular sessions today. JP Morgan Chase was making cots available in its New York offices for workers who were unable to make it home.        
	New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said the storm was likely to cost the citys taxpayers about $1 million for every inch that fell. Its not that bad out, the snow isnt that bad. Its mostly an excuse not to go to work. People freak out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Assange arrested in Britain
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Assange arrested in Britain
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Dec. 7: Only one thing is certain in the case of Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder who presented himself to British police today, was arrested by Scotland Yard by appointment and then taken to the City of Westminster Magistrates Court for a preliminary hearing on Swedish sex charges.        
	 Hero or villain, the story of Assange is almost certain to be turned into a Hollywood blockbuster, according to film industry sources in London.        
	 Some Americans politicians want Assange handed exemplary punishment for revealing state secrets; however, to millions across the world, he has become an unlikely hero for exposing how governments, especially US administrations, say one thing in public and do quite another in public.        
	 Former US vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin has described Assange as an anti-American operative with blood on his hands, while to Senior Republican Mike Huckabee, anything less than execution is too kind a penalty.        
	 An execution would make a Hollywood movie even better, The Telegraph was told. Whoever played Assange would be up for an Oscar.        
	 After days of dramatic hide and seek, Assanges arrest by Scotland Yards extradition unit was very gentlemanly.        
	 The 39-year-old Australian is wanted in Sweden on a rape charge but his supporters argue Assange is paying the price for embarrassing the Americans by publishing the contents of hundreds of thousands of US embassy cables.        
	 Whatever happens to Assange  and it looks the United States will deal firmly with him  the 250,000 cables in the public domain will keep journalists, scholars and historians busy for decades to come.        
	 Act one of todays drama occurred when Assange presented himself to Scotland Yard, whose spokesman said: Officers from the Metropolitan Police Extradition Unit have this morning arrested Julian Assange on behalf of the Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape. Julian Assange, 39, was arrested on a European Arrest Warrant by appointment at a London police station at 9.30am. He is accused by the Swedish authorities of one count of unlawful coercion, two counts of sexual molestation and one count of rape, all alleged to have been committed in August 2010. Assange is due to appear at City of Westminster Magistrates Court today.        
	 Assange denies the rape claims.         
	 Act two of the drama took place when he arrived for the court hearing, accompanied by his solicitor Mark Stephens and the rest of his legal team.        
	 As Assange was mobbed by photographers, Stephens said his client was fine.        
	 The meeting with the police had been very cordial, Stephen added. They have verified his identity. They are satisfied he is the real Julian Assange and we are ready to go into court.        
	 In movie language Act one had a prequel. Assange had written an op ed piece for The Australian newspaper, quoting its founder, Rupert Murdoch, as once saying the truth will inevitably win over secrecy. In a dont shoot the messenger message, Assange wrote: Nearly a century later, WikiLeaks is also fearlessly publishing facts that need to be made public.        
	 He went on: Democratic societies need a strong media and WikiLeaks is part of that media. The media helps keep government honest. WikiLeaks has revealed some hard truths about the Iraq and Afghan wars, and broken stories about corporate corruption.        
	 The campaigner denied he was anti-war, but said governments must tell the truth about their reasons for fighting. He claimed the United States, supported by its acolytes, has attacked WikiLeaks instead of other media groups because it was young and small.        
	 Branding the website underdogs, he accused Australia Prime Minister Julia Gillard of disgraceful pandering to the Americans.        
	 He said: The Gillard government is trying to shoot the messenger because it doesnt want the truth revealed, including information about its own diplomatic and political dealings.The swirling storm around WikiLeaks today reinforces the need to defend the right of all media to reveal the truth.        
	 Act three came in a declaration from Wikileaks which promised further revelations would not be disrupted by Assanges arrest.        
	 Speaking via Twitter, a spokesman issued a defiant statement: Todays actions against our editor-in-chief Julian Assange wont affect our operations: we will release more cables tonight as normal.        
	 There was a minor sub-plot. Visa suspended all payments to WikiLeaks today: Visa Europe has taken action to suspend Visa payment acceptance on WikiLeaks website pending further investigation into the nature of its business and whether it contravenes Visa operating rules.        
	 Act four was taking place in Sweden where more was forthcoming on the rape charge against Assange. This part of the movie would allow the director to hire plenty of blonde starlets working as waitresses in LA cafes. But the sex would probably earn the film an adult rating.        
	 Assange is wanted for questioning in Sweden after two women claimed they were sexually assaulted within days of each other when he visited the country earlier this year. He is said to have arrived in Stockholm on August 11 where he was invited to be a key speaker at a Leftist seminar on war and the role of the media.        
	 According to one account which has appeared in the Daily Mail, Assange had sex with a woman activist in her 30s, named only as Sarah, while staying at her flat in central Stockholm. A condom is said to have broken during this encounter.        
	 Assange allegedly had sex twice with another woman in her 20s, named as Jessica, at her home west of Stockholm three days later  the first time with a condom and the second without protection  after he met her at the seminar. She is reported to have alleged that he refused to wear a condom during their second sexual encounter.        
	 Assange is said to insist that the sex with the two women was consensual and that he has done nothing wrong.        
	 Sarah reportedly told a newspaper in Sweden: In both cases, the sex had been consensual from the start but had eventually turned into abuse.        
	 The two women are said to have then instructed a lawyer who publicly backs an extension of the legal definition of rape. British police contacted Assanges lawyer last night after receiving a fresh European Arrest Warrant from the Swedish authorities.        
	 Would be casting directors would be pondering which actresses might be suitable to play Sarah and Jessica.         
	 But who would play Assange was the biggest question of all.

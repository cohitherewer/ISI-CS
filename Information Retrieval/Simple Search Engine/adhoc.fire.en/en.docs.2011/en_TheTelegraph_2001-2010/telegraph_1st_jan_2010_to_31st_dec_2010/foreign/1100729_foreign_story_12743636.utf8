          HENRY SAMUEL                          Woody Allen and Carla Bruni in Paris. (AFP)                                  
	Paris, July 28: The French First Lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, has made her small but high-profile acting debut in a Woody Allen film being shot in Paris, as her husband looked on.        
	Bystanders gawped as the 42-year old First Lady walked in and out of a grocers shop last night in the central fifth arrondissement  a simple scene in which she appears in the romantic comedy Midnight in Paris.        
	The former supermodel, who has kept up her pop singing career, had clearly abandoned her official functions for the day to work with Allen and a string of Hollywood stars.        
	The road was cordoned off as crowds watched the filming. Bruni-Sarkozys scene may have been short, but the films notoriously perfectionist American director made her re-do it dozens of times.        
	Her husband, President Nicolas Sarkozy, turned up without a tie but with bodyguards to support his wifes new career move, as she acted alongside the films star, Owen Wilson.         
	Both the President and his wife appeared tired and on edge as they conversed between takes.        
	Allen began shooting the movie, about a young engaged couple whose life is disrupted by a holiday to Paris, earlier this month. Bruni-Sarkozy plays a museum curator.        
	Speaking about her role last year, she said she was looking forward to a great experience.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Artist Hopkins    
	 London, Feb. 18 (Reuters): Better known for his creativity on the screen, Welsh actor Anthony Hopkins has extended his artistic talent to the canvas, unveiling 50 acrylic and ink paintings in London this week.      
	Jonathan Poole, exhibition organiser, said the Oscar-winning actor was encouraged to pursue his talent by his third wife, Stella Arroyave, and paints every day in a studio at his Malibu home.      
	His wife Stella saw some of his drawings on his scripts and then pointed out to him that these are rather good and why dont you take it up, obviously not professionally but properly and he did. And therefore he is in full force now, painting away, Poole said.      
	A limited edition print of a painting inspired by his wife is on display and can be bought for $1,802 with the actual canvas hanging in Hopkinss home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pedal for free meal at Danish hotel
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pedal for free meal at Danish hotel
                            
	Copenhagen, July 15 (AFP): In the lobby of an up-market hotel in a Copenhagen suburb, a businessman in a suit pedalled away on a stationary bike, periodically glancing at the counter to see how far he had gone and how much energy he had produced.        
	A bit more sweat and Ill have pedalled enough for a free meal! said Ruediger Spaetel.        
	On a business trip from Munich, Spaetel is staying at the Copenhagen Crowne Plaza hotel where guests are asked to help produce the buildings electricity by climbing onto stationary bikes. The energy produced by pedalling guests is stocked in a battery before being injected into the hotels power supply. Spaetel, in his 30s, says curiosity led him to mount one of the two bikes parked in the hotel lobby.

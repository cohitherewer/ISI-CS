	San Francisco, June 7: Apple has launched iPhone 4, an updated version of its iPhone, describing it as the most precise, beautiful thing weve ever designed.        
	Speaking in San Francisco, Steve Jobs, Apples chief executive, unveiled a new, squarer handset, which he said was the biggest leap since the original iPhone.        
	A rim running around the edge of the iPhones case forms the phones antenna, and it also features a front-facing camera for video-calling and a much enhanced screen resolution. Jobs said the design was inspired by camera manufacturer Leica. Details about the new iPhone first came to light a few weeks ago, when an Apple engineer dropped a prototype iPhone in a bar and it fell in to the hands of a gadget blog.        
	Jobs also revealed more details about the iPhone OS 4.0 operating system  iOS4, which bring several long-awaited features to the iPhone, including multitasking.         
	Jobs was thwarted in his attempt to show off how clearly the newest iPhone displays Web pages, apparently because too many computers were clogging the wireless network. Jobs tried three times during his keynote to do a side-by-side comparison of the iPhone 4s screen resolution versus its predecessors. He was trying to call up The New York Times Web page, but it would not load.

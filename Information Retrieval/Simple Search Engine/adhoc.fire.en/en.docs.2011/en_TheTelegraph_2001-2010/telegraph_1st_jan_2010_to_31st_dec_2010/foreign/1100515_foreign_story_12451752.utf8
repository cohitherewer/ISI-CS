	Nantes (France), May 14 (Reuters): A man fell to his death after taking part in a mass cocktail party which was organised over the Internet and drew almost 10,000 revellers, the prefecture for Nantes in western France said yesterday.        
	The death is the first on record as a result of Facebook aperitifs  giant outdoor drinking parties whose popularity has exploded in the last six months and which are organised over the online social network. This must be stopped. Its quite dark, its not a party, people came to get smashed, among them 15-year-old adolescents, Nantes deputy mayor Jean-Marc Ayrault told RTL radio.        
	Maybe it is based on good feelings at the outset but you can see that something is happening which is no longer controllable and could end in tragedy, he said, calling the death profoundly sad.        
	The 21-year-old man, who was drunk, landed on his head after falling over the railing of a staircase leading down from a bridge, after apparently trying to slide down the banister. Such parties take place across France and often turn into mass drinking binges, sparking concern with authorities. Also on Wednesday, another party in the southern city of Montpellier drew around 11,000.        
	Another giant drinks party is planned for May 23 at the Champs de Mars in Paris, according to the events Facebook page.        
	Ayrault demanded the partys organisers be found and called on the interior ministry to set up a roundtable with mayors, health services and students to tackle the phenomenon. Local authorities in Nantes, who were not consulted by the party organisers, had issued an order restraining the transportation and sale of alcohol on Wednesday.

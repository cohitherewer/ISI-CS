	Washington, Oct. 29 (AP): Authorities on three continents were investigating today whether suspicious packages shipped from Yemen to the US aboard cargo planes could be part of a terrorist plot.        
	Yemen is home to the al Qaida branch that tried to bomb a US-bound airliner on December 25, Christmas Day. No explosives have been found.        
	Intelligence and law enforcement officials discovered suspicious packages in Britain and Dubai late last night, prompting national security officials to alert President Barack Obama to a potential terrorist threat, the White House said. The package in Britain, discovered aboard a plane in the East Midlands, about two hours north of London, contained a toner cartridge with wires and powder. It was found during routine screening of cargo in the UK, prompting authorities to scour three planes and a truck in the US today, officials said.        
	Searches also were conducted in Philadelphia, Newark, New Jersey and New York city. The packages were being sent via UPS.         
	Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Kristin Lee said the planes in Philadelphia and Newark were swept. The planes were moved away from terminal buildings while law enforcement officials investigated.        
	Two jets in Philadelphia belonging to UPS were searched. A federal law enforcement official, who was not authorised to provide information on the investigation, told the AP that nothing suspicious was found on them.        
	A source with knowledge of the situation in Newark who was not authorised to speak publicly said the FBI and a bomb squad checked two packages there and gave the all clear        
	New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the NYPD removed a package from a UPS truck in Brooklyn, tested it for possible explosives and found it not to be dangerous.         
	Sarah Furbank, a passenger who was about to board a plane out of East Midlands airport, said that she had noticed an increased security presence. There were quite a few police cars round the edge of the airport, she said.

	London, Aug. 8 (Reuters): British singer Robbie Williams has married US actress Ayda Field, his spokesperson said on Sunday. The 36-year-old, who rose to fame with Take That before forging a successful solo career, tied the knot at his home in Los Angeles on Saturday, the spokesperson said in a brief statement.        
	Williams met Field, 31, in 2006.        
	At last, Rob is happy, his father Pete Conway told the News of the World tabloid.        
	Thats what you want for your kids and this is the happiest Ive seen him. Ayda is so beautiful and so delightful and so lovely and just so right for him. They are brilliant together.        
	Take That announced in July that Williams had rejoined them to record their first album together since he walked out on the band 15 years ago.        
	The group enjoyed number one hits around the world during a meteoric rise to fame in the early 1990s but Williams quit in 1995 before pursuing a solo career. The other four members of Take That split up the following year.

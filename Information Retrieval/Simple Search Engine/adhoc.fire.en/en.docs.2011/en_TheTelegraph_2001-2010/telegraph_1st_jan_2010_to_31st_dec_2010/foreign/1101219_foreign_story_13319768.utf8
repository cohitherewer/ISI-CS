The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Congress closer to lifting army gay ban
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Congress closer to lifting army gay ban
                                  
	Washington, Dec. 18 (Reuters): Congress is expected to approve an end to the ban against gays serving openly in the US military after the White House-backed repeal cleared a major hurdle set by Senate Republicans.        
	A final vote on the measure was set for later after the Senate voted 63-33, well more than the 60 needed in the 100-member chamber, to limit debate on the bill to lift the 17-year-old dont ask, dont tell, policy. Six Republicans joined the Senate Democratic majority to support repeal.        
	The Senate vote will clear the way for President Barack Obama to sign it into law. The House of Representatives passed the bill earlier this week.        
	Obama vowed during his 2008 presidential campaign to end the ban, which he denounced as unfair, unwise and a violation of basic human rights. He had been facing criticism from liberal groups who said he failed to push hard enough to end the policy.        
	At least 13,000 men and women have been expelled from the US military under the dont ask, dont tell policy, which allows gays to serve in the armed forces as long as they keep their sexual orientation secret. Defence secretary Robert Gates and other supporters of the repeal argued it would allow for a more orderly transition for the military than would occur if it was delayed until the likely court-ordered end to the policy.        
	Once it is enacted into law, as anticipated, the Pentagon will have an undetermined amount of time  possibly months  to educate service members and prepare for the policy change before it is ready to certify the repeal.        
	When the repeal is certified, there will be another 60-day period before the new policy of allowing gays to openly serve takes effect. Until that time dont ask dont tell will be in effect.        
	The only method of repeal that places the timing of the repeal and control of implementation in the hands of the military leaders is enactment of this bill, said Senator Carl Levin, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.         
	Opponents of gays serving openly in the military argue that lifting the ban would undermine order and discipline and harm unit cohesiveness, especially among combat troops.

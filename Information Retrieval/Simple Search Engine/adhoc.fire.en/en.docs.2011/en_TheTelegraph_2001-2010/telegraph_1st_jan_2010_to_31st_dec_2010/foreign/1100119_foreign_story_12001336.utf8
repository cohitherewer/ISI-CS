	London, Jan. 18: Butter should be banned in a bid to save thousands from heart disease, a leading heart surgeon claims.        
	Dr Shyam Kolvekar said that he is increasingly concerned about Britains eating habits as he is seeing patients as young as 30 in need of heart bypass surgery due to a diet overloaded with saturated fat. According to a national diet survey, nine out of 10 children, 88 per cent of men and 83 per cent of women in Britain eat too much saturated fat.

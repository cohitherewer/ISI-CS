	Eric songs    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Rock guitarist Eric Clapton enjoys his recently recorded songs and insists he sounded awful when he first started adding vocals to his records. The 64-year-old singer admits he spent too long trying to hit the high notes and it took maturity to make him realise he sounded better if he sang low.

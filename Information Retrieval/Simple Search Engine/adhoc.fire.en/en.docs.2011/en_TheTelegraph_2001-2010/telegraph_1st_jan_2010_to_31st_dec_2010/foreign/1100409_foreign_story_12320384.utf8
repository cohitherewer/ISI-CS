          PETER BAKER                          Obama and Medvedev after signing the New Start treaty at the Prague Castle. (AP)                                  
	Prague, April 8: With flourish and fanfare, President Obama and President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia signed a nuclear arms control treaty today and opened what they hoped would be a new era in the tumultuous relationship between two former cold war adversaries.        
	Meeting here in the heart of a once-divided Europe, the two leaders put aside the acrimony that has characterised Russian-American ties in recent years as they agreed to bring down their arsenals and restore an inspection regime that expired in December. Along the way, they sidestepped unresolved disputes over missile defence and other issues.        
	When the United States and Russia are not able to work together on big issues, it is not good for either of our nations, nor is it good for the world, Obama said as his words echoed through a majestic, gilded hall in the famed Prague Castle. Together, we have stopped the drift, and proven the benefits of cooperation. Today is an important milestone for nuclear security and nonproliferation, and for US-Russia relations.        
	Medvedev called the treaty signing a truly historic event that will open a new page in Russian-American relations. What matters most is this is a win-win situation, he said. No one stands to lose from this agreement. I believe this is a typical feature of our cooperation. Both parties have won.        
	The Russian President signaled general support for the American-led drive to impose new sanctions on Iran, saying that Tehrans nuclear programme has flouted the international community. We cannot turn a blind eye to this, Medvedev said, while adding that sanctions should be smart and avoid hardship for the Iranian people.        
	The apparently warm relationship between the two Presidents was on display as they entered the hall to trumpet music. They whispered and smiled with each other in English as they sat side by side signing copies of the so-called New Start treaty, then traded compliments during a follow-up exchange with reporters.        
	Obama called the Russian a friend and partner and said without his personal efforts and strong leadership, we would not be here today. For his part, Medvedev said the two had developed a very good personal relationship and a very good personal chemistry as they say.        
	While the treaty will mandate only modest reductions in the actual arsenals maintained by the two countries, it caps a turnaround in relations with Moscow that sunk to rock bottom in August 2008 during the war between Russia and its tiny southern neighbour, Georgia. When he arrived in office, Obama made restoring the relationship a priority, a goal that coincided with his vision expressed here a year ago of eventually ridding the world of nuclear weapons.        
	Even as the two Presidents hailed the treaty, however, they found no common ground on American plans to build an anti-missile shield in Europe to counter any Iranian threat.         
	Obama refused Russian demands to include limits on missile defence in the treaty, nearly scuttling the agreement. In the days leading up to the ceremony here, Russian officials alternately claimed the agreement would bind the programme or complained that it did not and threatened to withdraw if it went forward.        
	The treaty, if ratified by lawmakers in both countries, would require each country to deploy no more than 1,550 strategic warheads, down from 2,200 allowed in the Treaty of Moscow signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. Each would be limited to 800 total land-, air- and sea-based launchers  700 of which can be deployed at any given time  down from 1,600 permitted under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 1991, or Start.

	Katy kids     
	 London, Nov. 29 (PTI): Pop star Katy Perry has said her children will take priority over her music career when she becomes a mother.      
	Perry plans to fit in her profession along with a parents responsibilities after she decides to have a baby with comedian husband Russell Brand. My singing is really important to me, but when children come along theyll be my main focus. Id never put my career in front of my babies itd be a case of fitting jobs around them, said Perry.

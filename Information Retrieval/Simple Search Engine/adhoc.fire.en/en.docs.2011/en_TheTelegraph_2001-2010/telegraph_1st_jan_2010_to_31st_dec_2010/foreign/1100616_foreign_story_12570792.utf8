	Osh (Kyrgyzstan), June 15: A plane carrying 40 tons of flour, pasta, cooking oil and other food landed at the airport in this traumatised city today, and citizens tentatively ventured out onto the street for the first time since spasms of ethnic violence seized the city last Thursday.        
	The thick black pillars of smoke that rose from ethnic Uzbek neighbourhoods during four days of ethnic rioting had thinned out, and shaken citizens were lining up to board government buses that had been commissioned to take them to the airport.         
	At the border, where thousands of refugees have been stranded without clean water or medical care, medical supplies, aid blankets and tarpaulins were due to be delivered by the International Committee for the Red Cross.        
	Meanwhile, officials in the capital, Bishkek, said they hoped the pace of aid delivery would steadily increase. This is our obligation, said Aleksandr Dulin, the flight manager aboard the Il-76 cargo plane, during the flight to Osh.

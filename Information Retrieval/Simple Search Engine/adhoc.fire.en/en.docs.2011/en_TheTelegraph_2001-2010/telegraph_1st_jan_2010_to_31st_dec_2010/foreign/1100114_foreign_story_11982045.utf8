	Port-au-Prince (Haiti), Jan. 13 (Reuters): Thousands were feared dead in a major earthquake that destroyed the presidential palace, schools, hospitals and hillside shanties in Haiti, its leaders said today, and the US and other nations geared up for a big relief operation.        
	A five-storey UN headquarters building was also demolished by yesterdays 7.0 magnitude quake, which the US Geological Survey said was the most powerful in Haiti in over 200 years. Many casualties were feared in the UN building.        
	Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said that thousands of buildings had collapsed in the capital, Port-au-Prince, and said he believed the casualties would be in the range of thousands of dead. He added he could give no clear official estimate. Soon after, however, Bellerive told CNN he believed well over 100,000 people could have died.        
	President Rene Preval called the damage unimaginable and described stepping over dead bodies and hearing the cries of those trapped in the collapsed parliament building, where the senate president was among those pinned by debris.        
	There are a lot of schools that have a lot of dead people in them, he told the Miami Herald. All the hospitals are packed with people. It is a catastrophe.        
	Sobbing and dazed people wandered the streets of Port-au-Prince, and voices cried out from the rubble. Please take me out, I am dying. I have two children with me, a woman told a Reuters journalist from under a collapsed kindergarten in the Canape-Vert area of the capital.        
	The presidential palace lay in ruins, its domes fallen on top of flattened walls. Preval and his wife were not inside when the quake hit.        
	The quakes epicentre was only 16km from Port-au-Prince. About 4 million people live in the city and surrounding area. Many people slept outside on the ground, away from weakened walls, as aftershocks as powerful as 5.9 rattled the city throughout the night and into today.        
	The devastation crippled the government and the UN security and assistance mission that had kept order, and there were no signs of any organized rescue efforts.        
	Haitian Red Cross spokesman Pericles Jean-Baptiste said his organisation was overwhelmed.There are too many people who need help ... We lack equipment, we lack body bags, he told Reuters today.

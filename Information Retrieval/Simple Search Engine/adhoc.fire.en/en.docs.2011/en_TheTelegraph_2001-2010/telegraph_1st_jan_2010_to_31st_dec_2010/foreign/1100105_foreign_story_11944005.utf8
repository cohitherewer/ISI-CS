                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Militants tied to Yemen threat killed
                            
	Sanaa (Yemen), Jan. 4 (Reuters): Yemeni forces today killed at least two al Qaida militants they said were behind a threat which forced the US and European embassies to shut.        
	The raid took place after the attempted bombing of a US-bound plane on Christmas Day thrust Yemen into the foreground of the US-led war against Islamist militants. Security authorities had been monitoring them for several days and struck today, a Yemeni security official said.        
	These elements are believed to be behind the threats directed to the US embassy.         
	The embassy in Sanaa stayed shut for a second day in response to what it said was al Qaida threats. Britains embassy has also been closed since yesterday.         
	Other European countries, including France and Italy, limited access to their embassies today, as did Japan.

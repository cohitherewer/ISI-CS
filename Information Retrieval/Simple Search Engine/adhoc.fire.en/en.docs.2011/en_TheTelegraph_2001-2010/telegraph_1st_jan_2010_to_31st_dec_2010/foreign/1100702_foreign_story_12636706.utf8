	Going Gaga    
	 Washington, July 1 (AFP): Facebook users are gaga over Lady Gaga.      
	The pop star has surged past President Barack Obama in the race to become the first person with 10 million fans on the social network.       
	The first living person, that is. A Michael Jackson remembrance page has attracted more than 14 million fans.       
	Lady Gaga, who is as well-known for her bizarre outfits as her chart-topping music, had 9.76 million Facebook fans on Thursday. Obama had 9.41 million.

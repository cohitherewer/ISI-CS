The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Disease fears rise in Pak
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Disease fears rise in Pak
  - 2 women die of cholera, experts fear malaria outbreak                            Two United Arab Emirates helicopters carry food and water to flood-affected areas in Punjab, Pakistan. (AFP)                                  
	Islamabad, Aug. 18 (PTI): The flow of aid to flood-hit areas in Pakistan is not enough to meet the needs of people affected by the calamity, giving rise to fears of more deaths because of a lack of food and an outbreak of waterborne diseases.         
	Two women died and 18 others were affected by an outbreak of cholera in the Bajaur tribal region in the northwest and special teams were sent to Qazi village, health officials said, adding that the situation was under control.         
	Up to 3.5 million children are at high risk of getting cholera, typhoid and dysentery, said UN spokesman Maurizio Giuliano.         
	Pakistani health experts warned that there could be a malaria outbreak in the next 30 to 40 days in flood-affected areas because of the breeding of mosquitoes in stagnant water. They said health officials should immediately provide mosquito nets to people living in flooded areas and begin spraying anti-mosquito repellents.         
	Information minister Qamar Zaman Kaira said the government was worried about half a million pregnant mothers among the flood victims and was making plans to help those who would give birth soon.         
	There are about 500,000 pregnant mothers and we plan to move to or near hospitals those who are expected to deliver within two weeks, he said.         
	There were fresh flood warnings in northwest Sindh, close to the border with Baluchistan, and several towns were placed on high alert.         
	The swollen Indus river continued to inundate villages as the waters travelled south.        
	 Nearly half the $459 million needed to fund initial relief efforts in Pakistan has been secured after days of lobbying donors and warnings that the country faces a spiralling humanitarian catastrophe, the UN said today.        
	Despite the fresh funds  and some signs that rain was easing  only a small minority of the six million Pakistanis desperate for food and clean water have received help after floods that have killed up to 1,600 people and left two million homeless.        
	There has been an improvement in funding. Donors are realising the scale of the disaster, Giuliano said,but the challenges are absolutely massive and the floods are not over.        
	The size of (the area affected by) this disaster is equivalent to Austria, Switzerland and Belgium combined. Thats pretty scary.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Court rejects Khaleda appeal over house
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                    
	Dhaka, Nov. 29: The Supreme Court in Bangladesh today rejected BNP chief Khaleda Zias petition to retain her upscale Dhaka cantonment house from where she was evicted on November 13.        
	This verdict comes a day before the nationwide hartal that the opposition has called tomorrow --- the second in just 15 days over Zias quot;eviction quot;.         
	The last strike was on November 14. As the verdict was made public, lawyers, sympathetic to BNP politics staged protest marches near the Supreme Court complex as Zia lost inher final legal battle on the residence.        
	The government, the business community and different other cross sections of society have expressed their strong disapproval of the hartal, while the highest body of the business and industry asked thegovernment to put a ban on hartal through legislation.        
	The hartal culture should not continue, as it paralyses economy. Strike seriously affects our business and does not allow us to meet buyers deadline. During the strike hours, our factories remain shutand we cannot take our items to the Chittagong Port for shipment, said Habibur Rahman, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Associations (BKMEA) acting president in a press conference yesterday.        
	Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, has already requested BNP to withdraw strike. We have been growing tremendously for the past few years. We want to continue the trend. So the government and the opposition should work together to reach a consensus and help us grow, quot; said AH Aslam Sunny, vice-president (finance) of BKMEA.         
	However, despite the call from the business sector, BNP has shown noinclination to call off the strike, and stray violence was reported from all over the country, as hundreds of people were detained by the police as a pre-hartal roundup.        
	In another development that might further make the hartal a cause forconcern is BNPs announcement that the strike is just a beginning of an out campaign against the Hasina Government.        
	Two days after the BNP called a nationwide strike, its standing committee member, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury said that his partys lawmakers will not return to Parliament and hinted that the opposition MPs might also resign enmasse as they had already tendered their resignation letters to the party chief.        
	Chowdhurys comments came as the seventh session of the house is setto convene from December 5 while with only 34 seats in the 345-seatparliament, BNP and its rightwing ally Jamaat-e-Islami has been absenting from the house from the fourth session.        
	Most of the first three sessions of the house were hit by the absenceof the opposition from the house. The grouse then were the seatingarrangements As BNP demanded more seats for their leaders.        
	BNP and its allies continued to abstain from the house in subsequentsessions accusing the ruling AL chief Hasina of taking extraadvantages of their quot;brute majority quot;.        
	AL members have responded by saying that by -elections would be heldin the seats that lay vacant.        
	Amidst these political upheavals, the Government has already begunrounding up people in a pre hartal offensive. BNP claims that about 1000 people have been detained by government forces in the last couple of days.        
	BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain in a press conferencepresented a district-wise arrest list. He alleged that the police wereraiding opposition leaders houses and making arrests on falsecharges.

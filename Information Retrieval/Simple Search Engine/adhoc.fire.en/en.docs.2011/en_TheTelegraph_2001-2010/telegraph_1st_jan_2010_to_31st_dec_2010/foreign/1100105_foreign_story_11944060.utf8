	Garner role    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Actress Jennifer Garner doubts whether she will team up with her husband Ben Affleck on the big screen again because the pairing could ruin their happy marriage. The couple first met on the set of Daredevil in 2003 and reunited for its spin-off, Elektra. They began dating in 2004 and went on to wed in 2005. The stars have not worked together on a movie project since and Garner is not keen on the idea of taking directions from her spouse.

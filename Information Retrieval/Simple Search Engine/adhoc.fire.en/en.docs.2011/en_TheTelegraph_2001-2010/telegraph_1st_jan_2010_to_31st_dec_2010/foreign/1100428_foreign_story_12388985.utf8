	London, April 27: British Airways is facing the threat of a fresh cabin crew walkout after the Unite trade union leadership rejected the airlines latest offer.        
	New strikes could be called for next month following a consultative ballot of 12,000 members of The British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association.        
	But it is understood the parent union, Unite, will not announce strike dates ahead of the general election in an attempt to avoid embarrassing Prime Minister Gordon Brown. A spokesman for Unite said its officials will recommend rejection of the latest proposals from BA.

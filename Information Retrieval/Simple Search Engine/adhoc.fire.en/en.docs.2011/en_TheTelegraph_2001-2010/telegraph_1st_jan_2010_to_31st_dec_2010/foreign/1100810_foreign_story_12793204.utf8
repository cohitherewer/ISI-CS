The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK couple shot dead in Pak honour killing
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      UK couple shot dead in Pak honour killing
          AMIT ROY                          Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood was shocked by the killings of Gul Wazir and his wife Niaz Begum                                  
	London, Aug. 9: In an unusual honour killing, taxi driver Gul Wazir and his wife Niaz Begum, from Alum Rock, Birmingham, were shot dead in Pakistan after they changed their minds about allowing their daughter to marry a first cousin to whom she had apparently been promised.        
	 The Pakistani couple from Britain were willing to pay Pound18,800 as compensation to the family of the prospective groom, whose father happens to be Guls brother, Noor Wazir.        
	 Noor had approached Gul with the proposal that his sons should marry Guls two British educated daughters but the girls did not seem keen on the idea  not least because their cousins had been married before.        
	 The marriages would have allowed the young men to circumvent UK immigration controls and enabled them to enter Britain as husbands of British women.        
	 Gul and his wife, a couple in their fifties, went to the remote village of Salehana in the Nowshera province of Pakistan to try to resolve the family dispute amicably. The row was taken to a local tribunal which agreed the marriages should not go ahead.        
	 Brother or not, Noor felt Guls behaviour in breaking the marriage promise was unacceptable. On Friday morning, Noor, one of his offended sons, Awal Wazir, and another man, then did what they felt was the only honourable thing they could do.        
	 They burst in while Gul and Begum were having breakfast and shot them in cold blood. Then they went back home relieved that their izzat had been saved.         
	 This man went crazy and shot them for breaking off the engagement, a family friend confirmed.        
	 Hours later, without too much fuss, Gul and Begum were buried locally.        
	 Guls son, Mehboob Alam, who had come from Birmingham with his mother and father, was having a shower at the time his uncle and first cousin were killing his parents. He came out to find a blood bath.        
	 A West Midlands Police spokeswoman said: We have been informed of the murder of two people from Birmingham in Pakistan. The murder inquiry is being carried out by the authorities in Pakistan and we will support their investigation as and when required.        
	 Honour killings of one sort or another are even more common in Pakistan than in India. There have been several in the Pakistani community in Britain, too, plus a few among Indians.        
	 It is invariably British-born and educated girls who tend to get hacked to death by disapproving fathers, uncles and brothers if they dare to choose their own boyfriends.        
	 The British Pakistani member of parliament for Birmingham Perry Barr, Khalid Mahmood, said: Im very disappointed and shocked by this act. Honour killing is absolutely absurd in this day and age.        
	 Parents living in Britain need to make sure that their children are happy with any marriage arrangements they make, he warned. The message to people here is they need to take it very seriously, when they make these kind of arrangements, that their children are happy with that and that they have a proper dialogue with their family. (The problem is) if the child refuses the marriage its seen as an insult.        
	 He added: I think people need to realise that if they (the parents) want to continue their ties with their relatives in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, they need to be aware of the extent, when their children arent overly enthusiastic, that the family overseas will feel theyre being slighted. Luckily very few of these incidents happen but when it does happen its disgraceful.        
	 Such incidents are anything but rare, though.        
	 In May Mohammad and Pervaze Yousaf, from Nelson, Lancashire, were gunned down in a graveyard in north-east Pakistan. They were shot after the arranged marriage of their son Kamar to his cousin broke down, sparking a family dispute.        
	 Councillor Eileen Ansar, who sits on Pendle Borough Council, and is related to the Yousaf family, was concerned about the practice of marrying off British women abroad.        
	 The 45-year-old said: The girls do it because they are going through the motions and they will lose the respect of their family if they dont go through with it. If you are moving well-educated girls from the UK to marry men who are not educated in Pakistan, then its not going to work as they have nothing in common. The parents should be considering a lot more what they are doing because its an absolute tragedy whats happened.        
	 The Foreign Office said it distinguished between forced and arranged marriages. A spokeswoman said its dedicated forced marriages unit dealt with 1,700 cases a year. It had the ability to send officers to Pakistan, India and Bangladesh to rescue people seeking a way out of a forced marriage, she said.        
	 It is, at least, to Guls credit that he listened belatedly to his daughters plea to cancel the marriages, though with devastating consequences for himself.        
	 May Sparrow, a pensioner who knew Gul since he was about 18, said he had lived in his current house, in Parkfield Road, for the past 15 years. He was so nice, and a wonderful father. I would imagine he went to Pakistan because he didnt want his daughter to marry this other person. It sort of fits perfectly that if his daughter didnt want to marry someone over there he would step in and stop it.

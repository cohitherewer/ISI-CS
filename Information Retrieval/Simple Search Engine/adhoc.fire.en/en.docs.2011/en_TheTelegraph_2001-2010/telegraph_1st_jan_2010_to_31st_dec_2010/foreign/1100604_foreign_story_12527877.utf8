The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | India-origin governor nominee in fresh affair
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      India-origin governor nominee in fresh affair
                              Nikki Haley: Scandal storm                            
	Washington, June 3 (PTI): Republican Nikki Haley, who became frontrunner to be South Carolina governor after she was backed by Sarah Palin, has been accused of having an affair with a political lobbyist.        
	The India-origin mother-of-two, whose husband is a US Army officer, has in the past been hit by allegations that she had a physical relationship with commentator Will Folks.        
	Larry Marchant, a familiar face at the South Carolina State House who has lobbied legislators on behalf of the insurance industry and the state Chamber of Commerce, told CNN he had a one night, one night only sexual relationship with Haley at a school choice conference held in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2008. However, he did not have any specific evidence. In spite of the two affairs, Haleys popularity ratings have increased.         
	Haleys campaign office rejected Marchants allegation as a false and desperate attack from a losing candidates paid campaign consultant in the final week of the race.        
	As Nikki Haley rises in the polls, the good old boys in Columbia see their taxpayer-funded fraternity party coming crumbling down, and they will say or do anything to hold on to their power, Haleys campaign manager Tim Pearson was quoted as saying.

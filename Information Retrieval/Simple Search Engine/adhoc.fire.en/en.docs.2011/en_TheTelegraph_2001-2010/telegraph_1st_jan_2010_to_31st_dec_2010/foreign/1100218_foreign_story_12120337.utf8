The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Saviour of BlackBerry: Teens
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Saviour of BlackBerry: Teens
          RUPERT NEATE                                    
	Barcelona, Feb. 17: Since its inception at the turn of the millennium, the BlackBerry has been the businessmans best friend.         
	Having been virtually unopposed in the mobile email market, Research in Motion (RIM), the Canadian company behind the BlackBerry, was caught napping when Apple released its phenomenally popular iPhone in 2007.        
	To begin with the iPhone was largely restricted to tech geeks and Apple fans, but the latest 3G version is proving a massive hit with executives and politicians trying to show the younger generation that they understand the latest technological fashions. But, as is so often the case, the kids have other ideas. The phone of choice for teenagers  particularly girls  is, surprisingly, the dull businessmans BlackBerry.        
	Mike Lazaridis, founder and co-chief executive of RIM, says the phone has developed a cult following in classrooms across the world thanks to its free instant messaging service.        
	Lots of younger people are using BlackBerry Messenger and Facebook capability on these devices, he said in an exclusive interview with The Daily Telegraph as the Mobile World Congress trade fair in Barcelona. BlackBerry Messenger (BBM), which lets users send messages to each others devices for free, looks like it could turn out to be RIMs unintended saviour.        
	Although the service was not designed with teenagers in mind, Lazaridis says he is not surprised at its popularity in the classroom. Its the fastest and most reliable messaging experience you can have today, he says. It is also nice that its a closed community. You keep your friends close and you keep your really good friends on BBM. Lazaridis, who has resisted the temptation to check any of his many BlackBerrys for nearly an hour, has just eight BBM contacts  his family and two industry contacts.        
	He says the success of BlackBerrys is due to RIMs relentless focus on the ability to communicate and the company wont let itself be distracted by creating hundreds of thousands of fancy applications and games found on rival devices.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

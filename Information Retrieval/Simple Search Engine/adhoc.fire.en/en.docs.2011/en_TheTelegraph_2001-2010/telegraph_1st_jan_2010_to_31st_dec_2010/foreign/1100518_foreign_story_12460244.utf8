	Kabul, May 17 (AP): An Afghan passenger plane carrying 44 people, including six foreigners, crashed today in a mountainous northern region where poor weather was hampering efforts to locate it, officials said. There was no immediate word on casualties.        
	Rescuers were on their way to the crash site near the 3,800-metre -high Salang Pass, a major route through the Hindu Kush mountains that connects the capital to the north. The plane, on a flight from Kunduz, went down about 100km from Kabul.

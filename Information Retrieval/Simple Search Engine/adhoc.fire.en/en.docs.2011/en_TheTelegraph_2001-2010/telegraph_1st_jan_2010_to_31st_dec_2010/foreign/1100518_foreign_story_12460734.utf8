The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran yes to Turkey nuclear deal
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Iran yes to Turkey nuclear deal

	Cairo, May 17: Iran announced an agreement today to ship some of its nuclear fuel to Turkey in a deal that could offer a short-term solution to its ongoing nuclear conflict with the West, or prove to be a tactic aimed at derailing efforts to bring new sanctions against Tehran.        
	The deal, negotiated by Turkey and Brazil, calls for Iran to ship 1,200kg of low enriched uranium to Turkey where it would be stored. In exchange, after one year, Iran would have the right to receive 120kg of material enriched to 20 per cent from Russia and France.         
	The terms mirror a deal with the West last October which fell apart when Iran backtracked.        
	This time, however, those same terms may be unacceptable to Washington and its partners because Iran has since increased its supply of nuclear fuel, experts said.        
	Iranian officials, however, applauded their success as a breakthrough. They said on state television that the next step would be to agree to terms for the exchange with the so-called Vienna Group of countries, including the US, and that they would send a formal letter confirming the deal to the International Atomic Energy Agency within a week.        
	This shows that Iran is not pursuing nuclear weapons and rather peaceful nuclear technology, said Ramin Mehmanparast, the foreign ministry spokesman in a news conference today.         
	Diplomats in Vienna said the IAEA had not been formally notified about the reported deal. But, the fact that Tehran had now agreed to a swap outside its own territory was potentially significant.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban responsible for raids: Terrorist
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Taliban responsible for raids: Terrorist
                                  
	Lahore, May 29 (PTI): One of the two terrorists arrested during yesterdays attacks on two mosques here has told investigators that the attackers had received training in the lawless Waziristan tribal belt and were working at the behest of the Pakistani Talibans Punjabi wing.        
	Abdullah Mohammad and Amir Muavia were captured after they stormed one of the two Ahamdi mosques in the upscale Model Town area of Lahore yesterday. Muavia was seriously injured when his suicide vest failed to detonate properly. Mohammad, 18, was captured by worshippers when he tried to detonate explosives strapped to his body.        
	We received training in Waziristan. Our commander is Badar Mansoor, who is based in south Punjab, Mohammad was quoted as saying by police officer (investigation) Zuliqar Hamid. He said Mohammad had said that the attackers were helped by the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.         
	Clarification        
	The Ameer Jamaat Ahmadiyya Kolkata has written to The Telegraph contradicting a report in Saturdays edition on the Lahore mosque hostage standoff that mentioned that Ahmadis consider their founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmed of Qadian, as their prophet. This, the report had said, goes against the belief of other Muslims.        
	The Ameer Jamaat said Ahmadis firmly believe and consider Hazrat Mohammed as their last and final prophet.        
	The association said: However, as mentioned in the Holy Quran and the Hadith and the prophecies of the Holy Prophet Mohammed, the promised Messiah and Imam Mahdi, (Mirza Ghulam Ahmed of Qadian) referred to as Ummati Nabi (subordinate prophet only), is regarded by Ahmadi Muslims only as his humble servant who has been appointed by Allah only to propagate and revive the Holy Prophet Mohammeds message strictly in accordance with the teachings of the Holy Quran and sayings of Prophet Mohammed.        
	The association added that as regards declaration of Ahmadis as non-Muslims by Pakistan, the teachings of the Holy Quran and Prophet Mohammed forbid Muslims from calling other Muslims who believe in the Kalima (there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and Mohammed is the messenger of Allah) as non-Muslims.

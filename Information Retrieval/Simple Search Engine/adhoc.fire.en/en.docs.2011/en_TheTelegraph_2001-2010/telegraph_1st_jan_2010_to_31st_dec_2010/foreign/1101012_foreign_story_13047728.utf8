The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Dawn of new age in stem cell treatment 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Dawn of new age in stem cell treatment 
          RICHARD ALLEYNE                              
	London, Oct. 11: A paralysed patient has become the first person in the world to receive treatment using human embryonic stem cells in a study described as the dawn of a new age of medicine.        
	The trial on a patient with severe spinal injuries is the first to test a treatment that has huge potential to cure disease and disability.         
	But it is also highly controversial and considered unethical among many Christian and pro-life groups.         
	The results of the procedure, carried out by privately funded US company Geron, will be awaited eagerly around the world by doctors and scientists working in regenerative medicines.         
	If a success, it could be the catalyst to open up stem cell treatments for all kinds of conditions from nerve damage, to Alzheimers disease to diabetes.         
	Professor Chris Mason, an expert in regenerative medicine at University College London, said it marked the dawn of the Stem Cell Age.         
	This pivotal clinical trial is a major morale boost for scientists, clinicians and most of all patients by finally commencing the transformation of stem cells from a scientific curiosity into advanced health care, he said.         
	Geron said that the patient had requested to remain anonymous and would not release any further details, even of age and sex.         
	However, to qualify for the study, he or she must have suffered a paralysing spinal cord injury no more than 14 days before being treated, otherwise it would not be so effective.         
	Millions of embryonic stem cells, which come from human embryos left over from fertility treatments, were injected into the damage area.         
	The hope is that they will travel to the site of a recent spinal cord injury and transform into damaged nerve cells and help the cord regenerate.         
	The Phase I trial, carried out at the Shepherd Centre in Atlanta, Georgia, will not be aiming to cure patients but to establish that the cells are safe to use and that there is no adverse side-effects.         
	Thomas Okarma, chief executive of Geron, said in a statement it was a milestone for the field of human embryonic stem cell-based therapies.         
	When we started working with human ES cells in 1999, many predicted that it would be a number of decades before a cell therapy would be approved for human clinical trials.         
	Embryonic stem cells are master cells found in human embryos, which give rise to more than 200 specialised types of tissue in the adult body, and can be grown into any kind of tissue to replace cells damaged by injury or disease.         
	Use of embryonic stem cells is controversial because they must be harvested from human embryos that are destroyed in the process.         
	This has raised moral objections from those who believe that embryos have the same rights as humans and see the treatment as unethical.

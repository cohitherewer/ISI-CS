	London, Sept. 8 (AP): British Prime Minister David Camerons father died in France today after suffering a stroke while on vacation, the leaders office said.        
	Cameron flew to a hospital in Toulon, on the French Riviera, to be at his 77-year-old fathers side, arriving shortly before he died, spokesman Steve Field said in London.        
	It is with deep regret we can confirm that Ian Cameron died earlier this afternoon. He passed away shortly after the Prime Minister arrived at the hospital in France where he was undergoing treatment, Camerons office said.        
	Camerons father had suffered a stroke and heart complications while on holiday in France, the statement said.        
	Field said Cameron planned to stay in France overnight, but remained in charge of British affairs.        
	Camerons father, a retired stockbroker, previously had had both of his legs amputated and used a wheelchair. In an interview before Britains election in May, Cameron described his fathers refusal to allow his disability to impede his life.        
	My father is a huge hero figure for me. Hes an amazingly brave man because he was born with no heels  quite a disability, Cameron told ITV television. I think I got my sense of optimism from him.

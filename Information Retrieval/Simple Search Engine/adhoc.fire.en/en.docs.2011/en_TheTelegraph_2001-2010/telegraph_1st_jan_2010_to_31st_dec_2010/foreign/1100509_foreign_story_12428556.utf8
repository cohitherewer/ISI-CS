	London, May 8: Swraj Paul stepped in today to defend his friend, Gordon Brown, but added that the Prime Minister would become an even greater friend should he choose to resign.        
	 Gordon Brown will not stay 15 minutes longer than necessary, said Paul. The industrialist who stood by Indira Gandhi at her lowest political point  this was after she had been defeated in the 1977 election that followed the 1975 emergency  said should Brown choose to resign, Gordon would become an even greater friend.         
	On the hung parliament, Paul said: This is truly a victory for the voters. For the first time, all the parties have been humbled. Paul castigated the medias coverage of Browns campaign: The media, which maligned Gordon and continue to malign him, have lost this election.        
	Paul said he expected another general election very soon but did not see a change in UK-India relations. He was personally a Labour man but pledged to continue to work to improve ties even if there was a change of government.

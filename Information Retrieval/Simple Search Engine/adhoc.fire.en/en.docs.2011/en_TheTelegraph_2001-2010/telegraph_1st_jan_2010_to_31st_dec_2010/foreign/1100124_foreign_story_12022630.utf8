	Houston, Jan. 23 (PTI): Tweeting is not for earthlings only. Now you can tweet even from space.         
	An American astronaut has for the first time sent a tweet from space after getting a personal Web connection on the International Space Station. Hello Twitterverse! We r now LIVE tweeting from the International Space Station  the 1st live tweet from Space! :) More soon, Creamer wrote.         
	Nasa said a software upgrade this week now allows its station crew personal Internet access and the ability to surf the Web through a wireless connection. When the high-speed communications are possible, astronauts will access a ground computer remotely from the orbiting outpost.         
	The astronauts already have access to official email.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kim son upset over succession
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Kim son upset over succession
                            
	Beijing, Oct. 12 (AP): The casino-loving eldest son of North Koreas Kim Jong Il  once tipped to succeed him before trying to sneak into Japan to go to Disneyland  says he opposes a hereditary transfer of power to his younger half-brother.        
	While his disapproval is unsurprising, its the first public sign of discord in the tightly choreographed succession process, though analysts said Kim Jong Nam has lived outside his native land for so long his opinion will carry little weight.        
	The chubby 39-year-old Kim, the oldest of three brothers who were in the running to take over secretive North Korea, is the closest thing the country has to a playboy.        
	He sports the family pot belly and favours newsboy caps, designer shoes and an unshaven face, while frequenting five-star hotels and expensive restaurants.        
	He told Japans TV Asahi that he is against third-generation succession, but I think there were internal factors. If there were internal factors, (we) should abide by them.        
	Kim Jong Un, 26, appeared with his father at Pyongyang celebrations on Sunday marking the 65th anniversary of the ruling Workers Party.

          PETER BAKER                          Senators John Kerry and Richard Lugar talk about the New Start treaty in Washington. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Dec. 22: An arms control treaty paring back American and Russian nuclear arsenals won a decisive vote in the Senate yesterday, clearing it for final approval and handing President Obama an important foreign policy victory.         
	The Senate voted 67 to 28 to end debate on the treaty, known as New Start, mustering the two-thirds majority needed for ratification despite a concerted effort by Republican leaders to sink the agreement. Eleven Republican senators joined every Democrat present to support the treaty, which now heads to a seemingly certain final vote of approval.         
	The outcome was another bipartisan victory for Obama, who emerged politically wounded from last months mid-term elections but then successfully pressed Congress to enact several of his top priorities.         
	New Start was the last major challenge of the session for Obama, and in some ways it was the clearest assertion of his authority in the face of an emboldened Republican Party.         
	Todays bipartisan vote clears a significant hurdle in the Senate, said Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Scissors are out in Savile row
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Scissors are out in Savile row
          JAMES HALL                          A mens tailoring store at Savile Row in London                                  
	London, May 11: Scissors at dawn on Savile Row.        
	The heart of the UKs tailoring industry is up in arms about plans by Moss Bros, the clothing chain, to sell bespoke suits.         
	Moss Bros  which is firmly positioned in the middle to lower end of the tailoring market (though it would claim otherwise)  will take suit-buyers measurements in-store, allow them to chose from a menu of cloth, cut and lining options, send the details to a factory in China, and have the suits delivered in four weeks. The suits will cost between 250 and 350.        
	What a load of old gabardine, say the traditional tailors of Savile Row.         
	According to Savile Row Bespoke, which represents the streets traditional tailors, the definition of bespoke is as follows: material has to be individually (rather than machine) cut, a customer needs three fittings, the garment must be hand-crafted under the supervision of a Master-Cutter, and the suit must be made within 100 yards of Savile Row.         
	Oh, and the average bespoke suit costs 3,000. Moss Bros  for fairly obvious reasons  falls sadly short of these criteria. It is a sad prostitution of the word bespoke. It is the same as B amp;Q offering bespoke kitchens when all they have done is put red knobs on, said Savile Row Bespokes chairman Martin Henderson (although he admits that it is not a bad business idea from Moss Bross point of view).         
	Alan Cannon Jones is senior lecturer in tailoring at London College of Fashion. He says that there is a lot of business potential in Moss Bross idea. He has recently been in Nepal, where factories offer the personalised service for overseas shoppers. However he splits the definition of bespoke even further.        
	Moss Bros could be offering a made-to-measure service, whereby customers chose from a menu  single or double breasted, one or four buttons, six styles of pocket etc  and they produce a suit. It is still a one-off, it is still produced for you, but it is not the same as bespoke.        
	The difference is subtle but it is there. It is like going into a very good restaurant and having a discussion with the Maitre d and chef about how you want fillet of sole and how you would like it cooked, rather than just choosing something from the menu, he says.        
	But beneath these semantics are we not simply dealing with case of dreadful snobbery? Surely Moss Bross only crime here is to democratise the tailoring process in the way that Topshop and Primark have done for female catwalk fashion?        
	Not quite, says Cannon Jones. In all likelihood, the Moss Bros bespoke suit will be equivalent to a made-to-measure Marks amp; Spencer suit. So we are talking good quality, rather than the equivalent of a 50 suit made in Thailand that lasts for just a week.        
	So, M amp;S quality. Not bad  but not quite a 3,000 suit either.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Wall Street hiring begins to look up
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Wall Street hiring begins to look up
          NELSON D. SCHWARTZ                              
	New York, July 11: Much of America remains fixated on the bleak employment picture, but hiring is beginning to pick up in the place that led the economy into recession  Wall Street.         
	The shift underscores the remarkable recovery of the biggest banks and brokerage firms since Washington rescued them in the fall of 2008, and follows the huge rebound in profits for members of the New York Stock Exchange.        
	Since employment bottomed out in February, New York securities firms have added nearly 2,000 jobs, a trend that is also playing out nationwide at financial companies, commodity contract traders and investment firms.         
	The figures are small in comparison to overall Wall Street employment but analysts expect the growth to pick up steam.         
	I think were seeing some hiring in anticipation of better times, said Rae Rosen, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Wall Street typically hires in anticipation of the recovery, and there is a sense that the economy has bottomed out and is slowly improving.         
	The increase in hiring and cautious optimism stand in sharp contrast to the mood among workers in other fields, where jobs have been slow to return or are disappearing altogether. It is also the opposite of what is going in other highly paid, white-collar professions like law, where employment nationwide in June was the lowest since late 2001.        
	The financial work force in New York has shrunk by more than 28,000 since its peak in January 2008, but is still slightly above its level in 2003 after the tech bubble burst, meaning it actually weathered this recession better than the previous one. Nationally, staffing is back to where it was in late 2005 while employment in the overall economy is near 2004 levels.         
	As hiring has picked up on Wall Street, salary packages recalling the boom years are reappearing at the most senior levels.         
	The offers are not near where they were in 2006, but there is still a war for talent, said Richard Stein, president of executive search firm Global Sage. Everyone thought the ice age had returned, but the thaw has come and were in catch-up mode.         
	Stein said corporate clients had offered compensation packages worth more than $1 million annually to 12 candidates in recent weeks.         
	The hiring is not just a local phenomenon. Major investment banks are quietly rebuilding their global work forces. Goldman Sachs added 600 jobs worldwide in the first quarter, while JPMorgans investment bank has hired slightly more than 2,000 people globally since the beginning of the year.         
	Closer home, Credit Suisses investment bank, based in New York, filled 600 positions in the first quarter, with a significant portion in New York. Deutsche Bank has hired 414 people in New York.

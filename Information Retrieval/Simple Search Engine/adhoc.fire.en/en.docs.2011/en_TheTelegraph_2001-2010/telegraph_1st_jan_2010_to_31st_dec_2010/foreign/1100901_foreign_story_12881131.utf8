	Los Angeles, Aug. 31 (PTI): When Paris Hilton was arrested for possession of cocaine, she claimed that the white bag in her purse contained nothing but chewing gum.         
	Hilton was booked into the Clark County Detention Centre on Saturday evening after her car was stopped by police on a Las Vegas street. The 28-year-old reality TV star was later released, People magazine reported.        
	She had not seen it but now thought it was gum, said an officers report.         
	However, Hiltons purse actually contained 0.8 grams of cocaine. She now faces drug-possession charges with an October 27 arraignment.         
	While speaking to the police after being stopped by a policeman who noticed marijuana smoke coming out from the car, Hilton denied that the bag belonged to her. In fact, she said, the purse was borrowed from a friend.         
	But somehow, according to Hilton, half the contents in the purse belonged to the socialite and her friend.        
	Following the drug bust, she claimed ownership of a broken Albuterol pill, Zig Zag wrappers commonly used to smoke marijuana, $1,300 in cash and credit cards.         
	But, she said several cosmetic items inside the purse were not hers, according to the police report.         
	In a post on Twitter, Hilton thanked her fans for their support.         
	Im so thankful to all my fans for all the love and support you are giving me. Thank you all. Love you so much. Love Paris, she wrote. This matter will be dealt with in the courts, not in the media, and I encourage people not to rush to judgment until all of the facts have been dealt with in a court of law, her attorney David Chesnoff said.

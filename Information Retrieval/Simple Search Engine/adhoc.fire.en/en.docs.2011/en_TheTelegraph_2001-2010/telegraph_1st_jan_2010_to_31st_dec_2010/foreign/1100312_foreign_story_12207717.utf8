The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pink Floyd wins Round 1
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pink Floyd wins Round 1
                            
	London, March 11 (Agenices): British rock band Pink Floyd won its court battle with EMI today with a ruling that prevents the record company from selling single downloads on the Internet from the groups concept albums.        
	The outcome of a dispute over the level of royalties the band received remained unclear, however, as that part of the judgment was held in secret. A source close to the band said talks were ongoing.        
	Lawyers said it was the first time a royalties dispute between artists and their record companies had been held in private, after EMI successfully applied for a news blackout for reasons of commercial confidentiality.        
	Experts said the ruling offers another brick in the wall supporting artists control of their own work -- and a boost for music fans dismayed by the power of online music retailers to slice and dice albums into individual tracks.        
	The ruling is the latest blow to EMI, the smallest of the four major record companies which is seeking new funds to avoid breaching debt covenants.        
	Pink Floyd signed with EMI over 40 years ago and its back catalogue has been outsold only by that of the Beatles.        
	The band, whose albums include The Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, went to court to challenge EMIs right to unbundle records and sell individual tracks online.        
	Judge Andrew Morritt accepted arguments by the group that EMI was bound by a contract forbidding it from selling records other than as complete albums without written consent.        
	The judge said the purpose of a clause in the contract, drawn up more than a decade ago, was to preserve the artistic integrity of the albums.        
	Pink Floyd alleged that EMI had allowed online downloads from the albums and parts of tracks to be used as ringtones.        
	EMI said the ruling was not an end to the complex case, and that the judges decision was not an order to stop selling single Pink Floyd tracks. They were still available individually from iTunes on Thursday.

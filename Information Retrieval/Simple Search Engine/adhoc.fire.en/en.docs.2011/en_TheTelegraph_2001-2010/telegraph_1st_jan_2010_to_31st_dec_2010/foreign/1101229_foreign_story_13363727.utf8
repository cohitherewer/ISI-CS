	Dec. 28: President Barack Obama and secretary of state Hillary Clinton were the most admired man and woman in the US in 2010, according to an annual USAToday-Gallup poll.         
	Obama led the field of male candidates with 22 per cent, followed by former Presidents George W. Bush (five per cent) and Bill Clinton (four per cent). They were followed by post-apartheid South African leader Nelson Mandela and Microsoft founder Bill Gates, each with two per cent.         
	Obama has held the title since 2008, after he won the election and became the first African-American President. That year he was the most admired by 32 per cent of those polled. Hillary Clinton held onto the title of most admired woman for the ninth straight year after largely dominating the poll over the last two decades.         
	This year she led with 17 per cent, followed by conservative former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin with 12 per cent and TV titan Oprah Winfrey with 11 per cent.         
	They were trailed by First Lady Michelle Obama with five per cent and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice with two per cent.

	Obama made the first public appearance of his vacation yesterday, stopping by one of his favourite local shops for a Hawaiian snow cone known as shave ice.         
	The President ordered a flavour combination of melon, lemon-lime and cherry at Island Snow, a store Obama has frequented during past trips.

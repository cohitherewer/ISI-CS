	Pokhara, Oct. 14 (AP): A Nepali fruit sellers son with the body of a toddler turned 18 today and was officially declared the worlds shortest man by officials of the Guinness World Records.        
	Khagendra Thapa Magar measures 26.4 inches (67cm). He has displaced former record holder Edward Nino Hernandez of Colombia, measuring 27 inches (70cm).        
	Cheers went up when Magar was handed world record certificate by Guinness official Marco Frigatti. The ceremony was held in a hotel in Pokhara, Magars hometown west of Kathmandu.        
	I can confirm that as of today Khagendra Thapa Magar is officially the shortest man in the world, Frigatti said as he handed over the certificate.        
	Magars family campaigned for years to get him the crown, but earlier requests were rejected because of the possibility that he might grow.

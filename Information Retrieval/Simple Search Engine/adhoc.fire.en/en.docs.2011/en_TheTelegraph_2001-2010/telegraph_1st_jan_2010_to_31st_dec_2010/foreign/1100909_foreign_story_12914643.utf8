The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US church defiant over Quran stunt
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US church defiant over Quran stunt
          DAVID ZUCCHINO                          Reverend Terry Jones at the Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida. (AP)                                  
	Sept. 8: The pastor of a tiny, fringe evangelical church in Florida yesterday rebuffed a plea for restraint from Gen. David H. Petraeus, who warned that a plan to burn the Quran could provoke violence against American troops and citizens overseas.        
	Instead of possibly blaming us for what could happen, we put the blame where it belongs  on the people who would do it, Pastor Terry Jones of the 50-member Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Florida, told the Associated Press. We should address radical Islam and send a very clear warning that they are not to retaliate in any form.        
	Jones also said he was still praying over his decision and hinted that he might change his mind. We understand the generals concerns and we are taking those into consideration, he told WOFL-TV in Orlando.        
	A coalition of Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders held a news conference in Washington yesterday to condemn Joness statements and other slurs aimed at Muslims nationwide.        
	The threatened burning of copies of the Holy Quran this Saturday is a particularly egregious offence that demands the strongest possible condemnation by all who value civility in public life and seek to honour the sacred memory of those who lost their lives on September 11, said a statement by religious leaders organised by the Islamic Society of North America.        
	Religious leaders warned that Muslims overseas would interpret extremists like Jones as reflecting mainstream American attitudes towards Muslims. In Afghanistan on Monday, protesters made a point of wrapping an effigy of Jones in an American flag before burning both the effigy and the flag.        
	Reaction in the Arab news media was more muted, with most commentators and government officials calling on US citizens to honour religious freedom and condemn Jones.        
	In Islamabad, actress Angelina Jolie, who is visiting Pakistan to highlight the plight of millions of people devastated by the countrys worst-ever floods, said she would never support any such plans. Of course not. Of course not, she told a news conference when asked if she supported Joness plans.        
	Jolie said she had hardly the words to express her opposition to burning someones religious text.        
	In India, the spokesperson of the Catholic Bishops Conference, Father Babu Joseph, said the Indian church has decided to appeal to Pope Benedict and President Barack Obama to stop the church from burning the Quran. The plan is totally against the tenets of Christianity and needs to be condemned by everyone who believes in Christ, he said.

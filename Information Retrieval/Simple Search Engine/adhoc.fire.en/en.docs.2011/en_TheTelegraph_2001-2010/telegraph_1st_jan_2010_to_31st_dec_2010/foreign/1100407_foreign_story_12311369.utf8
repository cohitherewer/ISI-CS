	Aniston retreat    
	 London, April 6 (PTI): Actress Jennifer Aniston is planning to buy a private tropical retreat like actor Johnny Depps Bahamas island in a bid to escape the paparazzi.      
	I am tempted to go somewhere ever further afield, somewhere they cant afford to station paparazzi. Id like Johnny Depps life. Hes so under the radar, said Aniston. The Pirates of the Caribbean star owns Little Halls Pond Cay in the Caribbean and frequently visits the island with his partner Vanessa Paradis and their two children.     
	Brave Kate    
	 London (PTI): Actress Kate Winslet braved the cameras for the first time after her much publicised split from filmmaker Sam Mendes as she took the couples young son out for a film. Winslet has hardly been seen in public since the split, reports the Daily Mail.      
	 The 34-year-old hid behind big dark sunglasses and clutched her six-year-old boy close to herself as she ran into a waiting car.     
	Grant role    
	 London (PTI): British actor Hugh Grant turned down the opportunity to star in Roman Polanskis latest film The Ghost Writer because he wanted to make romantic comedies, says the movies writer. Robert Harris, who adapted his own novel The Ghost for the big screen version, admits he originally wanted the Four Weddings and a Funeral star to play the part of the Prime Ministers ghostwriter, reports the Daily Express. I pushed for Grant because I wanted an everyman hero that I thought he could play.

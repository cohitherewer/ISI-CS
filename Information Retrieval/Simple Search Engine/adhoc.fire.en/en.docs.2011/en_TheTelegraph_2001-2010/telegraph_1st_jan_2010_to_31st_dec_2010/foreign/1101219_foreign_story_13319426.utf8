	New York, Dec. 18: Michelle Obama has set the US fashion world abuzz by wearing a second-hand dress to a Christmas celebration in Washington.         
	Michelle Obama is the first presidential wife in recent memory to wear a vintage outfit to a public event, according to seasoned observers. She donned a black 1950s frock made by the late American designer Norman Norelli, who is regarded as one of the most influential of his era.         
	The gown was bought from New York Vintage, Chelsea, for an estimated $2,500 . Jon Schneck, the co-owner of the shop, said he was truly honoured by Michelle Obamas choice.         
	Other dresses from our archive have been scheduled for use by the First Lady later this year, he told the Huffington Post. The event, a concert called Christmas In Washington, will be broadcast on American television during the weekend. Earlier this month, Michelle Obama was named by Vogue as one of the worlds best-dressed women, although her picks have sometimes provoked controversy.         
	A Naeem Khan gown she wore to a White House state dinner in May this year sparked a fashion debate over the colour nude. The description was criticised because it did not match Michelle Obamas actual skin tone.         
	However, critics praised her for the sequinned, strapless outfit.         
	A champion of young designers she wore a white Jason Wu gown for her first dance at the Presidential Inauguration in January 2009, while she is also known to favour the American high street chain J Crew, dressing her daughters in the label when their father Barack won the presidential election.

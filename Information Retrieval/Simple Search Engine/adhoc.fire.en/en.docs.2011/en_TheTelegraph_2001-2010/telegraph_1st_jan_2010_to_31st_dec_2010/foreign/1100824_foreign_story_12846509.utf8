	Amsterdam, Aug. 23 (AP): The monumental chestnut tree that cheered Anne Frank while she was in hiding from the Nazis was toppled by wind and heavy rain today.        
	The once mighty tree, now diseased and rotted through the trunk, snapped about 1 metre above ground and crashed across several gardens. It damaged several sheds, but nearby buildings  including the Anne Frank House museum  escaped unscathed. No one was injured.        
	Someone yelled: Its falling. The tree is falling, and then you heard it go down, said museum spokeswoman Maatje Mostart.         
	A global campaign to save the chestnut, widely known as The Anne Frank Tree, was launched in 2007 after city officials deemed it a safety hazard and ordered it felled. The tree was granted a last-minute reprieve after a battle in court.        
	The 150-year-old tree suffered from fungus and moths that had caused more than half its trunk to rot. Two years ago city workmen encased the trunk in a steel support system to prevent it from falling, but that failed under windy weather today.        
	Many clones of the tree have been taken, including 11 planted at sites around the US and 150 at a park in Amsterdam.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | You dont need a man, says Aniston
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      You dont need a man, says Aniston
          ANITA SINGH                          Aniston                                  
	Aug. 9: Jennifer Aniston says women no longer need a man in order to have a child.        
	In her latest film, The Switch, Aniston, 41, plays a single woman who uses a sperm donor to get pregnant. Women are realising it more and more  knowing that they dont have to settle with a man just to have that child, Aniston said.        
	Times have changed and what is amazing is that we do have so many options these days, as opposed to our parents days when you cant have children because you have waited too long. The point of the movie is: what is it that defines a family? It isnt the traditional mother, father, two children and a dog named Spot, she said.

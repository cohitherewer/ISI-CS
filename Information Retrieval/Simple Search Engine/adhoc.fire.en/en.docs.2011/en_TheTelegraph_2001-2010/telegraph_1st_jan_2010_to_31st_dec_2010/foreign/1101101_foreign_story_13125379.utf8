	Washington/Sana, Oct. 31: Airlines officials revealed that a parcel bomb had travelled on two passenger planes within West Asia before arriving in Dubai even as Yemen freed a woman held on suspicion of involvement in the plot to send parcel bombs on US-bound planes after her arrest sparked protests by fellow students.        
	A family member and a government official said the woman had been released. Another woman had used her name and ID. Authorities are looking for that woman, the government official said.        
	Yemeni police arrested the woman after tracing her through a telephone number she had left with a cargo company.        
	Dozens of students had staged a sit-in in the courtyard of Sana Universitys engineering faculty calling for her release.        
	The young woman was identified as 22-year-old Hanan al-Samawi, a student at the University of Sana.        
	Yemens President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, had said that Yemeni security forces had arrested her based on a tip from American officials.         
	The powerful bombs concealed inside cargo packages and destined for the US were expertly constructed and unusually sophisticated, the countrys officials said today, further evidence that al Qaidas affiliate in Yemen is steadily improving its abilities to strike on American soil.        
	Investigators said that the bomb discovered at the Dubai airport in the United Arab Emirates was concealed in a Hewlett-Packard desktop printer, with high explosives packed into a printer cartridge to avoid detection by scanners.         
	It had travelled on two passenger planes within West Asia before arriving in Dubai, a Qatar Airways spokesperson said.        
	As investigators on three continents conducted forensic analyses of two bombs ship-ped from Yemen and intercepted on Friday in Britain and Dubai, US officials said evidence was mounting that the top leadership of al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, including the radical American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, was behind the attempted attacks.        
	The wiring of the device indicates that this was done by professionals, said an official involved in the investigation. It was set up so that if you scan it, all the printer components would look right.         
	The bomb discovered in Britain was also hidden in a printer cartridge.         
	The terror plot broke publicly in dramatic fashion on Friday, when the two packages containing explosives and addressed to synagogues or Jewish community centres in Chicago were found. Later, American military jets escorted a plane to Kennedy International Airport amid concerns  which turned out to be unfounded  that there might be explosives on board.         
	American officials said their operating assumption was that the two bombs were the work of Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri, al Qaida in Yemens top bomb-maker, whose previous devices have been more rudimentary, and also unsuccessful. Asiri is believed to have built both the bomb sewn into the underwear of the young Nigerian who tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight last December 25, and the suicide bomb that nearly killed Saudi Arabias intelligence chief, Mohammed bin Nayef, months earlier.         
	The targets of the bombs remained in question.         
	Britains Prime Minister David Cameron said the parcel bomb intercepted in the UK was designed to explode while the plane was flying. The countrys home secretary, Theresa May, said that British investigators had also concluded the device was viable and could have exploded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fear grips Kandahar before US assault
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fear grips Kandahar before US assault

	Kandahar, March 27: American forces have begun operations to push back Taliban insurgents in this most important southern province, the birthplace and spiritual home of the Taliban, and a full-scale offensive is expected in the coming weeks.        
	But the Taliban have already turned Kandahar into a battlefield as they prepare for the operation, which American officials hope will be decisive in breaking the insurgencys grip on southern Afghanistan.        
	When American forces all arrive, they will encounter challenges larger than any other in Afghanistan. Taliban suicide bombings and assassinations have left this city virtually paralysed by fear. The insurgents boldly walk the streets, visit shops and even press people into keeping guns and other supplies in their houses for them in preparation for urban warfare, residents say.        
	The government, corrupt and ineffective, lacks almost any popular support. Anyone connected to the government lives in fear of assassination. Its few officials sit barricaded behind high blast walls. Services are scant. Security, people say, is at its worst since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001.        
	They are focusing on the city, said Hajji Agha Lalai, a provincial councillor and former head of the peace and reconciliation commission in Kandahar, who has extensive contacts with the Taliban. The Taliban want to show themselves to the world, to show, We are here, he said.        
	The intensifying Taliban campaign is a measure of the importance the insurgency places on Kandahar, where the bulk of the 30,000 additional American forces arriving this year are being deployed. That is a sign of its value to the Americans, too. The scale of the coming American offensive is expected to dwarf the recent operation in Marja, in neighbouring Helmand province, where 15,000 American, Nato and Afghan forces were deployed to secure an area much smaller than this provincial capital of 500,000 people.        
	American forces have been preparing for Kandahar since last year, building a presence around this city and along the border with Pakistan to try to secure the province.         
	But as a result, in the most important urban centre in southern Afghanistan, life has rapidly deteriorated, residents say.                  
	On March 13, suicide bombers killed 35 people, and the Taliban have issued repeated warnings that they are in the city and planning more attacks.        
	We do not feel safe in town, and even for the men it is dangerous to go out, said a female human rights worker who asked not to be named for fear of being singled out by the insurgents.        
	In the week before the bombings, officials said, the Taliban conducted a series of attacks on the police and other officials in the city, killing one or two police officers every night for several days and seizing their weapons.        
	A government official, the well-liked head of the provinces information and culture department, Abdul Majeed Babai, was gunned down on his way to work on February 24. He had received threats from the Taliban, who wanted him to leave his position, relatives said.        
	The Taliban can walk around, and government officials cannot, Hajji Lalai said.        
	The man nominally in charge of Kandahar province, Governor Tooryalai Wesa, sat alone in his office reading papers on a recent afternoon. The spacious lawns and rooms of his palace, thronged by tribal elders and petitioners a few years ago, stood empty and silent.        
	Outside the city, it is worse. Government services barely exist. Only 5 of 17 districts in the province are accessible for government officials.

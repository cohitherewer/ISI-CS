          WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM                              
	New York, May 15: The three Pakistani men detained by federal authorities who are investigating the failed Times Square car bombing came from varied backgrounds: one was a computer programmer, one a petrol station attendant and one a cab driver.        
	The men were taken into custody on Thursday as FBI agents and the local police executed search warrants on Long Island, in the suburbs of Boston and in New Jersey, as part of an effort to track the financing that bankrolled the unsuccessful attack, officials have said. They have not been charged in connection with any crime, but yesterday were still being held on administrative violations by federal immigration authorities.         
	Attorney-General Eric H. Holder Jr. said that investigators believed the three men had provided money to the naturalised Pakistani immigrant who admitted driving a SUV packed with a crude bomb to Times Square. But he said it was unclear if they knew the funds were going to be used for an act of terrorism.         
	One of the three men, Mohammad Shafiq Rahman, a computer programmer who was taken into custody in Portland, Maine, told his employer days earlier that he knew the accused would-be bomber, Faisal Shahzad, but had not seen him in nearly a decade. The connections between the other two men, Pir Khan, 43, who until recently drove a cab in the Boston area, and Aftab Khan, who worked in a petrol station in Brookline, and Shahzad were unclear.                    
	Mr. Rahmans employer, Larry Adlerstein, owner of Artist amp; Craftsman Supply         
	in Portland, said he was shocked that the authorities were interested in         
	his employee.              
	Mr. Adlerstein said he had asked his employee how he felt about all the         
	negative news about his native land.              
	Mr. Adlerstein recalled Mr. Rahmans saying, Its hard. As a matter of         
	fact I happen to know the guy accused of being the bomber in Times Square.         
	I havent seen him for eight or nine years, but back then he was a pretty         
	simple person, had no dogma, no theory, just went with the flow.               
	He said that Mr. Rahman added, So its hard for me to understand this,         
	but maybe thats what they look for, what terrorist organizations look         
	for.               
	Mr. Adlerstein said he hired Mr. Rahman about eight or nine months ago to         
	work as a computer programmer, after Mr. Rahman answered Mr. Adlersteins         
	Craigslist employment advertisement.              
	Pir Khan, a taxi driver, recently sold his medallion, said Pir Khans         
	brother-in-law, Fida Muhammed. (Pir Khan and Aftab Khan are not related.)              
	Pir Khan would often go to New York to pick up friends who recently arrived         
	from Pakistan and would drive them back to the Boston area, Mr. Muhammed         
	said.              
	Mr. Muhammed said that Aftab Khan was engaged to an American soldier he met         
	on a base in Kuwait and that they recently broke up.

	Island.

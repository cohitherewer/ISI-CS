The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Somali-born teen held in US bomb sting
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Somali-born teen held in US bomb sting
          LIZ ROBBINS                      Mohamed Osman Mohamud                                
	Nov. 27: A Somali-born teenager, trying to detonate what he believed was a car bomb in a packed downtown Portland Christmas tree lighting ceremony last night, was arrested by authorities, who had spent nearly six months tracking him and setting up a sting operation, officials in Oregon said.        
	The bomb in a van parked off the Pioneer Courthouse Square was a fake  planted by FBI agents at the culmination of the elaborate sting  but the threat was very real, said Arthur Balizan, special agent in charge of the FBI in Oregon. He identified the suspect as Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a 19-year-old naturalised citizen.        
	Our investigation shows that Mohamud was absolutely committed to carrying out an attack on a very grand scale, Balizan said in a statement released by the department of justice.        
	He added: At the same time, I want to reassure the people of this community that, at every turn, we denied him the ability to actually carry out the attack.        
	Thousands of people attended the tree lighting in a popular Portland square lined with shops and offices.         
	The foiled plot was just the latest jarring terrorist attempt aimed at mass gatherings in the US, including an attempted car bombing in Times Square this past May. In that case, a Pakistani-born American citizen was arrested and pleaded guilty.        
	This defendants chilling determination is a stark reminder that there are people  even here in Oregon  who are determined to kill Americans, Dwight C. Holton, US attorney for the district of Oregon said. Mohamud, a naturalised US citizen from Corvallis, Oregon, had been planning for more than a year to cause mass harm to a large and unsuspecting gathering of people  including children  in their own element, according to the affidavit.        
	Its in Oregon; and in Oregon, like, you know, nobody ever thinks about it, he is quoted as saying.        
	The authorities arrested Mohamud at approximately 5.40pm last night, 20 minutes before the ceremony, which was attended by 10,000 people, police said. He was taken into custody, kicking and screaming. He yelled, Allah-u- Akhbar, the authorities said.        
	According to the affidavit, Mohamud was in email contact with an unnamed associate in Pakistan in August 2009, who referred him to another an associate overseas. In June 2010, undercover agents FBI first got into contact with Mohamud, guiding him towards last nights event, but asking him repeatedly if he was prepared to commit the act, which would include the murder of children.        
	I want whoever is attending that event to leave, to leave either dead or injured, Mohamud said to undercover agents, according to the affidavit. He referred to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, calling the destruction awesome.        
	At the end of September, Mohamud mailed bomb components to whom he thought were fellow operatives assembling the device; instead, they were undercover agents. On November 4, the undercover agents travelled with Mohamud to a remote location in Lincoln County, Oregon, where they detonated a bomb as a trial run.        
	 Mohamud, who had told undercover agents that he had thought about committing jihad since he was 15, taped a statement that was a goodbye to his family and a rationale for his actions, the authorities said.         
	Yesterday afternoon, Mohamud again met the undercover agents and prepared to detonate the bomb in a parked van. But when he dialled a number from his mobile phone, thinking it would activate the bomb, he was instead arrested. Mohamud will appear in federal court in Portland on Monday, and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.        
	His arrest came a day after Americans celebrated the Thanksgiving holiday, and it was less than a year after a young Nigerian man was charged with attempting to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear aboard a passenger jet from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day.

	Theron date    
	 London, Dec. 7 (PTI): Actress Charlize Theron auctioned off a date with herself to raise money for charity and the prize went for a whopping $20,000.       
	Theron, who won a best actress Oscar for her role in Monster, hosted a dinner and charity auction benefiting the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project in New York. When guests began to bid on a pair of court-side tickets to watch the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, Theron, 35, offered to attend the game herself with the winner.       
	The bets got larger and larger, ending up at $20,000, reports the Daily Mail.

	 Los Angeles (PTI): Actress Uma Thurman gave a special treat to her favourite director Quentin Tarantino, a self-confessed foot-fetishist, by letting him drink champagne out of her stiletto. Thurman was the special guest at a function to honour Tarantino and decided there was no better way to celebrate than let him drink from her velvet heels.

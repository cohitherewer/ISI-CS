	Loren biopic    
	 Rome, March 15 (AFP): More than six million Italians tuned in for the first instalment of a television biopic of actress Sophia Loren in which she plays her own mother.      
	Lorens mother was a tenacious stage mum bent on ensuring stardom for her daughter. Presenting the film, La Mia Casa E Piena di Specchi (My House Is Full of Mirrors), at a news conference last week, Loren could not hold back the tears, saying: Things stay inside you, you never forget and you cant help it.      
	My life was a wonderful fairytale (but also) a story of war, hunger and begging, because thats what my mother did for us: she fought to give her daughters a name and a future that would not be poor.    
	Sandra guilt    
	London (PTI): Actress Sandra Bullock does not like shopping as she makes expensive purchases. Bullock, who won the best actress Oscar for her role in The Blind Side, feels pressured into buying expensive items she never wears.I love clothes, but I dont like to shop. Ive learnt from mistakes about the pressure in the store to pay exorbitant amounts for stuff that isnt right, and five years later its still in your closet with the tag on it. I have $900 guilt shoes.

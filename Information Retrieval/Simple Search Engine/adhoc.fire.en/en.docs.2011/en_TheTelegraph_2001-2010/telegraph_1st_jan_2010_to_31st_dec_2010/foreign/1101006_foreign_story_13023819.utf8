The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Twitter founder steps aside as CEO
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Twitter founder steps aside as CEO
          CLAIRE CAIN MILLER                                Evan Williams (Top) and Dick Costolo                                  
	Oct. 5: Evan Williams, the co-founder and chief executive of Twitter, is stepping down to lead product strategy at the company, Twitter announced yesterday. Dick Costolo, the chief operating officer, will succeed Williams.        
	The company, which announced the change in a blog post, is navigating a period of rapid growth and beginning to build an advertising business.        
	In the two years that Williams has been chief executive, Twitter has grown to 300 employees from 20; the services registered users have ballooned to 160 million from three million; and the company has started to generate revenue.        
	The news was unexpected. Though technology blogs had raised the question of whether Costolo would eventually become chief executive since he was hired a year ago, Williams had always insisted that he wanted the job. But yesterday, he and Costolo both said the decision was Williamss choice and that he wanted to get back to his roots, working on the product. The moves were effective immediately.        
	 Williams said in an interview that he realised he wanted to focus on product strategy while he was working on Twitters new website, introduced during the last month. I was reminded that maybe thats where my passion and skills lie, he said, and I couldnt focus on that as much as Id like.        
	Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures who is on Twitters board, said: Its a very smart and gutsy move for Evan to do so. He added that Costolo was more of a manager, more of an executive, more of a businessman than Williams.        
	Though the titles are new, Williams and Costolo had already divided many of their responsibilities along those lines. Costolo has been focusing on business development, like deals with Google and Microsoft, and revenue, including overseeing the introduction of Promoted Tweets.        
	Twitters new website was Williamss brainchild.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

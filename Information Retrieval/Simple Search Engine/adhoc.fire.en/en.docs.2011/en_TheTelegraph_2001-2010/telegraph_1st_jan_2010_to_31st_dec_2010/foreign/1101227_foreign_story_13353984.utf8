	Dec. 26: More than 1,200 troops from Britains Helmand taskforce sat down to turkey and all the trimmings served in customary Christmas style by their officers at their Camp Bastion headquarters outside Laskhar Gah on Saturday.         
	After a year in which insurgents have disrupted supply lines, the Royal Logistic Corps achieved a notable success delivering two tons of turkey; 1.5 tons of gammon; 1.5 tons of brussels sprouts; 440lb of cranberry sauce; 938 iced Christmas cakes; one ton of Christmas pudding; 45,000 After Eight mints and 15,000 mince pies to 9,500 troops across the country.         
	Lieutenant-Colonel David Eastman, at Lashkar Gah, said: The chefs did us proud. The dining hall was beautifully decorated, stars hanging down from the ceiling and we even had a snowman, a Christmas tree and Christmas crackers on the tables. Theyve done a great job.         
	On the menu: tomato soup for starters, a choice of turkey, beef or gammon, brussels sprouts, carrots, roast potatoes, mash, gravy, a selection of puddings and mince pies.         
	While most soldiers were tucking in, others were out on regular patrols. For those that cant make Christmas lunch today because they are out on operations, there will be a second lunch served on Boxing Day, said Eastman.         
	The lorries laden with food, presents from home and 22,500 Christmas boxes provided through donations to the charity UK4U Thanks! got through to British bases large and small  a contrast with 2008 when Taliban insurgents blew up several truckloads.         
	Brigadier James Chiswell, the commander of Helmand taskforce who spent the day touring bases, said: Our thoughts are particularly with the families of those who have lost their lives this year in Afghanistan. Taking on the good work of our predecessors, we have maintained a fearsome pace through the autumn and the insurgents finish this year under significant pressure. More importantly, the local people in Helmand are showing increasing confidence in their rejection of the Taliban. There is a tangible sense of progress.         
	More than 100 British troops have been killed in Afghanistan this year, after last years record toll of 105. However, as the American surge has progressed, the rate of British casualties has fallen dramatically in recent months.         
	Some soldiers stationed in remote bases scavenged turkeys from the local bazaar, cooked them in makeshift ovens fashioned from ammunition tins and served them up to the rest of their platoons.         
	Corporal Chris Chalmers, 30, from Thurso, a member of the Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, said: Being away from the family is always the hardest part of any operational tour but at Christmas, which is obviously such a special time for the kids, you can multiply that by 10. Most of us get a bit of a break on Christmas Day, but the operation doesnt stop for holidays.         
	The ministry of defence allotted 30 extra minutes of free call time for each soldier to phone their families.         
	After lunch on a sunny and considerably warmer day than that experienced by many British families, some of the troops joined in festive games such as pulling the sleigh, a variation of tug-of-war, and dodge the parcel.         
	The Band of the Parachute Regiment, on a morale-boosting tour, took over some guard duties at Camp Bastion to give the regular soldiers a break.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bill back in centre of Indo-US relations
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bill back in centre of Indo-US relations
          K.P. NAYAR                      Krishna with Clinton in Washington. (Reuters)                          
	Washington, June 3: Clinton is now at the centre of Indo-US relations! No, not Hillary, the US secretary of state, but the charismatic Bill, her husband, who was the 42nd president of America.        
	For eight full years, India had wiped Bill Clinton off the official agenda and screen of its relations with the US, glossing over contributions by him to a fundamental transformation of Indo-US relations in any statements by visiting Indian leaders to Washington, only reluctantly, if at all, referring to the former president in conversations with Americans in office here.        
	But external affairs minister S M Krishna today ended that distortion and restored balance to historys judgement of Indias ties with the US, opening the first Indo-US quot;strategic dialogue quot; with generous praise for Bill Clinton.        
	During the entire time that George W Bush was in office, Indians were fearful that any acknowledgement of Bill Clintons contribution to remaking Washingtons ties with New Delhi or any praise for the 42nd presidents state visit in 2000 which took India by storm would annoy Republicans, especially the more conservative ones among them in the Bush administration.        
	Bill Clinton continues to be a polarising figure domestically, even a hate figure for arch conservatives, but with Democrats back in office, Indians no longer fear praising him.        
	 quot;The relationship with the US is one of the most important bilateral relationships for India, quot; Krishna said in his opening remarks at the startegic dialogue, which has been relentlessly pushed to fruition by the former presidents wife, now the secretary of state.        
	 quot;Since the visit of president Clinton (to India) a decade ago, our two countries have been able to transform the relationship fundamentally quot;, Krishna told the meeting at which the Americans assembled some of the most powerful members of the Obama administration.        
	In addition to commerce secretary Gary Locke and FBI director Robert Mueller, the administration brought in top officials of its key agencies such as the national security council, the departments of education, energy and agriculture.        
	Krishna has also brought with him a team whose composition is intended to send a message to the Obama administration about the UPA governments commitment to the realisation of initiatives which were launched by prime minister Manmohan Singh and the White House, some of which remain incomplete.        
	Krishnas delegation includes human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, the deputy chairman of the planning commission, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the minister of state for science and technology, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao and the environment secretary, Vijai Sharma.        
	Like Krishna, Hillary Clinton also referred to her husbands role as president in the transformation of Indo-US relations. quot;India holds a special place in the minds of Americans, including me, quot; she said in her remarks.        
	She went on to talk about her first visit to India 15 years ago and the impact it had on her as first lady then. It is widely believed here that it was Hillary who actually persuaded her husband to take an interest in India after her trips, culminating in the first presidential visit to New Delhi in 22 years.        
	Today, she said nothing to contradict that belief: in fact, her remarks were constructed so as to let that legend live on. She cautioned against the recent tendency to underplay the outcomes of Indo-US engagement by warning that todays strategic dialogue was not aimed at producing big headlines.        
	Next year when the two teams meet again in New Delhi for the next round of dialogue the quot;real results quot; of what has been started today will be seen, the secretary of state said. Krishna used the open segment of the strategic dialogue to boldly demand in public that quot;the logical next step quot; in Indo-US counter-terrorism cooperation was for America to provide India with access to David Headley, a Pakistani-American who has pleaded guilty in a Chicago court to working with the terrorist organisation, Lashkar-e-Taiba, in planning attacks in Mumbai.        
	Unexpectedly, Krishna referred to an aborted terrorist attack in New Yorks Times Square a few weeks ago that was plotted by a Pakistani American and said quot;though the epicentre of this (terrorist) threat lies in Indias neighbourhood, it reaches far and wide all across the world. quot;        
	Krishna hinted at double standards in US counter-terrorism policies of being less concerned about terrorists who target other countries -- India, in this case -- and being obsessed about terrorists who target America.        
	 quot;Targeting only one or other of such groups would only provide false comfort in the short term and will not usher in long term stability, quot; he told the US side at the dialogue.

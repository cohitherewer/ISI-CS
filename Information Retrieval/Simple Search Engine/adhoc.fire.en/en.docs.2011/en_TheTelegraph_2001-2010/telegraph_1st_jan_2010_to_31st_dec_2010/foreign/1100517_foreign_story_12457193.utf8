The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thailand rejects rebels talks offer
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Thailand rejects rebels talks offer

	Bangkok, May 16 (Reuters): Thailand took a tough stand against anti-government protesters today, rejecting demands for UN supervised talks and calling on their leaders to surrender on the fourth day of clashes with troops.        
	The government doused hopes of a compromise to end fighting that has killed at least 31 people, all civilians, and wounded 230, transforming one of Asias most dynamic cities into a battleground and raising the risk of a broader conflict. We cannot retreat now, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said in a televised statement, encapsulating the governments all-or-nothing campaign to end two months of protests seeking to topple his fragile, ruling six-party coalition.        
	The mostly rural and urban poor protesters, supporters of ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra, accuse Abhisit of colluding with the royalist elite and meddling with the judiciary to bring down two Thaksin-allied governments.        
	Unless the government cracks down and does so decisively, and thats a big if, we are going to be seeing rioting and guerrilla warfare, possibly spreading out to other areas, said an Asian diplomat who declined to be identified.        
	That was already starting to happen.        
	A state of emergency has spread to more than a quarter of the country after emergency decrees were declared in five more provinces today, bringing the total to 22, as violence erupted in the north and northeast, a Thaksin stronghold, home to just over half of Thailands 67 million people.        
	In Ubon Ratchathani province, protesters burnt tyres on the roads. One group tried to break into a military compound but were forced back by soldiers firing guns in the air.        
	A red shirt leader, Nattawut Saikua, called for a ceasefire and UN moderated talks to end the violence. We have no other condition, he said.        
	But the government dismissed the offer. If they really want to talk, they should not set conditions like asking us to withdraw troops, said Korbsak Sabhavasu, the prime ministers secretary-general.

	London, May 30 (PTI): Disney star Miley Cyrus love life is on a roll. She is enjoying the company of two boyfriends at 17.        
	 The Hannah Montana star says shes spoilt for choice dating Australian hunk Liam Hemsworth and pint-sized singer Justin Bieber, The Sun online reported.         
	I have my travel-size boyfriend and I have my oversized security boyfriend. Its perfect, Cyrus said. Miley should be careful if she wants to avoid the Bieber fan brigade.

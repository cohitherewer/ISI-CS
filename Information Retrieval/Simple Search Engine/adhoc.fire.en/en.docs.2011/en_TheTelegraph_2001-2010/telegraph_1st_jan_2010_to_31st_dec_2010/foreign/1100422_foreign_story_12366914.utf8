	Bruni movie    
	 Los Angeles, April 21 (Reuters): French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy will appear in a new Woody Allen movie that starts shooting in Paris in the summer, sources close to the production told Reuters yesterday.      
	The movie will also star French Oscar winner Marion Cotillard and Hollywood actors Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams.      
	The title, release date and Bruni-Sarkozys role are expected to be announced later this week.      
	Allen, one of Americas most prolific film writers and directors, said last year that he would like to use the former supermodel in one of his films but at that time he did not have a story for her.      
	Bruni-Sarkozy, 42, who married French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, appeared briefly on the big screen as herself in Robert Altmans 1994 satire Pret-a-Porter.

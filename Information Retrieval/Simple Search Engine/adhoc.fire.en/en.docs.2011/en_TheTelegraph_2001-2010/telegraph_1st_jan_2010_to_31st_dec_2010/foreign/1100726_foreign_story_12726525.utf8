The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hayward quit buzz in BP
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hayward quit buzz in BP
                            
	London/Houston, July 25 (Reuters): British Petroleum has decided chief executive Tony Hayward should step down over his handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and his departure could be announced in the coming days, sources close to the company said today.        
	The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that if BPs board approves Haywards departure as expected, managing director Bob Dudley would replace him as the CEO.        
	As the boardroom drama intensified, clearing weather in the spill zone allowed work to resume on drilling a relief well to plug the leak that has been spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico for the past three months.        
	A Transocean Ltd rig was reconnecting equipment, a BP spokesperson said. Other vessels that had left the region late on Friday, to get out of the path of what was tropical storm Bonnie, were also returning.        
	BPs board will discuss the timing of Haywards exit when it meets tomorrow to review the companys second-quarter results ahead of their release on Tuesday.        
	The details are being worked out, a source said.        
	The London-based company could announce on Tuesday that Hayward will stand down, after a handover period.

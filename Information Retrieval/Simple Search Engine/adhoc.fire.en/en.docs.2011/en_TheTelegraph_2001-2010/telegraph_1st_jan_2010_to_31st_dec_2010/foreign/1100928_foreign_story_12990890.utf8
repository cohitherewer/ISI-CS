The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Dati goes red after sex gaffe
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Dati goes red after sex gaffe
                              Dati: Spoke too fast                            
	Sept. 27: Rachida Dati, Frances former justice minister, is battling to rebuild her reputation after making an embarrassing sex gaffe in a television interview about the economy.        
	Dati said she had made the slip, which has since become an Internet hit, because she was trying to speak too fast. I just spoke too quickly but, well, if that lets everybody have a laugh, then thats fine, she said in a radio interview today.        
	 More than 100,000 people have watched the clip of Dati confusing oral sex with inflation after it was posted online yesterday.        
	The original gaffe was made in an interview with Canal Plus as she launched an attack on foreign investment funds.        
	When I see some of them looking for returns of 20 or 25 per cent, at a time when fellatio is close to zero, and in particular in a slump, that means we are destroying businesses, she said.        
	French website Lepost.fr posted the clip and said by early evening it had been viewed 120,000 times.        
	It was then posted on various other video-sharing sites such as YouTube and Daily Motion.        
	The French for fellatio is fellation, which shares some syllables with inflation, which in French is the same as in English.        
	Dati was dropped from the French government last year after her penchant for designer dresses and appearing on the covers of celebrity magazines prompted criticism that a senior minister should not engage in such frivolity.        
	She is now a member of the European parliament and mayor of Pariss affluent 7th arrondissement.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Alcohol, drug curbs on Lohan
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Alcohol, drug curbs on Lohan
                            
	Beverly Hills, May 24 (Reuters): A Beverly Hills judge today ordered Lindsay Lohan to undergo random drug and alcohol testing and wear an alcohol monitoring device, brushing aside objections that they would hinder an upcoming film project.        
	Judge Marsha Revel imposed the new conditions after Lohan failed to show up for a probation hearing last week in a 2007 drunken driving case. The judge also ordered a hearing in July.        
	Lohan, who appeared in court 10 minutes late today, looked nervous and was dressed demurely in a white shirt and black pant suit. She claimed her passport was stolen in France last week, preventing her from meeting last Thursdays court date. Lohan returned to Los Angeles on Saturday after a week at the Cannes film festival.         
	Lohan agreed to the new conditions after her lawyer initially said they would interfere with a planned photoshoot and an upcoming movie to be filmed in Texas. I am afraid she is going to have to delay them, Revel said.She needs to submit to random testing here, not in Texas.

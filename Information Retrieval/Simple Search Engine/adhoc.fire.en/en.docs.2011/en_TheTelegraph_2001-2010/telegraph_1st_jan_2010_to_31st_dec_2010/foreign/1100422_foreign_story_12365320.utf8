	London, April 21: Many young people prefer exchanging text messages to having an actual conversation, with one in three teenagers sending more than 100 texts a day.        
	Text messaging has become the preferred method of communication for young people above face-to-face conversations, telephone calls and social networking websites, a new study has revealed.        
	It said teenagers enjoy being able to have a conversation with someone without speaking to them directly, and can do so thanks to the wide range of cheap mobile phone deals offering an unlimited number of text messages.        
	The study, by the Pew Research Centre in Washington DC, found that texting among American teenagers had risen dramatically since as recently as 2008. It found that female teenagers send an average of 80 text messages a day, while the average boy will send 30.

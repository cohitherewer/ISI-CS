The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Season of giving in DC kitchen
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Season of giving in DC kitchen
          LUBICA HAUSWALDOVA                      People eat a Christmas holiday meal at the Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen in New York   on Friday. (AFP)                                
	The land of plenty is no longer so for many Americans. Lubica Hauswaldova spends time in a Washington DC soup kitchen         
	I ran through the instructions once more and prepared my prescribed attire: long pants, closed shoes (no sandals), shirt with sleeves (no sleeveless tops and no bare midriff) and head cover.         
	My morning destination: Washington DC Central Kitchen. While walking from the metro station, two homeless men huddling in the morning cold saw me looking for something and shouted cheerfully: DC Kitchen? I nodded and they showed me the entrance at the back of a nearby parking lot.        
	Although they hold their begging cups they dont ask me for any money. I feel they already appreciate the fact that I am going to volunteer my time and work for the hungry and needy.        
	These are very difficult times for many in America. Official unemployment rate is still hovering just under 10 per cent, real rate is probably much higher and many unemployed workers have already exhausted all their benefits.         
	Thousands and thousands of people have lost their homes, many families live in shelters, huge numbers of Americans live in tent cities around towns and many are homeless. And this is the holiday season: season of giving, season of sharing.        
	All of us volunteers, 25 on that day, gather in the small dining room 15 minutes before our volunteer shift. There is a bigger group of employees from a pharmaceutical company and several individual volunteers.         
	Amanda is a student, aspiring dietician, who has already history of volunteering both at home and in Africa, Jason went through some bad times himself and wants to help others in need, some feel it is a religious duty.        
	First we get a short introduction to the kitchen activities: staff of the kitchen, culinary job trainees and volunteers prepare 4,500 meals every day from approximately 1300kg surplus food donated by local food businesses, grocery stores and local farms.         
	Some meals are directly served to the homeless, some are distributed to shelters, transitional homes and rehabilitation clinics in the Washington capital region.        
	However, the kitchen is not only about handing out food. It provides an opportunity for rehabilitation and culinary job training for people once homeless, disadvantaged, former prison inmates and other socially handicapped and gives them a chance to break away from their hopeless past.         
	Once they complete the programme they have better prospects of finding a job in local hotels, restaurants, catering companies and other food related businesses.        
	Then we go to work.        
	First we have to thoroughly wash our hands. Everybody gets a white apron, rubber gloves and a hair net. Even for one completely bald man. Rule is a rule. We have to remove everything that could fall into the food: watches, hanging earrings, brooches, pins. They divide us into smaller groups.         
	I am dispatched with two other women to the vegetable chopping station. Huge cheerful man in black uniform, a culinary trainee, brings a big box of celery. With skilful moves he cuts off the root part, washes the stems and with incredible speed chops the stalks into thin pieces. This is what we are to do as well: cleaning, chopping, filling big plastic containers. I see Amanda across the counter with piles of carrots in front of her. She smiles at me.        
	At the moment we think we got rid of all that celery and filled the containers, the smiling giant brings another big box of celery. And then another one. Then comes the cauliflower. Boxes are obviously from some grocery chain and the cauliflower could not be sold as it shows that its shelf life was coming to an end. First we have to remove black and brown spots . Then again: chop and fill the containers.        
	When I am finally coming to grips with this work and handle an extremely sharp knife really well I can have a look around. Another trainee is stirring some dark orange liquid in a huge vessel right behind me. I see some turmeric spilled around and look into the pot. He smiles: Squash soup.         
	Two male volunteers are handling piles of potatoes. Some are de-boning chickens. Others are opening innumerable cans of chickpeas. Two trainees are already cooking some of the carrots and capsicums. I see mountains of rice.        
	I and my two fellow-choppers break up the last cauliflowers and get perhaps hundreds of bunches of spring onions. They are also on their last legs. Remove the rotten parts, wash, chop. Remove the rotten parts, wash, chop. Repeat, repeat, repeat again.        
	And suddenly its over. End of shift. Time has passed so fast! It seems unbelievable, just the piles of chopped vegetables show that some really hard work had been done. I have never chopped so much celery, cauliflower and onions in my life. Neither any other vegetable for that matter.        
	Happy smiles. Some handshakes. We remove the nets, aprons and gloves. Everybody is invited to the dining room again to share a meal prepared by previous shift. Food that will be served to the hungry and needy as well: thick soup with pieces of meat and vegetables, roasted chicken, yellow corn, macaroni and green salad.         
	There is a desert, too: grocery type of pie whose shelf life was nearing the expiry date. No, it is not a gourmet fare. But its warm, fulfils basic nutritional requirements, its filling and it tastes reasonably good. Actually very good, because one can feel loving hearts and caring hands that went into the preparation of this food.

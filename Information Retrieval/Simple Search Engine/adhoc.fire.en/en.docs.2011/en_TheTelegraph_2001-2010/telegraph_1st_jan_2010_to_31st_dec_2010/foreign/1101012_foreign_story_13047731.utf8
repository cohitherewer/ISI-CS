	Geneva, Oct. 11 (AP): Soprano Joan Sutherland, whose purity of tone and brilliant vocal display made her one of the most celebrated opera singers of all time, has died at 83 after a four-decade career that won her praise as the successor to legend Maria Callas.        
	Her family said she died yesterday at her home near Geneva after a long illness.        
	Tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who joined Marilyn Horne in Sutherlands farewell gala recital at Covent Garden on December 31, 1990, called her the greatest coloratura soprano of all time. The term, derived from colour, refers to a soprano with a high range and the vocal agility to sing brilliant trills and rapid passages.

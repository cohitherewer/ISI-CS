	Depp skirts    
	 Los Angeles, March 1 (PTI): Actor Johnny Depp likes wearing skirts.       
	The actor portrays the Mad Hatter in Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland with a Scottish accent, and says he particularly enjoyed one scene where he got to wear a kilt, the national dress of Scotland.      
	The Scottish accent was something I did mess around with on Finding Neverland. That was a bit more Aberdeen, and Tim Burton and I talked about the Hatter being made up of different people and going to extremes  dark and dangerous with the Scottish accent. I hope I arrived there. And I like wearing skirts too! Depp said.     
	Cool Naomi    
	 London (PTI): Supermodel Naomi Campbell has admitted that her previous wild behaviour was a mistake and she is now maturing with age. The British beauty has a string of convictions adorning her past, including assaulting police officers and a housekeeper. But the 29-year-old star, who is making news with her charity work these days, has now claimed that she has learned form the previous mistakes, reports the Daily Mirror.    
	Rocker bio    
	 London (PTI): Rocker Joan Jett was impressed by the professionalism of actress Kristen Stewart who plays her in the new movie The Runaways. The 19-year-old Twilight star plays the rocker in the biopic about the 70s band of the same name and was so authentic in her portrayal that Jett thought it was as good as her mirror image. I found Kristen to be through and through totally professional and just great to be around. I found us to be really, scarily similar, said the singer.    
	Spears fun    
	London (PTI): Britney Spears seems to believe the old adage  blondes have more fun  as she has gone back to her trademark golden locks, after a few months as a brunette. The popstar entered a salon in Los Angeles as a brunette and hours later she left as a blonde, reported Daily Mail online. Spears covered her face with huge Christian Dior glasses as she dashed to her car after the lengthy salon stint.     
	Goofy star    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Actor George Clooney reportedly builds up an automatic connection with his female co-stars while filming who cant help feeling an attraction towards him. The 48-year-old actors Up In The Air co-star Vera Farmiga is all praises about him and has said that it is impossible not to have chemistry with him on the sets. Hes a goofball. Hes a clown. Its just so good to be in his presence.

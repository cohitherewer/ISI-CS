          MATTHEW MOORE                          Employees work at the Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California. (AP)                                  
	June 16: A new website allows anyone to trawl through embarrassing and indiscreet status updates posted by Facebook users.        
	The Openbook (http://youropenbook.org) search engine scans all public updates left by members of the social networking site, meaning that messages intended for small circles of friends can be read by everyone on the Internet.        
	The website has been established to highlight Facebooks complex privacy settings, which have been blamed for confusing users into disclosing more personal information than they intend. Searching Openbook for potentially compromising terms like sex, boss or drunk throws up thousands of updates from the past few hours.        
	While many Facebook members will have made a conscious decision to set their updates to public, Openbooks creators say that a large proportion may not be aware that their messages can be read by anyone online.        
	 The privacy campaigners hope that presenting the information in a searchable format on a single site will make social network members think twice about how much they share.

          ALAN COWELL                          Brown in London. (AFP)                                  
	London, Jan. 7: Months before a national election, Prime Minister Gordon Brown appeared today to have survived an attempt to unseat him by two senior figures in the governing Labour Party who issued an unusual appeal for a secret ballot on his leadership.        
	But the episode revealed a surprisingly tepid level of support for Brown among ministers who rallied belatedly to his side after the dissidents  former cabinet ministers Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon  said in a letter to Labour lawmakers that their party was deeply divided over his tenure.        
	Late yesterday, Hoon acknowledged on BBC television that the attempt to force a secret ballot  the third challenge to Browns position since he took power more than two years ago  had failed. He described the manoeuvre as an opportunity that Labour MPs by and large have not taken.        
	British newspapers today dwelled on the apparent reluctance of some cabinet ministers to support Brown, who faces a catalogue of woes ranging from recession at home to criticism of his handling of the war in Afghanistan. The BBC said up to six cabinet ministers may have harboured unspoken sympathies for the attempt to topple him.        
	In The Guardian newspaper, columnist Jonathan Freedland called the outcome a bittersweet kind of relief.        
	Yes, the plotters may have exposed their own weakness and may soon look like a spent force, he wrote. But Brown too has been wounded and weakened once again  just when he and Labour needed to gather their strength to fight the enemy beyond.        
	The dissidents letter said continued speculation and uncertainty about Browns leadership is allowing our opponents to portray us as dispirited and disunited. It is damaging our ability to set out our strong case to the electorate. It is giving our political opponents an easy target.        
	In a radio interview yesterday, Hewitt, a former health secretary, declared: This is not an attempted coup. Its exactly what we say in the letter  its an attempt to get this matter sorted out once and for all.        
	But the letter highlighted disarray in Labour ranks at a time when the party is fighting to stave off a widely forecast defeat in an election expected by next June that would end a 13-year stretch in power since Tony Blairs resounding victory in 1997.        
	The dissidents mounted their challenge only days after Labour and the Opposition Conservatives began unofficial campaigning for the national election. Brown learned of the putative revolt as he headed for parliament to face the Conservative leader David Cameron in a weekly verbal joust called Prime Ministers Questions.        
	In response to the letter, Brown yesterday mustered the support of the more influential members of his cabinet, notably the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling; the home secretary, Alan Johnson; and the foreign secretary, David Miliband. But some statements of support were widely interpreted by British analysts as lukewarm.        
	Miliband, often depicted in British newspapers as a potential successor to Brown, issued his statement of support only seven hours after the dissidents letter was circulated. I am working closely with the Prime Minister on foreign policy issues and support the re-election campaign for a Labour government that he is leading, Miliband said.        
	Lord Peter Mandelson, the business secretary and a key power broker in Browns camp, said late yesterday it was the settled view of the Labour Party that they want Gordon Brown to remain as their leader, which is why todays events didnt exactly catch on.

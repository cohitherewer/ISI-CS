	San Francisco, Nov. 16: Since the heyday of AOLs cheery Youve got mail greeting, email has been central to the online experience for millions of people.        
	But Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, says email is showing its age.        
	In his view, email is too slow, too formal and too cumbersome, especially for young people who have grown up using text messages and online chats.        
	Yesterday, Zuckerberg introduced a new unified messaging system for Facebook that allows people to communicate with one another on the Web and on mobile phones regardless of whether they are using email, text messages or online chat services.        
	We dont think a modern messaging system is going to be email, he said.        
	The new service, Facebook Messages, is a bold move by Facebook to expand from a social network into a full-fledged communications system.         
	It could help the company chip away even more at Internet portals like Google, Yahoo, MSN and AOL, which have used email as one of their main draws with consumers.

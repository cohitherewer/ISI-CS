The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Labour MP Ashok Kumar found dead
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Labour MP Ashok Kumar found dead
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, March 15: MPs from all parties expressed shock today at the sudden death of Dr Ashok Kumar, 53, Labour member of parliament for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, whose body was found at his home today.        
	The circumstance of his death have not been explained except that it is understood he was not unwell.        
	In January this year, Kumar, a research scientist who had worked for British Steel for many years before being elected to parliament in 1997, spoke to The Telegraph, expressing his determination to fight to prevent the mothballing of the Tata-owned Corus plants in Teeside.        
	He also turned up shortly afterwards in a committee room of the Commons to hear Jaswant Singh talk about his book on Jinnah. Kumar joined in the question and answer session and left before the meeting ended.        
	 Police were called to an address on Canberra Road in Marton, Middlesbrough, at 12.30pm today, Monday 15th March, a spokesman for the Cleveland force said.        
	Officers entered the property and found the body of a man in his 50s. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. At this stage it is too early to say whether the death is being treated as suspicious and inquiries are ongoing.        
	Staff, who are believed to have raised the alarm after being unable to reach the MP by telephone, said the news had come as a huge shock.        
	A statement issued by his office said: It is with great regret that we learned this morning that Ashok has passed away. He was found at home. His family have been informed. We all mourn our loss and all our thoughts are solely with his family at this tragic time.        
	The MP, who was born in Haridwar on May 28, 1956, was single.        
	When talking to The Telegraph about Corus, he said Gordon Brown, whom he had met, had promised to telephone Ratan Tata to discuss if there was any way the Corus plants could be rescued. Their closure would mean the loss of 1,700 jobs, while the livelihood of around 8,000 people down the supply chain could also be affected.        
	 The Prime Minister said, I have no problems picking up the phone and talking directly to Ratan Tata but first I need to do some sums, Kumar told The Telegraph.        
	 It was clear Kumar was depressed about the prospects for saving the steel plants. Many of my constituents work at the Redcar plants in Teeside. As a graduate trainee I worked at Redcar and later for 14 years, when I was with British Steel, I had a lot to do with the steel plants in Teeside.        
	He said he was prepared to fly to India to meet Tata if that helped and offered to keep The Telegraph informed of developments.        
	Fellow Labour MP Keith Vaz, chair of the Ethnic Minority Taskforce, were among those who paid tribute to Kumar. I am shocked at Ashoks death. He has been a wonderful loyal friend and colleague and only the fifth person of Asian origin to be elected since the war. He will be greatly missed.        
	Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: I was greatly saddened by the sudden death of Ashok Kumar. Ashok was a hard-working constituency MP who took pride in representing the people of Middlesbrough as both a councillor and MP since 1987. He was a tenacious campaigner for his constituents and a warm and incredibly generous man. I first met him at the by-election in 1991 and, although he lost his seat in 1992, it was a pleasure to welcome him back to Parliament in 1997. His long-standing campaigns to keep shipbuilding in Teesside were respected by all sides of the House.        
	 Former prime minister Tony Blair, who until his resignation was a fellow North East MP, added his tribute: Ashok Kumars sudden death is a genuine tragedy and source of real sadness. Ashok was a dedicated and committed local Member of Parliament, representing Middlesbrough with a real passion and determination to serve the community he was from. As a neighbouring MP I saw first hand his commitment to the North East where the support he received grew year after year. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this time.        
	A uniformed police officer stood on guard outside Kumars home, a 1930s-style semi-detached house. The front window curtains were drawn and a blue Rover 75 was parked on the driveway.

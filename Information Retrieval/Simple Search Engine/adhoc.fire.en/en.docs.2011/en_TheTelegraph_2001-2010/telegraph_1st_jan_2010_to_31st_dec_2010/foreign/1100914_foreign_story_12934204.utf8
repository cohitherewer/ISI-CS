The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | I am loaded, says Silvio
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      I am loaded, says Silvio

	Rome, Sept. 13 (AP): Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi said young women should follow the money when looking for a partner, noting that women seem to like him and Im loaded.        
	Berlusconi, who was embroiled in a sex scandal last year and is known for his gaffes, also raised eyebrows with a joke about Hitlers followers urging him to return to power.        
	The billionaire businessman appeared at a convention yesterday of the youth wing of his People of Freedom party. When questioned by one of his cabinet ministers  a woman  he joked about marriages of convenience, saying women were lining up for him because Im a nice guy and Im loaded.        
	He also recalled a much-criticised TV interview he once gave, when I said to a girl to look for a wealthy boyfriend. This suggestion is not unrealistic.        
	He also claimed women favour older men, thinking that hes old. He dies and I inherit.        
	The 73-year-old Berlusconi was engulfed in a sex scandal last year centering on his purported dalliances with young women, including an escort. Berlusconis wife Veronica Lario said last year she was seeking a divorce. They are now separated.        
	The media baron has said he is no saint but denied ever paying for sex.        
	In Italy, a divorce can only be sought after three years of separation. Media reports this summer suggested that Berlusconis wife has rejected his early proposals for a financial settlement.        
	Berlusconi often gets criticised for his earthy sense of humour, and this time an Opposition politician demanded he apologise to Italys Jewish community for his Hitler joke. Before telling it, he said: I already know I am going to be criticised.        
	Berlusconi, who claims prosecutors have led corruption investigations against him because they are Left-wing, also appeared to be poking fun at himself when commenting on the loss of his AC Milan soccer team on Saturday.         
	He contended the referee robbed the team of three goals and that Milan often gets Leftist referees.        
	Critics say the debate is not just about sex, but reflects an inattention to Italys deep problems, like the economy, or reconstruction after the earthquake that left 70,000 people homeless in central Italy.         
	The leader of one Opposition party compared Berlusconi to Nero, fiddling while Rome burned.        
	In the summer of 2010, Berlusconis government faced the most serious political crisis since it was elected in 2008.         
	After weeks of tension, Berlusconi split with Gianfranco Fini, one of his major allies, weakening Italys center-right governing coalition and raising the possibility of early elections.        
	The crisis came after weeks of byzantine intrigue centred on judicial investigations of corruption that have focused on other Berlusconi allies.

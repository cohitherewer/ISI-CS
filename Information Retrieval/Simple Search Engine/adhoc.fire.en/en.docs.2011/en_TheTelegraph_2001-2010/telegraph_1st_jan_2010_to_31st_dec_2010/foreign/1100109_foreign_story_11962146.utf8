The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Churches hit in Malay row
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Churches hit in Malay row
                            
	Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 8 (Reuters): Malaysian Muslims rallied today to protest against Christians using the word Allah for God after a spate of attacks on churches.        
	At least three churches were struck early today in this mainly Muslim country as a row over a court ruling that allowed a Catholic newspaper to use the word Allah in its Malay language editions presented a major challenge to the government.        
	At Friday prayers, banners outside the countrys biggest mosque in Kuala Lumpur read: Dont pawn Malay pride for personal political gain as hundreds of people chanting Allah-u-Akbar gathered in peaceful protests.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Doctor shot at in US hospital
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Doctor shot at in US hospital
                              The Johns Hopkins hospital in Baltimore, Maryland                            
	Baltimore, Sept. 16 (AP): A man shot and wounded a doctor today at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, then killed himself and a relative in a two-hour standoff inside the sprawling red-brick complex, police said.        
	Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told The Associated Press that the gunman and his relative died in a hospital room.        
	Guglielmi said earlier that he did not know the relationship between the gunman  described as a man in his 30s  and the doctor. The hospital said in a statement that the doctor is a faculty physician but that it could not release more information because of privacy policies.        
	The doctor was shot in the stomach but was expected to survive, Guglielmi said. The doctor will be OK, Guglielmi said. Hes in the best place in the world  at Johns Hopkins Hospital.        
	Michelle Burrell, who works in a coffee shop in the hospital lobby, said she was told by employees who were on the floor where the doctor was shot that the gunman was angry with the doctors treatment of his mother. Basically, he was upset about his mother being paralysed by the doctor, Burrell said. Its crazy.        
	A small area of the hospital had been locked down before the gunman died, as about a dozen officers wearing vests and helmets and carrying assault weapons prepared to go into the hospital at midday.        
	Guglielmi said the gunman had not taken any hostages, and people with appointments in other parts of the hospital were encouraged to keep them. The FBI was assisting Baltimore police, said an FBI spokesman.

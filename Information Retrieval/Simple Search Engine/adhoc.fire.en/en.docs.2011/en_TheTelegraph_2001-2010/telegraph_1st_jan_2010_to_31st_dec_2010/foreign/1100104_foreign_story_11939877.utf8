	Geeks, be Foxed    
	 London, Jan. 3 (PTI): Megan Fox has expressed a desire to date a geek.       
	The actress says comic book fans make great boyfriends because they are well-mannered.       
	I have been to comic book conventions a few times and even though there are a lot of guys here, they are always very polite and very kind, Fox said.       
	Maybe its because I am a geek too but the kind of guys you meet at those conventions are very nice and very appreciative of what you do, she added.    
	Leo love    
	 London (PTI): Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has rekindled his romance with supermodel Bar Rafaeli over the New Year. The couple had split last year but they patched up over a holiday in Mexico, the Daily Mail has reported online. The Titanic star and the Israeli model are currently on a holiday in Cabos San Lucas, Mexico. Photographs taken by the paparazzi show DiCaprio playing beach volleyball with other guests while Bar Refaeli sunbathes. The couple ended their three-year on-off romance in June last year after DiCaprio was said to have been scared off when his model girlfriend started to get serious.

	San Bernardino (California), June 4: A woman who thought she would never see her children again has found one of them on Facebook.        
	The social networking website helped a San Bernardino mother find her kidnapped children who have been living in Central Florida.         
	Investigators said the womans husband Faustino Utrera abducted the children in 1995 when they were two and three years old from San Bernadino.        
	According to reports he called the childrens mother and told her he had taken the children to Mexico and she would never see them again.        
	In March, the mother logged on to Facebook and typed in her missing childrens names. She spotted a picture that looked like her daughter, befriended her and started talking to her.        
	The San Bernadino police were contacted and eventually Utrera was arrested in Central Florida where he had moved with the children.        
	He has been charged with two counts of kidnapping, and two counts of violating child custody orders.        
	The two kidnapped children were placed in the custody of the Department of Children and Families (DCF).        
	But with the father facing prison time, the mother was granted custody of the two teens. Experts say the adjustment for all involved will be difficult.

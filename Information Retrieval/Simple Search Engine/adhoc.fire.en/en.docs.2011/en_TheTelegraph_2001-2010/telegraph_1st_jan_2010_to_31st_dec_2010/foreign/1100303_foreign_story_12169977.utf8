The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chile quake may have shortened Earths day

	New York, March 2 (AP): Earths days may have got a little bit shorter since the massive earthquake in Chile, but dont feel bad if you havent noticed.        
	The difference would be only about one-millionth of a second. Richard Gross, a scientist at Nasas Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and colleagues calculated that Saturdays quake shortened the day by 1.26 microseconds. A microsecond is one-millionth of a second.        
	The length of a day is the time it takes for the planet to complete one rotation  86,400 seconds or 24 hours. An earthquake can make Earth rotate faster by nudging some of its mass closer to the planets axis, just as ice skaters can speed up their spins by pulling in their arms.         
	Conversely, a quake can slow the rotation and lengthen the day if it redistributes mass away from that axis, Gross said today.

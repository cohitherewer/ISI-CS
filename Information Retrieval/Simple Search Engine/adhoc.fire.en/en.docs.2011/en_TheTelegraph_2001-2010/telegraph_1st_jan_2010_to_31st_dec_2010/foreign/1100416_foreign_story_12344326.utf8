          BEN LEACH                          Weaver and Cameron at the Avatar Blue-Ray and DVD launch in Sao Paulo. (Reuters)                                  
	April 15: Hollywood actress Sigourney Weaver has said that James Cameron, the Avatar director, lost out on an Oscar because he is male.        
	The 60-year-old, who starred in the film, also said that Avatar missed out because it is unfashionable to give the Oscar to big Hollywood blockbusters.        
	In an interview with a Brazilian news website, Weaver said the Academys choice of best director was motivated by the fact that a woman had never won the prize. Jim didnt have breasts, and I think that was the reason, Weaver told Folha Online. He should have taken home that Oscar, she said.        
	Avatar was beaten by The Hurt Locker at this years Oscars. The film was directed by Camerons ex-wife, Kathryn Bigelow.        
	She became the first female winner of the best director prize and only the fourth woman to be nominated for it in the Oscars 82-year history.        
	Weaver said Avatar lost out on the main prize because it would have been unfashionable for the film to win. In the past, Avatar would have won because they loved to give the award to those great movies like Ben-Hur, she said.Today its fashionable to give the Oscar to a small movie that nobody saw.

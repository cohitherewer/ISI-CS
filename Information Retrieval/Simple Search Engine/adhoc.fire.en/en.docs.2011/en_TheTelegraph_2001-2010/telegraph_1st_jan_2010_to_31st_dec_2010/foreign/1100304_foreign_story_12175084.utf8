	Jerusalem, March 3 (Reuters): The Israeli military called off a raid in Palestinian territory after a soldier posted details, including the time and place, on Facebook, Israels Army Radio reported today.        
	The soldier described in a status update how his unit planned a clean-up arrest raid in a West Bank area. Facebook friends then reported him to military authorities. The soldier was sentenced to 10 days imprisonment.

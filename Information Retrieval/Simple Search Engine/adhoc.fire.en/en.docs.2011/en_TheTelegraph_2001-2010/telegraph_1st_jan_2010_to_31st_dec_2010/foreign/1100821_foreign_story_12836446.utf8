The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Australia polls on knife edge
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Australia polls on knife edge

	Sydney, Aug. 20 (Reuters): Australia could have its first minority government in 70 years, a worst-case scenario for investors, with an election-eve poll showing the ruling Labour party drawing level with the conservative Opposition.        
	The vote looks so close, the result may have nothing to do with policy but simply come down to which leader, Prime Minister Julia Gillard or the Oppositions Tony Abbott, voters like best.        
	The uncertainty helped pressure the Australian dollar today. The Aussie was quoted at $0.8910 by late afternoon, down 0.85 per cent from late yesterday, while the benchmark stock index fell 1 per cent. One financial analyst has tipped a 2-5 per cent fall in the currency if Australia has a minority government.        
	Assistant treasurer Chris Bowen said the election was so tight that a hung parliament was just a likely as either a re-elected Labour government or a victory for the conservative coalition.        
	Its just so close that any of those are eminently possible, he told Reuters in a telephone interview after a Newspoll survey showed Labour and the Opposition even with 50 per cent of the two-party vote. The latest poll by the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age newspapers showed Labour ahead.        
	The most likely outcome is ... a narrow Labour victory, said Herald political editor Peter Hartcher on Australian television, revealing that a Nielsen poll to be published tomorrow showed Julia Gillards Labour ahead with 52 per cent compared with 48 per cent for Tony Abbotts Opposition.        
	Without a clear winner, the next government would have to rely on a handful of independent or Green MPs to form a government, leaving policies such as Labours new mining tax in limbo and creating market uncertainty.        
	Given the fact that around 40 per cent of Australias market is owned by foreign investors, any uncertainty can have a detrimental impact on markets, CommSec equities economist Savanth Sebastian told Reuters. If you start seeing a hung parliament or a minority victory, then the Aussie dollar could certainly come under some pressure.

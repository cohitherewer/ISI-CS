The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 15-day deadline for UK parties
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      15-day deadline for UK parties

	London, May 10: The major political parties have 15 days to try to thrash out a deal to form the next government before the country faces the prospect of a second general election.        
	Under a new set of guidelines put in place by the civil service, Gordon Brown could remain as Prime Minister until May 25  the day of the Queens speech. By then either the Prime Minister, David Cameron or Nick Clegg has to show that he has the confidence of the Commons.        
	The unusually long period between the election result and the Commons sitting has been agreed by Sir Gus Donnell, the cabinet secretary. Sir Gus, the countrys most senior civil servant, presciently drew up a set of rules earlier this year, anticipating the possibility of a hung parliament.        
	Previously there had been no written guidance on what should happen in the event of no single party having an overall majority of MPs.        
	The extra time is designed to allow the three main parties to try and reach an agreement to see who can form a government. The new guidelines are designed to try and ensure that the country is not forced to immediately go to the polls again almost in the event of no one party winning an overall Commons majority.         
	The backdrop of the fraught economic climate was also uppermost in Sir Guss mind when he drew up the rules. There have been fears that an inconclusive result would lead to a run on the pound. Under constitutional convention Brown could request a second dissolution of Parliament if he does not win a vote of confidence when it sits again. That would trigger a second general election.        
	The Queen is not obliged to grant that second dissolution and would be reluctant to do so. Instead, at that point she is likely to ask Cameron if he can form a government.         
	In reality, it is unlikely to get that far. If Brown cannot lure the Liberal Democrats from their probable deal with the Conservatives to side with Labour then he will have to accept that it is Camerons right to try and form a government.

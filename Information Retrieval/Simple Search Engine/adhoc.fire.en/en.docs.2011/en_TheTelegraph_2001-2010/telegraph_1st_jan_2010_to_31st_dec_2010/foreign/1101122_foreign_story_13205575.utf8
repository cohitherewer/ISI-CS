	London, Nov 21 (PTI): Arnold Schwarzenegger is planning a comeback to the big screen after his tenure as the governor of California ends in January 2011.         
	The actor-turned-politician is weighing his options for the future and a return to his action star days could be a possibility, reports Contactmusic.         
	It could be that fighting climate change would be the main thing. It could also be that it would be one of five things that I would do. It could be showbusiness. It could be business in general, said the 63-year-old.         
	The Terminator star who made a cameo is Sylvester Stallones The Expendables earlier this year saw success in movies, politics and bodybuilding.         
	My whole life I was always very ambitious but I was smart enough to always look, what is my talent, what do I have to offer the world? Then you go with that, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger is currently launching a global war on climate change and has already chalked out a plan because it is difficult to interest people in environmental issues.         
	People get stuck and fall in love with their slogans and with their little agendas. Youve got to make it hip, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Study pierces G-spot myth
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Study pierces G-spot myth
										      BEN LEACH      London, Jan. 3: The G-spot, the erogenous zone that is said to be possessed by some women but not by others, may not exist at all, according to scientists. 
  Researchers at King rsquo;s College London claim there is no evidence for the existence of the G-spot mdash; supposedly a cluster of internal nerve endings mdash; beyond a woman rsquo;s imagination. 
  ldquo;Women may argue that having a G-spot is due to diet or exercise, but in fact it is virtually impossible to find real traits, rdquo; said Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology, who coauthored the research. 
  ldquo;This is by far the biggest study ever carried out and it shows fairly conclusively that the idea of a G-spot is subjective. rdquo; 
  They reached their conclusions after a survey of more than 1,800 British women, all of whom were pairs of identical or non-identical twins. 
  Identical twins share all their genes, while non-identical pairs share 50 per cent of theirs. If one identical twin reported having a G-spot then her sister was more likely to give the same answer 
  But no such pattern emerged, suggesting the G-spot is a matter of the woman rsquo;s subjective opinion. 
  Andrea Burri, who led the research, said she was anxious to remove feelings of ldquo;inadequacy or underachievement rdquo; that might affect women who feared they lacked a G-spot. 
  ldquo;It is rather irresponsible to claim the existence of an entity that has never really been proven and pressurise women mdash; and men, too, rdquo; she said.

          KATE ZERNIKE                       Palin at the convention in Nashville on Saturday. (AP)                                
	Nashville, Feb. 7: As Sarah Palin left the stage at the inaugural National Tea Party Convention here last night, the crowd erupted into chants of Run Sarah Run!        
	I think you like her! said Judson Phillips, the chief organiser of the convention, when the ovation finally stopped and people had stepped down from the chairs where they had been standing and waving flags.        
	Palin gave the Tea Party crowd exactly what they wanted to hear, declaring the primacy of the Tenth Amendment in limiting government powers and complaining about the bailouts and the generational theft of rising deficits.        
	 America is ready for another revolution! she told the crowd, prompting the first of several standing ovations.        
	The speech was closely watched as a potential signal of Palins political future and the extent to which the convention would embrace her. But Palin urged the 1,100 delegates who had gathered in a hotel ballroom not to let the movement be defined by any one leader. This is about the people, and its bigger than any one king or queen of a tea party, and its a lot bigger than any charismatic guy with a teleprompter, she said.         
	That was just one of several digs at President Obama. Hows that hopey-changey thing workin out for you? she asked at one point.        
	She blasted him for rising deficits, apologising for America in speeches in other countries, and for allowing the so-called Christmas bomber to board a plane headed for the US, saying he was weak on the war on terrorism. To win that war, we need a commander in chief, not a professor of law, she declared.        
	Palin gave little hint to her political plans. When Phillips asked her about the two words that scare liberals: President Palin, she demurred and smiled.

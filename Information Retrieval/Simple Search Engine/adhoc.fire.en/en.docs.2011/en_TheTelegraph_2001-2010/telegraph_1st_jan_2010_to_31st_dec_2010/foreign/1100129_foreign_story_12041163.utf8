The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jobs top priority: Obama
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jobs top priority: Obama

	Washington, Jan. 28 (Reuters): President Barack Obama pushed job creation to the top of his agenda and vowed not to abandon his struggling healthcare overhaul after a political setback that raised doubts about his leadership.        
	With the economy still weak and unemployment at a painful 10 per cent, jobs must be our number one focus in 2010, Obama told Congress in his first State of the Union address last night.        
	Obama, who inherited a financial crisis and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan from the Bush administration, admitted he had made mistakes and that his first year in office had been a difficult one.        
	But he promised not to give up in his efforts to change the way that Washington works and push through his ambitious agenda for financial reforms, healthcare, energy and climate change, even though many Democrats fear losing their seats in November congressional elections.        
	We dont quit. I dont quit, he told Congress, split largely along Republican and Democratic lines over Obamas policies. Lets seize this moment  to start anew, to carry the dream forward and to strengthen our union once more.        
	He pledged tough new rules for Wall Street but said he was not interested in punishing banks, comments that helped boost US stock futures by appearing to retreat slightly from some of his fiery rhetoric.        
	Obama said he would work to dig the US out of a massive fiscal hole and was willing to use his veto power to enforce budgetary discipline. The US deficit  a record $1.4 trillion in 2009 or almost 10 per cent of gross domestic product  is forecast by the Congressional Budget Office to fall slightly this year to $1.35 trillion.        
	Obama vowed to double exports in five years to help create jobs, which weighed on the dollar and prompted some in the market to think the government may seek a weaker US currency. Others said there was little substance to his promise to boost jobs.        
	The devil is in the detail, said Andrew Neale, portfolio manager at Fogel Neale Wealth Management in New York. Making a speech and getting things done are two very different things.        
	Still smarting from a drop in his popularity and the loss by his Democrats of a pivotal Senate seat in Massachusetts, Obama did not gloss over his political difficulties.        
	No second place        
	The President said he would not accept a second place for his country. Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, Chinas not waiting to revamp its economy. Germanys not waiting. Indias not waiting.

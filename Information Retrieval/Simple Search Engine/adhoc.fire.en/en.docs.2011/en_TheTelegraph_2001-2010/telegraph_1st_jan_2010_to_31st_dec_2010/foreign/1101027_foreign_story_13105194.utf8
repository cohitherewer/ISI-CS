	Bellucci goes red    
	 London, Oct. 26 (PTI): She gave birth to her daughter just months ago but Italian actress Monica Bellucci proved that she is still at the top of her game at 46 with a new magazine cover in a red swimsuit.      
	Bellucci is married to French actor Vincent Cassel and gave birth to her second child, Leonie, five months ago. She was back to work filming an advertisement for Martini Gold just six weeks after giving birth. Bellucci and Cassell also have another daughter together, six-year-old Deva.

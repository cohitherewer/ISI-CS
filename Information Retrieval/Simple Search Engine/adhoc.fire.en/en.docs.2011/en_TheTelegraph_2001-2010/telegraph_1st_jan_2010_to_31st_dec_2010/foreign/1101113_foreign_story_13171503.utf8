	Bangkok, Nov. 12: Supporters of the pro-democracy leader in Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, gathered near her home today as unconfirmed reports circulated that she would be released soon from house arrest.        
	Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has been held for 15 of the last 21 years. Her latest term of detention was due to expire tomorrow, a date set in August by the leader of the military junta, Senior General Than Shwe.        
	News agencies quoted members of her party as saying they had heard that her release was imminent, and the word spread quickly through Internet reports.        
	My sources tell me that the release order has been signed, said Tin Oo, vice- chairman of Aung San Suu Kyis party, The Associated Press reported.         
	I hope she will be released, he added, but did not say when he thought she would be freed or when the order had been signed.        
	The Thailand-based exile magazine, The Irrawaddy, which has close contacts with people in Myanmar, reported that several riot police trucks had been positioned near her home in downtown Yangon.         
	Later in the afternoon, The Irrawaddy reported, party leaders told supporters to return home and to come back tomorrow morning. The release of Aung San Suu Kyi, 65, had been a central demand of western nations as they sought to pressure the ruling junta on questions of human rights and political freedom.        
	Reports that the release was imminent came five days after a parliamentary election that cemented military rule behind a civilian government structure and was intended, at least in part, to gain international legitimacy.        
	Western diplomats said their reaction would be based on the degree of freedom or restriction placed by the junta on her activities.        
	Her release by itself was not likely to change the policies of Myanmars critics like the US. And it could lead to further condemnation from abroad if authorities try to constrain her activities.        
	Her lawyer, U Nyan Win, told reporters in Yangon that she would not accept restrictions on her freedom and that she would resume active politics and make organi- sing tours around the country.        
	He said she had called for in investigation of irregularities in the election, which was won by the military-backed party but has been criticised as fraudulent by Opposition parties.        
	This activist role could lead to a confrontation like those she faced after her two previous releases, in 1995 and in 2002, when the ruling generals found her freedom too challenging and returned her to house arrest.        
	Her current term of house arrest was extended in August after an American adventurer, John Yettaw, swam across a lake uninvited to her home, leading to charges against her that she had violated the terms of her detention.        
	Aung San Suu Kyis party, the National League for Democracy, won the countrys last election, in 1990, by a landslide but the generals who controlled the country annulled the result and clung to power.        
	It was not clear what role she would now play or what options would be available to her even if her release does not carry restrictive conditions.        
	This is the nature of Than Shwe and his regime, said David Mathieson, a Myanmar specialist with Human Rights Watch based in Thailand.        
	Government people dont know, Suu Kyis party doesnt know and the experts certainly dont know. No one knows any more than anyone else. We know her house arrest expires tomorrow and everything else is all within the realm of speculation.        
	There was also speculation that Suu Kyi had rejected an offer of her conditional release and some media reported diplomats as visiting her.         
	Many believe expectation of her release is wishful thinking at such a critical juncture in a transition from dictatorship to army-dominated democracy.        
	The junta might see the release of Suu Kyi, the hugely popular daughter of Myanmars independence hero, as a threat to its political process as a new government has yet to be formed.

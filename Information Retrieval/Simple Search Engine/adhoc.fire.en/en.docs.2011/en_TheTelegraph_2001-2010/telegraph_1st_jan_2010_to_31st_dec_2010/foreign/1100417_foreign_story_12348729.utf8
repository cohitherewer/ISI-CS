	Brasilia, April 16 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will avoid Frankfurt for a stopover and instead take a detour to Johannesburg on his way back home.        
	He will return to Delhi tomorrow afternoon.         
	The detour was forced on Singh after ash clouds from an erupting volcano in Iceland disrupted flights in northern Europe, official sources said. Singh was earlier scheduled to land in Frankfurt for a technical halt.        
	The Prime Minister was in the US for four days during which he attended the Nuclear Security Summit and met Obama.        
	After the US visit, Singh arrived in Brasilia on a three-day visit to attend the India-Brazil-South Africa and Brazil-Russia-India-China Summits.

	Washington, June 7 (Reuters): Veteran White House journalist Helen Thomas, who has covered every US President since John F. Kennedy, abruptly retired today amid a storm of criticism over her controversial remarks about Israel.        
	The departure of Thomas, 89, as a Hearst Newspapers columnist was announced after she was captured on video saying Israelis should get the hell out of Palestine and suggesting they go home to Germany, Poland or the US.        
	The comments drew widespread condemnation, including from the White House.        
	Thomas, long considered the dean of the White House press corps, apologised for her statements, recorded in an impromptu interview dated May 27 and posted on the website http://www.rabbilive.com.        
	The controversy prompted Thomas to be dropped by her public speaking agency and also led to the cancellation of her plans to deliver a high school commencement address in suburban Washington. Helen Thomas announced on Monday that she is retiring, effective immediately, Hearst News Service reported. Her decision came after her controversial comments about Israel.

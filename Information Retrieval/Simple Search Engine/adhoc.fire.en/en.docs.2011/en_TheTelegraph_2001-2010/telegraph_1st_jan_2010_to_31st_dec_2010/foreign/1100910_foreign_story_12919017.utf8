The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Quran burning a stunt, says Obama
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Quran burning a stunt, says Obama

	Washington, Sept. 9: President Obama sharply criticised a Florida pastors plan to burn copies of the Quran on the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, calling it a stunt that threatens the lives of American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and violates American principles of religious tolerance.        
	If hes listening, I just hope he understands that what hes proposing to do is completely contrary to our values as Americans, Obama said in an interview that aired on ABCs Good Morning America today, referring to Terry Jones, a pastor from Gainesville, Florida.        
	As a practical matter, as commander in chief of the armed forces of the United States, I just want him to understand that this stunt that he is pulling could greatly endanger our young men and women in uniform who are in Iraq, who are in Afghanistan.        
	 Obama said that the Quran burning would be a recruitment bonanza for al Qaida and other terrorist groups looking for people willing to blow themselves up in American or European cities.        
	Obama is the strongest voice so far among a long list of prominent political and religious leader who have condemned Joness plan. General David Petraeus, the American commander in Afghanistan, earlier this week said that the burning would put American troops there directly in harms way, a warning echoed by the FBI, which said Islamic extremists are likely to retaliate.        
	Insensitive: Palin        
	Former US vice-presidential candidate and prominent Republican Sarah Palin said the Florida churchs plan to burn hundreds of Qurans on Saturday is insensitive to American ideals.

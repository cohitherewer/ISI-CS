The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Aided by Nato, Taliban elite join talks

	Kabul, Oct. 20: Talks to end the war in Afghanistan involve extensive, face-to-face discussions with Taliban commanders from the highest levels of the groups leadership, who are secretly leaving their sanctuaries in Pakistan with the help of Nato troops, officials here say.        
	The discussions, some of which have taken place in Kabul, are unfolding between the inner circle of President Hamid Karzai and members of the Quetta shura, the leadership group that oversees the Taliban war effort inside Afghanistan.         
	Afghan leaders have also held talks with leaders of the Haqqani network, considered to be one of the most hardline rebel factions; and members of the Peshawar shura, whose fighters are based in eastern Afghanistan.        
	The Taliban leaders coming into Afghanistan for talks have left their havens in Pakistan on the explicit assurance that they will not be attacked or arrested by Nato forces, Afghans familiar with the talks say. Many top Taliban leaders reside in Pakistan, where they are believed to enjoy at least some protection.        
	In at least one case, Taliban leaders crossed the border and boarded a Nato aircraft bound for Kabul, according to an Afghan with knowledge of the talks. In other cases, Nato troops have secured roads to allow Taliban officials to reach Afghan- and NATO-controlled areas so they can take part in discussions. Most of the discussions have taken place outside Kabul, according to the Afghan official.        
	American officials said last week that talks between Afghan and Taliban leaders were under way. But the ranks of the insurgents, the fact that they represent multiple factions, and the extent of Nato efforts to provide transportation and security to adversaries they otherwise try to kill or capture have not been previously disclosed.        
	At least four Taliban leaders, three of them members of the Quetta shura and one of them a member of the Haqqani family, have taken part in discussions, according to the Afghan official and a former diplomat in the region.        
	The identities of the Taliban leaders are being withheld by The New York Times at the request of the White House and an Afghan who has taken part in the discussions. The Afghan official said that identifying the men could result in their deaths or detention at the hands of rival Taliban commanders or the Pakistani intelligence agents who support them.        
	The discussions are still described as preliminary, partly because Afghan and American officials are trying to determine how much influence the Taliban leaders who have participated in the talks have within their own organisations.        
	Even so, the talks have been held on several different occasions and appear to represent the most substantive effort to date to negotiate an end to the nine-year-old war, which began with an American-led campaign to overthrow the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks.         
	These are face-to-face discussions, said an Afghan with knowledge of the talks. This is not about making the Americans happy or making Karzai happy. Its about what is in the best interests of the Afghan people.        
	These talks are based on personal relationships, the official said. When the Taliban see that they can travel in the country without being attacked by the Americans, they see that the government is sovereign, that they can trust us.        
	The discussions appear to be unfolding without the approval of Pakistans leaders, who are believed to exercise a wide degree of control over the Talibans leadership. The Afghan government seems to be trying to seek a reconciliation agreement that does not directly involve Pakistan, which Karzais government fears will exercise too much influence over Afghanistan after Nato forces withdraw.        
	But that strategy could backfire by provoking the Pakistanis, who could undermine any agreement.                            NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Parisians rediscover the magic of Monet
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Parisians rediscover the magic of Monet
  - Show restores painters status          MICHAEL KIMMELMAN                          A visitor looks at Terrasse a Sainte-Adresse by Claude Monet at the Grand Palais Museum in Paris. (Reuters)                                        
	Poor Claude Monet. Like white noise, hes everywhere and invisible, the staple of countless dentists offices. Old hat for more than a century now. Is it too late to recapture some of the shock and thrill that caused horrified Parisians in the 1870s to perceive his work as leprous?        
	Amazingly, no, its not. The Monet show that just opened here at the Grand Palais is a start. The biggest art spectacle in Europe this autumn, with some 160 paintings, it is, believe it or not, the first full-dress overview Paris has staged in decades, the first chance anywhere to see the whole sweep of his work in some time. The French are treating it like a national celebration. President Nicolas Sarkozy contributed a note to the catalogue extolling this unmistakable emblem of the international influence of French culture. The exhibition would have been a box office smash even if it had corralled fewer of Monets benchmarks.        
	It happens to be ravishing.        
	Monet the populist decorator of candle-in-Chianti-bottle bistros and college dormitories is modernisms prettiest painter, a virtuoso of picturesque country scenes and ephemeral weather but not an especially heavyweight thinker or troublemaker.         
	This show, surveying his long career and probing its depths, helps restore something of his original status.         
	He comes across as more than the familiar Impressionist  he comes across as a painter of strange and elusive probity, of memory and reflection, as an artist seeking not just to simulate sun, rain and snow, but states of mind as well. He gave form to the heavenly pasturage our minds can find in things, is how Proust once put it.        
	In part he did this by returning again and again, as the exhibition stresses, to certain sites and motifs, completing pictures not on the spot, but often in his studio, based on what he remembered.         
	All this is hardly news, and to make the case, pictures in the show are hung, albeit a bit confusingly, by subject as opposed to chronologically, with occasional pedestrian ones from haunts like Vtheuil and Antibes. Monet became a very rich man churning out 2,000 works, and one need only hop the Mtro to the Muse Marmattan Monet to see, among some great paintings, plenty of absolute stinkers.

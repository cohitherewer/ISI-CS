The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Smartphones score over point-and-shoots
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Smartphones score over point-and-shoots

	Dec. 4: Ariel Dunitz-Johnson, a 30-year-old illustrator in San Francisco, bought a point-and-shoot camera in May. But in July, she bought a smartphone, with a camera built in.        
	Soon, whenever she wanted to take a picture, she found herself reaching for the smartphone, a Droid Incredible. She barely uses her point-and-shoot, a Panasonic DMC-LX3.        
	Its much easier to share those pictures with my friends, she explained, through social networks or email. With my point-and-shoot, I have to plug it into my computer and upload the photos. Its just a few more steps than I want to take.        
	The point-and-shoot camera, which has been a part of American households since 1900, when George Eastman introduced the Kodak Brownie, is endangered. Like other single-use devices  the answering machine, the desktop calculator, the Rolodex  it is being shoved aside by a multipurpose device: the smartphone and its camera, which takes better snapshots with each new model.        
	Cameras, mostly point-and-shoots, are still found in 82 per cent of American households, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. But for many consumers, the point-and-shoot they have now may be the last they ever own.        
	 Its close at hand whenever a photo opportunity arises, and can be used to instantly email and share pictures. And it has an expanding menu of photo apps, well beyond the landscape and panoramic settings on a point-and-shoot, that can be used to easily manipulate the images.        
	Point-and-shoots do have certain advantages over smartphone cameras, including features like image stabilisation and larger lenses and sensors. That does not matter to consumers like Emily Peterson, a 28-year-old graphic designer who lives in Brooklyn and who bought an iPhone 4 in July.         
	One day I just thought, Wow, I never have my camera with me, when I used to carry it around all the time, she said. Its just one less thing for me to remember, one less thing to carry.

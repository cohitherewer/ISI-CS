The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | CT scans can reduce lung cancer deaths
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      CT scans can reduce lung cancer deaths

	Washington, Nov. 4: Annual CT scans of current and former heavy smokers reduce the risk that they will die from lung cancer by 20 per cent, a huge government-financed study has found.        
	Even more surprising, the scans seemed to reduce their risk of death from other causes as well. The finding, announced by the National Cancer Institute today, represents a major advance in cancer detection that could potentially save thousands of lives annually, although at considerable expense. Lung cancer claims about 160,000 lives each year, more than the deaths from colorectal, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers combined.         
	In most patients, the disease is discovered too late for effective treatment, and 85 per cent of those who are diagnosed with lung cancer die from it.         
	Until now, no screening method had proven to be effective at reducing mortality from the disease. Four randomised, controlled trials done during the 1970s showed that chest X-rays helped to catch cancers at an earlier stage, but had no effect on overall death rates. Since then, researchers have suggested that CT scans  which use coordinated X-rays to provide three-dimensional views of body tissue  could detect lung tumours at an even earlier stage than X-rays could, but no trial had shown conclusively that deaths could be averted.        
	This is the first time that we have seen clear evidence of a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality with a screening test in a randomised controlled trial, said Dr Christine Berg of the National Cancer Institute.        
	Called the National Lung Screening Trial, it involved more than 53,000 current and former heavy smokers between the ages of 55 and 74 who were given either a standard chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan at the start of the trial and then twice more over the next two years. The participants were followed for up to five years.         
	There were 354 lung cancer deaths among those who received CT scans, and 442 lung cancer deaths among those who got conventional X-rays.

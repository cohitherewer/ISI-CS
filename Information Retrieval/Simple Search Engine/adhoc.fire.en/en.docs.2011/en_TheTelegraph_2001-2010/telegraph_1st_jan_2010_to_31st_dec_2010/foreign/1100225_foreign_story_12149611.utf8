The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | India forces Pak to drop ISI official
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      India forces Pak to drop ISI official
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Feb. 24: India has won the first round in the foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan even before they have begun.        
	At New Delhis insistence, Pakistans foreign secretary Salman Bashir was forced at the eleventh hour to drop from his delegation an Inter Services Intelligence operative masquerading as a civilian official in the ministry of interior in Islamabad.        
	India also insisted and had an official from Pakistans ministry of water and power removed from Bashirs delegation for Thursdays bilateral talks at New Delhis Hyderabad House.        
	This official would have made a ruckus about Pakistans grievance that India is building a dam on the Chenab river and muddied the talks if they did not go the way Islamabad wanted, South Block feared, when it was conveyed that this official would be part of the dialogue.        
	Vishnu Prakash, spokesman for the ministry of external affairs, categorically denied any claim that India had interfered with the composition of Bashirs delegation as factually incorrect and absolutely baseless, but officials at the Indian high commission in Islamabad, confirmed on background that India had objected to the two officials.        
	The spokesmans denial reflects foreign secretary Nirupama Raos desire to avoid any controversy on the eve of the talks. Besides, having had its way on this issue, South Block does not obviously wish to gloat over its victory.        
	But the Pakistanis embarrassed India as Bashir and his reconstituted team arrived in New Delhi for the talks by confirming that their delegation had, indeed, been changed on the eve of its departure for New Delhi.        
	Pakistan foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit, who is accompanying Bashir to New Delhi, said that the delegation had been pruned. But he denied, naturally, that the changes had been forced on Bashir by India.        
	According to high commission officials in Islamabad, a list of delegation members seeking Indian visas was hastily sent to South Block as soon as it was received from Pakistans foreign ministry: it was at this point that the name of the ISI operative was spotted.        
	When the name was objected to, the Pakistanis did not beat about the bush: one foreign ministry official told the high commission that the delegate representing the interior ministry was being included for the safety of Bashirs team.        
	The Indian side decided to object to the name after it concluded that this ISI operative would act as the minder for the Pakistani delegation on the familiar lines where KGB drivers were often minders for Soviet delegations abroad.        
	India recognises that Pakistans military establishment will have a veto on anything to do with India.        
	But the preferred view in South Block on the eve of the bilateral talks is to engage the military establishment also through Bashir. The foreign secretarys brother, Admiral Noman Bashir is Pakistans chief of naval staff.        
	Both brothers were appointed to two of the top positions in Pakistan within months of each other in 2008.        
	Together they constitute a powerful force in Pakistans scheme of things. That is also a factor, which will influence the course of Thursdays talks, where India will go the extra mile to accommodate Pakistans foreign secretary as someone who can deliver beyond the capabilities of a mere civil servant in Islamabad.        
	India was warned against accepting a delegate from Pakistans ministry of water and power after signals from its Permanent Indus Commissioner, Syed Jamaat Ali Shah, in the last one week that he intends to be confrontational over allegations that Indian activity on the Chenab river violated the Indus Water Treaty.        
	South Block feared that the water and power ministry official would be a Trojan Horse for dictating Pakistans agenda on Thursday repeating the history of the Agra summit in 2001 when General Pervez Musharraf attempted to make the most of a collapsed summit through the media.        
	Reflecting such fears, there will be no joint media briefing after talks between Rao and Bashir on Thursday. The two sides will hold separate media briefings putting across their respective assessments of the foreign-secretary level talks.

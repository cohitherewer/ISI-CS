The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bomb suspect met US hawk in Yemen
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bomb suspect met US hawk in Yemen
                              Abdulmutallab: Key details                            
	Sanaa (Yemen), Jan. 7 (Reuters): A Nigerian man accused in the attempted bombing of a US-bound plane on Christmas Day was recruited by al Qaida in London and met a radical American Muslim cleric in Yemen, a top Yemeni official said today.        
	Yemen, the poorest Arab country, was thrust into the foreground of the US-led war against Islamist militants after a Yemen-based wing of al Qaida said it was behind the failed bomb attempt.        
	The information provided to us is that Umar Farouk (Abdulmutallab) joined al Qaida in London, Rshad al-Alimi, Yemens deputy Prime Minister for defence and security, told a news conference today.        
	Alimi said that Abdulmutallab had also met Muslim preacher Anwar al-Awlaki during his time in Yemen, referring to an English-speaking cleric linked to a gunman who ran amok in a US army base in Texas. A Yemeni security official said Awlaki was believed to have later died in a strike on al Qaida militants last month.        
	Yemen, trying to fight a resurgent al Qaida on its territory, launched an operation this week to root out militants who they said were behind threats that forced western embassies to close on Sunday.        
	The raid, which killed two militants, allayed US concerns and allowed its heavily fortified mission to reopen.        
	Yemeni foreign minister Abubakr al-Qirbi, whose country is also facing a Shia revolt in the north and simmering separatist sentiment in the south, said fighting militants was a priority for Yemeni forces and rejected foreign intervention.        
	We think this is the priority and the responsibility of our security forces and the army, Qirbi told CNN.        
	Asked by CNN whether Yemen would accept direct US intervention, Qirbi said: No, I dont think we will accept that. I think the US, as well, have learned from Afghanistan and Iraq and other places that direct intervention can be self-defeating.         
	Yemen has sent troops to take part in a campaign against al Qaida in three provinces this week. One security source said forces had set up extra checkpoints on main roads. Yemeni forces had surrounded a suspected al Qaida regional leader near the capital yesterday, and have captured eight rank-and-file al Qaida militants.

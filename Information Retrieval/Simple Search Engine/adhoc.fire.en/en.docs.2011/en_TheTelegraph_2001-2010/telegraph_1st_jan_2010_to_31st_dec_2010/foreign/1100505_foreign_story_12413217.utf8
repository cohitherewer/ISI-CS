	Dublin, May 4 (Reuters): Airports in Ireland and parts of Britain were closed again for hours today because of the cloud of volcanic ash drifting south from Iceland that wreaked havoc on European air travel last month.        
	The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) allowed flights to resume from Irish airports from 1200 GMT after a closure lasting six hours. Dublin airport said flight schedules had reverted to normal operations.        
	Britains National Air Traffic Services (Nats), which had imposed a no-fly zone in the west of Scotland and Northern Ireland, also opened all UK airspace from 1200 GMT, apart from a small no-fly zone in the northwest with no impact on UK flights.        
	Flights in much of continental Europe were operating as normal.        
	However, the IAA said northerly winds forecast for the coming days could bring more clouds of ash from the Icelandic eruption and disruption for passengers this week.        
	We could be faced with this periodically during the summer, IAA Chief Executive Eamonn Brennan said. We are probably facing a summer of uncertainty due to this ash cloud.        
	The IAA had closed airports from 0600 GMT because of risk of ash ingestion in aircraft engines, although overflights of Ireland from Britain and continental Europe had not been banned.        
	European flights overall were expected to be at almost normal levels today, European air traffic agency Eurocontrol said. On a typical weekday, just under 200 flights would be expected in and out of Ireland, compared with around 28,000 throughout Europe, a spokeswoman said.        
	However, fresh ash from the erupting volcano could cloud airspace over northern Britain for the next few days following a change in direction of the wind, Icelands meteorological office said.

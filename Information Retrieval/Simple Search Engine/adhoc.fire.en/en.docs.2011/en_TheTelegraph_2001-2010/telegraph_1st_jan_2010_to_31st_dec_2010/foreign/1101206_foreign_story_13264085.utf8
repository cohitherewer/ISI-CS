The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hillarys hello too soft for Iran
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hillarys hello too soft for Iran
                                Hillary Clinton (top), Manouchehr Mottaki                    
	Shannon, Ireland, Dec. 5 (Reuters): Hillary Clinton lost him at hello.        
	The US secretary of state had a rare chance to interact with Irans foreign minister at a Bahrain security conference, where Clinton urged Tehran to engage with the international community over its nuclear programme.         
	But while her speech from the podium directly addressed the Iranian team led by foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki, her attempt at a more personal touch fell distinctly flat.        
	I got up to leave and he was sitting a couple of seats down from me and shaking peoples hands and he saw me and he stopped and began to turn away, Clinton told reporters on her plane back to Washington yesterday.        
	I said Hello, minister. He just turned away.        
	At a news conference on Saturday, Mottaki denied the reported slight, saying he had been greeting King Abdullah of Jordan at the moment Clinton spoke to him. He said he had returned her greeting.        
	Clintons Bahrain speech on Friday came ahead of next weeks Geneva meeting between Iran and six big powers  the US, France, Russia, Britain, China and Germany  their first such encounter in more than a year.        
	While the US secretary of state laid out her case for broader Iranian engagement, Mottaki concentrated on his dinner  giving no sign that Washingtons latest message to Tehran had been heard.

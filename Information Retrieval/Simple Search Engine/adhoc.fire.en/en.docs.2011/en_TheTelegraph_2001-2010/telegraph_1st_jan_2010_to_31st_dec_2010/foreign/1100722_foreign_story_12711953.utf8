The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lohan sentence may be cut to 14 days
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lohan sentence may be cut to 14 days

	Los Angeles, July 21 (Reuters): A scared but resolute Lindsay Lohan began a 90-day jail sentence yesterday, trading nightclubs and Twitter messages for a small, isolated cell and an orange jumpsuit.        
	Lohan, 24, was booked into an all-female jail in south Los Angeles for violating her probation on two 2007 drunk-driving and cocaine possession charges.        
	The actress is likely to serve just 14 days behind bars, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles county sheriffs department, which runs the jail system.        
	Whitmore told reporters that non-violent female inmates generally serve about 25 per cent of their sentence. Good behaviour and jail overcrowding programmes also reduce the time in LA lock-ups, he said.        
	Beverly Hills Judge Marsha Revel yesterday ordered that Lohan must not be released to house arrest or electronic monitoring.        
	The Mean Girls actress, whose promising career has foundered during two years of strenuous partying, looked tired and tense during a brief, silent appearance at a packed Beverly Hills courtroom yesterday morning, where she was handcuffed and taken into custody.        
	Lohans lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, told reporters Lohan is scared as anyone would be...and shes resolute. She does her time just like anyone else.        
	Local TV news helicopters showed live video of Lohans journey, an unmarked car with tinted windows, to the 2,200-bed Century Regional Detention Facility. Whitmore said that Lohan has been extremely cooperative and everything is going smoothly. She will wear a standard orange jumpsuit, hand in any jewellery, and mobile phones and computers are banned.        
	Lohan, who has voluntarily spent the past week in a sober living facility in Los Angeles, will serve her jail time alone in a nine square-metre cell for her own safety.        
	People that have this kind of notoriety... they are kept away from the general population, Whitmore said.

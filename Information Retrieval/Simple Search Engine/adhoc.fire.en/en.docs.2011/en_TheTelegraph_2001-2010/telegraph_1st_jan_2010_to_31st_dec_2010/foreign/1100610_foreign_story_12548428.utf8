	June 9: Al Gores eldest daughter, Karenna, has separated from her husband according to reports, a week after her parents announced their own split after 40 years of marriage.        
	Two friends of the family, who declined to be named, say the couple, Karenna Gore Schiff and Andrew Schiff, is seeking counselling. Karenna Gore, 36, married the 44-year-old doctor in 1997 and they have three young children, Wyatt, 10, Anna, eight, and Oscar, three.        
	A friend told People magazine: Its amicable and they are in counselling. They are not divorced.        
	Earlier this month, Gore and his wife Tipper, long regarded as a model political couple, announced they were separating. The Gores said they had reached a mutual and mutually-supportive decision that we have made together following a process of long and careful consideration.        
	Gore, 62, was Bill Clintons vice-president for eight years and narrowly lost the presidency to George W Bush in 2000. He then built a reputation as a leading campaigner against global warming, winning a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his documentary An Inconvenient Truth.

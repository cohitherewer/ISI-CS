          LYDIA POLGREEN                          Fonseka in Colombo. (AFP)                                  
	Colombo, Jan. 25: When President Mahinda Rajapaksa announced late last year that he would move the presidential election up by two years and seek a fresh mandate from Sri Lankas war-weary electorate, he seemed like a winner.        
	Having vanquished the fearsome Tamil Tiger insurgency in May with a no-holds-barred assault on its last stronghold, Rajapaksa enjoyed widespread adulation.         
	The Opposition parties were fractured and in disarray. No one, it seemed, could match the Presidents popularity, despite deep unease about what seemed to be the increasing concentration of power in the hands of his family and rising corruption.        
	But to near-universal surprise, an alphabet soup of political parties has rallied around the retired general who led Sri Lankas army to victory against the Tamil Tigers, Sarath Fonseka.        
	Tomorrow, voters here will go to the polls in what has been one of the most bitterly contested elections in Sri Lankan history.         
	Rajapaksa has argued that he delivered on his election promise, made in 2005, to end the war, and that he can be relied upon to mend the country.         
	But his popularity has waned in the months since the end of the war as Sri Lankans have grown impatient for prosperity.. Rajapaksa has also given powerful positions in the government to relatives, rankling many Sri Lankans.        
	Sri Lanka has always been a democracy, said Waskadwa Dhammarana, a Buddhist monk who supported the President in 2005 but is now planning to vote for General Fonseka. I am against corruption, nepotism and the anti-democratic attitude prevalent in the Rajapaksa regime.        
	Fonseka has pledged to reduce the powers of the presidency and give more authority to parliament, a cherished goal of many parties in the fractious coalition backing him. But he is untested as a political leader, and many question his ability to lead beyond the regimented sphere of the military.        
	Indeed, the alliance behind Fonsekas candidacy is a grudging coalition that includes more than one set of archenemies. It includes hard-line Marxists and laissez-faire capitalists, hard-core nationalists who argue that minorities should submit to majority rule as well as the main Tamil and Muslim parties.        
	The Opposition parties have come together with the single purpose of effecting regime change, said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Centre for Policy Alternatives, a research and advocacy institute here.        
	The campaign has unfolded in a tense but hopeful nation that seeks to put its violent past to rest. The Tamil Tigers took up arms to defend the Tamil minority from government discrimination, but eventually became a ruthless insurgency best known for its use of child soldiers and suicide bombers.        
	Fonseka has struggled to find his footing as a politician. In speeches his clipped delivery is that of a man accustomed to giving orders, not asking for votes. The country in the future will be free of corruption, he commanded from the stage at a rally in the southern coastal town of Kalutara. Democracy will be restored. Your children will have a bright future.

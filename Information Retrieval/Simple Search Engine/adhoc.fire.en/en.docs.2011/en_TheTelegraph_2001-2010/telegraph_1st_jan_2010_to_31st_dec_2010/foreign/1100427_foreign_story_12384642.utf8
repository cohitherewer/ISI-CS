	JLo body bother    
	 London, April 26 (PTI): Actress and singer Jennifer Lopez, who is a mother of twins, compares her pregnancy to an invasion of the body snatchers.      
	Lopez, 40, who is making a comeback this year in The Back up Plan, found the way her babies took over her body during pregnancy as weird. The film, featuring Lopez and Alex Loughlin, follows the story of a woman who has in-vitro fertilisation to become a single mother, only to meet the man of her dreams when she is pregnant.       
	I wanted to put as much in as we could that was real: the overeating, the burping. Why not? Its funny too. Pregnancy and giving birth are weird, strange. The growing life inside you  its like an invasion of the body snatchers, Lopez said.     
	Rich Potter    
	London (PTI): Harry Potters money-making magic has made its star Daniel Radcliffe richer than Prince William and Prince Harry. Radcliffe, 20, who stars as Harry Potter in the film adaptations of the bestseller by J.K. Rowling, was ranked the fifth wealthiest young Briton after clocking up a fortune of $64 million. It put him ahead of William and Harry who came seventh with individual fortunes of $42 million.     
	Carey child

Carey sparked speculation that she was expecting her first child with husband Nick Cannon last month when she told reporters: I have a lot of new acting projects coming up... But theres also something else very special on the way. I cant say any more.     
	Tough Bond    
	 London (PTI): Actor Pierce Brosnan had a tough time filming the James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies. The suave star admits he had a great time shooting GoldenEye, but knew the follow-up wasnt as good. I remember starting the first day on that film in an aircraft, flying a jet... and it was 102 degrees, and then Im being strangled over and over again, and I thought: Oh my God, this bloody character is going to kill me, Brosnan said.

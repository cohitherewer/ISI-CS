	Travolta twirl    
	 Los Angeles, Sept. 13 (PTI): Actor John Travolta had none other than TV presenter Oprah Winfrey on his arm to mark the beginning of The Oprah Winfrey Shows last season.       
	Travoltas dancing skills in films such as Grease and Saturday Night Fever made him a sex symbol in the 70s.      
	Winfrey experienced his smooth moves as Travolta, 56, danced hand-in-hand through her stage doors to the song Love Train, reports People magazine. Dressed in a pinstripe suit and white shirt, Travolta hugged Oprah after the dance. The actor is just one in a big line-up of stars said to appear in the episode.

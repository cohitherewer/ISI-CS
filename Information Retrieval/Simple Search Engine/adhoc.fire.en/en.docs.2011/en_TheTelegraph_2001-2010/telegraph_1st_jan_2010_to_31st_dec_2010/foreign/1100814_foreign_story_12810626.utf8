	Aug. 13: A flight attendant received a round of applause from passengers for taking part in a mass pillow fight at 20,000 feet.        
	After a week of cabin crew making headlines for all the wrong reasons, this Lufthansa employee showed that some attendants still take pleasure in their work. In footage captured on a passengers mobile phone, she is seen hurling pillows around the cabin after being bombarded by playful French tourists.        
	 After one particularly heavy onslaught, the grinning stewardess flees to the safety of the galley, to the applause of economy class. Far from condemning the on-board horseplay, the airline paid tribute to the attendant for making the flight from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt more enjoyable for passengers. A Lufthansa spokeswoman told AOL Travel News: Its an example of passengers enjoying themselves in economy class. And it shows we still offer pillows to our passengers in economy class.

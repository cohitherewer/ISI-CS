	Portman bikini    
	 London, Nov. 19 (PTI): Actress Natalie Portman had vowed never to strip for the cameras.      
	However, she will be seen in a bikini for the first time in her next film, Your Highness. It comes after her lesbian scenes with actress Mila Kunis in the Black Swan. In recently-released stills, Portman, 29, peels down to a very skimpy bikini that emphasising every curve of her body.

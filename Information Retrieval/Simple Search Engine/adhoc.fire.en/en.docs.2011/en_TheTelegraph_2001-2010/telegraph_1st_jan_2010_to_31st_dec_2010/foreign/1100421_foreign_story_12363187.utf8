                              New Album                            
	London, April 20: Kylie Minogue has been reinvented as a Greek goddess, as she announced details of her return with a new album today.        
	She poses as the goddess of love Aphrodite  who gives her name to the singers 11th studio album  for the cover of her new release.        
	Kylie is seen in flowing, windswept blue robes, arms held aloft and looking to the heavens in the shot. It could be the answer to the prayers of her record bosses at struggling EMI, which owns her label Parlophone.        
	Details were released on the singers website today along with a snatch of her forthcoming single All The Lovers which is out on June 28.        
	The album sees her working with Madonna collaborator Stuart Price who is executive producer. He is also among the songwriters.        
	Kylie said: The single was one of the last tracks to be written for the album. As I was recording it I knew that All The Lovers had to be the first single  it sums up the euphoria of the album perfectly. It gives me goose-bumps.

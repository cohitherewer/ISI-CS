	Baghdad, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Suicide bombers and other attackers killed at least 62 people in apparently coordinated attacks on Iraqi security forces in Iraq today, less than a week before US troops formally end combat operations.        
	The bombings also wounded more than 250 people, underscoring the fragility of Iraqs security and the uncertainty of its political situation more than five months after an election that produced no outright winner and as yet no new government.        
	In the southern city of Kut, 150km southeast of Baghdad, a suicide car bomber killed at least 30 policemen and wounded 87, said Lieutenant Colonel Aziz al-Amarah, commander of the rapid response police force in the province of Wasit.        
	The blast shattered the building. Burnt-out cars littered the scene as rescue workers searched for survivors.        
	Parts of the building collapsed and there are still policemens bodies, including the police chief, under the rubble, Amarah said by telephone.        
	In Baghdad, a suicide truck bomber killed 15 people and wounded at least 56 others in an attack on another police station, interior ministry and police sources said. Parts of the police station in Baghdads northern Qahira district collapsed and surrounding houses were severely damaged, the interior ministry source said.        
	Baghdad security spokesman Major General Qassim al-Moussawi blamed insurgents linked to Sunni Islamist al Qaida and warned of more attacks as US troops end combat operations ahead of a full withdrawal by the end of 2011.        
	 In the Shia holy city of Karbala, southwest of Baghdad, at least 29 people were wounded when a car bomb went off near a police station, a health department source said. A parked minibus packed with explosives blew up near a police station in the southern oil hub city of Basra, wounding 12 people, police and hospital sources said.        
	In Buhriz, about 60km northeast of Baghdad, gunmen detonated bombs near the houses of policemen and raised the flag of al Qaidas Iraqi affiliate on one of the buildings, police sources said.         
	Five people were wounded.        
	Other attacks in Baghdad, Diyala province, Anbar province and the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul, brought the overall death toll from the attacks to at least 62. Iraq is on high alert for attacks by suspected al Qaida-linked groups following the election.

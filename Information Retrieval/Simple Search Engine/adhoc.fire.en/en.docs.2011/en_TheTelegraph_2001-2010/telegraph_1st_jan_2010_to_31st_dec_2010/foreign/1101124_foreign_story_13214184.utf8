The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China admits it is top polluter
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China admits it is top polluter

	Beijing, Nov. 23 (Reuters): China acknowledged today it is the worlds biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, confirming what scientists have said for years but defending its right to keep growing emissions.        
	Chinas chief negotiator in international climate change talks, Xie Zhenhua, made the comment while spelling out his governments position ahead of negotiations in Cancun, Mexico, from November 29 over a new global pact to fight global warming.        
	Scientists and overseas bodies have said that since 2006-2007, Chinas greenhouse gas pollution has surpassed US, the worlds top emitter for the 20th century        
	However, until now Beijing has hedged. Its officials have said it may possibly be the top emitter, that the issue needs more study or that average emissions per capita is a fairer measure to guide policy. Now we stand at world number one in emissions volumes, Xie told a news conference in Beijing.         
	Rich countries should nevertheless lead with steep cuts in their emissions, said Xie, since over time they have contributed most to the build-up of greenhouse gases trapping more solar heat in the atmosphere, and they should give poorer countries room to grow their economies and emissions. China is taking steps in the hope that we can peak (in emissions) as early as possible, he said.        
	In a possible sign that the top status remains sensitive for China, Xies comment did not appear on the transcript of his news conference on the governments website (http://www.gov.cn), nor were they reported by the official Xinhua news agency.        
	The government does not issue recent statistics for those emissions.        
	The mixed signals underlined how difficult it will be to craft a climate change deal that fits needs of both emerging economies such as China and India and the advanced economies. In 2009, Chinas emissions of carbon dioxide  the main greenhouse gas from burning coal, oil and gas  reached 7.5 billion tonnes, a rise of 9 per cent on the previous year and accounting for 24 per cent of the global total.        
	US climate envoy Todd Stern said in a speech last month that a new paradigm was needed since developed nations now account for just 45 per cent of world emissions.        
	But China rejects an internationally binding limit on its greenhouse gas emissions as unfair, because it contributed less to the problem historically and its emissions per-capita are still relatively low.

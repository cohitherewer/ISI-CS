	Corvallis, Oregon, Nov. 28 (AP): A fire caused by suspected arson today broke out in an Islamic centre near Oregon State University, which was the occasional place of worship for a Somali-born teen who was arrested two days ago on charges of plotting a terror attack in Portland.        
	A fire prevention officer for the Corvallis fire department said the fire at the Salman Al-Farisi Islamic Center was set early morning. Quite a bit of evidence was left at the scene, which led her to believe the fire was intentionally set.

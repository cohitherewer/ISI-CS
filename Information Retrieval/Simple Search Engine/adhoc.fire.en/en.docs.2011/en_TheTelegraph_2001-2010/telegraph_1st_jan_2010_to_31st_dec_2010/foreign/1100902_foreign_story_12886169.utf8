	BBC Stig revealed    
	 London, Sept. 1 (AP): The opaque visor of one of Britains most famous helmets has been lifted.      
	The identity of The Stig, the always-anonymous test driver on the popular television show Top Gear, has long been a closely guarded secret. Today, lawyers said the BBC had been refused an injunction blocking publication of a book revealing the identity of the character.      
	Shortly after, publishers HarperCollins said in a statement that a 33-year-old racing driver named Ben Collins has a great story to tell about his seven years as The Stig, which will appeal to a wide audience beyond just motoring enthusiasts.      
	Calling it a victory for freedom of speech, HarperCollins said the book will be published in Britain on September 16. The white-suited Stig is the second in the role; the first Stig, who wore a black suit and helmet, was Perry McCarthy. He left the show in 2003 after his identity was revealed.       
	The show has a long-standing policy of not commenting on The Stigs identity.

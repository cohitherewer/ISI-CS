The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | India huge priority for UK: Cameron
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      India huge priority for UK: Cameron
          AMIT ROY                          Cameron in London. (AFP)                                  
	London, Nov. 16: India will be a huge foreign policy priority for Britain, David Cameron said last night in the prime ministers first major speech on foreign policy.        
	 But he failed to say he wanted a new special relationship with India which Cameron has done on previous occasions.        
	 In marked contrast, he did say: We will continue to build on our special relationship with America.        
	 It will be up to foreign policy experts to work out the difference, if any, between a new special relationship and a huge foreign policy priority but the prime minister, who was making a formal address at the Lord Mayors Banquet, would have been fully aware his words would be carefully analysed in chancelleries across the world.        
	 His main thesis was that despite reports to the contrary, Britain was not a power in decline.        
	 Perhaps he needed to repair relations with America for, as opposition leader, Cameron had repeatedly emphasised he would not behave like a poodle, which, by implication, his predecessor, Tony Blair, had done in tamely following President George W Bush into a disastrous war in Iraq.        
	 In the manner of President Barack Obama during his trip to India, Cameron, too, declared his mantra: We must link our economy up with the fastest growing parts of the world, placing our commercial interest at the heart of our foreign policy.        
	 Cameron, who took six ministers to India in July and has just visited China with three, announced he would go to Brazil and Russia next year in pursuit of a more commercial foreign policy.        
	 Some people think it is somehow grubby to mix money and diplomacy, he explained, using words which might offer comfort to India which has been taken to task over its softly-softly approach to the Burmese generals. I say: when it is harder than ever for this country to earn a living, we need to mobilise all the resources we can.        
	 In other words, ditching New Labours ethical foreign policy, the Tories would always put business and jobs first. Today we trade more with the Netherlands than with Brazil, Russia, India, China and Turkey combined, said Cameron. But this statistic just shows we are not making nearly enough of the opportunities out there. Thats why one of the first visits I made as prime minister was to India. Its the second fastest growing major economy in the world. We already have unique ties of history, culture, people and language. And extending and deepening our relations with that country is a huge foreign policy priority for us.        
	 It is worth comparing and contrasting his warmer words on America, which will always remain the most important country for the UK. He was making it clear that there will only be one special relationship  he wouldnt be two timing the US.        
	 We have a deep and close relationship with America, Cameron stressed. It is not just special, it is crucial, because it is based on solid practical foundations such as our cooperation on defence, counter-terrorism and intelligence and tomorrow in Washington the foreign secretary (William Hague) will set out how that relationship will remain fundamental to us in defence intelligence and diplomacy as well as being essential to our economy.        
	 On Britains rise and apparent decline, Cameron conceded: Now there are some who say that Britain is embarked on an inevitable path of decline. That the rise of new economic powers is the end of Britains influence in the world. That we are in some vast zero-sum game in which we are bound to lose out. That our claim to the status of a major military power is now a sham and that we should be pulling back from our military engagements.        
	 I want to take this argument head on, he continued. Britain remains a great economic power. Show me a City in the world with stronger credentials than the City of London. Show me another gathering with the same line-up of financial, legal, accounting, communications and other professional expertise. We are a strong and active member of the EU and gateway to the worlds largest single market. You know even better than me, Britain is a great trading force in the world.        
	 Cameron was giving a realistic assessment: India is today a top dog but not the top dog.         
	 He pointed out: In Seoul I was at the G20, forged at the height of the financial crisis, its now the main forum for global economic decision-making, bringing together not only the United States and China, but also Brazil, South Africa, India, Russia.        
	 There was no mention last night of Pakistan whose military  unlike that of Burma  continues to receive the UKs  and Americas  support, succour and money.

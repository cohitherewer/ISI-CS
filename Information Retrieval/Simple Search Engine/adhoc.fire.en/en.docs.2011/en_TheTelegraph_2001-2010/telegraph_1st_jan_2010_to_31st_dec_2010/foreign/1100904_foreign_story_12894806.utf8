	Wellington, Sept. 3 (AP): A powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake has rocked much of New Zealands South Island. No immediate tsunami alert has been issued and no injuries have been reported.        
	The quake, which hit 30km west of the southern city of Christchurch, shook a wide area with initial radio reports saying items were tossed from store shelves and roof tiles cracked by the strong temblor.        
	New Zealands National Radio reports the temblor hit at 4.35am, shaking thousands of residents awake.

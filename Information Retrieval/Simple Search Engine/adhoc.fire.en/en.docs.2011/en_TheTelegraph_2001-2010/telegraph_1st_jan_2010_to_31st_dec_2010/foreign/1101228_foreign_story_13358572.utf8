The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hollywood puts emphasis on quality
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hollywood puts emphasis on quality

	Los Angeles, Dec. 27: When negative Twitter commentary seemingly torpedoed the Sacha Baron Cohen film Brno in July 2009, movie executives started talking in solemn tones about the ability of social networking to sway attendance. The era of using marketing to trick consumers into seeing bad movies was drawing to a close.         
	It was mostly lip service.         
	As Hollywood plowed into 2010, there was plenty of clinging to the tried and true: humdrum remakes like The Wolfman and The A-Team; star vehicles like Killers with Ashton Kutcher and The Tourist with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp; and shoddy sequels like Sex and the City 2. All arrived at theatres with marketing thunder intended to fill multiplexes on opening weekend, no matter the quality of the film.         
	Sex and the City 2, for example, had marketed girls night out premieres and bottomless stacks of merchandise like thong underwear.         
	But the audience pushed back. One by one, these expensive yet middle-of-the-road pictures delivered disappointing results or flat-out flopped.         
	Meanwhile, gambles on original concepts paid off. Inception, a complicated thriller about dream invaders, racked up more than $825 million in global ticket sales; The Social Network has so far delivered $192 million, a stellar result for a highbrow drama. As a result, studios are finally and fully conceding that moviegoers, armed with Facebook and other networking tools and concerned about escalating ticket prices, are holding them to higher standards. The product has to be good.         
	Cynical cinema buffs will laugh: isnt Hollywood always blathering on about quality yet churning out dross? Perhaps. And there are always exceptions  how else to account for Clash of the Titans, which sold a strong $319 million at the global box office in April despite messy 3-D effects.         
	And as The Last Airbender demonstrated, also with $319 million in ticket sales, there may always be room in the summer for a mindless action movie that the critics cannot stand.         
	Still, the message that the year sent about quality and originality is real enough that studios are tweaking their operating strategies. Sony Pictures Entertainment, the studio behind The Social Network, is trying to bet more heavily on new directors with quirkier sensibilities. To reboot its Spider-Man franchise, for instance, Sony hired Marc Webb, whose only previous film was the indie comedy (500) Days of Summer.         
	At Walt Disney Studios, which has traditionally not worried much about directorial artistry (at least in its live-action films), a new executive team has been busy attaching A-list filmmakers to broad blockbusters. David Fincher, who directed The Social Network, is working on an adaptation of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.         
	Guillermo del Toro, the Pans Labyrinth auteur, is developing a new movie around Disneylands Haunted Mansion ride.

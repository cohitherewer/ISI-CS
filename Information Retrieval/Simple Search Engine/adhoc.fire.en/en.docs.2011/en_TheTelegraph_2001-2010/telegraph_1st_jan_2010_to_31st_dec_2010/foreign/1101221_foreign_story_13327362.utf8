	Anne nudity    
	 London, Dec. 20 (PTI): Anne Hathaway accepts the fact that she has to get naked as an actress and believes every actor should be prepared to strip if the role requires nudity.      
	The Princess Diaries star, who recently posed nude for a number of scenes in Love amp; Other Drugs with actor Jake Gyllenhaal, does not mind stripping in front of the cameras and relies on her co-stars to help her overcome any pre-scene nerves.      
	Doing nudity is really a part of being an actor and you know at some point it might happen. But everyone wants to be respectful of each other and everyone wants each other to feel as comfortable as possible so I think those days have a focus, said Hathaway.    
	Cosy duo    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Just days after announcing their separation, actress Scarlett Johansson and actor Ryan Reynolds got together for a cosy dinner. But the couple are not planning to end their separation and will remain friends as they had announced earlier, reports People magazine. Johansson, 26, who had just returned from a trip to Jamaica, and Reynolds, 34, met in a New York restaurant.

          LAURA ROBERTS                          Lady Gaga: Creativity woes                                  
	Aug. 3: Lady Gaga has revealed that she is perpetually lonely despite becoming one of the most successful pop stars in recent years.        
	 The singer, who is renowned for her adventurous taste in clothes, told Vanity Fair that she is currently celibate and fears that she might lose her creativity if she were to be in a relationship.        
	The 24 year-old said: Im perpetually lonely. Im lonely when Im in relationships. Its my condition as an artist. She said her song Bad Romance was about negative relationships she had had in the past.        
	Lady Gaga said: Im quite celibate now; I dont really get time to meet anyone.         
	She added: I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone theyre going to take my creativity from me.        
	Lady Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, talked about her previous cocaine use after she dropped out of a music course at New York University. Instead of going to rehab she went with her mother to her 82-year-old grandmothers house.        
	Gaga said: I cried. I told her I thought my life was over and I have no hope and Ive worked so hard, and I knew I was good. What would I do now? And she said: Im gonna let you cry for a few more hours. And then after those few hours are up, youre gonna stop crying, youre gonna pick yourself up, youre gonna go back to New York, and youre gonna kick some ass.        
	The star has sold over 15 million albums and 40 million singles to date and is the worlds most popular living person with over 5 million Twitter followers and 10 million Facebook fans.        
	Lady Gaga is not the only pop star to laud the value of abstinence, but she may be among the first to tout it as a boost to creativity. Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers have all worn promise rings to symbolise a pledge of chastity until marriage.

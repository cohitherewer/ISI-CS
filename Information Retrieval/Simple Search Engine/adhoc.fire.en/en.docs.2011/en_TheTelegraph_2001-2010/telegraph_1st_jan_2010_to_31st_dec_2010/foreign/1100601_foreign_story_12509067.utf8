	Klum damper    
	 Los Angeles, May 31 (PTI): Supermodel Heidi Klum ruined the surprise planned for her birthday by husband Seal after she opened the present days before the big day.       
	Klum was helping her husband when she discovered a box filled with a little sparkler inside, reports E! Online. Seal purchased a new piece of jewellery for Klum, who turns 37 on June 1, but his plan was foiled when the German beauty found the hidden treat.      
	Its a pretty flower ring. My husband was going away and he asked me to help him pack a little bit. We were in his closet, and I was looking for things for him to take. I open this box and theres this gorgeous little sparkler in there that was looking into my direction, she said.

	Posh Spice    
	 London (PTI): The Spice Girls are hoping to regroup for another comeback tour but the band members are struggling to convince Victoria Beckham. The group thrilled fans when they returned for a sold-out world trek in 2007 and 2008. After that, Beckham vowed to hang up her microphone. The girls are now reportedly eager to get back on stage and are struggling to persuade Beckham to join them.

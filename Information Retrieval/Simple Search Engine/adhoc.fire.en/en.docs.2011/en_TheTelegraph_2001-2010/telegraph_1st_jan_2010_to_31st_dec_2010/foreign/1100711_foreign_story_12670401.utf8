The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Spy as hot as Anna? Joe wont let go
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Spy as hot as Anna? Joe wont let go
                                Anna Chapman and Joe Biden. (AP and Reuters)                           
	Burbank, California, July 10 (AP): US vice-president Joe Biden had to convince a sceptical Jay Leno yesterday that the US didnt get a raw deal from Russia in the biggest spy swap since the Cold War.        
	Leno asked Biden during a taping of The Tonight Show why the US was sending 10 accused spies back to Russia while getting only four in return.        
	That doesnt seem fair, Leno said.         
	We got back four really good ones, Biden reassured Leno.         
	And the 10, theyve been here a long time, but they hadnt done much.        
	Leno then showed a sultry photo of alleged Russian agent Anna Chapman and asked: Do we have any spies that hot?        
	Bidens reply, in a mock-serious tone: Let me be clear. It was not my idea to send her back.        
	The vice-president also said he had one more suggestion for the deal, which was ignored. I thought theyd take Rush Limbaugh, he said, referring to the popular talk-show host who rails against the Obama administration.        
	The spy exchange took place earlier on Friday on an airport tarmac in Vienna.        
	Biden opened the show in a comedy bit with Leno. It was his first appearance since taking office in January 2009.        
	Before becoming vice-president, Biden had appeared on Tonight several times.         
	On Friday, Leno jabbed Biden for his tendency to make very public gaffes, pointing out an open-microphone expletive Biden uttered when Obama signed health care legislation in April.        
	Biden said he warned Obama before taking the job. I told the President two things when he asked me to do the job, Biden said. I said, Just two conditions, Mr. President. Im not going to wear any funny hats, and Im not changing my brand. And I kept my promise.        
	Biden went on to demonstrate that speaking style when Leno asked him who would win Sundays World Cup final.        
	I think the Netherlands are going to win, but what the hell do I know? he said. I thought LeBron was going to stay.        
	He was referring to the departure of the basketball star from Cleveland Cavaliers to Miami Heat.

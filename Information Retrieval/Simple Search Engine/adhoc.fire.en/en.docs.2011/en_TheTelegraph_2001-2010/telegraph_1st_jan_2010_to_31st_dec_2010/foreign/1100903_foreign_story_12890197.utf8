The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bug bite bother at NY hotel
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bug bite bother at NY hotel
          BARBARA DE LOLLIS                          Lauren Hildebrandt                                  
	Sept. 2: As pop singer Lauren Hildebrandt visits radio and TV stations across the US to promote her new dance hit this autumn, she will be talking another, unlikely subject: nasty bed bugs.        
	Why? Hildebrandt was attacked by the hard-to-kill, blood-sucking pests in an unidentified luxury hotel  that is right, luxury hotel  in New York citys Union Square neighbourhood, a press release that her public relations team issued yesterday says.        
	Hildebrandt says she left the hotel with painful, itchy bed bug bites across her back and shoulders, and now she wants to spread the word to encourage other frequent travellers to take precautions  even in pricey, posh hotels.        
	People should be aware of the danger in NYC hotels right now, Hildebrandt says in the release. I couldnt sleep at night, because I kept thinking they were in my bed.        
	Frequent travellers know the issue well, and bed bugs have been causing a national sensation this summer as they have moved from hotels to a variety of new homes including CNN and Elle magazines midtown Manhattan offices and the Hollister and Abercrombie amp; Fitch stores downtown in Soho.        
	Hildebrandt and Mary Maguire, her mom and manager, say they are not identifying the hotel  at least for now  while the case is being investigated. The hotels identity may never be revealed. The release describes the hotel as being very good in their response to the situation so far.        
	Still, even Maguire, who told Hotel Check-In that she was not personally attacked by bed bugs, says in the release that shes really freaked out about bed bugs while travelling now.        
	Underscoring the incredible difficulty in eliminating bed bugs, they say the hotel in question told them the property had been undergoing weekly searches with specially trained dogs  and the hotels managers personally conduct spot checks on guestrooms. Hildebrandt says she does not blame the hotel.        
	The traveller has to be diligent, Hildebrandt says. I travel constantly, as it is a huge part of my profession. I will now always look at my hotel bed before agreeing to take the room.

	Ashton Kutcher, Ryan Seacrest and other Hollywood celebrities have also joined the Twitter campaign. Starting today, the participants will send out tweets encouraging the public to donate to buy bednets which guard against the mosquitoes that spread malaria in Africa.        
	Gates will also take part in TV charity fundraiser Idol Gives Back to promote the fight against malaria and other health causes.        
	Organisers of the Twitter fund-raising push are working with the UN special envoy for malaria, Ray Chambers. Its one of the few campaigns Im aware of where $10 buys a bednet which can save a childs life, Chambers said.

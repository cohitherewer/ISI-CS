The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US offers Pak army $2bn aid
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US offers Pak army $2bn aid
          ERIC SCMITT AND DAVID E. SANGER                          Clinton in Washington. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Oct. 22: Even as the Obama administration moved to stop training and aiding Pakistani army units that have killed civilians in the offensive against the Taliban, the US said today that it planned increased aid for Pakistans military over the next five years.        
	Secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton made the announcement in Washington with the Pakistani foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, as leaders from both nations convened for a series of meetings.        
	The new aid package, totalling $2 billion, is meant to replace one that expired on October 1. It would complement $7.5 billion in aid that the US has already pledged to Pakistan for civilian projects, some of which have been directed towards helping the nation recover from the damaging floods.        
	In announcing the aid, Clinton did not discuss the administrations moves to stop financing certain elements in the Pakistani army that have killed unarmed prisoners and civilians.        
	Yesterday, senior administration and Congressional officials said that the Obama administration planned to cut off funds to those units. The step appeared to be an unusual rebuke to a wartime ally, illustrating the growing tensions with a country that is seen as a pivotal partner, and sometimes impediment, in a campaign to root out al Qaida and other militant groups.        
	The White House had not told Pakistan of the decision to cut off those units funds, according to officials from both countries. It has privately briefed a few senior members of Congress, but it has not given them details about which Pakistani units will be affected by the suspension.        
	One senior administration official said there was a lot of concern about not embarrassing the Pakistani military, especially during a week in which officials are here for the third Strategic Dialogue in a year. Yesterdays decision to cut to cut off those units funds came just as the two countries were trying to get beyond a sharp exchange after Nato helicopter gunships killed three Pakistani paramilitary troops.

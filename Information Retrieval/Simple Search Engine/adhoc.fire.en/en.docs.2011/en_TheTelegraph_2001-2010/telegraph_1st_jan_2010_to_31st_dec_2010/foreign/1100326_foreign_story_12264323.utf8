	Reese in love    
	 London, March 25 (PTI): Reese Witherspoon is so much in love with her new boyfriend Jim Toth that she acts like a schoolgirl around him.      
	The actress, who split form long-term partner Jake Gyllenhaal last year, began dating the Hollywood agent earlier this year and her friends insist she is completely smitten, reports the National Enquirer.      
	Reese is normally super-private about her love life, but she acts like a schoolgirl when it comes to Jim. She has a spark with him that was just never there with Jake, a friend said.    
	Texting dog    
	 Las Vegas (Reuters): With most Americans already toting mobile phones, AT amp;T Inc now wants to target their dogs. A wireless dog collar could send text messages or emails to the owner of a pet when it strays outside a certain area, or it could allow tracking of the pet. Other gadgets include a pill box that reminds people to take their medicine.

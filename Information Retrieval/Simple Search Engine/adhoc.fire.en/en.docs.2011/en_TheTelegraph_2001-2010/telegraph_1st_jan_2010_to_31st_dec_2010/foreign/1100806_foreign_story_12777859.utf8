	Aug. 5: Conflict diamonds, or so-called blood diamonds, are rough diamonds used by rebel dictators to fund wars against legitimate governments.        
	The precious stones are at the heart of former Liberian leader Charles Taylors war crimes trial in The Hague, who allegedly used them to buy weapons for Sierra Leones Revolutionary United Front.        
	Conflict diamonds are defined by the UN as diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognised governments, and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the Security Council.        
	Under a UN resolution, an international certification scheme for rough diamonds was set up in 2003 to halt the trading of blood diamonds, in an effort to ensure they could not be used to finance conflict. As a result the Kimberley Process, which controls rough diamond production and trade, came into being and is now in action in 75 countries which account for 99.8 per cent of the worlds rough diamonds.        
	Through the scheme  named after the South African city where the agreement was reached  all diamonds traded by member countries are certified so that buyers can be sure they have not contributed to atrocities. There is no international law on the trading of blood diamonds but countries who have signed up to the Kimberley Process are prevented from importing or exporting them through domestic laws.

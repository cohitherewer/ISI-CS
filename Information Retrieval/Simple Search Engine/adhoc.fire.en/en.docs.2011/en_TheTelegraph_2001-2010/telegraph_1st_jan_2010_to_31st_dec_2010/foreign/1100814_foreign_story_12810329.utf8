The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fonseka stripped of rank
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fonseka stripped of rank
  - General will lose military status if sentence is approved                            Fonseka: Under pressure                                  
	Colombo, Aug. 13 (Reuters): A Sri Lankan court martial today stripped the general who spearheaded the armys victory over Tamil separatists of his military ranks after finding him guilty of involvement in politics while in uniform.        
	General Sarath Fonsekas conviction, which had been widely expected, and sentence still have to be approved and signed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa.        
	He was found guilty of charges and sentenced to dishonourable discharge from rank and service, pending the Presidents approval, a military source said on condition of anonymity. Another military source confirmed the sentence.        
	An official at the Presidential Secretariat said that he had been cashiered subject to the Presidents approval.        
	Fonseka, who has been held in military custody at navy headquarters, will lose his military status, including his four-star general rank and pension, if Rajapaksa signs the document.        
	One of Fonsekas lawyers said he had not been informed of the courts decision but that it would be challenged if true.        
	Fonseka lost the presidential election to Rajapaksa in January before being arrested by the military on February 8.        
	He then contested the April general election and became an MP, which wont be affected by the courts decision.        
	Fonseka and defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the Presidents brother, led the military defeat of the LTTE after 25 years of war in May last year. Fonseka had stood side-by-side with Rajapaksa after the Tigerss defeat, but fell out later over what he said was false accusations of planning a coup.        
	Thousands of civilians were killed in the final months of the war as the army, led by Fonseka, bore down on the Tigers. The UN, US and rights groups have urged some kind of accountability for possible war crimes. Sri Lanka has adamantly refused an external probe but on Wednesday launched its own probe.

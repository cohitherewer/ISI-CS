                              EASY SCENE                            
	July 24: Angelina Jolie, the Hollywood actress, has disclosed she was injured while filming for Salt, her new spy action thriller in a stunt accident that left her scarred.        
	The A-list actress performed her own stunts in the film where she plays a character called Evelyn Salt. The role required her to jump across highway overpasses onto semi trucks, perform hand-to-hand combat and handle a number of different weapons.        
	Jolie, 35, said she sliced open part of her face just above her nose when tumbling into a doorway with a gun. Speaking at the Comic-Con festival in San Diego, California, she said it had come during a ridiculously easy scene, which involved her rolling onto the floor. It has left her with a permanent scar. She also thought she had suffered a concussion because she could not hear anything.

	Bangkok, April 28 (Reuters): Thai troops fired in the air and shot rubber bullets in a chaotic clash with anti-government protesters on a highway in Bangkoks suburbs today that wounded at least 16 people and possibly killed one soldier.        
	Troops and riot police tried to stop a convoy of up to 2,000 red shirt protesters on pickup trucks and motorcycles who had left central Bangkok in defiance of a state of emergency.        
	About 100 protesters had moved ahead of the main convoy, charging the troops and riot police, who used batons and shields to push them back. Some red shirts fought back by hurling stones and shooting metal balls from sling-shots, witnesses said.        
	Three rounds of clashes stopped only when a powerful tropical rainstorm moved over the traffic-choked area about 40km from central Bangkok on Vipawadee-Rangsit road.        
	A Reuters photographer said a soldier was shot through his helmet and believed dead.        
	The photographer, who witnessed the shooting, said the soldier and at least five others were on motorbikes heading towards a cordon of police and troops behind shields when gunfire erupted. It was not immediately clear who shot him.        
	The state-run Erawan Medical Centre said at least 18 people were wounded, but gave no further details. It said it could not immediately confirm that a soldier had been killed.        
	Some vehicles in the main convoy have left the site, but some protesters are still scattered throughout the area and troops remain massed along the highway.                  An injured soldier is rushed to hospital after clashes with anti-government supporters in Bangkok on Wednesday. The soldier later died. (AFP)       
	Government spokesman Panitan Wattayagorn told Reuters security forces were still trying to take control of the highway        
	The protesters, honking horns and singing, began the day in high spirits, heading for a market 50km away, leaving thousands of others back at their fortified encampment in central Bangkok, which they have occupied since April 3.        
	But the latest incident in Thailands prolonged political crisis, following last Thursdays grenade attacks and an April 10 clash that killed a total of 26 people and wounded 900, has raised fears of more violence to come.        
	The seven-week crisis has further widened a political chasm between the rural masses and working poor that support the red shirts and what they call a traditional elite that has long run Thailand. It has also started to squeeze southeast Asias second-biggest economy.

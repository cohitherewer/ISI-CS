The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | iPhone 4 has design flaw, says magazine
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      iPhone 4 has design flaw, says magazine
          NICK BILTON                          An iPhone 4                                  
	July 12: Product review magazine Consumer Reports said in a blog post and accompanying video today that widely reported signal problems with the iPhone 4, Apples latest mobile phone, are a result of a flaw in the phones antenna design, and that it cannot recommend purchasing the phone.         
	That contradicts earlier claims by Apple that the problems are a software issue.        
	The magazine said its engineers performed a series of tests on three separate iPhone 4s inside a controlled lab environment known as a radio frequency isolation chamber. They found that when the bottom left corner of the iPhone is touched it can sometimes lose enough signal strength to drop calls.        
	Consumer Reports said the tests led it to conclude that cannot recommend the iPhone 4 to consumers until Apple fixes the hardware problem. It also questioned Apples honesty on the antenna issues:        
	When reports first started to surface of a reception flaw in the new phone, Steven P. Jobs, Apples chief executive, said to a customer in an email that he was simply holding the phone incorrectly. Technology writers lambasted the company for this comment.        
	Consumer Reports also tested several other phones, including the earlier iPhone 3GS and Palm Pre, and reported that none of those phones had the signal-loss problems of the iPhone 4. The report also said AT amp;Ts network did not appear to play a primary role in the iPhone 4s signal woes.

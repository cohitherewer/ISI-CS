	 Los Angeles, July 9 (PTI): Gwyneth Paltrow has launched a new cookbook in memory of her father Bruce, who succumbed to pneumonia in 2002.      
	Calling her father the love of her life, the Iron Man star said that she was dedicating the book titled My Fathers Daughter as she feels close to him whenever she cooks new dishes, reported Vogue magazine online. I always felt closest to my father, who was the love of my life until his death in 2002, when I am in the kitchen, said Paltrow.

	 New York (Reuters): Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese was sued $600,000 on Thursday for bookkeeping costs and other services provided by jailed financial advisor Kenneth Starr. Starr Investment advisors managed Scorseses money from 2006 to 2010, but The Departed director failed to pay the companys fee of five per cent of earned income, according to a complaint filed by company receiver Aurora Cassirer in New York State Supreme court.      
	Starr, 66, is accused of stealing at least $59 million from celebrities, including Scorsese, actors Uma Thurman, Al Pacino and others.

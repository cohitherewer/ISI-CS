                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      At last! William plans to marry Kate in 2011
          AMIT ROY                          William and Kate in London on Tuesday. (AFP)                                  
	London, Nov. 16: So its official  Prince William is to marry his long-time girlfriend, Kate Middleton, next year.        
	 Ever since they met as undergraduates at the University of St Andrews in Scotland in 2001, rumour has been rife they would marry  and this morning Clarence House, on behalf of Prince Charles, the proud father, announced they would.        
	 The Queen and Prince Philip, no doubt relieved the couple, both 28, have chosen formally to tie the knot rather than live together, as is more common today among the young, said they were absolutely delighted.        
	 One day, Catherine Elizabeth Middleton, a commoner from a respectable if undistinguished middle class family, will probably be styled Queen Catherine. Her self-made millionaire father, Michael, and her mother, Carole, a former air hostess, run a mail order business and live in a modern five-bedroom detached house in Bucklebury, a small village near Newbury, Berkshire.        
	 The wedding, which will take place in spring or summer next year and provide a huge boost to the British economy, will be a great state occasion with tourists flooding into London for the event.        
	 It may be held in St Pauls Cathedral, where Charles and Diana married in 1981, but since that marriage ended in divorce and tragedy another venue may be picked. Westminster Abbey, where the Queen and Prince Philip married in 1947, is the obvious alternative.        
	 The announcement, which has been anticipated almost on a daily basis for years by tabloid newspapers, finally came today in a statement from Clarence House. The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince William to Miss Catherine Middleton, it said. The wedding will take place in the spring or summer of 2011, in London. Further details about the wedding day will be announced in due course.                  William gave his most prized possession mdash; his late   mother rsquo;s engagement ring mdash; to his fianc eacute;e. Kate, showing off the blue sapphire 
  ring (in picture on left), said joining the royal family was a ldquo;daunting prospect rdquo;. The prince added: ldquo;It was my way of making sure my mother didn rsquo;t miss out on the excitement. rdquo; (AP)      
	It revealed: Prince William and Miss Middleton became engaged in October during a private holiday in Kenya. Prince William has informed The Queen and other close members of his family. Prince William has also sought the permission of Miss Middletons father. Following the marriage, the couple will live in north Wales, where Prince William will continue to serve with the Royal Air Force.  
	 William was with British troops on Remembrance Sunday in Helmand province in Afghanistan but he will never be allowed to serve on the frontline.        
	 When David Cameron broke todays news at a cabinet meeting at 10, Downing Street today, his ministerial colleagues thumped the table to mark their approval. The prime minister disclosed he had telephoned William to congratulate him. He was obviously extremely excited about the news and thrilled about what lies in store. I just said that obviously the government stood ready to do anything we could to help make sure that what I know will be a great day of national celebration will be a great success.        
	 Cameron disclosed: I remember when I was young, when Williams mother got married  I slept on the Mall that night and joined in the celebrations. Im sure lots of people will want to celebrate in lots of different ways.        
	 This morning St Andrews got in on the act and indicated it was the university to come to for pupils who wished to specialise in romance and marriage  a bit like Presidency College or Scottish Church in Calcutta in the old days.         
	 St Andrews is a special place  one in 10 of our students meet their future partner here, and our title as Britains top match-making university signifies so much that is good about this community, a spokesman enthused. 2011 will see the launch of our 600th anniversary celebrations and we will be proud to share our anniversary with the royal couple.        
	 Kates parents mail order business, Party Pieces, sells toys and party paraphernalia, but on grounds of taste and propriety it will not be able to cash in on the demand now for wedding souvenirs.        
	 The business has been profitable enough to finance Kates education at the Pound15,000 a year co-educational public school, Marlborough College. Born on January 9, 1982, Kate is just a little older than William, whose date of birth is June 21, 1981. Kate, who excelled at netball at school and captained the hockey team, has two younger siblings, Pippa and James.         
	 In 2001, after Eton, William chose to study history of art at St Andrews. Kate was doing the same course.        
	 She apparently caught his eye as an attractive undergraduate shortly after he arrived in the small and windswept Scottish town of Fife, witnesses recalled.         
	William forked out 200 for a front seat at a charity student fashion show where Kate strode confidently down the catwalk in a see-through lace dress which revealed her black underwear.        
	 Kate is credited with persuading the prince to continue his studies when he considered quitting as he struggled to adjust to university life during his first year. He later switched to geography.        
	 He and Kate moved into a shared house with two other friends in 2002 and reportedly became a couple around Christmas 2003. William was listed in the graduation ceremony programme as William Wales, Tetbury, Gloucestershire  Geography, while Kate was entered as Catherine Elizabeth Middleton, Bucklebury, Berkshire - Art History.        
	 Unlike his younger brother, Harry, William did not play the field with a host of willing girls.        
	 William and Kate briefly split up in April 2007, probably because she got fed up with waiting, but were back together within weeks.        
	 Now that Kate is to join The Firm, as the royal family is often called, the commoner will have to be groomed for her new role, for unlike her late mother-in-law, the erstwhile Diana Spencer, born to wealth and privilege, she is not a member of the landed aristocracy. But then high earning footballers, such as Wayne Rooney, are now part of the new aristocracy in an England that has much in common with the Bengal represented in Satyajit Rays Jalshaghar.        
	 There will be tiaras to wear, jewels to inherit, elaborate gowns to pick for state banquets, prime ministers to meet, presidents to entertain and gifts from foreign royals to collect, royal experts predicted today. Servants  from valets, dressers and hairdressers to butlers, private secretaries and cooks  will become the norm. If she chooses to, she can be waited on hand and foot. She will live off money from the Prince of Waless cash cow the Duchy of Cornwall, which provides William with his private expenses, and will one day live at Buckingham Palace.        
	 It is all a dream come true for Kate. She had a schoolgirl crush on the prince and was dubbed Princess-in-Waiting for having a poster of him in his polo gear on her wall.

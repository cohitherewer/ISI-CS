	Dhaka, Feb. 16 (PTI) Bangladesh plans to rename all government institutions named after former President Ziaur Rahman.        
	The decision comes a day after the government re-christened the Zia International Airport as Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at a cabinet meeting last night. This sparked a strong protest from the Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).        
	Rahman, who was the President of Bangladesh from 1976 to 1981, founded the BNP, currently being led by his wife Khaleda Zia. According to the cabinet decision no institutions will bear the name of Ziaur Rahman following the high court verdict, Prime Minister Hasinas press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said.        
	The cabinet also decided to change Shaheed Ziaur Rahman University, Barisal, to Barisal University.

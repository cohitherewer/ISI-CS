The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Aussie vote too close
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Aussie vote too close
                                  
	Canberra, Aug. 21 (AP): Australians chose today between giving their first female Prime Minister her own election mandate and returning to a conservative government after just three years.        
	With 70 per cent of the vote counted, the result was too close to call.        
	A record number of votes cast for independents and Australian Greens party candidates could decide the outcome, with the possibility growing that the mainstream parties will need to strike a deal with fringe groups to form a government. Such a coalition would be the first in 70 years. Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan said it would take days of counting before it was clear who could form a government.         
	Its very close. I think its just too early to come to that conclusion, Swan told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television, referring to the possibility that his centre-left Labour Party had lost the government.        
	Prime Minister Julia Gillard, a cheerfully charismatic and sharp-witted 48-year-old former lawyer, came to power in a June 24 internal coup in her party during the first term of her predecessor, and almost immediately called elections to confirm her mandate.        
	She was vying against Tony Abbott, a married 52-year-old former Roman Catholic seminarian with three daughters who barely gained the endorsement eight months ago of his conservative Liberal Party, which has led Australia for most of the last 60 years. Australians have not dumped a first-term government since 1931.

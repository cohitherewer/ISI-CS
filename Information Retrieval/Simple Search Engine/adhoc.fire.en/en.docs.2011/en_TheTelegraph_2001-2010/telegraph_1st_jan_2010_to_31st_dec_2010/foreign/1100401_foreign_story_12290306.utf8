          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, March 31: Pakistans anti-corruption watchdog has asked Swiss authorities to re-open all corruption cases including the one against President Asif ali Zardari in move that may endanger Zardaris stay in the presidency.         
	The move came a day after the powerful Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry have a 24-hour deadline to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to get in touch with Swiss authorities for re-opening of all cases of corruption under its recent judgement that struck down the infamous National reconciliation Ordinance (NRO), which was promulgated by former military dictator Pervez Musharraf and granted amnesty to over 8,000 people including politicians as part of a power sharing deal with Pakistan Peoples Party.         
	Interestingly, the NAB was set up by Musharraf in 2000 to try corrupt politicians, bureaucrats, businessmen and armed forces personnel.         
	Officials in NAB, who held a lengthy meeting on Tuesday after the apex courts deadline, said in Islamabad that the watchdog has asked Swiss authorities to re-open all corruption cases including the one against President Zardari. The court had also threatend to jail the NAB chairman, Naveed Ahsan, who is already on a long leave.         
	Meanwhile, the Supreme Court was informed on Tuesday that an action had already been taken and a process initiated to re-open the cases. The NAB told the court that a formal request was being sent to geneva through the foreign office.         
	The cases had been closed after a formal communication by Malik Qayyum, a former attorney general and a close confidant of General Musharraf in 2007 dasy after the latter slapped emergency in the country and sacked over 60 judges including justice Chaudhry.         
	The court had also asked the government to quot;proceed against Qayyum in accordance with law for quot;addressing unauthorized communications which had resulted in unlawful abandonment of claims of the government of Pakistan , inter alia, to huge amounts of the allegedly laundered moneys lying in foreign countries including Switzerland quot;.         
	The new development comes at a time when the Pakistan Peoples Party-led coalition government prepares to table a new amendment bill in the parliament to dratically curtail presidential powers including those relating to dismissal of the government and dissolution of National Assembly , which had been incorporated by Musharraf in the constitution.         
	Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani repeatedly assured the court that his government would implement its judgement on NRO.         
	The amnesty deal also paved way for Bhutto to return home from an eight-year self-exile in October 2007. But she was killed in a gun and suicide attack during an election rally in Rawalpindi on December 27,2007, clearing the way for Zardari to be nominated for office of the President by his Pakistan Peoples Party in August 2008.         
	The government has been under pressure from its former ally, Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) to re-open all corruption cases.         
	Former two-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , who was ousted from power by Musharraf in October 1999, did not receive any benefit from the proposed legislation as it convered only politicians up to October 12, 1999.

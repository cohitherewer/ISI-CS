The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran hits back at Carla Bruni
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Iran hits back at Carla Bruni
                              Morally corrupt                            
	Tehran, Aug. 30 (AP): Iranian state media called Frances First Lady, Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, a prostitute today in an unusual attack on the wife of a world leader that shows deep anger over her support for an Iranian woman who faced death by stoning on an adultery conviction.        
	The wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy has condemned the stoning sentence against Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, which Iran temporarily suspended.        
	Ashtiani, a 43-year-old mother of two, could still face execution by stoning or hanging after a final review of her case, her lawyer, Javid Houtan Kian, said today.        
	The Kayhan newspaper, whose editor is a representative of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, described Bruni-Sarkozy as a prostitute on Saturday in an article headlined French prostitutes enter the human rights uproar.        
	The state-owned news website inn.ir carried similar remarks today. Although Bruni, the morally corrupt singer and actress of Italian (origin), was able to break the Sarkozy family and marry the French President, lately new reports have emerged about her affair with a singer, said the weekend report in Kayhan.        
	The French Presidents office declined to comment on the remarks. The media attack was in response to an open letter Bruni-Sarkozy wrote to Ashtiani that was printed in several French news outlets last week.

          RICHARD EDWARDS                          extreme                                  
	London, March 6: The alma mater of Labour MP Jacqui Smith and journalist Fiona Bruce, Hertford College, Oxford, has built a proud reputation for launching the careers of some of the countrys most influential women.        
	But this years intake of female freshers quickly discovered that their intellect was the last thing their male counterparts were interested in.        
	Members of a male college drinking society known as the Penguin Club compiled a secret list of fitties and compared notes in a series of emails which included pictures of the targets they planned to lure to a drunken party.        
	Under one girls photograph someone wrote only if were desperate and beside another picture was written buy condoms. A third remark about a girl said saw her get battered on Sat... although not all that great.        
	However, the Hertford women had the last laugh when it emerged yesterday that all 15 members of the drinking club have been suspended. It comes after the private emails were posted around the college in the middle of the night by an unknown whistleblower, who exposed the sexist hit list.        
	One female student said: The behaviour [of the Penguins] was at the extreme end of sexually aggressive and predatory. The womens welfare representative at the college, Phoebe Arnold, also condemned them.        
	The actions and values of the Penguins are certainly not representative of anyone else at Hertford. Id be loath for anyone to think that. Students have been informed that their bar will be closed as a result of the events.

	Washington, Jan 28 (PTI): President Obama last night said in his first State of the Union address that he would slash tax breaks to American firms that move jobs abroad.        
	A report by IT consultancy firm Forrester Research estimates that 3.3 million American jobs will be lost to outsourcing in 15 years ending 2015. Already, half of the Indian IT-BPO industrys $71.7 billion revenue comes from the US.         
	Obama said: Now, the House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps (to slash tax breaks). As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same.

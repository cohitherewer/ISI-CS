The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lohan returns to prison in handcuffs
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lohan returns to prison in handcuffs
                              Lohan at the Beverly Hills court on Friday. (Reuters)                            
	Beverly Hills, Sept. 24 (AP): Actress Lindsay Lohan returned to jail in handcuffs today after a judge refused to set bail and ordered her to remain in custody for failing a drug test until another hearing nearly a month away.        
	Bailiffs handcuffed Lohan immediately after the hearing that lasted less than 10 minutes at the Beverly Hills courthouse. Lohans father, Michael Lohan, said Oh God as his daughter rose, looked at her attorney and was handcuffed.        
	Los Angeles superior court Judge Elden S. Fox would not listen to arguments for bail from Lohans attorney, Shawn Chapman Holley. It will be Lohans third jail stint for a three-year-old drug and drunken driving case filed after a pair of high-profile arrests in 2007.        
	Lohan has twice been released early because of overcrowding, with her longest jail stay a 14-day stint on a 90-day sentence earlier this summer.        
	But this time, the judges order diminishes the likelihood that Lohan will be released before an October 22 hearing, when her positive drug test will be discussed.        
	The judge said probation officials are also reviewing Lohans compliance with other aspects of her probation, which included frequent meetings with counsellors.        
	 Holley was not immediately available for comment. Court spokesman Allan Parachini said she remained in the courtroom to confer with Lohan.        
	Lohan acknowledged failing a court-ordered drug screening last week in a series of Twitter postings.         
	Lohan arrived at the court today about 10 minutes before the hearing was set to start, wearing sunglasses and accompanied by her mother, Dina.         
	It was the Mean Girls stars first appearance before Fox, who had said at a previous hearing he would sentence her to a month in jail for each drug test she skipped or failed. The actress was not present for that hearing, which was held hours after her release from rehab.        
	Lohan seemed to acknowledge an addiction problem after news of her positive drug test broke last week. Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesnt go away over night, Lohan posted on her Twitter feed last Friday. I am working hard to overcome it. This is certainly a setback for me but I am taking responsibility for my actions and Im prepared to face the consequences, her posts said.

	London, April 1: A six-year-old girl suffered months of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of 23 classmates but nobody will be held accountable because those involved were too young.        
	 Child A was stripped on a daily basis and routinely assaulted by children of her own age. But a combination of the childrens young ages and a lack of firm evidence left both her teachers and local council to conclude that little could be done. As a result, all the abusers were allowed to remain at the school.        
	The victims mother, who learned of the abuse from another parent, eventually moved her daughter to another school in a different area.        
	Her calls for an investigation were ignored until she took legal action, which prompted the local authority to launch a serious case review. Its officers then took two years before publishing their findings today        
	The review concluded that while Child A had undoubtedly been the victim of sexually harmful behaviour, it was impossible to establish exactly what happened. The school and the local education authority said the fact that the abusers were under the age of criminal responsibility meant little action could be taken.

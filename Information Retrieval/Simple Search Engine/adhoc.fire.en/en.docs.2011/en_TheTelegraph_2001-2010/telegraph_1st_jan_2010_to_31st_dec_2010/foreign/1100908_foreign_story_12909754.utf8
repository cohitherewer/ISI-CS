	Sydney, Sept. 7: Prime Minister Julia Gillard will form a minority government after two independent legislators voiced their support for her today and gave the Centre-Left Labour Party a second three-year term of rule in Australia, ending more than two weeks of political impasse.        
	Ive learned some lessons and the Australian government has learned some lessons, Gillard said at a news conference in Canberra, the capital. The Australian people have sent us a message about needless partisanship and bickering.        
	In a dramatic piece of political theatre earlier in the day, lawmakers Rob Oakeshott and Tony Windsor told a room packed with reporters that they would support Gillards government, giving her Labour party a one-vote majority of 76 in the 150-seat House of Representatives.        
	The announcements by Windsor and Oakeshott came after a third independent legislator, Bob Katter, earlier in the day threw his support behind the Opposition conservative leader, Tony Abbott.        
	This is not a mandate for either party, Oakeshott said, saying Gillards coalition will need to work with independent legislators from rural Australia to win passage on proposals.

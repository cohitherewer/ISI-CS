                              Sen: Sharp words                            
	Washington, Oct. 21 (AFP): Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen has pleaded for greater global scrutiny on Myanmars upcoming elections, warning the vote could hugely set back democracy efforts.        
	The academic, who spent part of his childhood in Myanmar, criticised what he saw as a lack of attention worldwide over the vote and reserved his sharpest words for India.        
	The military regime of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, plans its first election in 20 years on November 7. It has banned foreign observers and media, and has kept Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest.        
	Nothing perhaps is more important right now as the day of the phony electoral event approaches than global public discussion of the real nature of the forthcoming electoral fraud, the Harvard University professor said yesterday.        
	The expressions of pious hope that things can change after the election are totally contrary to reasoned analysis about whats going on in Burma, Sen said in a lecture at Johns Hopkins University.        
	A propaganda victory for the regime, by muddying the water for democracy in Burma now, can put things hugely back, Sen said.        
	Sen called for the immediate launch of a UN investigation into alleged crimes against humanity by the junta, which is accused of destroying thousands of villages.        
	Sen criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for welcoming Myanmars military leader Than Shwe in July. He said the nation of Mahatma Gandhi, because of concerns of Chinas role, had wound up emulating the communist nation and losing its idealism. It breaks my heart to see the Prime Minister of my democratic country  and one of the most humane and sympathetic political leaders in the world  engage in welcoming the butchers from Myanmar and to be photographed in a state of cordial proximity, Sen said.        
	When our power to influence the world was zero, we spent our time lecturing the world on morality. And when we get a bit of power, although not as much as China, then we completely abdicated that responsibility.

	Madrid, Nov. 4 (AP): Spanish social workers have inspected the home of a 10-year-old Romanian girl who gave birth last week to determine whether her baby is being properly cared for, officials said today.        
	Authorities in the small city of Lebrija also arranged a doctors appointment to make sure the young mother and infant are doing well.        
	The girls mother told reporters earlier this week that shes delighted to have a new granddaughter and doesnt understand the fuss the birth has caused. She said the babys father is a 13-year-old boy who is still in Romania.        
	She also said since they are Romanian Gypsies, or Roma, it is their custom to marry very young. The birth has shocked Spaniards and created an international sensation.

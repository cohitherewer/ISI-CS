	New York, Sept. 14 (PTI): Jamaican reggae king Bob Marleys family has lost a lawsuit seeking the copyrights to some of his best-known recordings, including cult hits like I Shot the Sheriff and No Woman, No Cry.        
	US judge Denise Cote ruled that Universal Music Group (UMG) owned the copyright to five albums the late star recorded between 1973 and 1977 for Island Records, reported the New York Post. Marleys widow and children had sought millions in damages for UMGs alleged attempts to exploit his recordings.        
	The albums in question, Catch a Fire, Burnin, Natty Dread, Rastaman Vibrations and Exodus, were recorded by Marley with his band The Wailers. His greatest hits compilation, Legend, is the biggest-selling reggae album.

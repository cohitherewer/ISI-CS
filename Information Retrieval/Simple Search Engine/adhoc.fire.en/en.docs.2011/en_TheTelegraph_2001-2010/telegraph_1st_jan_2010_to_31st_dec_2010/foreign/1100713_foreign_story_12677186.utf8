	Elle for learning    
	 London, July 12 (PTI): Supermodel and hostess of the show, Britains Next Top Model, Elle Macpherson ranks education higher than good looks.      
	Macpherson, 47, says that a sharp brain always helps to go further in life. She believes intelligent models do not depend just on their looks, reports Tatler magazine.      
	Macpherson, who has two sons with business tycoon Arpad Busson, realises the importance of education, specially for girls.       
	My advice would be to get an education. Its much more interesting for girls to be educated and be beautiful because they are a lot of simply pretty girls out there, Macpherson said.

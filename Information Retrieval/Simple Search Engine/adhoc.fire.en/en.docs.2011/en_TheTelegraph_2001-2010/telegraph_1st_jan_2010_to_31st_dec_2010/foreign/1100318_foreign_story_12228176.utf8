	London, March 17 (Reuters): Christies has put a record price tag on an important Picasso painting from his celebrated Blue Period that will be offered for sale in London in June.        
	Portrait of Angel Fernandez de Soto (The Absinthe Drinker), dated 1903, is expected to fetch $45-60 million at an auction on June 23, the highest pre-sale estimate for any work of art offered at auction in Europe.

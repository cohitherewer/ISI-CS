	Shanghai, June 1: A man carrying a mini machine gun burst into a court in central China, killing three judges before turning the gun on himself.        
	The attacker, named as Zhu Jun, the 46-year-old head of security at a district post office, broke into a fourth-floor office at the court building in Yongzhou, Hunan province.        
	He had allegedly told his co-worker at the post office that he was taking the automatic weapon and two pistols for inspection before diverting to the courthouse.         
	 All three judges in the office were killed while three other court staff were wounded, said a spokesman for the local propaganda department.        
	 According to the state media, Zhu was taking revenge on the court for ruling against him in his divorce case three years ago.

	Nov. 8: The Large Hadron Collider has succeeded in recreating a miniature version of the Big Bang by smashing stripped-down lead atoms together.        
	The reaction created temperatures a million times hotter than the centre of the Sun, which have not been reached since the first billionths of a second following the Big Bang.        
	This was expected to cause atomic particles such as protons and neutrons to melt, producing a soup of matter.        
	Scientists will now study the particles in the hope of discovering what holds atoms together and gives them their mass. The collisions were produced by firing lead ions  atoms with their electrons removed  at incredible speeds at the LHCs underground tunnel at Cern.

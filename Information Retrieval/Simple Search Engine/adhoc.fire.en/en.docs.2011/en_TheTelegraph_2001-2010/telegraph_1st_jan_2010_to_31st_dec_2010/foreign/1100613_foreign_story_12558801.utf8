                              ANGRY SNAPS                            
	Los Angeles, June 12 (Reuters): The family of a 17-year-old teenager has accused actress Jodie Foster of being rough with the boy after he snapped photographs of the Oscar-winning actress and her sons outside a movie theatre.        
	Fosters spokeswoman fired back yesterday that the young man was most definitely a professional paparazzo.         
	She did touch him on the arm to try to take him aside to talk to him and tell him to stop taking pictures, the actresss spokeswoman, Jennifer Allen, told Reuters.        
	A report filed with Los Angeles police hours after the May 29 incident said Foster went up to the unidentified teen after he had snapped pictures of her, and that she poked him on the chest and grabbed his left arm.

	Beyonce glitch    
	 London, April 27 (PTI): She has successfully avoided wardrobe malfunctions on stage while wearing the skimpiest of outfits.       
	However, the paparazzi managed to capture Beyonce Knowles spilling out of a swimsuit. The singer revealed more than she bargained for as she leaned back on a beach in Hawaii and accidentally flashed her breasts, reports the Daily Mail.      
	Unfazed, the star carried on fooling around with her friends and family as husband Jay-Z clicked pictures.       
	At one point, she laughed her head off as her friends buried her up to her neck in the sand. After adjusting her swimsuit, Knowles went for a dip in the ocean to wash off all the sand.

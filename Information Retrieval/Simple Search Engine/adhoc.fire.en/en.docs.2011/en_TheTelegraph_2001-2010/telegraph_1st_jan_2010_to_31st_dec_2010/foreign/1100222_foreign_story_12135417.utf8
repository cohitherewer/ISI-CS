                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Taliban behead Sikhs in Pak
                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 21 (PTI): Two Sikhs who were kidnapped over a month ago have been beheaded by the Pakistani Taliban in the countrys restive tribal belt.        
	Some more members of the minority community are still in the custody of the rebels.        
	The body of Jaspal Singh was found in the Khyber tribal region near Peshawar while the body of Mahal Singh was found in the Orakzai area, sources said tonight.        
	There was confusion about the total number of Sikhs who had been kidnapped for ransom from the Bara area of Khyber area by the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan. A source said four Sikhs were abducted while another report said the total number of kidnapped persons was six.        
	The Sikhs were kidnapped 34 days ago and the Taliban had demanded Rs 30 million as ransom. Two of the kidnapped Sikhs were beheaded after the expiry of the deadline for the payment of the ransom, sources said.        
	Gurvinder Singh and Gurjit Singh are still in the custody of the militants. The kidnapping occurred in an area where there the government has virtually no control and the militants are in a dominant position.        
	A sizeable number of Sikhs lived in the tribal belt till the Taliban imposed jiziya or a religious tax last year. Most members of the community then fled to cities across Pakistan.         
	According to unconfirmed reports, the Taliban had dumped the heads of the two victims at a gurudwara in Peshawar.        
	An estimated 10,000 Sikhs live in the North West Frontier Province and the tribal areas, descendants of those who chose not to move to India during the partition in 1947.        
	In 2009, the Taliban there forced the minority Sikh population to pay it lakhs of rupees as religious tax.        
	The community has been facing an uncertain future after fleeing clashes between security forces and the Taliban.        
	Brigadier Mehmood Shah, former security secretary of Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan described, the Taliban act as horrendous and said they must be condemned in the strongest terms. It is really a horrendous act. It is really shameful, he told a TV channel.         
	The reports have shocked New Delhi but there was no comment from the government. We are aware of these media reports. If it is true then its a matter of shock. We are ascertaining the facts, an official said.        
	The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee today strongly condemned the beheading and asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to take up the matter with his Pakistani counterpart.

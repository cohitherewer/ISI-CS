	Port-au-Prince, April 13 (Reuters): Michelle Obama made an unannounced visit to earthquake-hit Haiti today at the start of her first solo international trip as US First Lady.        
	The 46-year-old wife of President Barack Obama made the stopover in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince en route to an April 13-15 visit to Mexico. She arrived with Jill Biden, the wife of Vice-President Joe Biden.        
	Immediately after the catastrophic January 12 earthquake that Haitis government says may have killed more than 300,000 people, Obama ordered thousands of US soldiers and aid workers to spearhead a huge international relief effort.        
	First Lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden are visiting Haiti to underscore to the Haitian people and the Haitian government the enduring US commitment to help Haiti recover and rebuild, especially as we enter the rainy and hurricane seasons, the White House said.        
	Obama and Biden flew over the wrecked capital in a helicopter before meeting Haitian leaders.

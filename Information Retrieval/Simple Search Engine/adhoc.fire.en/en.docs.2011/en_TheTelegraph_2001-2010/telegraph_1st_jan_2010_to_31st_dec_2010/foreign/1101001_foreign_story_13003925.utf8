          LISA W. FODERARO                          Tyler Clementi                                  
	Sept. 30: It started with a Twitter message on September 19: Roommate asked for the room till midnight. I went into mollys room and turned on my webcam. I saw him making out with a dude.        
	That night, the authorities say, the Rutgers University student who sent the message used a camera in his dormitory room to stream the roommates intimate encounter live on the Internet.        
	And three days later, the roommate who had been surreptitiously broadcast  Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old first-year student and an accomplished violinist  jumped from the George Washington Bridge into the Hudson river in an apparent suicide.        
	The September 22 death, details of which the authorities disclosed yesterday, was the latest by a young American that followed the online posting of hurtful material.         
	The Middlesex county prosecutors office said Clementis roommate, Dharun Ravi, 18, of Plainsboro, New Jersey, and another classmate, Molly Wei, 18, of Princeton Junction, New Jersey, had each been charged with two counts of invasion of privacy for using the camera to view and transmit a live image of Clementi. The most serious charges carry a maximum sentence of five years.        
	Ravi was charged with two additional counts of invasion of privacy for trying a similar live feed on the Internet on September 21, the day before the suicide. A spokesman for the prosecutors office, James Neill, said the investigation was continuing, but he declined to speculate on additional charges.

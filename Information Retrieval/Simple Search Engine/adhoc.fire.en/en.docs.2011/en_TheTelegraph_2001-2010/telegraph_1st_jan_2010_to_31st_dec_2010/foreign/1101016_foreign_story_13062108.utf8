The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Khaleda told to vacate home
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Khaleda told to vacate home
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                      Khaleda Zia                          
	Dhaka, Oct. 15: The high court in Bangladesh has asked former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia to vacate her residential quarters in the Dhaka cantonment area in 30 days.        
	The Sheikh Hasina regime had issued her three eviction notices on charges that the house was illegally allotted to her after her husband Ziaur Rahmans murder in a military coup in 1981. Khaleda, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief, had filed a petition challenging the notice.        
	The court has rejected the petition and ordered Khaleda to vacate the house in 30 days, attorney-general Mahbubey Alam said after the verdict on Wednesday. The house was given to her illegally on June 13, 1981, through a so-called lease agreement. The army has now got the house back.        
	The 2.72-acre house was originally the official residence of the armys deputy chief of staff, a position held by Ziaur Rahman who later became army chief and then military ruler.        
	The house was leased to Khaleda for Taka 1 by then acting President Abdus Sattar following Ziaur Rahmans murder. She was also given a house in Gulshan in Dhaka.        
	On April 20 last year, the directorate of military lands and cantonments issued the first of three notices asking Khaleda to vacate her cantonment residence. Some of its contentions were:        
	A civilian cannot be given a residential lease within the cantonment area;        
	One person cannot be allotted two government houses in the capital;        
	Khaleda has been carrying out political activities from her home. This violates the conditions of allotment as the house is in an army area;        
	Unauthorised changes have been made to the building structure in violation of the code of conduct for a military area.        
	On May 27 last year, the court stayed the notices for three months after the initial hearing. The final hearing began on August 23 this year, with the court asking the government to submit all files relating to the house lease.        
	Khaleda has been claiming that the eviction notices were a result of Hasinas political vendetta. BNP sources alleged Hasina was getting even because Khaleda had in 2001 evicted her from her leased home near Parliament and cancelled the allotment of a house given to her sister Sheikh Rehana.        
	However, the government has denied this. Hasina told Parliament in April last year that she had requested Khaleda to move out so homes could be built to settle families of 55 army officers killed in the 2009 February mutiny by the Bangladesh Rifles.        
	 Khaledas lawyers have said that they would move the Supreme Court.

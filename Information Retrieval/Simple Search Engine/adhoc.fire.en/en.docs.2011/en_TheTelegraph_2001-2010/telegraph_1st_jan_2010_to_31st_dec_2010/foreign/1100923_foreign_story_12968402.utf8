	London, Sept. 22: It was always thought the Titanic sank because its crew were sailing too fast and failed to see the iceberg before it was too late.        
	But now it has been revealed that they spotted it well in advance but still steamed straight into it because of a basic steering blunder. According to a new book, the ship had plenty of time to miss the iceberg but the helmsman panicked and turned the wrong way. By the time the catastrophic error was corrected it was too late and the side of the ship was fatally holed by the iceberg. Even then the passengers and crew could have been saved if it had stayed put instead of steaming off again and causing water to pour into the broken hull. The revelation was kept secret until now by the family of the most senior officer to survive the disaster.        
	Second Officer Charles Lightoller covered up the error in two inquiries on both sides of the Atlantic because he was worried it would bankrupt the liners owners and put his colleagues out of job. Since his death  by then a war hero from the Dunkirk evacuation  it has remained hidden for fear it would ruin his reputation. But now his granddaughter the writer Lady (Louise) Patten has revealed it in her new novel.        
	The error on the ships maiden voyage between Southampton and New York in 1912 happened because at the time seagoing was undergoing enormous upheaval because of the conversion from sail to steam ships.

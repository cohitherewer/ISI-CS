The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Israel: iPad can disrupt devices
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Israel: iPad can disrupt devices
                            
	Jerusalem, April 15 (AP): Israel has banned imports of Apples hottest new product, the iPad, citing concerns that the powerful gadgets wireless signals could disrupt other devices.        
	Customs officials said today that they have already confiscated about 10 of the lightweight tablet computers since Israel announced the new regulations this week. The ban prevents anyone  even tourists  from bringing iPads into Israel until officials certify that they comply with local transmitter standards.        
	The US Federal Communications Commission allows devices with Wi-Fi capability to broadcast at higher power levels than are allowed in Europe and Israel  meaning that the iPads stronger signal could throw off others wireless connections, Schubert said. If you operate equipment in a frequency band which is different from the others that operate on that frequency band, then there will be interference, said Nati Schubert, a senior deputy director for the communications ministry.         
	Some Israelis successfully got the popular devices into Israel before the ban. Amnon, a software developer who legally brought an iPad into Israel, said he and other high-tech businessmen need the iPad to develop new applications.

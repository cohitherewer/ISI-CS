The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Saudi king limits cleric power to issue fatwas
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Saudi king limits cleric power to issue fatwas
                            
	Riyadh, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Saudi King Abdullah today ordered that public fatwas, be issued only by clerics he appoints, in the boldest measure the ageing monarch has taken to organise the religious field.        
	Timid efforts by the absolute monarchy to modernise the deeply conservative country have led to a profusion in fatwas from scholars and imams in the country.        
	This abundance depicted growing divisions among pro-reformist clerics and more conservative clerics, a trend which diplomats say was bound to worry Saudi authorities seeking to fight militancy.        
	Because Saudi Arabia hosts Islams holiest shrines, fatwas from the Saudi clerics are often revered.        
	We have noticed some excesses that we cant tolerate, and it is our legal duty to stand up to these with strength and resolve to preserve the religion, the dearest of our belongings, the monarch said in a royal order sent to the kingdoms Grand Mufti.        
	We urge you ... to limit fatwas to the members of the High Scholars Authority and to advise on those among them who are wholly... eligible to be involved in the duty of fatwa so that we allow them to carry out fatwas, he added.

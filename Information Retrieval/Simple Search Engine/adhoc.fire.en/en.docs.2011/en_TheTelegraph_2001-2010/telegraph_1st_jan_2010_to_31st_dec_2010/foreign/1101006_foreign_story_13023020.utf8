The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Younger Kim has had plastic surgery
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Younger Kim has had plastic surgery

	Tokyo, Oct. 5: Kim Jong-un, the heir to the North Korean regime, has reportedly undergone plastic surgery so that he more closely resembles his grandfather, the deeply respected Kim Il-sung.        
	The speculation began in South Korea after the release last week of the first official photographs of the 27-year-old son of Kim Jong-il.        
	The images show a chubby, nervous looking young man sitting in the front row of a packed auditorium as he was named vice chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Workers Party and a four-star general. In the images, the family resemblance between Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un is obvious.         
	The youngest in the Kim dynasty has the same chubby cheeks as his grandfather, a double chin and the familiar mouth that turns down at the ends.         
	He also apparently favours his predecessors preference for having his hair cut very short at the sides and swept back on top.        
	The images are in stark contrast to previous photographs, which depict Kim as a slender teenager who looks nothing like his paternal grandfather. South Korean newspapers suggested that in the intervening years he had undergone surgery to boost his standing with the public.        
	The Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported that Pyongyang was hoping to cement Kims position as the countrys next leader through a reincarnation of North Koreas late founder. A lot of people in South Korea have pointed out that Kims face is very different from when he was young, particularly the shape of his chin, Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyos Waseda University and author of a number of books on the North Korean leadership, told The Daily Telegraph.        
	From previous photos, everyone had remarked that he looked nothing like his grandfather, so the change is quite dramatic, he said.        
	The JoongAng Sunday newspaper reported that it had secretly interviewed three people in North Korea by mobile phone and that there has been similar speculation in the North since their new leader-in-waiting was unveiled.        
	The official Korea Central News Agency today said in a dispatch that Kim joined his father Kim Jong il in a visit to a military unit and to observe a live-fire drill.         
	Todays Korean-language report did not specify exactly when the visit took place. Also attending the event were top military officers and other ruling party officials including Jang Song Thaek and his wife, Kim Kyong Hui, who is Kim Jong ils younger sister.        
	Jang and Kim Kyong Hui are considered close to Kim Jong il and are expected to play a key role in ensuring the succession process goes smoothly.        
	Security tensions on the Korean peninsula had reached new heights this year after the sinking of a South Korean navy ship in March killing 46 sailors. Seoul says a North Korean submarine fired a missile sinking the navy vessel.        
	North Korea denies responsibility and says the charge was part of South Koreas conservative governments campaign to undermine the leadership in Pyongyang.

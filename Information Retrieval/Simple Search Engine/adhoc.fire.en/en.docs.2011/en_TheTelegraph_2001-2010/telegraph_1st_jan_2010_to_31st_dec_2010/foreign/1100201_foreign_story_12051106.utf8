The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US Gulf leash on Iran 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US Gulf leash on Iran 
          DAVID E. SANGER AND ERIC SCHMITT                          Barack Obama                                  
	Washington, Jan. 31: The Barack Obama administration is accelerating the deployment of new defences against possible Iranian missile attacks on the Persian Gulf, placing special ships off the Iranian coast and anti-missile systems in at least four Arab countries, according to administration and military officials.        
	The deployments come at a critical turning point in President Obamas dealings with Iran. After months of unsuccessful diplomatic outreach, the US administration is trying to win broad international consensus for sanctions against the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, which western nations say control a covert nuclear arms programme.         
	Obama spoke of the shift in his state of the Union address, warning of consequences if Iran continued to defy UN demands to stop manufacturing nuclear fuel.         
	Secretary of state Hillary Clinton publicly warned China on Friday that its opposition to sanctions was shortsighted.         
	The news that the US is deploying anti-missile defences  including a rare public discussion of them by General David H. Petraeus  appears to be part of a coordinated administration strategy to increase pressure on Iran.        
	The deployments are also partly intended to counter the impression that Iran is fast becoming the most powerful military force in West Asia, to forestall any Iranian escalation of its confrontation with the West if new sanctions are imposed.         
	In addition, the administration is trying to show Israel there is no immediate need for military strikes against Iranian nuclear and missile facilities, according to administration. By highlighting the defensive nature of the build-up, the administration was hoping to avoid a sharp response from Tehran.        
	Military officials said the countries that accepted the defence systems were Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait. They said the Kuwaitis had agreed to take the defensive weapons to supplement older, less capable models it has had for years. Saudi Arabia and Israel have long had similar equipment of their own.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Debate over womens sex pill

          DUFF WILSON                          Employees at the Boehringer Ingelheim pharmaceutical factory in Ingelheim, central Germany. (AP)                                  
	New York, June 17: Ever since Viagra met blockbuster success in 1998, the drug industry has sought a similar pill for women.        
	Now, a German drug giant says it has stumbled upon such a pill and is trying to persuade the Food and Drug Administration that its drug can help restore a depressed female sex drive. The effort has set off a debate over what constitutes a normal range of sexual desire among women, with critics saying the company is trying to turn a low libido into a medical pathology.        
	Yesterday, an FDA staff report recommended against approving the drug, saying the maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, had not made its case and that the benefits of the daily pill did not outweigh its side effects, which included dizziness, nausea and fatigue.        
	That staff report came ahead of a meeting tomorrow by an FDA advisory panel of experts who are to vote on whether to recommend that the agency approve the pill, which would be the first drug aimed specifically at a low sex drive in pre-menopausal women.        
	FDA staff reports carry weight but do not always sway how advisory panels vote, and advisory votes do not always predict what the FDA might finally decide.        
	Some analysts forecast that if the drug does reach the market, it could have annual sales in this country of $2 billion  or about equal to the current combined annual American sales of the mens drugs Viagra, Levitra and Cialis.        
	In the last month, Boehringer has been trying to lay the consumer groundwork with a promotional campaign about womens low libido, including a website, a Twitter feed, a Discovery Channel documentary and a publicity tour by Lisa Rinna, a soap opera star and former Playboy model, who describes herself as someone who has suffered from a disorder that Boehringer refers to as a form of female sexual dysfunction.        
	There is no dispute that some women have a depressed level of sexual desire that causes them anguish. Boehringer cites a condition  hypoactive sexual desire disorder  that is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a reference book for psychiatrists and insurers.        
	But many experts say that unlike sexual dysfunction in men  which has an obvious physical component  sexual problems in women are much harder to diagnose. And among doctors and researchers, there is serious medical debate over whether female sexual problems can be treated with drugs.        
	Some doctors advocate psychotherapy or counselling, while others have prescribed hormonal drugs approved for other uses.        
	There is also debate over how widespread hypoactive sexual desire disorder actually is among women.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

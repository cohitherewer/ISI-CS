The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Helen Mirren poses topless
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Helen Mirren poses topless
          ANITA SINGH                          risque shoot                                  
	London, June 22: Dame Helen Mirren has posed topless in the bath for her most risqu photoshoot to date.         
	The 64-year-old actress, who won an Oscar for The Queen, took part in the Juergen Teller shoot to publicise her latest role as a brothel madam in Love Ranch.         
	Im still the good girl who wants to be a bad girl, she said in the accompanying interview for New York magazine.         
	But Ill never make it as a bad girl... Im not a prude or a moralist and I never have been, but Im too fearful, too much of a wimp, really.        
	Dame Helen said she learned early in her career to use her sexuality to her advantage, appearing in the notorious 1979 film Caligula.         
	A lot of it is plain, old-fashioned practicality. I wanted to work. When I did Caligula, for example, I hadnt really done movies, she explained.         
	But I was kind of a trailblazer because I demanded to do it my own way. Id say: Im not having it put on me by someone else. I didnt want to be the sort of puritanical good girl with a little white collar who says: Dont until you get married.         
	Love Ranch is directed by Dame Helens husband, Taylor Hackford, and is based on the real-life story of the couple who owned the Mustang Ranch, the first legalised brothel in the US. Joe Pesci plays her husband.         
	While she visited the present-day Mustang Ranch as part of her research, she drew the line at Hackfords suggestion that she stay over.

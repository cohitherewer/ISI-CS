	Jili, China, Oct. 12: There was a time when clean water, mulberry trees and tiny, squirming, milky-white larvae made this village one of the most famous in all of China.        
	The larvae spun cocoons, and the cocoons were spun into silk, and the silk travelled the world. It was made into gowns and garter belts, slippers and scarves.        
	Few products are as synonymous with China as silk. And for a time, no name was as synonymous with quality silk as Jili. In 1851, when the first World Expo, then called the Great Exhibition, was held in London, Jili silk was displayed by a Chinese businessman. It won gold and silver prizes handed out by Queen Victoria. The silk was later presented to her as a birthday gift.        
	This year, the World Expo is being held 80 miles northeast of here, in Shanghai, but Jili silk is not up for any awards.        
	The industry here has proved far less resilient than its product. Like many rural residents across China, the young people in this patch of Zhejiang province have flocked to cities to look for jobs. Only their parents remain to carry on the famed tradition of sericulture, or silk farming. They live in about 50 homes clustered around a central pond where wooden skiffs bob. Groves of mulberry trees ring the outskirts.        
	Every home once had hand tools that the residents used to spin silk thread. In the Qing Dynasty, founded in the 17th century, Jili silk was used to fashion the clothing of the imperial court in Beijing and of the emperor himself. Now, only a single decaying factory in the area still processes silk, and the villagers raise silkworms only twice a year, a sharp drop from five times a year in the 1980s.        
	Starting in the third century BC, silk travelled to Europe along the various Silk Roads. Chinese rulers strove so hard to keep silk manufacturing a secret that Western merchants thought silk grew on trees in China, until silkworms were smuggled to Constantinople in hollow walking sticks. The Suzhou area was the centre of silk production in the Tang and Song Dynasties, and poets there waxed lyrical about silk and mulberry trees while drinking rice wine.        
	At one point, the number of looms in the official silk workshops of southern China exceeded 10,000.         
	The downfall of the local silk industry came with industrialisation. The hand looms of Jili could not compete with the machines introduced into factories in the 20th century. The industry ground to a halt when the Japanese occupied this part of China during World War II, and the Chinese Communists pushed for mass industrialisation across China after 1949.        
	Jilis changing environment, with factories dirtying the pure water so crucial to sericulture, also contributed to the industrys decline.

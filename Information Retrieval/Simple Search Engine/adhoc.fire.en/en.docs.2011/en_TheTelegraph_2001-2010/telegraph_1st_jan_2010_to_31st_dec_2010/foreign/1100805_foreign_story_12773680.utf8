The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gisele apology for breastfeed comments
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Gisele apology for breastfeed comments
          TOM LEONARD                          Stung                                  
	New York, Aug. 4: The fashion model Gisele Bundchen has been forced to make a public apology after her call for an international breastfeeding law prompted maternal outcry.        
	In her blog, Bundchen, a 30-year-old Brazilian, insisted she was not trying to judge other mothers who fed their offspring from a bottle. She said: My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding has nothing to do with the law.        
	Bundchen, one of the modelling worlds biggest stars, was back to work posing in swimwear only six weeks after giving birth seven months ago to her son, Benjamin.        
	In an interview with Harpers Bazaar magazine, she said breastfeeding the baby  albeit for just three weeks  had helped her to recover her figure. Criticising mothers who chose instead to give bottled milk to their babies, she said: There should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months.        
	She added: Some people here [in the US] think they dont have to breast-feed and I think: Are you going to give chemical food to your children when they are so little?        
	The intervention of a millionaire mother who can afford the most pampered care prompted widespread anger among women on the Internet. Some experts applauded her support for breastfeeding but stressed that some women cannot do it for medical reasons.         
	Dr Manny Alvarez, a gynaecologist, told Fox News: quot;For Gisele to give a public statement like that is unfair to other mothers. There are maternal and fetal challenges to breastfeeding.

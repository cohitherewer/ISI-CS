	Miami, Nov. 20 (Reuters): Actor Wesley Snipes was ordered yesterday to start serving a three-year prison sentence for a felony tax conviction after a Florida judge rejected his bid for a new trial.        
	The defendant Snipes had a fair trial ... The time has come for the judgment to be enforced, US district judge Terrell Hodges said in his ruling. Revoking bail for the 48-year-old star of the Blade trilogy, the judge ordered him to report to prison as directed by the US Marshals Service .        
	It was not clear when or where Snipes would begin serving his time behind bars.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak army probe on soldiers 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pak army probe on soldiers 
                            
	Islamabad, Oct. 8 (Reuters): Pakistan Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani has ordered an investigation into a Internet video that shows men in military fatigues shooting at a group of what the military said were civilians.        
	The video raised fresh questions about alleged extra-judicial killings by the army at a time when Pakistan faces mounting US pressure to crack down harder on militants launching attacks on Western forces in Afghanistan from Pakistani sanctuaries.        
	The US officials said last week they had asked Pakistan for information about the Internet video that allegedly show Pakistani troops shooting bound and blindfolded men in traditional Pakistani clothing.        
	The army said Kayani vowed to take action if the perpetrators were found to be soldiers and has set up a board of inquiry to establish the identity of the uniformed personnel.        
	The Pakistan military statement added: Taking notice of a video footage showing cold-blooded execution of civilians by personnel clad in Pakistan Army uniforms, General Ashfaq (Parvez) Kayani has ordered setting up of a board of inquiry to establish the true identity of the uniformed men personnel and the veracity of the video footage. The board will be headed by a two-star general, reports our correspondent.        
	If the blurry video is found to be genuine, it is likely to raise troubling questions for Washington about its support for an army that is vital for efforts to stabilise Afghanistan.

	London, Sept. 20 (PTI): Reformed Lothario Russell Brand has revealed details about his most famous conquest  none other than supermodel Kate Moss  in a new book.        
	The British comedian, who plans to marry popstar Katy Perry in October, said he does not intend to invade Mosss privacy with his account in Booky Wook 2. However, Brand has decided to dedicate a chapter to their one-night-stand as a tribute to the supermodel, reports The Sun.        
	I thought when I was writing it: I dont want her to be upset when she reads it. I thought if I said something that was intimate then that would be bad. It was more like an encounter with an angel, said Brand, 35.         
	He was an upcoming stand-up-comedian when he met Moss in 2006.         
	I had a mad infatuation with her. I didnt feel all cool, it felt like I fell down a well. When I saw she was there I felt totally overwhelmed because she is obviously incredibly beautiful and she is Kate Moss, said Brand.         
	Then she sort of looked at me and smiled, then she sent me a text message a bit later, saying: Do you wanna meet up?. I said: Yeah, Ill come round. I really, really liked her. It was never going to go anywhere but it was mad, he added. Brand was infamous for his promiscuous ways and his liaisons provided plenty of fodder for tabloids. But he is a changed man, thanks to fiance Perry.

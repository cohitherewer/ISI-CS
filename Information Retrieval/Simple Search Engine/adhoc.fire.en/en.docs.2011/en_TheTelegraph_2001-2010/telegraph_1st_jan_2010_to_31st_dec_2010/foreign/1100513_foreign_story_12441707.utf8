	Crowe rival    
	 London, May 12 (PTI): He has played a Roman hero in Gladiator and a police officer in LA Confidential but actor Russell Crowe is yet to impress his children with his acting skills.      
	Crowe said his children Charlie, 6, and Tennyson, 3, find Indiana Jones star Harrison Ford a better actor than their father.

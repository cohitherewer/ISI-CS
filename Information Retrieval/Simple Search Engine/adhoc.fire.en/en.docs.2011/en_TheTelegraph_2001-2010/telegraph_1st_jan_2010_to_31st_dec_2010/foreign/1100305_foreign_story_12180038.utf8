The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China eases military surge
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China eases military surge

	Beijing, March 4 (AP): Chinas government proposed its smallest increase in defence spending in two decades today.        
	Premier Wen Jiabao will further flesh out the governments shift in priorities in a speech tomorrow. Social programmes are expected to benefit as the government moves to shift the economy towards domestic consumption and away from the binge on easy credit and state investment that warded off the global recession.        
	In a preview, a spokesman for the national legislature said today that the Cabinet plans to raise spending on its increasingly formidable military 7.5 per cent to $77.9 billion (532.1 billion yuan). Though experts say Chinas true military budget is higher, the rate of increase is the lowest since the 1980s.         
	Analysts said that was directly tied to the new fiscal priorities. China has not fully recovered from the sluggish foreign trade and employment, and to some extent the government has financial difficulties, said Ni Lexiong of Shanghai University of Politics and Law.

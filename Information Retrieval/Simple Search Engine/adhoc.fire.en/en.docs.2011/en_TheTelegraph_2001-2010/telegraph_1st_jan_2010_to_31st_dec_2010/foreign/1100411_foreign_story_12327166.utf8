The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fleet that provoked   a funeral forecast
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fleet that provoked   a funeral forecast
                              A picture taken from Polish television shows the wreckage of the Tupolev TU-154 that crashed near Smolensk, Russia, on Saturday. (AFP)                                  
	April 10: The plane that crashed today was a Tupolev Tu-154, designed by the Soviets in the mid-1960s.        
	Russia halted mass production of the jet roughly 20 years ago, and around 200 of them are still in service around the world. The Polish Presidents jet was one of the youngest of them.        
	Officials in Poland have repeatedly requested that the governments ageing air fleet be replaced.        
	Former Prime Minister Leszek Miller, who survived a helicopter crash in 2003, told Polish news he had long predicted such a disaster. I once said that we will one day meet in a funeral procession, and that is when we will take the decision to replace the aircraft fleet, he said.        
	A TV channel reported that moments before the crash, air traffic controllers had refused a Russian military aircraft permission to land but that they could not refuse permission to the Polish plane.        
	Russian media reported that the planes crew made several attempts to land before a wing hit the treetops and the plane crashed about half a mile from the runway.         
	The Tupolev Tu-154 is described as the workhorse of the Soviet airlines for decades. Aviation experts say it has a reasonable safety record for the amount of aircraft in use.        
	The 154 is by a wide margin the most successful jet ever built by a communist economic system, said Richard Aboulafia, vice-president at Teal Group, a Virginia-based consultant. It was created at the height of the old Soviet Unions ability to invent equipment that at least approximated the achievements of the west. The real problem is regulatory oversight in many of the regions where its used. Corruption and neglect almost guarantee trouble.        
	The Tu-154 has a fatal accident every 431,200 flights, according to London-based aviation consultant Ascend. The Boeing 737, the worlds best-selling passenger plane, crashes every 2.68 million flights.        
	The Tu-154 was Aeroflots standard craft from the early 1970s until this year.         
	In January 2010, the Russian national carrier announced the retirement of its Tu-154 fleet but the plane remains the standard airliner for routes across the former Soviet Union and in eastern Europe and Iran.        
	In July last year, a Tu-154 crashed in Iran, killing 168 people. It was the eight fatal incident involving a Tu-154 in 10 years.

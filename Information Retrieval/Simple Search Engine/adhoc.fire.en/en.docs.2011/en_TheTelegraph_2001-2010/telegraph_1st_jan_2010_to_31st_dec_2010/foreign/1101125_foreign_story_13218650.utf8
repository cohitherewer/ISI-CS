	Washington, Nov. 24: President Obama and South Koreas President agreed last night to hold joint military exercises as a first response to North Koreas deadly shelling of a South Korean military installation.        
	The agreement comes as both countries struggled for the second time this year to keep a North Korean provocation from escalating into war.        
	The exercise will include sending the aircraft carrier George Washington and a number of accompanying ships into the region, both to deter further attacks by the North and to signal to China that unless it reins in its unruly ally it will see an even larger American presence in the vicinity.        
	The decision came after Obama attended the end of an emergency session in the White House Situation Room and then emerged to call President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea to express American solidarity and talk about a coordinated response.         
	But as a former national security official who dealt frequently with North Korea in the Bush administration, Victor Cha, said just a few hours before the attack began, North Korea is the land of lousy options.        
	Obama is once again forced to choose among unpalatable choices: responding with verbal condemnations and a modest tightening of sanctions, which has done little to halt new attacks; starting military exercises that are largely symbolic; or reacting strongly, which could risk a broad war in which South Koreas capital, Seoul, would be the first target.        
	President Lee said he would order strikes on a North Korean base if there were indications of new attacks.        
	North Koreas artillery shells fell on Yeonpyeong Island, a fishing village whose residents fled by ferry to the mainland city of Inchon  where Gen. Douglas MacArthurs troops landed 60 years ago this autumn, three months after the outbreak of the Korean War.        
	Today, Inchon is the site of South Koreas main international airport, symbolising the vulnerability of one of the worlds most vibrant economies to the artillery of one of the worlds poorest and most isolated nations.        
	A senior American official said that an early American assessment indicated that a total of about 175 artillery shells were fired by the North and by the South in response yesterday.        
	But an American official who had looked at satellite images said there was no visible evidence of preparations for a general war.         
	Historically, the Norths attacks have been lightning raids, after which the North Koreans have backed off to watch the worlds reaction. This one came just hours after the South Koreans had completed a long-planned set of military exercises, suggesting that the North Korean attack was premeditated, a senior American official said.        
	Television reports showed large plumes of black smoke spiralling from the island, as dozens of houses caught fire. The shelling killed two marines and wounded 18 people. The South put its fighter planes on alert  but, tellingly, did not put them in the air or strike at the Norths artillery bases. Obama was awakened at 3.55am by his new national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, who told him of the attack.

	London, Dec. 6: The battle lines between supporters of the whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks and its detractors began to form yesterday, as supporters erected numerous copies of the site on the Internet and the US put pressure on Switzerland not to offer a haven to the sites founder, Julian Assange.        
	Since several major Internet companies cut off services to WikiLeaks in recent days, activists have created hundreds of mirror sites, websites that host exact copies of another sites content, making censorship difficult.         
	The collective Anonymous, an informal but notorious group of hackers and activists, also declared war yesterday against enemies of Assange, calling on supporters to attack sites that do not support WikiLeaks. Meanwhile, the American ambassador to Switzerland, Donald S. Beyer Jr., responded to signs that Assange might seek refuge in that country, warning that the Swiss should very carefully consider whether to provide shelter to someone who is on the run.

	Spears skip    
	 London, Jan. 20 (PTI): Pop princess Britney Spears incurred the wrath of a judge when she decided to miss a court date to go shopping for diamonds.       
	The singer missed a hearing over the decision to lift the legal guardianship of her father. The 28-year-old was spotted at a luxury shopping centre near her home in Calabasas, California, when she should have been in court, reports the Daily Mail.      
	Spears is now in trouble with Los Angeles Superior Court commissioner who is angry that the singer failed to show up for the hearing. The singers manager claimed that she was under the impression that the hearing had been postponed.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      52 die in Iraq church siege

	Church officials described the attack, which began when gunmen seized the Our Lady of Salvation Church during Sunday mass, as the bloodiest against Iraqs Christians in the seven years of sectarian war that followed the 2003 US-led invasion.        
	A Christian lawmaker said the botched raid to free the hostages proved that the Iraqi security forces lack the capability to maintain peace.        
	Lieutenant General Hussein Kamal, a deputy interior minister said 52 hostages and police were killed and 67 wounded in the incident, which ended with police storming the Assyrian Catholic church to free more than 100 hostages seized by guerrillas. The death toll was many times higher than that given overnight in the hours after the raid.        
	What happened was more than a catastrophic and tragic event. In my opinion, it is an attempt to force Iraqi Christians to leave Iraq and to empty Iraq of Christians, human rights minister Wijdan Michael, a Christian, said at the scene.        
	Al Qaidas Iraqi affiliate, the Islamic State of Iraq, claimed responsibility in a statement posted on Islamist websites for the attack on the dirty den of idolatry.        
	At least one bomb exploded at the start of the siege. Sporadic gunfire rang out for several hours over the Karrada neighbourhood near the heavily fortified Green Zone district where many embassies and government offices are located.        
	US and Iraqi military helicopters thundered overhead as security forces cordoned off the area. A federal police source who declined to be identified said yesterdays rescue operation was extremely difficult. The attackers were among children, armed with weapons, the source said. Most of the casualties were killed or wounded when the security forces raided the place.

	Mirren lazy jab    
	 London, April 25: Helen Mirren has labelled British actors lazy, saying they are less hard-working and take longer to learn their lines than American performers, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	 Mirren, 64, described British actors as struggling, saying rehearsals had to be cut short so that they could learn the script.       
	Her comments related to a 1994 London production of A Month in the Country, in which she starred along with Joseph Fiennes and John Hurt, although she made no mention of individual members of the cast.       
	The Oscar winner said there had been no such problem with the American ensemble when the play moved to New York several months later.    
	Grey stars     
	 London (PTI): Iron-Man 2 co-stars Gwynweth Paltrow and Scarlett Johannson became partners in a fashion blunder as they both wore identical grey dresses for the first cast photocall of the film. The two actresses, who play love rivals in the film, made it a point not to pose together on the red carpet, Daily Mail has reported. The two women wore similar fitted, knee-length grey dresses, with their blonde hair loose and nude-coloured lipstick.     
	Gay dog    
	 Sydney (AFP): A court has ordered an Australian restaurant, which refused a blind man entry because a waiter thought his seeing eye dog was gay has been ordered to apologise and pay compensation. Ian Jolly was told he could not take his guide dog Nudge into Adelaides Thai Spice last May. The restaurants owners said a waiter had misunderstood Jollys female companion when she said she wanted to bring a gay dog into the restaurant. The staff believed that Nudge had been desexed to become gay, the owners said.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Iran envoy resigns
          MARTIN FLETCHER                              
	London, Jan. 16: A veteran Iranian diplomat based in Norway has resigned his post, denounced his government and urged colleagues around the world to do the same after the regimes brutal suppression of huge opposition demonstrations last month.        
	Mohammed-Reza Heydari, Irans consul in Oslo, is the first Iranian diplomat to publicly quit and condemn the regime. He revealed that it sought to lure him back to Tehran after rumours of his defection surfaced last week. At the time, the Iranian foreign ministry insisted that the rumours were baseless.        
	In an interview with the Norwegian television channel NRK, Heydari said that he decided to resign after Iranian security forces killed a dozen demonstrators on December 27.        
	I hope my friends and colleagues in other parts of the world who see and hear me now and know me will move in the same direction as their people. I hope they will manage to sacrifice some personal interests and rather think of what is in the interest of their people and their nation, he said.        
	Heydari said that he did not fear for his life, but in the past the regime has arrested the relatives of those, such as Shirin Ebadi, the Nobel peace laureate, who criticise it from abroad.         
	Irans police chief, Esmail Ahmadi Moghaddam, said yesterday that anyone caught using text messages or emails to organise demonstrations would be prosecuted.

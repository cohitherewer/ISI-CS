	Theron tip    
	 London, March 12 (PTI): Actress Charlize Theron says the best beauty tip she has ever received is to use eyelash curlers and admits she now cannot live without it.       
	Theron was introduced to the curlers by a make-up artist. The first make-up artist I worked with curled my eyelashes and now Im addicted to curlers. They are the most amazing thing since sliced bread! After using them, it looks like Ive had two extra hours sleep, she said.     
	Bar on Leo    
	London (PTI): An Israeli nationalist group has urged supermodel Bar Rafaeli to ditch her boyfriend, actor Leonardo DiCaprio, so that she can settle down with a Jewish husband. She was forced to deny rumours she was engaged to DiCaprio earlier this month.

	Los Angeles, Sept. 25 (AP): Lindsay Lohan was freed from a suburban Los Angeles jail late last night, well short of the nearly month-long stay a judge had intended for the actress following a failed drug test.        
	Lohan was released at about 11:40pm after posting $300,000 bail, Los Angeles county sheriffs department spokesman Steve Whitmore said early today. Celebrity website TMZ.com reported her release just before midnight.        
	Los Angeles superior court Judge Elden Fox had ordered Lohan held without bail during a brief hearing yesterday morning, But his ruling later was overturned after the Mean Girls stars attorney, Shawn Chapman Holley, filed a late-afternoon appeal seeking bail.        
	Judge Patricia Schnegg, who is an assistant supervising judge of Los Angeless criminal courts, issued a ruling shortly before 6pm, saying that since the starlet had been convicted of misdemeanours, she was entitled to bail. She will be required to wear an ankle alcohol monitor and stay away from establishments that sell alcohol.        
	She is also supposed to be back in court on October 22, when the judge who curtly sent her to jail will decide what her punishment will be for failing a drug test.

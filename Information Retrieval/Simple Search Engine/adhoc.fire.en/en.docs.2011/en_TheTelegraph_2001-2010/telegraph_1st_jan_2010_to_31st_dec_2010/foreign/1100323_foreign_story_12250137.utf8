The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Google broke vow: China
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Google broke vow: China

	Beijing/Shanghai, March 22 (Reuters): Chinas state-run Xinhua news agency launched a new broadside against Google Inc today, saying in an angry commentary that the company had reneged on promises to abide by Chinese law.        
	Speculation is swirling that Google will soon announce a decision to pull out of China, or at least shut down its Chinese search engine.        
	The Financial Times, citing a person familiar with the situation, said the company could close its Chinese search engine. Google has not formally unveiled any such plans.        
	Two months since Google said it would no longer agree to abide by Beijings censorship rules even if that meant shutting its Google.cn site, some Chinese Internet users and state media are baying for the company to pull out.        
	Xinhua, in a signed commentary, said Google had promised when it entered the Chinese market to filter its search engine for harmful content, in accordance with the law. Now Google suddenly wants to break its promise, and if its not satisfied it will criticise China for a worsening of the investment environment, Xinhua said.        
	The burst of angry Chinese comments suggested that the government is steering state-run media and websites to lump the company together with other recent disputes with Washington.

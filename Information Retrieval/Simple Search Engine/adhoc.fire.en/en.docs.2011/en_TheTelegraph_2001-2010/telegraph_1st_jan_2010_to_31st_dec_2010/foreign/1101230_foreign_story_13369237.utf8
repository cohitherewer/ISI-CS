The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Clooney watch on Sudan border 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Clooney watch on Sudan border 
                              KEEPING TRACK                            
	New York, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Groups including the UN, Harvard University, Google Inc and an organisation co-founded by actor George Clooney are launching a project using satellites to watch Sudan for war crimes before a vote that could split the African country in two.        
	The Satellite Sentinel Project, which begins today, is meant to provide an early warning system for human rights and security violations before the January 9 referendum on whether to divide Sudan into north and south.        
	We want to let potential perpetrators of genocide and other war crimes know that were watching, the world is watching, Clooney said in a statement.        
	The satellite project received funding for six months from Not On Our Watch, an organisation co-founded by Clooney and his Hollywood friends, actors Don Cheadle, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, David Pressman and producer Jerry Weintraub. The group has been active in raising money to help the many displaced people in the Darfur region of western Sudan.        
	Clooney told Time magazine in an article posted on its website that he came up with the idea three months ago when he was in Sudan meeting refugees.

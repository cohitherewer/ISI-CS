                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Facebook phone plans denied

	Sept. 20: Facebook has denied several reports that it is developing a smartphone, in a move which would up the competition between itself and major rivals, Google and Apple.        
	Reports yesterday alleged that Facebook is developing smartphone software, according to a source with knowledge of the project.        
	Yesterday TechCrunch, a technology specialist site, ran a saying the company was developing mobile phone software, citing a source with knowledge of the project.        
	Techcrunch reported: Facebook is building a mobile phone, says a source who has knowledge of the project. Or rather, theyre building the software for the phone and working with a third party to actually build the hardware. Which is exactly what Apple and everyone else does, too...        
	However, Facebook has denied the reports to several other sites, telling CNET: Facebook is not building a phone. Our view is that almost all experiences would be better if they were social, so integrating deeply into operating systems is a good way to enable this.

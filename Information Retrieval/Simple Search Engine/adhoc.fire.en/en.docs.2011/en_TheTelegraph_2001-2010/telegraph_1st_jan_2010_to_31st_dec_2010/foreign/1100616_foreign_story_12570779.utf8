          SHAILA DEWAN AND ROBBIE BROWN                          Nikki Haley with her children (from left), Rena and Nalin, and husband Michael in Columbia, South Carolina. (AP)                                  
	Bamberg (South Carolina), June 15: Nikki Haley, the favourite to become the first governor of South Carolina who is neither white nor male, has always challenged established norms with her own brand of courage.        
	As a girl, her parents  the first Indian immigrants this small, working-class town had ever seen  entered Nikki and her sister in the Little Miss Bamberg pageant. The judges of the contest, one that crowned one black queen and one white queen, were so flummoxed that they simply disqualified Nikki and her sister, Simran  but not before Nikki, about 5, sang one of Americas most popular folk songs This Land Is Your Land.        
	Haley, 38, upended things again last week after a sharp-elbowed primary that included allegations of marital infidelity and pitted her against the lieutenant governor, the attorney general and a congressman. Haley, a state legislator, received 49 per cent of the vote, but faces a June 22 runoff with Representative Gresham Barrett, whom she beat by more than 25 points last Tuesday. And this from a campaign that was so underfinanced that it had to sell yard signs at $5 apiece, Haley said.        
	Now, she finds herself one of the brightest rising stars in the Republican Party, a Tea Party favourite, a Sarah Palin endorsee and the subject of national attention.        
	I love that people think its a good story, but I dont understand how its different, she said in an interview on Friday, in a voice with a faint watermark of Southern drawl. I feel like Im just an accountant and businessperson who wants to be a part of state government.        
	Haley  born Nimrata Nikki Randhawa and always called Nikki, which means little one, by her family  said that growing up in Bamberg was at times tough. Her father wears a turban and, though male Sikhs are not supposed to cut their hair, her brothers was trimmed after teasing at school grew vicious.         
	Its survival mode, she said. You learn to try and show people how youre more alike than you are different.        
	But her political rise has raised questions about her difference, and she has become more careful about how she presents the religious aspect, in particular, of her life.        
	I was born and raised with the Sikh faith, my husband and I were married in the Methodist Church, our children  Nalin, 8, and Rena, 12  have been baptised in the Methodist Church, and currently we attend both, she said. Haley did not mention that she and her husband, Michael Haley, wed in two ceremonies, one Sikh and the other at St Andrews by-the-Sea, a Methodist church in Hilton Head.        
	Back then, though, Haley seemed comfortable publicly embracing both religions.         
	Nowadays, she talks of having converted to Christianity before her wedding in 1996, when she was baptised at St Andrews. She has also changed the wording on her website under the heading, Question: Is Nikki a Christian? from an answer that references Almighty God to one that references Christ.        
	I still find these things to be very private, she said about the change. However, when people question you, you do have to answer to them.        
	Tim Pearson, her campaign manager, said that the campaign grew more specific in response to questions. We got a lot of emails and what not from people saying, Shes talking about God, but what God? he said. Even her name became an issue in 2004, when a political opponent, a 30-year incumbent who was at the time the longest serving state legislator, pointed out that she was registered to vote as Nimrata Randhawa and not Nikki Haley.         
	But such nicknames are not unusual: one of Haleys inspirations and a fellow Indian-American politician, Gov. Piyush Jindal of Louisiana, is better known as Bobby.        
	From early on, Haley was involved in her familys clothing business  Exotica International, which sells gowns, suits and jewellery  taking over the bookkeeping at age 13. Her father, Ajit Randhawa, was a biology professor at Voorhees College in nearby Denmark, South Carolina; her mother, Raj, started Exotica as a gift shop.        
	Before she ran for office, Haley got an accounting degree at Clemson University, where she met Haley. She worked for FCR, a waste management and recycling company, and then returned to Exotica as chief financial officer and helped the company grow into a multimillion-dollar business.        
	Then, hearing that State Representative Larry Koon would be retiring in 2004, she jumped into the race. But Koon stayed in. At the time, Lexington county, just outside Columbia, was in the throes of transition from a rural community to a suburban, affluent one with many newcomers. The changing voter base may be one reason that the attacks against Haley backfired.

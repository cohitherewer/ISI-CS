The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Accused of murder, troops point to leader 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Accused of murder, troops point to leader

	Washington, Oct. 16: Soldiers in an American army platoon accused of murdering Afghan civilians for sport say they took orders from a ringleader who collected body parts as war trophies, were threatened with death if they spoke up and smoked hashish on their base almost daily.         
	Now family members and the military are asking a central question: How could their commanders not know what was going on?         
	I just dont understand how this went so far, said Christopher Winfield, the father of Specialist Adam C. Winfield, one of the platoon members charged with murder. Ive been in management for 20 years; you know what your people are doing.         
	But interviews in recent days and hundreds of pages of documents in the case offer a portrait of an isolated, out-of-control unit that operated in Kandahar Province in southern Afghanistan with limited supervision and little oversight from senior commanders.         
	There are indications of missed warnings among army officers who saw trouble with some platoon leaders but did not dig deeper  let alone suspect the extent of the problem  until investigators began asking questions in early May, nearly four months after prosecutors say the first of three murders of Afghan civilians occurred.         
	The documents, which have not been made public, include sworn statements from soldiers and some of their officers. So far, neither the leaders of the 30-man platoon nor more senior officers in the Fifth Stryker Combat Brigade have been charged or disciplined in one of the most gruesome war crimes cases to come out of nearly a decade of conflict in Afghanistan. It is unclear whether action will be taken against them in the future.         
	Five platoon members of lower ranks have been charged with murder and all have said they are not guilty. Seven more were charged with lesser offences.         
	Drug tests were conducted regularly on most of the platoon and its larger brigade before the group left Joint Base Lewis-McChord, near Seattle, for the war, and 1,207 tests were done while the 3,800-member brigade was in Afghanistan. (Drug tests are required for entire units in the US, but are conducted at commanders discretion during deployments.)         
	Soldiers in the platoon give no indication that illicit drug use was the reason for the alleged crimes. Lawyers interviewed said it was symptomatic of larger trouble.         
	Still, illicit drug use was already common in the platoon as it prepared to leave Lewis-McChord for Afghanistan in spring 2009, at least according to the sworn testimony from one of its members, Justin A. Stoner. While at the base, my platoon was not exactly straightforward with substance abuse, Stoner told army investigators.         
	He said members of the platoon would blatantly smoke what they said was marijuana and that another platoon member, Specialist Jeremy N. Morlock, had gone AWOL (absent without leave) for a week to avoid a final drug test before deployment. Specialist Morlock, one of those charged with murder, was referred yesterday for court-martial proceedings.         
	In summer 2009, the platoon was sent to Forward Operating Base Ramrod, a military installation of about 1,600 people in the desert about 50 miles west of the city of Kandahar, the ideological home of the Taliban. Once at Ramrod they were separated from their company of 150 soldiers and attached to a separate cavalry troop  a move that Specialist Winfield told his father cut the men off from their regular chain of command.         
	They were kind of the red-headed stepchild of the cavalry because they werent their guys and they were kind of left by themselves, Winfield said. During a rough deployment with high brigade casualties and a daily fear of being killed by homemade bombs, Specialist Winfield told his father that the platoons leader, First Lt Roman Ligsay, rarely checked on his soldiers and that they were even further removed from the Troop A commander, Capt. Matthew Quiggle.         
	Soldiers and their lawyers say the drug use continued among as many as 20 of the 30 platoon members at Ramrod, where the group and its leaders lived close to each other in small prefabricated housing units. They say they used the unit that Private Stoner shared with a roommate for drinking alcohol  they received it by mail  and for smoking hashish that they easily got from Afghan interpreters.         
	On May 3, Private Stoner told investigators, the hash-smoking in his room was to the point where the smoke was lingering in the air and the smell was impossible to get rid of.         
	Afghanistan is the worlds largest producer of hashish, and Afghan Army troops smoke it on the outposts they share with American forces.

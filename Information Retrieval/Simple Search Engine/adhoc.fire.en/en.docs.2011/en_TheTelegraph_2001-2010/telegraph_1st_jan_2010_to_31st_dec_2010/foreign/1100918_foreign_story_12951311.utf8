The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fonseka found guilty of graft
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fonseka found guilty of graft
                              Fonseka: Under pressure                            
	Colombo, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Sri Lanka today found the former army chief who led the military victory over the Tamil Tiger separatists guilty of misappropriation of funds, which can land him in prison for up to three years.        
	Sarath Fonsekas sentence was widely expected after he was stripped of his four-star general rank last month in a similar court-martial, which found him guilty of involvement in politics while in uniform.        
	He had challenged his former commander-in-chief, President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in a bitterly personal campaign and lost in a January election. He was arrested on February 8 but still won a parliamentary seat in April.        
	He was found guilty of all charges, said Lakshman Hulugalla, the director-general at the governments Media Centre for National Security. The state-run Daily News in an SMS news alert said Fonseka was sentenced for three years by the second court-martial.        
	It was not immediately clear whether Fonseka will be transferred to a civilian prison from military custody at navy headquarters after the President signs the sentence.        
	25 killed in blast        
	Three trucks carrying explosives blew up inside a police compound in eastern Sri Lanka today, killing at least 25 people in what the military called an accident. It occurred in Karayinadaru, about 50km from Batticaloa.

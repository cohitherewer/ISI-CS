	London, Feb. 5: Perhaps the complaints about late-night noise at an all-women Cambridge college related to the sound of papers rustling as undergraduates studied round-the-clock.        
	But when an email went out to students at Newnham College asking them to be discreet in your activities after dark, most understood it to refer to noise of a more amorous nature.        
	Yesterday, young women at the college, which was founded in 1871, admitted to having blushed as they read the message, which followed claims that Newnham had gained a reputation for being slutty.        
	 Lizzy Cole, the colleges undergraduate president, sent the email to all 400 residents after the student union received 30 complaints about noise in the student halls.        
	Some girls said they had been horrified to think that fellow students may have heard them with their boyfriends.

	Cold got dinos    
	 London, April 24: Dinosaurs were wiped out by a sudden drop in temperatures, not by a comet striking the planet, scientists have claimed.       
	British researchers claim that a sudden fall in the sea temperature more than 137 million years ago was the first step towards the dinosaurs eventual road to extinction.       
	While studying fossils and minerals from Norway, they concluded the sudden change in the Atlantic Gulf Stream during the Cretaceous period would almost certainly have wiped out the abundance of the dinosaurs, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	We believe dinosaurs were most likely to be cold-blooded creatures and would have needed warmth to keep them alive, Gregory Price, who led the study, said.     
	Moore kids     
	 London (PTI): Actress Demi Moore says she has an amicable relationship with former husband Bruce Willis because they always keep the welfare of their children first. Moore, 47, has three daughters with Willis and says she puts them before anything else in her life. The most important thing is to make your kids your priority, so it becomes very easy, Moore said.

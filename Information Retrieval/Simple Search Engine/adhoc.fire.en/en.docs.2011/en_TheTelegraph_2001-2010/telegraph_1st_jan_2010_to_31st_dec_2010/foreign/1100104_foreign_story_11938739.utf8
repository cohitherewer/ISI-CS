                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Qaida threat closes US embassy
                            
	Sanaa, Jan. 3 (Reuters): Britain and the US closed their embassies in Yemen today over security concerns about possible militant attacks after the failed bombing of a US-bound plane on Christmas Day.        
	The US embassy said it had received a threat by al Qaida, which American intelligence agencies believe has a growing presence in the poor Arab country.        
	The US embassy told its Yemeni staff to stay in their homes today.        
	The US embassy in Sanaa is closed today, January 3, 2010, in response to ongoing threats by al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula to attack US interests in Yemen, a statement on the embassy website said.        
	A British foreign office spokesperson cited security reasons for the embassys closure but declined to say if any specific threat had been made.

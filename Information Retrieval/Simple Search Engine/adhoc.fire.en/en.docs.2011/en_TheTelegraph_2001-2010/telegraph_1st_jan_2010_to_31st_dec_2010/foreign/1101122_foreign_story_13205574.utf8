	Washington, Nov. 21: North Korea showed a visiting American nuclear scientist earlier this month a vast new facility it secretly and rapidly built to enrich uranium, confronting the Obama administration with the prospect that the country is preparing to expand its nuclear arsenal or build a far more powerful type of atomic bomb.         
	Whether the calculated revelation is a negotiating ploy by North Korea or a signal that it plans to accelerate its weapons programme even as it goes through a perilous leadership change, it creates a new challenge for President Barack Obama at a moment when his programme for gradual, global nuclear disarmament appears imperiled at home and abroad.         
	The scientist, Siegfried S. Hecker, a Stanford professor who previously directed the Los Alamos National Laboratory, said in an interview that he had been stunned by the sophistication of the new plant, where he saw hundreds and hundreds of centrifuges that had just been installed in a recently gutted building that had housed an aging fuel fabrication centre, and that were operated from what he called an ultra-modern control room.         
	The North Koreans claimed 2,000 centrifuges were already installed and running, he said.         
	US officials know that the plant did not exist in April 2009, when the last Americans and international inspectors were thrown out of the country. The speed with which it was built strongly suggests that the impoverished, isolated country, which tested its first nuclear device in 2006, had foreign help and evaded strict new UN Security Council sanctions imposed to punish its rejection of international controls.         
	Just as the North used the sinking of a South Korean warship this year to build the credentials of its leader-in-waiting, Kim Jong-un, the son of the current leader and grandson of the countrys founder, this effort could be designed to show that the North must be accepted as a nuclear state along with the major nuclear powers and Pakistan, India and Israel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Firm Blair defends Iraq war
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Firm Blair defends Iraq war
                            
	London, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a defiant defence of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq today, saying the September 11 attacks in the US meant Saddam Hussein had to be removed.        
	Facing the first official public grilling on why he sent 45,000 British troops to war in Iraq, Blair said the policy of containing Saddams weapons of mass destruction programme had failed and the former Iraqi leader had to be dealt with.        
	This isnt about a lie, or a conspiracy, or a deceit, or a deception, this is a decision, said Blair, who initially looked nervous before becoming more confident as the hearing went on.

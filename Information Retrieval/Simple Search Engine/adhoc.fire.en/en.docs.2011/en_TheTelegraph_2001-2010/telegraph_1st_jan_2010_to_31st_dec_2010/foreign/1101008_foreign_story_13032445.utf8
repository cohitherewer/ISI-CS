The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Strong Sun actually cools Earth, says study

          RICHARD ALLEYNE                          Solar debate                                  
	Oct. 7: An increase in solar activity from the Sun actually cools the Earth, suggests new research that will renew the debate over the science behind climate change.        
	The research overturns traditional assumptions about the relationship between the Sun and global warming.         
	Focused on a three-year snapshot of time between 2004 and 2007, the findings will be seized upon by those who believe that mans role in rises in the earths temperature has been overstated.        
	 As solar activity waned at the end of one of the Suns 11-year cycles, the new data shows the amount of light and heat reaching the Earth rose rather than fell. Its impact on melting polar ice caps, and drying up rivers could therefore have been exaggerated by conventional climate models during the period.

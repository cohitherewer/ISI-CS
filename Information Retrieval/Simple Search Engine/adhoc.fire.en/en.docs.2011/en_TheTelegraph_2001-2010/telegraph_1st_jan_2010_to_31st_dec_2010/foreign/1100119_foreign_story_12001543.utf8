The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US guards aid, looters raid Haiti capital
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US guards aid, looters raid Haiti capital
                                  
	Port-au-Prince, Jan. 18 (Reuters): US troops protected aid handouts and the UN sought extra peacekeepers to bolster security in Haiti today as marauding looters emptied wrecked shops and tens of thousands of survivors waited desperately for food and medical care.        
	Hundreds of scavengers and looters swarmed over wrecked stores in downtown Port-au-Prince, seizing goods and fighting among themselves, but some signs of normality returned as street vendors emerged with fruit and vegetables for sale.        
	We do not have the capacity to fix this situation. Haiti needs help ... the Americans are welcome here. But where are they? We need them here on the street with us, said policeman Derain Robeson.        
	Some 2,200 Marines with heavy earth-moving equipment, medical aid and helicopters were arriving today, said the US Southern Command, which aims to have 10,000 US troops in the area for the rescue operation. UN chief Ban Ki-moon said he had recommended to the Security Council that 1,500 police and 2,000 troops be added to the current mission in Haiti.        
	Guatemala quake        
	A magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Guatemalas Pacific coast near the border with El Salvador today, the US Geological Survey reported, but there were no immediate reports of victims or damage.

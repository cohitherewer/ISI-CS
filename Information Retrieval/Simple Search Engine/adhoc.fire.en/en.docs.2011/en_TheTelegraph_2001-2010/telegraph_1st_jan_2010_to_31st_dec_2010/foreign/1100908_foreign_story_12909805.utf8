	Sept. 7: Philanthropist George Soros has announced a        
	10-year, $100 million grant to Human Rights Watch.        
	The organisation said today that it is receiving the funding from Soross Open Society Foundations.        
	The grant challenges Human Rights Watch to raise an additional $100 million in matching private contributions. It will require Human Rights Watch to increase its annual budget from $48 million to $80 million within five years. Soros said in the statement that human rights are at the heart of open societies.        
	It is the largest gift Soros has made, the largest gift by far that Human Rights Watch has ever received and only the second gift of $100 million or more made by an individual this year, according to the Centre on Philanthropy at Indiana University.         
	Were seeing noticeably fewer charitable gifts at the $100 million level from individuals reported than we did just a few years ago, said Patrick Rooney, the centres executive director.

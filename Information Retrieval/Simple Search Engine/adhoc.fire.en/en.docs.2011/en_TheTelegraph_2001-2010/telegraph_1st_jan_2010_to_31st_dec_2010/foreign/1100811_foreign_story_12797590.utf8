The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gates orders Pentagon cuts
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Gates orders Pentagon cuts
          DAVID S. CLOUD                          Gates: Tough times                                  
	Washington, Aug. 10: Facing growing pressure to cut military spending, defence secretary Robert M. Gates yesterday ordered the closing of a major Pentagon headquarters, restrictions on the use of contractors and reductions in the number of generals and admirals.        
	The belt-tightening moves were aimed at eliminating duplication and reducing overhead, Gates said at a Pentagon news conference. My greatest fear is that in economic tough times that people will see the defence budget as a place to solve the nations deficit problems, he said.        
	Pentagon officials would not supply estimates of the cost savings from the steps announced yesterday. They admitted that the savings were a minuscule part of the $712 billion in defence spending that the Obama administration has requested for fiscal year 2011.        
	After a decade of rapidly increasing defence spending, the Pentagon is facing growing calls from outside commissions and some members of Congress for cuts in its budget.        
	These steps dont go that far to reach the kind of savings he is going to need in the next five years, but its a start, said Todd Harrison, a defence budget expert at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.

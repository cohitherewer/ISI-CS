	Pirate Cruz    
	 London, March 22 (PTI): Actress Penelope Cruz will play Johnny Depps lover in the fourth film of the Pirates of the Caribbean series.       
	The two were last seen together as husband and wife in Blow. Cruz has signed up to play the daughter of British actor Ian McShane who will portray Depps new nemesis, the notorious pirate Blackbeard in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, according to producer Jerry Bruckheimer.      
	Shes the daughter of the bad guy... very feisty. Theres a little romance between Captain Jack and the character that Penelope plays, said the movie mogul.      
	Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, who were part of the previous three films in the hit franchise, are not returning for the fourth movie as they feel their characters storylines are at an end.

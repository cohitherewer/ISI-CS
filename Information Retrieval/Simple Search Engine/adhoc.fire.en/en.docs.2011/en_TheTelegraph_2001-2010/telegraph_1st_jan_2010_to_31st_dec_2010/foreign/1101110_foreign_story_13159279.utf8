The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cruise ship stranded off Mexico
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Cruise ship stranded off Mexico
                            
	San Diego, Nov. 9 (AP): A cruise ship stranded offshore with 4,500 passengers and crew must be towed slowly into a Mexican port and will not arrive until at least tomorrow night, the Coast Guard said today.        
	The Carnival Splendor was 320km south of San Diego when an engine room fire cut its power early yesterday, according to a statement from Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines. The 3,299 passengers and 1,167 crew members were not hurt and the fire was put out, but the 290-metre ship had no air conditioning, hot water or telephone service. Auxiliary power allowed toilets and cold running water to be restored last night.        
	The Mexican Riviera-bound ship, which was drifting about 90km off the northern Baja California coast, was in contact with the US Coast Guard, which deployed aircraft and ships.

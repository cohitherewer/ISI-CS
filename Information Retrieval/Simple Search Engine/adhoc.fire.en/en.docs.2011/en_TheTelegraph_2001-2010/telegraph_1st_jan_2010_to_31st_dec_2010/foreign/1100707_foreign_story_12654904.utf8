The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Afghan-neutral cry in Pak
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Afghan-neutral cry in Pak
                          Nawaz Sharif                    
	 Islamabad, July 6 (AP): Pakistan should stop trying to influence affairs in Afghanistan, Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif said today, admitting that the pro-Afghan Taliban policy he pursued when he was Prime Minister in the 1990s was a failure.        
	Sharifs comments come as he tries to gain political traction and deflect criticism that his party is beholden to extremist elements. Last week, he pushed the government to open talks with elements of the Pakistani Taliban, and the ruling party agreed to his proposal to hold a national conference on stopping terrorism.        
	The remarks also come as Pakistan tries to weigh in on reconciliation efforts between Afghanistans government, the US and the Afghan Taliban.        
	Pakistans historical interest in Afghanistan is largely a result of its desire to assert itself in the region and attain a strategic advantage over India. In an interview with Pakistans Dunya TV that aired on Monday and Tuesday, Sharif appeared to renounce a policy he pursued with vigour while twice Prime Minister in the 1990s. Back then, Pakistan openly supported the Afghan Taliban movement as it pushed out other armed factions such as the Northern Alliance and gained control of Kabul. Pakistan should abandon this thinking that Pakistan has to keep influence in Afghanistan, said Sharif, who heads the Pakistan Muslim League-N party. Neither will they accept influence, nor should the pro-influence-minded people here insist on it.        
	Our policy in the past has failed. Neither will such a policy work in future. We have a centuries-old relationship, and we can maintain this relationship only when we remain neutral.        
	It was unclear where Sharif would stand on the reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan.         
	 Sharifs party, which controls the government of Punjab province but sits in opposition in the federal government, is considered more conservative and aligned with pro-Taliban parties than the national ruling Pakistan Peoples Party.

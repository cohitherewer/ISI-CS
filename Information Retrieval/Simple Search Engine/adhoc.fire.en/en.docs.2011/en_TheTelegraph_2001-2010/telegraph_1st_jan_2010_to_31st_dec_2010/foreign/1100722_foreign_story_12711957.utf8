	July 21: David Warren, an Australian scientist who invented the black box flight data recorder, has died, at the age of 85.        
	Warren, came up with the idea for the cockpit voice recorder after investigating the crash of the worlds first commercial jet airliner, the Comet, in 1953. He thought it would be helpful for airline accident investigators to have a recording of voices in the cockpit.         
	He constructed a black box prototype in 1956, but it took several years before officials understood just how valuable the device could be.

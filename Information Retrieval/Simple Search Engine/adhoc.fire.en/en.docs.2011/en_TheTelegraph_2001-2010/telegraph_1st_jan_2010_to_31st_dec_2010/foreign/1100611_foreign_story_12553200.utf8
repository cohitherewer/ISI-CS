The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Calvin Klein cologne helps lure jaguars
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Calvin Klein cologne helps lure jaguars
                              Calvin Kleins Obsession for Men                            
	Guatemala City, June 9 (Reuters): Biologists tracking jaguars in the Guatemalan jungle might smell nice but its all in the name of science, with researchers finding the Calvin Klein cologne Obsession for Men attracts big cats.        
	Biologists Rony Garcia and Jose Moreira from the Wildlife Conservation Societys (WCS) Jaguar Conservation Programme say they use hidden cameras as a primary source for observing and tracking jaguars in Guatemalas Maya Biosphere Reserve.        
	But they also rely on Obsession for Men, a cologne known for its complex scent, to help lure, then research and ultimately preserve jaguars in the Central American country.        
	The method we are using to study the jaguars here in Guatemala is a non-invasive method which is based on photographing the individuals by using camera traps, Moreira told Reuters Television. It has been very useful using Obsession (for Men) to get the jaguars in front of these camera traps ... and that allows us to estimate with greater confidence the genders and the numbers that live in each studied site.        
	The discovery that Obsession for Men acted as a magnet for jaguars was the result of an experiment by WCS in the Bronx Zoo, New York.        
	The WCS was looking for ways to get cheetahs in front of camera traps, and, after several years of testing with different fragrances, found spraying the musky Obsession For Men near the heat-and-motion-sensitive cameras drew the cats for longer than other scents.        
	They also tried out 23 other fragrances but Obsession for Men kept the cats attention longest with Nina Riccis LAir du Temps coming second. The practice made its way down to Guatemala, where Garcia and Moreira said they have been recording similar success in the wild since 2007.         
	Garcia said the results will be invaluable to conservation efforts. These camera traps help us to identify how many jaguars are living in this area, he said.

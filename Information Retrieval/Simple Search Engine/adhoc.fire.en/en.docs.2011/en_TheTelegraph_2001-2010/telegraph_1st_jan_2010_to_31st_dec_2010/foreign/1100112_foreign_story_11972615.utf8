The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Train line stitches Balkans together

	Sarajevo, Jan. 11: The siege of Sarajevo had just begun the last time Vera Bagur, now 68, took the famous train line from Sarajevo to Belgrade. It was one of the few physical links that bound Muslims, Serbs and Croats.        
	That unity was cracking into violence as she peered, against the conductors orders, out the window as tanks rolled past in the dry, unpicked cornfields. That was the time I realised it was going to be serious, she said.        
	Now, after 18 years, the line is running again, one small reason the mood of Bagur, once again travelling from Sarajevo to Belgrade, was more, if not entirely, hopeful. I think were going to overcome this, Bagur said.        
	For the chain-smoking Serbs, Croats and Bosnians toasting one another in the cafe car, the revived passenger line was certainly a sign that their forced isolation from the rest of Europe and the world beyond could be on the verge of ending.        
	Starting on December 19, citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia could travel to EU countries without visas for the first time since the collapse of Yugoslavia.         
	Serbia, until recently an international pariah, applied for EU membership a few days later. Reacceptance into the western fold looks closer for the region than it has in years. But the region  like the train line itself  is by no means normal or fully integrated. In the fragmented territory of the former Yugoslavia, the train journey now requires four different locomotives from four separate railway companies, two passport checks and more than eight hours to journey about 483km.        
	That fragmentation plays out politically: the unresolved issue of gaining worldwide recognition of Kosovos independence remains both an impediment and a source of agitation, while the rise of nationalism ahead of this autumns general election in Bosnia and Herzegovina has meant increasing divisiveness and even fear of renewed violence here.        
	What is of the most concern for me is that for the first time in years, this political tension seems to be influencing and affecting the general public, said Srecko Latal, an analyst on Bosnia and Herzegovina with the International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation that aims to prevent deadly conflicts. Its a good thing that this choo-choo train is running between Sarajevo and Belgrade again, but Im not sure very many passengers will be on it until the issues in the Balkans are resolved.        
	But travellers flocked to the train last week to visit friends and relatives over the Orthodox Christmas holiday, and hope was high as the journey began at the Sarajevo train station, which was repaired after being badly damaged during the war. Rajko Zeljaja, 56, a telecommunications engineer and Orthodox Serb who is married to a Roman Catholic, took the bus from his home in Mostar to begin his journey.        
	I celebrated one Christmas in Mostar, Zeljaja said. Now I go to my mother in Serbia to celebrate another Christmas. They can change locomotives all they want, but I guess they cant change us. The station agent did not accept credit cards and wrote out each ticket by hand.         
	A round-trip ticket to Belgrade, the Serbian capital, cost around $45, a bargain compared with a plane ticket.        
	The train hugged riverbanks as flocks of ducks bobbed in icy, green water for much of the early part of the journey, stopping at small stations still prominently displaying the red star of communist times. It chugged past houses with snowy rooftops or, telling for a country still recovering from war, gutted houses with no roofs at all.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hillary heads to Port-au-Prince with aid

	Port-au-Prince, Jan 16 (Reuters): US secretary of state Hillary Clinton flew to Haiti today carrying relief supplies as the US poured in massive aid four days after the earthquake that local officials say killed up to 200,000.        
	Clinton left for Port-au-Prince today to meet Haitian President Rene Preval at the airport. Her plane was to bring in supplies and return with evacuated Americans.        
	We will also be conveying very directly and personally to the Haitian people our long-term unwavering support, solidarity and sympathies, Clinton said.        
	Trucks piled with corpses have been carrying bodies to hurriedly excavated mass graves outside the city, but thousands of bodies still are believed buried under rubble.        
	US rescuers worked through the night to dig out survivors from one collapsed supermarket where as many as 100 people could have been trapped inside. They were about to give up, when they were told a supermarket cashier had managed to call someone in Miami to say she was still alive inside.        
	We have already collected around 50,000 dead bodies, interior minister Paul Antoine Bien-Aime said. We anticipate there will be between 100,000 and 200,000 dead in total, although we will never know the exact number.        
	Some 40,000 bodies had been buried in mass graves, said secretary of state for Public Safety Aramick Louis.        
	If the casualty figures turn out to be accurate, the 7.0 magnitude quake that hit Haiti on Tuesday and flattened much of its capital city would be one of the 10 deadliest ever.        
	Health minister Alex Larsen told Reuters three-quarters of Port-au-Prince will have to be rebuilt.        
	Three days after the quake, gangs of robbers had begun preying on survivors living in makeshift camps on streets strewn with debris and decomposing bodies.        
	Scores of police were on the streets of downtown Port-au-Prince today, rounding up looters in the biggest security presence since the earthquake struck, witnesses said.        
	Reuters photographer Carlos Barria saw police shooting in the air, grabbing and throwing people to the ground, and occasionally kicking detainees in parts of the city. But there was still no sign of widespread looting and riots many feared.        
	Hungry residents fought each other for bags of foods handed out by UN trucks in downtown Port-au-Prince.        
	A senior UN official warned that hunger will fuel trouble if aid does not arrive soon, although the law and order situation remains under control for the time being.        
	The UN mission responsible for security in Haiti lost at least 36 of its 9,000 members when its headquarters collapsed. Its two top officials have not been accounted for.        
	The weakened Haitian government was in no better position to handle the crisis. The quake destroyed the presidential palace and knocked out communications and power.        
	Preval and Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive were living and working in the judicial police headquarters. I do not have a home, I do not have a telephone. This is my palace now, the President told Reuters in an interview.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Britain unveils radical spending cuts

          SARAH LYALL AND ALAN COWELL                          Osborne announcing the spending cuts in parliament in London. (AP)                                  
	London, Oct. 20: Seeking to free itself of crushing debt, the British government unveiled the countrys steepest public spending cuts in decades today, sharply reducing welfare benefits, raising the retirement age earlier than planned and eliminating almost half a million public sector jobs over the next four years.        
	Today is the day when Britain steps back from the brink, George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer told parliament as he laid out an ambitious and potentially risky plan to reduce debt.        
	The programme is a centrepiece of the coalition government, which blames the countrys economic malaise on its Labour predecessor under former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The cuts are so momentous that they could determine the coalitions fate as Britons face politically-charged austerity after years of growing prosperity before the financial meltdown in 2008.        
	It is a hard road but it leads to a better future, Osborne said. To back down now would be the road to economic ruin.        
	He said that 490,000 public sector jobs would be lost over the four-year savings programme and the size of government departments in London would be cut by one third.         
	Public spending would be cut by a total 83 billion by 2015.        
	Osborne said the authorities planned to save 7 billion a year on welfare payments by measures including the imposition of a new 12-month limit on people drawing some forms of long-term jobless benefits. Measures would be taken to curb benefit fraud and simplify the benefit system.         
	Additionally, other welfare payments would be limited to 500 a week for couples and families and 350 for single adult households so that no workless family can receive more in welfare than working households with median incomes.        
	Osborne said an increase in the official retirement age from 65 to 66 would start four years sooner than planned, in 2020, saving 5 billion a year. Britain has already said it will restrict once-universal child benefit payments to people earning less than around $70,000 a year.        
	Britains public deficit is one of the highest among developed economies, running at 11.5 per cent of its total economic output, compared to 10.7 per cent for the US and 5.4 per cent for Germany.         
	The debate that has seized Britain in advance of todays announcement centre around the question of whether deep cuts in spending would slow recovery, leading to a so-called double-dip recession.

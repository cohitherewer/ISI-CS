	Rome, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi sought to woo rebel deputies today, a day after surviving a vote that saw tumultuous scenes in parliament and set off some of the worst violence in Rome in years.        
	The wall between politics and the country, said an editorial in Turin daily La Stampa, which headlined its front page Berlusconi wins, guerrilla warfare in Rome.        
	Tuesdays no-confidence motion, which left the government clinging on by just three votes was widely seen as a humiliation for Gianfranco Fini, Berlusconis estranged former ally, who failed to bring down the 74-year-old Premier.        
	Im not looking at an agreement with political groups but Im looking at individual deputies who feel betrayed by Fini, who took them into the Opposition with the left, Berlusconi told Canale 5, part of his own Mediaset empire.        
	But the vote was also seen as a sign of deep-seated weakness in Italys institutions and a warning of more trouble ahead unless Berlusconi, mired in scandals over his personal life and tax affairs, can put his struggling government on a secure footing.        
	The last chance to guide the country, said Stefano Folli, an editorialist in financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore.        
	There was widespread shock at the violent protests which broke out in Rome after the vote, which echoed an ill-tempered debate in parliament punctuated by shouts and insults and interrupted by scuffles.

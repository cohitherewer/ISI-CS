The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Walkman sale stops in Japan
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Walkman sale stops in Japan

	Tokyo, Oct. 25: More than 200 million sales later and 30 years after the worlds first personal stereo system was launched, Sony has stopped selling the cassette tape Walkman in Japan.        
	Sales had been declining in recent years, increasingly so since the introduction of the iPod, but Sony has no plans to stop selling the cassette tape Walkman in other markets, the company said. There is still demand in certain regions, including emerging markets, but in Japan there has been a shift to other forms of recording media, said George Boyd, a spokesman for Sony in Tokyo.        
	But there is still residual demand for tape players and while we are phasing out the tape version of the Walkman here, tape as a format is still around and we will continue to sell tape decks for as long as the market is there, he said. Sony sold 220 million cassette tape Walkmans around the world in the three decades after it was released in 1979.         
	Credited with changing the way in which people listened to music, it was dreamed up by Nobutoshi Kihara, an engineer in Sonys audio division, in response to a request from Akio Morita, the companys joint chairman.        
	Arguably Sonys most famous product, the Walkman was not an instant success but it took off when the marketers targeted younger consumers.With the arrival of CDs, however, the tape Walkmans popularity began to decline, although Sony did bring out the Discman to meet that shift.         
	But the advent of downloadable music with devices that are able to store thousands of songs signalled the end of the Walkman in Japan, and the last one for the domestic market was produced on Friday.

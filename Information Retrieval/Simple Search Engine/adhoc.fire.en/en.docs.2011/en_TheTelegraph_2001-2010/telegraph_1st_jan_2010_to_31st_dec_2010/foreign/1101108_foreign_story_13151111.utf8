The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US gay bishop to quit 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US gay bishop to quit 
                            
	Boston, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Gene Robinson, whose consecration as the US Episcopal Churchs first openly gay bishop opened a deep rift in the worldwide Anglican Communion, said yesterday he planned to retire in 2013.        
	Robinsons election as bishop of New Hampshire in 2003 led some conservative Episcopalians to form their own church and stoked a backlash among Anglican churches in regions such as Africa.        
	To the New Hampshire Diocese, Robinson, 63, said the strains of the controversy surrounding his role figured in his decision.        
	The fact is, the last seven years have taken their toll on me, my family and you, he said.Death threats, and the now-worldwide controversy surrounding your election of me as bishop, have been a constant strain.        
	He said he gave early notice of his plans to smooth the transition to his eventual successor.

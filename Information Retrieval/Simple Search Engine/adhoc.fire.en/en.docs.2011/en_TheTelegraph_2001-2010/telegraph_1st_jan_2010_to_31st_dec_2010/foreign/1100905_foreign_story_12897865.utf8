The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Zuma awaits child No. 22
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Zuma awaits child No. 22
          JANE FLANAGAN                          Zuma: Proud Zulu                                  
	Cape Town, Sept. 4: South Africas polygamous President, Jacob Zuma, is to become a father for the 22nd time following news that his fiance is pregnant.        
	Bongiwe Gloria Ngema, who recently accompanied Zuma on a state visit to China, is expecting a child early next year, according to media reports citing her close friends. The pair already have one child and are supposed to marry in December, which will bring to four the number of South Africas First Ladies.        
	Reports of the pregnancy comes only a fortnight after the arrival of Zumas 21st child, which was born to the second of his current wives.        
	The boy, named Manqoba Kholwani which means believe it, arrived amid claims that he could be the result of an affair between his mother and her bodyguard. The President has dismissed the claims as rumours.        
	Now aged 68, Zuma has faced repeated calls to live a quieter life and devote more of his energies to leading his country out of the grinding poverty which confronts the majority of the population.        
	Zumas advisers insist that, as a proud Zulu, his culture permits him to have as many children as he wants with as many partners as he likes. However, the President was forced to make a humiliating apology earlier this year following the birth, out of wedlock, of his 20th child to the daughter of a family friend.        
	While polygamy is accepted in South Africa, the spiralling cost to the taxpayer of Zumas cultural observance has led to bitter clashes between the Presidents ruling ANC and the leading Opposition party. News of yet another child and another marriage are bound to reignite the debate.

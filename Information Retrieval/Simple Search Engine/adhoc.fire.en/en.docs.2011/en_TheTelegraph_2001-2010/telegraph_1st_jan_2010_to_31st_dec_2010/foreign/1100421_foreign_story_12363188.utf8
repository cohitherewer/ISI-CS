	Islamabad, April 20: The CIA has been accused of ordering the kidnapping of a former Pakistani intelligence officer, who turned human rights campaigner to defend al Qaida suspects.        
	The wife of Khalid Khawaja claims that her husband, who was once a confidante of Osama bin Laden, was taken at the request of the American intelligence service as he travelled through Pakistans lawless tribal belt.        
	Yesterday a group calling itself the Asian Tigers released videos of Khawaja, and the colleague he was captured with, saying that they were in Taliban custody and demanding the release of arrested militant leaders.        
	The kidnapping has baffled analysts who believe the two men were instrumental in fostering close ties between Pakistans intelligence agencies and radical Islamist groups.        
	Yesterday his wife, Shamama Khalid, said she did not believe her husband had been captured by the Taliban. We heard some groups there are supported by the CIA, she said. My husband is against this American war so maybe the Americans want to remove him from the fray.        
	Khawaja was taken along with Col Amir Sultan, known as Col Imam, as they travelled through North Waziristan. Col Imam, a guerrilla warfare specialist, worked with the CIA in the 1980s, training thousands of Afghan Mujahideen in their fight against the Soviets. He remained close to the Taliban once they took power, meeting frequently with its leader Mullah Omar.

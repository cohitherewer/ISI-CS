The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Saarc drops move to upgrade China status
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Saarc drops move to upgrade China status
          ARCHIS MOHAN                               
	New Delhi, April 23: A Nepalese proposal to make China a permanent member of Saarc has been dropped from the blocs agenda for this months summit in Bhutan after other member countries expressed reservations.        
	New Delhi has long considered Saarc its sphere of influence and been unenthusiastic about granting China permanent membership. But some of Indias neighbours want such a status for China to make Saarc a more vibrant grouping.        
	Sources said Nepal had pushed for the inclusion of its proposal to bring in China as well as Iran as permanent members. Pakistan and Bangladesh had backed the move, said a source in the Saarc secretariat.         
	Sources in the secretariat said the proposal was dropped after some other member countries argued that the move would be premature, given that China had been granted observer status only five years back.         
	China, on its part, has been dangling the carrot of seeking permanent membership for India in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.        
	The summit, to be attended by Manmohan Singh and other heads of state, will be held in Thimphu on April 28-29.         
	China and Iran will participate in the meetings as observers, along with seven other countries, including the European Commission, Japan, Mauritius, South Korea, Myanmar, Australia and the US.         
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao had yesterday ruled out bringing in more permanent members. A fresh entry into Saarc? No, I am afraid not. We have eight member countries and that is the way it is, she had said.         
	The eight members are India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

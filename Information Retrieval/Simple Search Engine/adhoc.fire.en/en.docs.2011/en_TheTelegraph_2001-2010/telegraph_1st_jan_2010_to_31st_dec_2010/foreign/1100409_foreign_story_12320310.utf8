The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Multitasking boost to iPhone
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Multitasking boost to iPhone
                                  
	Cupertino (California), April 8 (AP): Apple Inc.s iPhone and iPad devices will soon be able to run more than one program at a time, an ability that phones from Apples rivals already offer and that iPhone owners have long sought.        
	The changes, coming this summer to iPhones and this autumn to iPads, mean that users user might be able to listen to music using the Pandora programme and check a bank account online simultaneously. Currently, users must return to Apples home screen, effectively quitting the open programme, before starting a new task.        
	We werent the first to this party, but were going to be the best, Apple CEO Steve Jobs declared today, as the audience of bloggers, software developers and others greeted the news of such multitasking with applause.        
	The iPhone already permits some multitasking, but thats largely limited to Apples own programmes. Apple had not given users ways to seamlessly switch among all the software apps available from outside software companies.        
	That will change with the updates known as iPhone OS 4. Apple generally makes such updates available for free, and often automatically, as a software download. It really changes the way you use the iPhone, Jobs said. Jobs also unveiled a unified inbox for all email accounts, support for folders filled with applications and a way to connect an iPhone with a regular keyboard using Bluetooth wireless technology.

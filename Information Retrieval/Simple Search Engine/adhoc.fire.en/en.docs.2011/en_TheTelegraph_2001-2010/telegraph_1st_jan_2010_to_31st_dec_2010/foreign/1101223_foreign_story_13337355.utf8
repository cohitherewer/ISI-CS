The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | New Korea drills raise tension
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      New Korea drills raise tension

	Seoul, Dec. 22 (AP): South Korea vowed today to completely punish North Korea if it attacks again, and mobilised hundreds of troops, tanks and helicopters for a massive military exercise prompted by high tensions on the peninsula.        
	The firing drills planned for tomorrow near the Koreas heavily armed land border signalled that South Korea is willing to risk further escalating tensions with North Korea, which shelled a southern island off the western coast on November 23 and stirred up a war-like atmosphere.        
	The attack, which killed four people, was portrayed by Pyongyang as a retaliation for southern military exercises on Yeonpyeong island that day.        
	South Korea has conducted 47 similar military drills this year, and it scheduled one more exercise for tomorrow in response to the North Korean attack, an army officer said on condition of anonymity citing department rules.         
	Tomorrows drill will be the biggest-ever wintertime joint firing exercise that South Koreas army and air force have staged, an army statement said.        
	We will completely punish the enemy if it provokes us again like the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island, Brig. Gen. Ju Eun-sik, chief of the armys 1st armoured brigade, said separately.        
	South Korean forces are on high alert even though the North backed down from its threat to again retaliate over a separate firing drill the South held on Monday on Yeonpyeong in disputed western waters.        
	The two Koreas remain technically at war since their 1950s conflict ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty.         
	The North has made conciliatory remarks in recent days  telling a visiting US governor it might allow international inspections of its nuclear programmes  but Seoul is mindful of past surprise attacks and still is bracing for possible aggression.        
	South Koreas navy also began annual four-day firing and anti-submarine exercises yesterday off the countrys eastern coast.        
	That area has been less tense recently but in the past, the North has used eastern waters as a submarine route for communist agents to infiltrate South Korea.        
	The Koreas recent military skirmishes, including last months artillery bombardment, have been in the tense western waters, where Pyongyang does not recognise the UN-drawn border.         
	Tomorrows air force and army drills will involve 800 troops, F-15K and KF-16 jet fighters, K-1 tanks, AH-1S attack helicopters and K-9 self-propelled guns. They will take place in Pocheon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | West   warns Lanka   on UN
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      West warns Lanka   on UN
                                        
	Colombo, July 9 (Reuters): Nine nations and the European Union today warned Sri Lanka its handling of a protest led by a cabinet minister against a UN war crimes panel could threaten its international standing.        
	On the fourth day of the sit-in at the doorstep of the UN compound, construction minister Wimal Weerawansa vowed a fast to death if UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon does not end the work of the panel probing the bloody end of Sri Lankas war last year.        
	A joint statement issued today by the US, Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Romania, Norway and the European Union expressed dismay over the governments handling of the row and Weerawansas role.         
	Peaceful protest is part of any democracy, but blocking access to the UN... as well as intimidating and harassing UN personnel is a breach of international norms and harmful to Sri Lankas reputation in the world, it said.        
	Sri Lankas relations with the world body and western nations have been strained since it destroyed the separatist Tamil Tigers and won a 25-year conflict, a victory that drew military praise but equal criticism over civilian deaths.        
	Protesters led by Weerawansa on Tuesday blocked UN staff from leaving the office, prompting Ban to blast President Mahinda Rajapaksas government for failing to stop the unruly protests.        
	Ban also ordered closed the regional office of the UN Development Programme in Colombo. UN officials in Sri Lanka said it had already been downsized in preparation for a planned move to Bangkok. The main country office remains open.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lockerbie bomber lives beyond prognosis 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lockerbie bomber lives beyond prognosis 
                            
	London, July 4 (PTI): The Lockerbie bomber, who has outlived the three-month prognosis that led to his release on sympathetic grounds, could survive 10 years or longer, the cancer specialist who examined the Libyan last year has said.         
	Suffering from terminal cancer, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmet al-Megrahi of Libya was assessed last year by professor Karol Shikora who predicted he would be dead within three months of his release from prison. Shikora now says it is embarrassing that he has outlived his prognosis by so long.         
	Other doctors involved in Megrahis case said they did not believe he was close to death when he was released on compassionate grounds in August last year. The Scottish government provoked international outrage when it freed the Libyan, claiming there was a firm consensus among experts that he would die from prostate cancer within three months.         
	A Sunday Times probe established that one expert told Scottish officials at the time that Megrahi may have had many months to live. Other doctors refused to put a timeframe on his survival because of the unpredictability of the cancer. The advice of two experts consulted by the Libyans was ignored after they said Megrahi could live for 19 months.         
	Megrahi is the only person convicted of the 1988 bombing of a jet over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, which left 270 people dead.        
	The disclosures are likely to fuel claims that the Scottish and the Libyan authorities rigged the medical evidence to secure his freedom.

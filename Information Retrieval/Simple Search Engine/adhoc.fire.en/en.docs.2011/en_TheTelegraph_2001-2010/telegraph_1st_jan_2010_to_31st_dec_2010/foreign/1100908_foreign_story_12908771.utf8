                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Keira leaves Britain to save tax
                              US main home                            
	Sept. 7: Keira Knightley has left Britain to make the US her main home, according to reports.        
	The actress, 25, filed official documents for her company, Ponder Rights, which changed her principal country of residence from Britain to the US. The papers, filed at Companies House, are likely to raise a debate over whether Knightleys move is a bid to avoid Britains higher tax rate.        
	 Knightley was the subject of reports last month which claimed she had bought a 1.9 million country home in France, after becoming bored of living in London. She was also reported to have been living on a barge in London with her boyfriend, the actor Rupert Friend, 28, after leasing an East London apartment owned by her mother.

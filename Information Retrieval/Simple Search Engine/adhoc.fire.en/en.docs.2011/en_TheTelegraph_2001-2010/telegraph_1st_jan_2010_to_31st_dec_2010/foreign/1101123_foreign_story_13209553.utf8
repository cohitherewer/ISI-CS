                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Suu Kyi to see son after 10yrs
                            
	Yangon, Nov. 22 (AP): Myanmars pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi will be allowed to see her son for the first time in 10 years after the countrys ruling junta granted him a visa, her lawyer said today.        
	Kim Aris, 33, lives in Britain and has repeatedly been denied visas since his last visit in December 2000. Suu Kyi has been detained for 15 of the past 21 years and was unwilling to leave her homeland even when free for fear she would not be let back in to continue her political struggle. The 65-year-old Nobel Peace laureate was released from her latest house arrest term on November 13.        
	Nyan Win, a lawyer for Suu Kyi, said that Aris was expected to fly to Yangon from Bangkok tomorrow morning. He said she would meet him at the airport, and at some point soon take him to the citys famous Shwedagon pagoda, a cultural and religious landmark. I am very, very happy to finally see him, Nyan Win quoted Suu Kyi saying. I havent seen him for years. She spoke by phone with him soon after her November 13 release from seven-and-a-half years of continuous detention.        
	Myanmars junta tightly controls Suu Kyis movements because it sees her calls for democracy as a threat to its rule. Suu Kyi, who won the 1991 Nobel Peace prize for her dedication to the non-violent struggle for democracy, was first arrested in 1989 when Kim was 11 and his older brother Alexander was 16. In an interview last week with The Associated Press, Suu Kyi acknowledged that her years of political work had been difficult for her family.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sarko vows to punish rogues
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Sarko vows to punish rogues
          STEVEN ERLANGER AND ALAN COWELL                          Students at a protest in Marseille. (Reuters)                                  
	Paris, Oct. 21: Maintaining a tough line, President Nicolas Sarkozy warned today that troublemakers using violence in the protests against his proposed pension changes would be pursued and punished with no weakness on the part of the authorities.        
	The President spoke at a meeting with rural officials southwest of Paris as strikers blocked traffic in several cities and other protesters vowed to continue weeks of efforts to thwart the retirement changes on which Sarkozy appears to have staked his political future.        
	Sarkozy said strikers and demonstrators blocking fuel depots did not have the right to take hostage people who have nothing to do with it. He was referring to 10 straight days of strikes at refineries and blockades of fuel depots that have left motorists struggling to find fuel.        
	While the authorities said today that there had been a slow improvement in fuel supplies with only 14 out of more than 200 depots still blockaded, service station operators said about half of the countrys 13,000 fuel stations were experiencing supply problems.        
	The crisis shows little immediate sign of ending and a final parliamentary vote on Sarkozys plan to raise the minimum retirement age to 62 from 60 seemed unlikely until the middle of next week.        
	Referring to several days of clashes between the police and protesters in Lyon, which continued today, Sarkozy said the troublemakers will not have the last word in a democracy, a republic. It is not acceptable, he said.         
	They will be stopped, tracked down and punished, in Lyon and anywhere else, with no weakness. Because in our democracy, there are many ways to express yourself. But violence is the most cowardly, the most gratuitous, and that is not acceptable.        
	Earlier today, strikers blocked the access road to the airport in Marseille for several hours and held up traffic near the cities of Rouen, Toulon, and Le Havre.

	Yangon, Nov. 8 (AP): Clashes between rebels and Myanmar government troops raged today at key border points a day after the countrys first election in two decades  polling that critics say will cement the military-run governments power.        
	 At least 10 people were wounded in what was the first sign of post-election violence, and thousands of panicked refugees fled into neighbouring Thailand.         
	In the heaviest clashes, ethnic Karen rebels reportedly seized a police station and post office yesterday in the Myanmar frontier town of Myawaddy. Sporadic gun and mortar fire continued into this afternoon.         
	More fighting broke further south for one hour today at the Three Pagodas Pass, said local Thai official Chamras Jungnoi. However, there was no word on any casualties.        
	Groups from Myanmars ethnic minorities who make up some 40 per cent of the population had warned in recent days that civil war could erupt if the military tries to impose its highly centralised Constitution and deprive them of rights.        
	Myanmars secretive government has billed yesterdays poll as a step towards democracy, but most observers have rejected it as a sham engineered to solidify military control. President Barack Obama called the vote neither free nor fair. He said the US would continue a policy of both pressure and engagement in seeking change in Myanmar.        
	Still, some say having a parliament could provide an opening for moves towards democracy.

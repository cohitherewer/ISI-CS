The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China censors empty Nobel chair image
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China censors empty Nobel chair image
          MATTHEW CAMPBELL                          Blacked out                                  
	Dec. 12: China has taken its suffocating censorship to a new level by erasing from an Internet blog an image of the empty chair that graphically highlighted the absence of Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel laureate, from the peace prize ceremony in Oslo.         
	The image was removed only a few minutes after a lone Chinese blogger, evoking the man in the white shirt who stood in the path of four tanks near Tiananmen Square in 1989, posted it on a popular website in defiance of the authorities.         
	Buoyed by Lius award, Chinese dissidents will no doubt be keeping censors busy in the coming days: the blue and white empty chair is set to become a powerful symbol and rallying point for resistance to the regime. Already empty chairs have begun proliferating in cyberspace as icons identifying the participants in Internet forums. One image circulating online and via Twitter, the social networking site, showed a black chair in the shape of a human with handcuffs around the ankles.         
	I think that they will remember the empty chair, Geir Lundestad, the Nobel committee secretary, correctly predicted after the Nobel medal was placed on the chair under a portrait of the 54-year-old Liu at Fridays ceremony in Oslo.         
	Liu, a writer, professor and human rights activist, could not attend because he was jailed in 2009 for 11 years for his campaign to bring more freedom to China. China also prevented members of his family, including his wife, Liu Xia, from leaving the country to accept the medal on his behalf. A 900,000 cash prize went uncollected.         
	It has been rare for the award not to be received by a laureate or close family member since 1935, when Carl von Ossietzky, a German pacifist jailed under the Nazis, won the prize. This year it was left to Liv Ullman, the Norwegian actress and film director, to speak Lius words for him.         
	In the days leading up to the ceremony, China signalled its fury with a crackdown on dissidents, who were barred even from gathering at cafes for fear they would find a way to celebrate the occasion.         
	Zhang Xianliang, the mother of a student killed in the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, said she had been shadowed on a visit to Beijing by four plainclothes agents, who demanded that she stay out of the capital and escorted her to her home in the southwestern province of Yunnan.         
	They have become crazy, she said. This is unprecedented. I have never been so threatened in the last 20 years.         
	The crackdown at home was accompanied by an international campaign to pressurise countries to boycott the ceremony but this focused even more attention on proceedings in Oslo.         
	Only in China could the authorities ensure that, for the great majority of the 1.3 billion inhabitants, word of the award was ruthlessly censored.         
	However, in Hong Kong, which still stages protests in defiance of Beijing, a few dozen slogan-chanting pro-democracy demonstrators gathered to celebrate with champagne after watching a live broadcast on a screen in a park. It was the only public screening of the event on Chinese territory.         
	On Friday, police kept up a heavy presence outside the flat of Lius wife. Her telephone and Internet connections have been cut off for weeks to prevent her from communicating with the outside world.         
	Foreign embassies in Norway were warned that if they sent representatives to the ceremony they would face unspecified consequences. Russia, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan were among the countries that stayed away.

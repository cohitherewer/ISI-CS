                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Kayani term extended by 3yrs
                              General Ashfaq Kayani                            
	Islamabad, July 22 (Agencies): Pakistans Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani today extended the term of the countrys powerful army chief by three years in a move to preserve continuity in the fight against Islamist militancy.        
	General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani was supposed to retire in November after the completion of his three-year term in office.        
	This decision has been taken in the light of his effective role in the war against terrorism and in the enforcement of rule of law in the country, Gilani said in a televised address after consultation with President Asif Ali Zardari.        
	We are confident that under the leadership of General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani the war against terrorism will be taken to its conclusion.        
	Kayani, a former head of the ISI, who is also believed to have a good rapport with the American military officials, was appointed army chief in November 2007 by former President Pervez Musharraf.        
	Under Kayanis command, the military launched major offensives against militants linked to al Qaida in their strongholds in the northwest.        
	He also helped the civilian government to avert possible political unrest in 2009 triggered by Opposition protests for the restoration of judges ousted by Musharraf.         
	There have been reports in the past few months that Kayani could be given an extension or made the chief of defence staff so that he can continue to guide Pakistans armed forces in the war against terrorism.         
	Gilani had last week said that he will make a final decision soon on whether to give Kayani an extension in service.         
	Under the 18th constitutional amendment, it is the Prime Ministers prerogative to decide on the term of the army chief.         
	Born into a family from Punjab, Pakistans traditional seat of power and largest province, Kayani, 58, studied at a military college in his home town of Jhelum, before training at the US armys Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the National Defence College in Islamabad.        
	After fighting as a lieutenant in the 1971 war against India, Kayani was appointed as deputy military secretary to former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1988.        
	He won accolades for overseeing troop movements in a tense 2001-2002 border standoff between Pakistan and India as the armys chief operational commander.        
	In September 2003, he was promoted to command the armys elite 10 Corps in Rawalpindi.        
	Known as man of few words by his colleagues, the chain-smoking army chief headed investigations into two December 2003 assassination attempts against Musharraf, securing several convictions, before being appointed director-general of the ISI in October 2004.

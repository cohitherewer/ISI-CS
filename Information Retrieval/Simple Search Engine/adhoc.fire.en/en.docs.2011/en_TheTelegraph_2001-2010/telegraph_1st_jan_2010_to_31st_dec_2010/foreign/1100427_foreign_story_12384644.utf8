The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Teenagers create secret online language

                              Private plan                            
	London, April 26: Teenagers on social networking sites such as Facebook and Bebo are creating a secret language to stop adults knowing what they are up to, researchers say.        
	The teens are using it to stop parents and employers judging them by their social activities such as partying and drinking. Instead of writing they are drunk, teens post Getting MWI  or mad with it.        
	Being in a relationship is known as taken or Ownageeee, and Ridneck, a corruption of redneck, means to feel embarassed.        
	Meanwhile, girls posting Legal are indicating that they are above 16 and legally allowed to have sex.        
	Lisa Whittaker, a postgraduate student at the University of Stirling, who studied teens aged 16-18 on Bebo in Scotland, said the slang had been created to keep their activities private, and cited the example of one young girl who was sacked after bosses found pictures of her drinking on the website.        
	Young people often distort the languages they use by making the pages difficult for those unfamiliar with the distortions and colloquialisms., she said.        
	The language used on Bebo seems to go beyond abbreviations that are commonly used in text messaging, such as removing all the vowels.        
	This is not just bad spelling, which would suggest literacy issues, but a deliberate attempt to creatively misspell words. The creation and use of their own social language may be a deliberate attempt to keep adults from understanding what is written on the page.

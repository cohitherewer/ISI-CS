	Love via texts    
	 London, April 15 (PTI): Demi Moore has revealed that her relationship with husband Ashton Kutcher, who is 15 years her junior, began through text messages.       
	Moore, 47, said in the beginning they would text each other constantly. When the actress first met Kutcher, he paid no attention to her, reports the Daily Mail .      
	The first night I met him he didnt have two words to say to me  he had a singular focus and it was on somebody else, Moore said on the morning talk show Live with Regis and Kelly in New York. The actress, who is promoting her new film, The Joneses, said all went her way when they met again just two weeks later at a party.    
	Keira Maze    
	London (PTI): Actress Keira Knightley worked for free in her latest film, Maze, because she just clicked with the directors ideas. Knightley, 23, is Elizabethan lover Constance in the 10-minute short film. Keira and her lover get lost in a maze trying to find each other. It was shot by painter turned filmmaker Stuart Pearson Wright in one day for just 15,000, reports The Independent. I loved the idea of doing something that was purely creative, weird and wonderful and not a commercial venture.

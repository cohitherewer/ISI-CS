The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US warns Pak on Iran gas
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US warns Pak on Iran gas
                          Richard Holbrooke                     
	Islamabad, June 20 (Reuters): Pakistan should be wary of committing to an Iran-Pakistan natural gas pipeline because anticipated US sanctions on Iran could hit Pakistani companies, the US special representative to the region Richard Holbrooke said today.         
	While sympathetic to Pakistans energy needs, Holbrooke, told reporters that new legislation, which targets Irans energy sector, is being drafted in the US Congress and that Pakistan should wait and see.        
	Pakistan has an obvious, major energy problem and we are sympathetic to that, but with regard to a specific project, legislation is being prepared that may apply to the project, Holbrooke said, referring to the pipeline.         
	We caution the Pakistanis not to over-commit themselves until we know the legislation.         
	Pakistan is plagued by chronic electricity shortages that have led to mass demonstrations and battered the politically shaky government of President Asif Ali Zardari.        
	US Senator Joseph Lieberman said last week he expects Congress to finish legislation tightening US sanctions on Iran shortly.         
	The law will include provisions affecting the supply of refined petroleum products to Tehran, and add to sanctions on its financial sector. Lieberman said it could be passed by July 4.        
	The $7.6 billion natural gas pipeline deal, signed in March, doesnt directly deal with refined petroleum products and was hailed in both Iran and Pakistan as highly beneficial.        
	The US has so far been muted in its criticism of the deal, balancing its need to support Pakistan, a vital but unstable ally in the global war against al Qaida, with its desire to isolate Iran. But the legislation could be comprehensive enough to have major implications for Pakis- tani companies, Holbrooke said.        
	This is Holbrookes tenth trip to Pakistan since President Barack Obama appointed him special representative to the region.

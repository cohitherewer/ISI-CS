The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US military seeks to expand Pak raids
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US military seeks to expand Pak raids
          MARK MAZZETTI AND DEXTER FILKINS                          A paramilitary soldier on guard in Islamabad. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Dec. 21: Senior American military commanders in Afghanistan are pushing for an expanded campaign of Special Operations ground raids across the border into Pakistans tribal areas, a risky strategy reflecting the growing frustration with Pakistans efforts to root out militants there.        
	The proposal, described by American officials in Washington and Afghanistan, would escalate military activities inside Pakistan, where the movement of American forces has been largely prohibited because of fears of provoking a backlash.        
	The plan has not yet been approved, but military and political leaders say a renewed sense of urgency has taken hold, as the deadline approaches for the Obama administration to begin withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan.         
	Even with the risks, military commanders say that using American Special Operations troops could bring an intelligence windfall, if militants were captured, brought back across the border into Afghanistan and interrogated.        
	The Americans are known to have made no more than a handful of forays across the border into Pakistan, in operations that have infuriated Pakistani officials. Now, American military officers appear confident that a shift in policy could allow for more routine incursions.        
	Americas clandestine war in Pakistan has for the most part been carried out by armed drones operated by the CIA.        
	Additionally, in recent years, Afghan militias backed by the CIA have carried out a number of secret missions into Pakistans tribal areas. These operations in Pakistan by Afghan operatives, known as Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams, have been previously reported as solely intelligence-gathering operations.         
	But interviews in recent weeks revealed that on at least one occasion, the Afghans went on the offensive and destroyed a militant weapons cache.        
	The decision to expand American military activity in Pakistan, which would almost certainly have to be approved by President Obama himself, would amount to the opening of a new front in the nine-year-old war, which has grown increasingly unpopular among Americans.         
	It would run the risk of angering a Pakistani government that has been an uneasy ally in the war in Afghanistan, particularly if it leads to civilian casualties or highly public confrontations. Still, one senior American officer said, Weve never been as close as we are now to getting the go-ahead to go across. The officials who described the proposal and the intelligence operations declined to be identified by name discussing classified information.         
	Ground operations in Pakistan remain controversial in Washington, and there may be a debate over the proposal. One senior administration official said he was not in favour of cross-border operations  which he said have been generally counterproductive  unless they were directed against top leaders of al Qaida. He expressed concern that political fallout in Pakistan could negate any tactical gains.

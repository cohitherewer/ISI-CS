The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Blogger held in Facebook sting
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Blogger held in Facebook sting
                            
	Qalgiliya (West Bank), Nov. 15: A mysterious blogger who set off an uproar in the Arab world by claiming he was God and hurling insults at the Prophet Muhammad is now behind bars  caught in a sting that used Facebook to track him down.        
	The case of the unlikely apostate, a shy barber from this backwater West Bank town, is highlighting the limits of tolerance in the western-backed Palestinian Authority and illustrating a new trend by authorities in the Arab world to mine social media for evidence.        
	Residents of Qalqiliya say they had no idea that Walid Husayin  the 26-year-old son of a Muslim scholar  was leading a double life.        
	Known as a quiet man who prayed with his family each Friday and spent his evenings working in his fathers barber shop, Husayin was secretly his anti-religious opinions on the Internet during his free time.        
	The media in the Palestinian Authority, as in the Arab world in general, are largely government-controlled, driving dissenting voices to the relative freedom of the Internet. The bloggers arrest showed a willingness on the part of the Palestinian government to clamp down on freedom of speech on the Web as well. He now faces a potential life prison sentence on heresy charges for insulting the divine essence.        
	Many in this conservative Muslim town say that isnt enough, and suggested he should be killed for renouncing Islam. Even family members say he should remain behind bars for life. He should be burned to death, said Abdul-Latif Dahoud, a 35-year-old Qalqiliya resident.         
	Few have come forward to defend him. One was Zainab Rashid, a liberal Palestinian commentator, who wrote in an online opinion piece that Husayin had made the important point that criticising religious texts for their (intellectual) weakness can only be combatted by ... oppression, prison and execution.        
	Over several years, Husayin is suspected of posting arguments in favor of atheism on English and Arabic blogs, where he described the God of Islam as having the attributes of a quot;primitive Bedouin. quot;                    USA TODAY

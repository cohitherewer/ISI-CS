	Islamabad, May 4 (Reuters): Pakistan today made several arrests in connection with the failed Times Square car bomb attack in New York, security sources said.        
	We have picked up a few family members related to Faisal Shahzad, the chief suspect in the attempted attack, a security official in Karachi said. A friend of Shahzad was also arrested.        
	Another intelligence official in Pakistan said Shahzad received militant training in northwest Pakistan near the garrison town of Kohat. The area around Kohat is a stronghold of Tariq Afridi, the main Pakistani Taliban commander in the region.        
	Pakistan, which could come under renewed US pressure to crack down harder on militants after the Times Square incident, vowed today to help the US bring Shahzad to justice        
	We will cooperate with the United States in identifying this individual and bringing him to justice, interior minister Rehman Malik told Reuters.        
	US ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson met Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Malik and talked about the issue, Pakistani government officials and the US embassy said.        
	Malik said Shahzads family came from northwestern Pakistan which is mainly inhabited by Pashtuns and where Islamic militants are active.        
	He belongs to Pabbi, he said, referring to a small town near Peshawar about an hours drive from Islamabad. He has Pakistani identification documents. We are making further checks.

                              Paras: Trigger happy                            
	Kathmandu, Dec. 13 (PTI): Nepals former Crown Prince allegedly opened fire during an argument with the newly-wed daughter and son-in-law of the deputy Prime Minister, Sujata Koirala, at an upmarket tourist resort in Nepal.        
	Paras Shah,38, the only son of deposed king Gyanendra, fired in the air after arguing with Melanie, Koiralas daughter, following a drinking session.         
	No one was injured in the incident last night, sources said. Paras, known in Nepal for his late night escapades in bars and casinos, sought to defend his actions in a statement today. He said he could not bear insults against himself and his family.         
	Though no official complaint has been filed so far, the news of the incident dominated newspaper front pages in Nepal today. Various political groups called for Parass arrest who recently returned to Nepal after a brief, self-imposed exile in Singapore.         
	According to close friends of the deputy Prime Minister , the firing took place at the Tiger Tops Resort at Chitawan National Park in southern Nepal where Melanie and her Bangladeshi husband Subel Chaudhary got into an argument with the former prince.         
	The friends, who preferred not to be named, said a drunk Paras fired his gun after blaming Sujata Koiralas father, the late Girija Prasad Koirala, responsible for the end of the Nepal monarchy.         
	In the statement today Paras admitted firing his gun into the air over two guests at the resort, who he claimed had said negative things about his former role and the institution which he represented.         
	Witnesses at the resort said Paras, who was accompanied by his wife and young son, had to be escorted out from the dining hall for shouting at the guests.         
	Nepali media quoted them as saying that the former prince had fired as many as five times in the air.         
	During his years as a prince, Paras was a target of intense public criticism for his partying ways and frequent brawls. These arguments, mostly at night clubs and casinos, had triggered public protests against him.         
	Nepals three-century-old monarchy was abolished in 2008 when Parass father Gyanendra Bikram Shah had to give up his throne.         
	But he returned to Nepal recently where his wife has launched a fund to help deprived women, in a move widely seen as an attempt to rehabilitate the familys public image. A spokesman for Tiger Tops refused to comment on the incident and Nepali police spokesman Bigyan Raj Sharma said that he has no information about it .        
	 Sujata, who is in Singapore, reportedly called home minister Bhim Rawal to look into the matter and take legal action against Paras, according to The Kathmandu Post.

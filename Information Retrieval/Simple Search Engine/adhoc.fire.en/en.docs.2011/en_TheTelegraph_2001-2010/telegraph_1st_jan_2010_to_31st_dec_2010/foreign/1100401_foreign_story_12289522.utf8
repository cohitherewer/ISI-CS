	Madonna dress irony    
	 London, March 31: Madonna has risked accusations of adopting double standards by saying that she wishes her daughter Lourdes would dress more conservatively, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The pop star, famed as much for her outlandish outfits as her vocals, berated the 13-year-old over her risqu dress sense. The 51-year-old singer told US Weekly magazine that she was less than impressed with the recent wardrobe choices of her daughter.      
	If anything, I wish shed dress more conservatively, she said. However, she did acknowledge that the suggestion was a bit rich, coming from someone who wore a Jean Paul Gaultier-designed conical bra costume for her 1990 world tour. Hows that for irony? she added. [Lourdess style is] inspired by kids she sees in hip-hop and ballet classes, European influences, bands she listens to.

	New York, Feb. 15 (PTI): Pop star Shakira and tennis champ Rafael Nadal have sparked rumours that they might be more than just friends.

	There was just the two of them at the table together. They were whispering and all smiles. It definitely looked like they are more than just friends. They were there for a few days shooting, an eyewitness said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Blizzard hits NY region, affects travel

	Dec. 27: Sunshine and deep piles of sparkling snow blanketed the northeast this morning, but for frustrated commuters and holiday travellers struck by the winters first ferocious storm, the beauty was short-lived.         
	Gusting winds kicked up formidable snowdrifts further crippling an entire New York metropolitan region trying to dig out, shutting down the three major airports, stopping commuter trains and some subway lines  even stranding some passengers overnight  and causing nightmare delays without much of a sense of when the conditions would improve.         
	About two feet of snow fell across the New York area through the overnight hours, making even the easiest of commutes  for those still having to report to work  a Himalayan trek.         
	The massive winds damaged switches for train lines, drifted snow perilously deep on the tracks and even caused plow trucks to get stuck.         
	Transit officials said that there was no service along the entire Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road commuter rail networks as of 9am. All New Jersey Transit trains were operating with delays of up to 30 minutes, but New Jersey Transit bus service remains entirely suspended. The Staten Island Railway is also suspended.         
	Bus service throughout the city is uniformly bad, a spokesman said, particularly on hilly routes. New York City Transit received reports of more than 400 stuck buses last night and early this morning. Express routes are making all local stops; you can assume that everything is running with delays, said Charles Seaton, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman.         
	Although New York City Transit takes extensive measures to prevent service disruptions in a snowstorm, we were overwhelmed, Seaton said. Blowing snow drifts of up to one-metre high contributed to equipment problems and prevented crews from accessing some tracks and switches. Another problem this morning was transportation for train operators themselves. Many were having trouble getting to work, and Seaton said that a dearth of workers had contributed to the decision to shut down the entire B line.         
	Morning commuters faced the daunting prospect of cutting fresh tracks in half a metre of snow along roads and sidewalks that looked more like Colorado than the urban north.         
	A total of 51cm covered Central Park, according to the National Weather Service. The deepest snow was recorded in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where 78cm fell. The storm had largely moved on from New York city by sunrise, heading northeast out past Long Island and up over Nantucket, gradually weakening, the weather service said.         
	But for all its bluster and powder, the monster storm was technically a blizzard only outside Manhattan. The winds in Central Park blew at 58kmph but were not sustained over a period of three consecutive hours, nor was the visibility under a quarter of a kilometre for that period  both requirements to qualify as a blizzard. We didnt quite make the criteria in Central Park, said Matt Scalora, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Central Park. But we did meet the criteria at JFK airport and La Guardia, he added.         
	The Federal Aviation Administration said that the three New York airports would remain closed indefinitely. The Philadelphia and Boston airports were open, according to the FAA. Even as airports re-open, however, flight delays were expected and could extend into the week.         
	The storm was just in time to disrupt the plans of thousands of people trying to get home after the holiday, return unwanted gifts or take advantage of post-holiday sales.

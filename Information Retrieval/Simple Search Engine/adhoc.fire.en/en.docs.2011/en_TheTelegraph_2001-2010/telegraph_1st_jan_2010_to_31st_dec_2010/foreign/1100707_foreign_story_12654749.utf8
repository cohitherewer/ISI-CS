                                Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck                    
	 London, July 6 (PTI): Pop star and actress Jennifer Lopez admits her split with actor Ben Affleck completely changed her, while her romance with rap superstar P. Diddy was ugly and sordid.         
	The 40-year-old star whose engagement to Affleck ended hours before they were supposed to wed in September 2003 was left heartbroken by their split and ended up not quite the same person she was before they started dating, Contactmusic said.         
	I dont think I had ever been heartbroken in that way before had so many hopes and dreams on something. This was the first time and it was tough. When you go through that kind of heartbreak in front of everybody you are not quite the same person you were before, Lopez says in her Behind The Music documentary for VH1.         
	Before Affleck, Lopez dated rapper P. Diddy for two-and-a-half years relationship as ugly and sordid. He was like, I love you. Right away. It was very fast, but we did have a connection. We did fall in love and we were very close. But my relationship with him was always something I knew would end. It started out as something very pure and innocent. But it did get ugly, it did get sordid, Lopez said.         
	After dating the rapper, she had a brief marriage to dancer Cris till June 2002, when she started dating Affleck.         
	Lopez is now settled with her long-term friend, singer Marc Anthony, whom she briefly dated in the 1990s and has two-year-old twins Max and Emme with him.         
	They recorded a track together for Lopezs film Shall We Dance in 2004, and following a whirlwind romance, they wed on June 5 that year.         
	We make each other better. We reconnected like we had never been apart. It was really the same chemistry and connection we had at the very beginning, Lopez said.         
	I couldnt be more in love. I say it every day  Im the luckiest man on earth, Anthony said.

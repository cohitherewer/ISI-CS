  - President ignoring floods        SALMAN MASOOD                          Zardari: Under pressure                                        
	Islamabad, Aug. 6: As rain fell throughout Pakistan today, public anger at President Asif Ali Zardari, away on a European trip, began to swell with critics accusing him of ignoring the countrys worst flooding in 80 years in order to travel abroad.        
	Political opponents, print and electronic media continued venting their anger at Zardari as the army and international aid organisations struggled to help victims of the flooding. After visiting France, Zardari is in Britain where he arrived yesterday at the country residence of British Prime Minister David Cameron for talks on terrorism, Afghanistan and trade.        
	The floods are expected to inflict heavy suffering in southern Sindh province after roaring down from the northwest and through the agricultural heartland of Punjab province. Authorities have evacuated more than half a million people in Sindh.        
	The Pakistan government emphasised that the talks were an opportunity to smooth over a diplomatic tussle created by comments last week by Cameron that were highly critical of Pakistans approach to fighting terrorism.         
	After the meeting yesterday, Zardari and Cameron both described ties between their countries as unbreakable. Storms will come and storms will go, and Pakistan and Britain will stand together and face all the difficulties with dignity, Zardari said.        
	But Zardaris diplomacy has not eased criticism at home, where his popularity continued to fall in surveys.        
	We have been let down very badly by Zardari, Nawaz Sharif, an Opposition leader and former Prime Minister, said earlier this week.        
	 We have been let down more by him than the statement by David Cameron, Sharif said after visiting flood affected areas in Charsadda in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province.

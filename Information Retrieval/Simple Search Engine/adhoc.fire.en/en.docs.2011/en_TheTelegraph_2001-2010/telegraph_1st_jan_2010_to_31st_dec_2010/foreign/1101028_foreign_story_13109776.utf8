The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pilots strike grounds Biman flights
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pilots strike grounds Biman flights
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                       Retirement ruckus                                
	Dhaka, Oct. 27: Bangladesh Bimans global operations came to a standstill today after its pilots decided to go on strike.         
	Last night, Biman suspended four pilots, prompting the others to join the strike today. As a result, most flights were cancelled for an indefinite period. However, the Bangladesh Airlines Pilots Association (BAPA) confirmed that no Haj flights would be disrupted during the strike.         
	The protest is likely to disrupt up to 15 international flights. These include Dhaka-Jeddah, Dhaka-Riyadh, Dhaka-Dubai-London, Sylhet-Kathmandu-Bahrain, Dhaka-Kuwait, Chittagong-Muscat and Dhaka-Singapore flights.         
	The other flights that could be affected are Dhaka-Sylhet and Dhaka-Calcutta-Kathmandu, Biman sources said. Most of the stranded passengers are waiting at the terminal.         
	However, many Calcutta- bound passengers decided not to wait and continue their journey via train or bus.         
	One of the suspended pilots, Captain Masood, told this correspondent that out of the 115 Biman pilots, 102 decided not to operate any flights from 9pm yesterday. Masood said the suspension letters were given to the pilots around 8pm.         
	On October 20, the pilots gave a 24-hour ultimatum to the airline to meet their demands.         
	The following day, Biman called the pilots statements contrary to national interest.         
	Biman officials said pilots who have flying experience have been kept on standby.         
	Several thousand domestic and foreign passengers will remain stranded if the airline does not make alternative arrangements.         
	The pilots decided on Tuesday night not to fly Biman planes. This sudden surge of sickness immediately following that decision is certainly intentional, Biman chairman Jamaluddin Ahmed told a local news channel here, adding: Bimans board of directors will convene a meeting tonight. The body will decide on the next course of action.         
	The airline operates 15 flights a day on 18 international and three domestic routes.

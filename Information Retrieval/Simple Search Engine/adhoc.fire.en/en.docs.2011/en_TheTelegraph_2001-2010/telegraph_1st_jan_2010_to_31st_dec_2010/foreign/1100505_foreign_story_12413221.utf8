	London, May 4: The size of the digital universe will swell so rapidly this year that a new unit  the zettabyte  has been invented to measure it.        
	Humanitys total digital output currently stands at 8,000,000 petabytes  each of which represents a million gigabytes  but is expected to pass 1.2 zettabytes this year.        
	One zettabyte is equal to one million petabytes, or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 individual bytes.        
	The current size of the worlds digital content is equivalent to all the information that could be stored on 75 billion Apple iPads, or the amount that would be generated by everyone in the world posting messages on the microblogging site Twitter constantly for a century.        
	The rapid growth of the digital universe has been caused by the explosion of social networking, online video, digital photography and mobile phones.        
	Around 70 per cent of the worlds digital content is generated by individuals, but it is stored by companies on content-sharing websites such as Flickr and YouTube.

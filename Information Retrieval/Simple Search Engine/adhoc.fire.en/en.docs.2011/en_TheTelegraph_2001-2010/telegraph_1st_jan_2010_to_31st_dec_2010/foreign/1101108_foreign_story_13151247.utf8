	Katie in trouble    
	 London, Nov. 7 (PTI): Model Katie Price is facing up to two years in jail over allegations that she hit a photographer with her car after leaving a theatre in Sussex last month.       
	The 32-year-old glamour model was photographed sitting in the front seat with husband Alex Reid and talking on her mobile phone as she drove away from the theatre.       
	And now, after studying photographs of the alleged incident, police have served the 35-year-old with a legal notice asking her to confirm whether or not she was driving at the time of the accident, reports the Daily Star.    
	Emma tale    
	 London (PTI): Actress Emma Watson has said she is straight and boring and refuses to drink alcohol at parties. The Harry Potter star who is currently studying at Brown University in the US and is legally old enough to consume alcohol in the UK, said that she avoided drinking during her first year in college as she felt it would be wrong to flout American laws, reports Contactmusic.

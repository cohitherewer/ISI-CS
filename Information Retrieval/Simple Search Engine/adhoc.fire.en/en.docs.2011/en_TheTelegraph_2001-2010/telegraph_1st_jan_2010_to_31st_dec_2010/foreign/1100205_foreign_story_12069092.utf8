The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Trace of thought found in vegetative patient
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Trace of thought found in vegetative patient
          BENEDICT CAREY                              
	Feb. 4: He emerged from the car accident alive but alone, there and not there: a young man whose eyes opened yet whose brain seemed shut down. For five years he lay mute and immobile beneath a diagnosis  vegetative state  that all but ruled out the possibility of thought, much less recovery.        
	But in recent months at a clinic in Lige, Belgium, the patient, now 29, showed traces of brain activity in response to commands from doctors.         
	Now, according to a new report, he has begun to communicate: in response to simple questions, like Do you have any brothers?, he showed distinct traces of activity on a brain imaging machine that represented either yes or no.        
	Experts said on Wednesday that the finding could alter the way some severe head injuries were diagnosed  and could raise troubling ethical questions about whether to consult severely disabled patients on their care.        
	The new report, posted online by The New England Journal of Medicine, does not suggest that most apparently unresponsive patients can communicate or are likely to recover. The hidden ability displayed by the young accident victim is rare, the study suggested.        
	Nor does the finding apply to victims of severe oxygen depletion, like Terri Schiavo, the Florida woman who became unresponsive after her heart stopped and who was taken off life support in 2005 during an explosive controversy over patients rights.        
	Moreover, experts said the new test was not ready for wide use; serious technical challenges remain to be worked out.        
	Still, the experts agreed that the new study exposed the limits of the current bedside test for diagnosing mental state: checking whether patients eyes can track objects, and carefully looking for any signs  eye blinks, finger twitches  in response to questions or commands.        
	Im convinced as an observer that in these few cases, the MRI technique, in these researchers hands, gives us a window into human consciousness that we have not had and that potentially adds to the clinical exam we currently use, said Dr James L. Bernat, a professor of neurology at Dartmouth Medical School.        
	In the new paper, researchers in Britain and Belgium studied 54 patients living in states of persistent unconsciousness. Of these, 23 had a diagnosis of vegetative state, meaning they were not able to signal any response to commands or questions.        
	In 2006, the same research group reported that one of the 23 vegetative patients showed on imaging tests that her brain was responding to commands. When doctors asked her to think of playing tennis, areas of her motor cortex leapt to life. When asked to think of being in her house, spatial areas in the brain became active.        
	In the current experiment, the researchers found that three other patients identified as vegetative showed similar responses. To open a channel of communication, they instructed one of them, the 29-year-old man, to associate thoughts about tennis with yes and thoughts about being in his house with no.        
	They then asked questions, repeating the procedure numerous times, switching the associations to make sure the patient was in fact making conscious choices.

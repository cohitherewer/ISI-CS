The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Texas crash pilot hated tax system
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Texas crash pilot hated tax system
          MICHAEL BRICK                          Joseph Stack III                                  
	Austin (Texas), Feb. 19: Leaving behind a rant against the government, big business and particularly the tax system, a computer engineer smashed a small aircraft into an office building where nearly 200 employees of the Internal Revenue Service were starting their workday yesterday morning, the authorities said.        
	The pilot, identified as Andrew Joseph Stack III, 53, of north Austin, apparently died in the crash, and one other person was unaccounted for.         
	Late yesterday, two bodies were pulled from the site, though the authorities would not discuss the identities of those found, The Associated Press reported. Two serious injuries were also reported in the crash and subsequent fire, which initially inspired fears of a terrorist attack and drew nationwide attention.        
	But in place of the typical portrait of a terrorist driven by ideology, Stack was described as generally easy-going, a talented amateur musician with marital troubles and a maddening grudge against the tax authorities.        
	I knew Joe had a hang-up with the IRS on account of them breaking him, taking his savings away, said Jack Cook, the stepfather of Stacks wife, in a telephone interview from his home in Oklahoma. And thats undoubtedly the reason he flew the airplane against that building. Not to kill people, but just to damage the IRS.        
	Within hours of the crash, before the death or even the identity of the pilot had been confirmed, officials ruled out any connection to terrorist groups or causes.        
	In a six-page statement signed Joe Stack (1956-2010) and posted on a website connected to Stacks wife, the author singled out the tax agency as a source of suicidal rage, concluding: Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, lets try something different, take my pound of flesh and sleep well.        
	Though profane at points, the statement articulated grievances with specific sections of the tax code, corporations, politicians and a local accountant. It appeared to have been written with some deliberation. At one point, the verbs left and abandoned appear side by side, seemingly an editing choice never settled.        
	From relatives, friends and neighbours, a portrait emerged of Stack as a man pushed over the brink by retirement dreams deferred by a long series of financial setbacks. By the account of Cook, Stack was raised in an orphanage in Hershey, Pennsylvania.

	Phnom Penh, Nov. 22 (AP): The Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Sen, today said that more then 180 people died in a stampede during a water festival in the capital.        
	Authorities had estimated that more than 2 million people would descend on Phnom Penh for the three-day water festival, which marks the end of the rainy season. Its main attraction are the traditional boat races along the river. A witness said the crowd began to panic after a few people fell unconscious in the crush.        
	Ambulances raced back and forth between the river and the hospital for several hours after the stampede, while onlookers and relatives waited outside.        
	 The last race ended in early evening, and the panic started later on Koh Pich  Diamond Island  a long spit of land in the river where a concert was being held.         
	Soft drink vendor So Cheata said the trouble began when about 10 people fell unconscious in the crowd. She said that set off a panic, which then turned into a stampede, with many people caught underfoot.         
	Part of the crowd pushed on to a bridge, which also jammed up, with people falling under others and off the bridge.

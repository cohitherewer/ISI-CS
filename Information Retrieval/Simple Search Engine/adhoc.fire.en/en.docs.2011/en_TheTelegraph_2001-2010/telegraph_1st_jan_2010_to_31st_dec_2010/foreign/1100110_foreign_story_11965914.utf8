	Fans shiver for King    
	 Memphis (Tennessee), Jan. 8 (Reuters): The cold couldnt keep them away from the King.      
	Hundreds of Elvis Presley fans braved frigid, snowy weather to celebrate the late rockroll legends 75th birthday yesterday at his Graceland shrine, part of a marketing machine that generates $50 million a year.      
	It feels like his presence is here, long-time Elvis devotee Debbie Bradshaw of Texas said during a tour of the Memphis mansion where Presley died in 1977.      
	Some 1,500 people shivered and sang along with the early Presley hit Thats All Right in minus 11.7 degrees Celsius as snowflakes swirled. Chilled fans gave their warmest reception to Presleys ex-wife Priscilla, daughter Lisa Marie and her two children  including Benjamin Keough, who bears a striking resemblance to his grandfather  when they appeared onstage in an open-sided tent at the shopping complex across Elvis Presley Boulevard.

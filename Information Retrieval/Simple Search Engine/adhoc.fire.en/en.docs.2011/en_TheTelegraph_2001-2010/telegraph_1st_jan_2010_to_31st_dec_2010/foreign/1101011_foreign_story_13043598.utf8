The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chile waits to free miners
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Chile waits to free miners
                            
	San Jose Mine, Chile, Oct. 10 (AP): The 33 miners trapped for more than two months in a Chilean mine are enjoying the day tantalisingly close to rescue.         
	Drillers have completed an escape shaft, and Chiles mining minister says a video inspection shows the holes walls are firm enough to allow the men to be hoisted out as early as Wednesday.        
	Officials said late yesterday that workers first must reinforce the top few hundred feet of the tunnel and had begun welding steel pipes for that purpose.        
	The completion of the 28-inch-diameter escape shaft yesterday morning caused bedlam in the tent city known as Camp Hope, where the miners relatives had held vigil for an agonising 66 days since a cave-in sealed off the gold and copper mine August 5.        
	Miners videotaped the piston-powered hammer drills breakthrough at 2,041 feet underground and could be seen cheering and embracing, the drillers said.        
	On the surface, the rescuers chanted, danced and sprayed champagne.

  - Leaks behind policy        NASIR JAFFRY                                    
	Islamabad, Dec. 26: Pakistans government is formulating a policy to restrict movement of foreign diplomats and prevent their free interaction with politicians and members of civil society without permission from the foreign ministry.         
	The interior ministry is working closely with the foreign office and in consultations with parliamentarians to formulate the new Standard Operating Procedures, official sources said in Islamabad amid media reports that interior minister Rehman Malik had also asked lawmakers in the upper and lower Houses to give the government a road-map to formulate the policy.         
	The need to formulate the policy arose after some of members of the Opposition in the lower House recently drew attention of the interior minister towards increasing US interference in Pakistans internal matters.         
	They said: It is unfortunate that foreign diplomats move freely in the country and meet leaders without seeking permission of the foreign office. They interfere in our politics and violate our sovereignty.         
	The interior minister has already asked the lawmakers to set up a parliamentary committee to finalise broad contours of the procedures to restrict movements of foreign diplomats, the sources said, adding that the the procedures, when formulated, will be purposeful only if Pakistani politicians as well as ruling and Opposition lawmakers avoid meeting foreign diplomats without permission of the foreign office.         
	The campaign to formulate the policy began weeks after the leaked US cables by whistleblower WikiLeaks and published by British and American newspapers threw light on political machinations of Pakistan leaders in the name of democracy, Washingtons growing interference in political affairs and highlighted international concerns about the safety of Pakistans nuclear arsenal and private support of some politicians for US drone attacks in the countrys lawless tribal regions.

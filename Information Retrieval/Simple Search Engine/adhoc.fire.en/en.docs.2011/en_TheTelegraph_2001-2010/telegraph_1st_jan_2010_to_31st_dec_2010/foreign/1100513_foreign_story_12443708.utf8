	Tripoli, May 12 (Reuters): A Libyan Airbus jet crashed early today as it tried to land at Tripoli airport, killing 103 people on board, most of them Dutch, leaving a young boy the sole survivor, Libyan officials said.        
	The Airbus A330-200, which had been in service only since September, was flying from Johannesburg to the Libyan capital when it crashed just short of the runway around 0400 GMT, the airline and planemaker said.        
	Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said there were several dozen Dutch passengers on board the aircraft. Libyan officials said 22 of the victims were Libyans. They gave no details of the other nationalities on board.        
	The plane was carrying 93 passengers and 11 crew, Libyan officials and executives from the airline said. Transport minister Mohamed Zidan said investigators were working out what went wrong with Afriqiyah Airways Flight 8U771 but that he ruled out terrorism as the cause. Libyan online newspaper Quryna, which has close ties to the government, reported that shortly before the crash the pilot had contacted the control tower to ask them to alert emergency services because there was a problem with the plane.

	Karachi, Oct. 7 (AP): Two suspected suicide bombers attacked the most beloved Sufi shrine in Pakistans largest city today, killing at least 10 people, wounding 65 others and sending a stark reminder of the threat posed by Islamist militants to this US-allied nation.        
	The attack came amid tensions between Washington and Islamabad over Nato helicopter incursions that have led Pakistan to close a key border crossing used to ferry supplies to western troops in Afghanistan.         
	The explosions at the Abdullah Shah Ghazi shrine in Karachi took place this evening, the busiest time of the week for Sufi shrines across the country. Thousands typically visit the shrine today, praying, distributing food to the poor and toss rose petals on the grave of the saint.        
	 Ghazi was an 8th century saint credited with bringing Islam to the region along the coast. Local legend has it that his shrine protects Karachi from cyclones and other sea-related disasters.        
	Pakistani Sufi sites have frequently been the target of Islamist militant groups, whose hardline interpretations of the religion leave no room for the more mystical Sufi practices that are common in this Sunni-majority nation of 175 million. Earlier this year in Lahore, nearly 50 people were killed in a similar attack at another major Sufi shrine.        
	An Associated Press reporter at the scene in Karachi saw blood, flesh and shoes splattered at the shrine compound. A young boy with blood-stained clothes cried for help in a police vehicle, TV footage showed. Dozens of ambulances lined up outside to ferry victims to hospitals.        
	 As Tahir Salim, an official with the paramilitary Pakistani Rangers, said some suspicious packages were found, police and other security officials held hands and formed a human chain to keep people from entering the area.        
	The first explosion took place as the suspected bomber was going through the metal detector before a long staircase leading to the main shrine area, said Babar Khattak, the top police official in Sindh province. The second blast took place about 10 seconds later, further ahead of the metal detector, he said.        
	Mohibullah Khan, a 38-year-old manual labourer, was about to visit the shrine after evening prayers at a nearby mosque when the explosions occurred.        
	I heard a huge bang and smoke billowed from there,Khan said. I ran back towards the mosque and seconds after heard another big explosion. Then I moved to help the wounded and put six or seven of the crying ones in ambulances and police vehicles.        
	The death toll was at least 10, Sindh province home minister Zulfiqar Mirza said, adding that suicide bombers were suspected because of the severed heads discovered. We have provided the best available security at this shrine, Mirza said. Humanly, it is not possible to stop suicide bombers intent on exploding themselves.        
	In July, twin suicide bombers attacked Data Darbar, Pakistans most revered Sufi shrine in Lahore, killing 47 people and wounding 180.

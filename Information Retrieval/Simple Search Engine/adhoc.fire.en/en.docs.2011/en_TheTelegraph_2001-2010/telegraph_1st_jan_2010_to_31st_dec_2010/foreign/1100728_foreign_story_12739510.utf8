	July 27: Apple likes to maintain tight control over what programmes can appear on the iPhone  a task that just became a little bit harder.        
	The Library of Congress, which has the power to define exceptions to an important copyright law, said yesterday that it was legal to bypass a phones controls on what software it will run to get lawfully obtained programmes to work.        
	The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit digital rights group, had asked for that exception to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to allow the so-called jailbreaking of iPhones and other devices.        
	This is a really important victory for iPhone owners, said Corynne McSherry, a senior staff lawyer with the foundation. People who want to tinker with their phones and move outside of the Applesphere now have the ability to legally do that.        
	The issue has been a topic of debate between Apple, which says it has the right to control the software on its devices, and technically adept users who want to customise their phones as they see fit.        
	 In a legal filing last year with the US Copyright Office, which is part of the Library of Congress, Apple argued that altered phones infringed on its copyrights because they used modified versions of Apples operating system.        
	Apple also said that altering the phones encouraged the pirating of applications, exposed iPhones to security risks and taxed the companys customer support staff.

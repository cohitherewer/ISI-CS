The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fresh storm brings Europe travel delays
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fresh storm brings Europe travel delays

	Paris, Dec. 24: A fresh storm brought new travel chaos to Europe today, snarling roads, slowing train routes and delaying flights for thousands of Christmas Eve travellers from northern France, Belgium and parts of Germany, as troubles at the delay-plagued Heathrow airport began to clear up.        
	The backlog of stranded passengers was growing today as Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport, the major hub for Paris, faced a shortage of de-icing fluid, compounding the delays as planes sat on the tarmac. About two thousand people remained camped inside the airport from delays built up over the week. Were expecting shortly to receive 12 tons of de-icing fluid from the US, delivered by plane, and there are truckloads arriving from Germany, as well, said a spokeswoman for Aeroports de Paris.         
	Across Europe, an overnight onslaught of snow and ice was causing new air travel delays.         
	On a day like today, we would normally have had around 25,000 flights across Europe by now, Rena Fakhouri, a spokeswoman for the air safety organisation Eurocontrol, said this morning.         
	By contrast, weve had about 15,500 so far today. Not only is that number insufficient to move frantic holiday travellers with tickets for today, it also means airports are adding to the number of frustrated passengers.         
	The snow this week has been unusually gluey, the Paris airports spokeswoman said, requiring twice as much de-icing as is normally the case and leading to the shortage in France. There is enough fluid on hand for about 200 flights to take off today, transport minister Thierry Mariani told the French daily Le Figaro.         
	A spokeswoman for Aeroports de Paris said about 35 per cent of flights would be cancelled in the afternoon. While that was an improvement from the 50 per cent of morning flights that were halted, it meant dashed hopes for thousands of people who had hoped to reach their families or vacation destinations for Christmas.         
	Officials at Charles de Gaulle airport briefly evacuated a portion of a large international terminal, 2E, where snow had built up on the roof. In 2004, a portion of the same terminals roof came crashing down, killing four people and leading to structural changes.         
	There was never any risk that the roof would collapse, a spokesman for Aeroports de Paris, which operates the Paris airports, said, adding that passengers could now return to the entire terminal. It was done as a safety precaution.         
	Light snow and cold temperatures were forecast for the rest of the day, but the forecast for tomorrow offered relief with sunny skies.         
	Frankfurt airport, Germanys main hub, escaped the worst of the recent bad weather, and said it was operating near normal. But Dsseldorf and Dortmund airports were closed in the morning, and Schiphol airport, serving Amsterdam, was reporting delays and cancellations. Brussels airport was in disarray.         
	Heathrow said it would be operating 1,100 flights, 95 per cent of the normal schedule. Some carriers were taking extra measures to clear their backlogs. Virgin Atlantic said it was adding a charter flight from Heathrow to John F. Kennedy International airport in New York.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iraqs 19-year N-winter ends 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Iraqs 19-year N-winter ends 
                            
	UN, Dec. 15 (Reuters): The UN Security Council today gave Iraq the green light to develop a civilian nuclear programme, ending 19-year-old restrictions aimed at preventing the country from developing atomic weapons.        
	In two other resolutions, the 15-nation council also wound up the controversial oil-for-food programme for Iraq and set June 30, 2011, to end all immunities protecting Baghdad from claims related to the period when former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was in power.        
	The adoption of these important resolutions marks the beginning of the end of the sanctions regime and restriction on Iraqs sovereignty, independence and recovery, Iraqs foreign minister Hoshiyar Zebari told the council.        
	Our people will rejoice for having turned a chapter on the aggressive, belligerent and defiant behaviour of the previous regime towards international law and legitimacy, he said.        
	After its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq was hit with a series of UN measures that banned imports of chemicals and nuclear technology that could be used in its covert atomic, chemical and biological weapons programmes. Those restrictions were in place for two decades.        
	Baghdad will keep paying 5 per cent of its oil revenues as war reparations, most of it to Kuwait, despite Iraqs calls for a renegotiation of those payments so it can use more of its oil money for needed development.        
	Iraq still owes Kuwait nearly $22 billion in reparations, Western diplomats said.         
	The diplomats said the resolutions included Iraqs recognition of the borders of Kuwait, a country that Saddams government had called the 19th province of Iraq.

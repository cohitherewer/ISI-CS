	Pretty Julia    
	 London, July 14 (PTI): Actress Julia Roberts feels that she is pretty enough to take part in a beauty campaign even though she is on the other side of 40.      
	Roberts, who is the new face of French cosmetics brand Lancome, said she is now confident of her appearance.      
	The whole idea of modelling in my 40s, I think, is very modern and fun. Theres a kind of joy and sense of fun to doing it right now, a sense of being secure in who you are that I feel today in my 40s, Roberts said.

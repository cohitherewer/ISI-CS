The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chelsea nuptials on Saturday in NY village
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Chelsea nuptials on Saturday in NY village
                              Top secret                            
	Rhinebeck (New York), July 27 (Reuters): Bill and Hillary Clintons daughter will be married on Saturday in Rhinebeck, and the picturesque New York village is basking in the glory of hosting what many have dubbed Americas royal wedding.        
	Signs and pictures congratulating Chelsea Clinton, the only child of the former President and the US secretary of state, and groom Marc Mezvinsky hang in many shop windows, and the nuptials have the rural town talking.        
	While wedding plans have remained top secret, the presence of US Secret Service agents in Rhinebeck, 160km north of New York city, point to the ceremony being held at Astor Courts, an historic 50-acre estate on the Hudson river. Its all everyones talking about, said Cassidy Reed, 20, an assistant at a local hair salon. We havent had one client in here who hasnt said something about it.        
	Wedding balloons blew in the breeze outside The Rug Garden, a dress shop mannequin wore a wedding gown and an equestrian store offered advice with a sign: No nagging the groom.        
	To welcome Chelsea and Marc and all their friends were having champagne and cake, said Deborah Belding, 56, owner of The Rug Garden. Its an honour that a former first daughter is coming to our town and getting married.

	Pontiac (Michigan), July 14 (AP): A Detroit-area woman, who pleaded guilty to having sex with the biological son she gave up for adoption and later tracked down on the Internet, has been sentenced to 30 years in prison.        
	Thirty-six-year-old Aimee L. Sword of Waterford Township apologised at her sentencing on Monday in an Oakland court. She had pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in a deal with prosecutors.        
	Police say Sword used Facebook in 2008 to find her son, who is now 16. She gave him up for adoption as an infant. He testified they had sex in Waterford Township and Grand Rapids which is 50km northwest of Detroit.

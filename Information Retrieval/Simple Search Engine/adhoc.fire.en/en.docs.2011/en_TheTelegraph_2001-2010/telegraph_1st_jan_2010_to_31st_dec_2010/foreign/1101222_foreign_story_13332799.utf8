                              Whisked away                            
	London, Dec. 21 (PTI): Madonna angered her first class co-passengers when she was able to leave their snow-stranded plane two hours before the others and added to the trouble when she started doing yoga in the aisles.        
	Passengers on board a flight from New York became stranded on the snow-bound tarmac of Heathrow airport over the weekend.        
	As UKs transport system to a near standstill, Madonna and her entourage were whisked away by bus to the terminal before everyone else. It was bad enough having to wait, but then she started doing her yoga in the aisles. After about an hour, a bus came along and took her and her party of about 15 off the plane. The rest of us all had to wait for another two hours, said a passenger on the plane.

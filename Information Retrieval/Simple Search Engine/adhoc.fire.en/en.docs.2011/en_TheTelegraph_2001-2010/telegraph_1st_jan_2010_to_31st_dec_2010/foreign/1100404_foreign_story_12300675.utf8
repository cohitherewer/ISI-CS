The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | For race, Obama checks black

	New York, April 3: It is official: Barack Obama is the nations first black President.        
	A White House spokesman confirmed that Obama, the son of a black father from Kenya and a white mother from Kansas, checked African-American on the 2010 census questionnaire.        
	The President, who was born in Hawaii and raised there and in Indonesia, had more than a dozen options in responding to Question 9, about race.         
	He chose Black, African Am., or Negro. (The anachronistic Negro was retained on the 2010 form because the Census Bureau believes that some older blacks still refer to themselves that way.)        
	Obama could have checked white, checked both black and white, or checked the last category on the form, some other race, which he would then have been asked to identify in writing. There is no category specifically for mixed race or biracial.        
	Instructions for the censuss American Community Survey, which poses the question in the same way as the 2010 form, say that people may choose to provide two or more races either by marking two or more race response boxes, by providing multiple write-in responses, or by some combination of marking boxes and writing in responses.        
	In the 2000 census, when Americans first were allowed to check more than one box for race, about 6.8 million people reported being of two or more races.        
	Speaking in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama hailed new signs of an improving US labour market yesterday as proof that we are beginning to turn the corner.

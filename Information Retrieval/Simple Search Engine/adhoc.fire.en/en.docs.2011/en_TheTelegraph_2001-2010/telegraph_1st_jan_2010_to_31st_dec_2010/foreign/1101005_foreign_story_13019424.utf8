	Oct. 4: Wave goodbye to BIOS, say hello to UEFI, a new technology that will drastically reduce start-up times.        
	The next generation of home computers will be able to boot up in just a few seconds, as 25-year-old BIOS technology makes way for new start-up software known as UEFI. BIOS, which has been used to boot up computers since 1979, was never designed to last as long as it has.        
	By contrast, UEFI  which stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface  has been built to meet modern computing needs, and will soon be the pre-eminent technology in many new computers, enabling them to go from off to on in seconds.        
	At the moment, it can be 25- to 30 seconds of boot time before you see the first bit of OS sign-on, Mark Doran, head of the UEFI Forum, told the BBC.

	Kathmandu, May 27: Nepal President Ram Baran Yadav today told the three major political parties he would have no option but to impose Emergency unless they reached an agreement to extend the Constituent Assemblys tenure.         
	The 601-member Assemblys two-year term expires on Saturday.         
	Yadav summoned Sushil Koirala of the Nepali Congress, Jhalanath Khanal of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, of the Maoists to his official residence this morning and urged them to avert a constitutional crisis.        
	 The President expressed his concern over the bickering and emphasised on the need to extend the term of the Constituent Assembly on time, a spokesman said.

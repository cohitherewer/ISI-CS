The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mobiles used more for data

          JENNA WORTHAM                          No need to call                                  
	New York, May 14: Liza Colburn uses her mobile phone constantly.        
	She taps out her grocery lists, records voice memos, listens to music at the gym, tracks her caloric intake and posts frequent updates to her Twitter and Facebook accounts. The one thing she doesnt use her mobile phone for? Making calls.        
	I probably only talk to someone verbally on it once a week, said Colburn, a 40-year-old marketing consultant in Canton, Massachusetts, who has an iPhone.        
	For many Americans, mobile phones have become irreplaceable tools to manage their lives and stay connected to the outside world, their families and networks of friends online. But increasingly, by several measures, that does not mean talking on them very much.        
	For example, although almost 90 per cent of households in the US now have a mobile phone, the growth in voice minutes used by consumers has stagnated, according to government and industry data.        
	This is true even though more households each year are disconnecting their landlines in favour of mobile phones. Instead of talking on their mobile phones, people are making use of all the extras that iPhones, BlackBerrys and other smartphones were also designed to do  browse the Web, listen to music, watch television, play games and send email and text messages.

	Washington, May 13: There are many ways to pay off campaign debts  cajoling phone calls, begging letters  but Bill Clinton believes that he has come up with a better method to wipe out the financial obligations outstanding from his wifes failed presidential bid.        
	In an email sent to millions of people who supported Hillary Clintons White House campaign, the former President asks: How would you like the chance to come up to New York and spend the day with me? For those who would like the One-Day-With-Bill prize, an online donation of as little as $5 will buy them the chance.        
	Hillarys campaign still has a few vestiges of debt that I know she would like to see paid in full. Will you reach out today to help Hillary this one last time? Clinton asks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China plans highest airport
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China plans highest airport
                            
	Beijing, Jan. 12 (AP): China has announced plans to build the worlds highest airport in Tibet by 2011, further accelerating investment into the restive Himalayan region, state media said today.        
	The 4,436-metre Nagqu Dagring Airport is expected to surpass Bamda Airport, also in Tibet, by 102 metres as the worlds highest altitude airport, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The new airport is part of Beijings ongoing plan to encourage development of transportation and other industries in the long-isolated region as a way to promote its economic growth and raise living standards.        
	Six new railway lines in and around Tibet are in the works, following the opening in 2006 of the final link in a line from Beijing to the capital Lhasa. Critics worry the rush into Tibet could wreck much of the regions ecosystem.

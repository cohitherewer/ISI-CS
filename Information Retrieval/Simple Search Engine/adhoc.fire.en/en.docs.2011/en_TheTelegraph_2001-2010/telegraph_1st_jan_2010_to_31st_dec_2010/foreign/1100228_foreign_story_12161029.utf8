The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US soldiers can now use Twitter
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US soldiers can now use Twitter
                            
	Washington, Feb. 27 (Reuters): The Pentagon announced yesterday it has authorised the use Twitter, Facebook and other so-called Web 2.0 sites across the US military, saying the benefits of social media outweighed security concerns.        
	The decision, which comes at a time of growing concern over cyber-security, applies only to the US militarys non-classified network. But it could mean big changes for large portions of the US armed forces, including the Marines, which had selectively banned social media on work computers.        
	The department of defence also had bans in place since 2007 on accessing certain bandwidth-gobbling websites.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Court: Detain Wiki founder

                              Julian Assange                            
	Stockholm, Nov. 18 (Reuters): A Swedish court today ordered the detention of Julian Assange, the founder of whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks, on suspicion of rape and other sexual crimes.        
	Assanges lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig, told journalists after the hearings he expected a European arrest warrant would be issued for Assange, who had sometimes visited Sweden in the past, and that he would probably appeal.        
	He maintains his complete innocence, Hurtig said. He declined to answer questions as to the whereabouts of Assange, an Australian citizen. But sooner or later he has to come to Sweden if this continues, Hurtig said.        
	The prosecutors office began an investigation into allegations of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion against Assange in September. The reason for my request (to the court) is that we need to interrogate him. So far, we have not been able to meet him to carry out the interrogations, said Marianne Ny, leading the case for the prosecution authority.        
	Assange has called the allegations baseless and criticised what he has called a legal circus in Sweden, where he had been seeking to build a base in order to benefit from its strict journalist protection laws. He has said that he had been warned by Australian intelligence before the charges were brought that he could face a campaign to discredit him.        
	Hurtig played down talk of a plot. I dont think so, at least not from the CIA or from any big organisation, he said.

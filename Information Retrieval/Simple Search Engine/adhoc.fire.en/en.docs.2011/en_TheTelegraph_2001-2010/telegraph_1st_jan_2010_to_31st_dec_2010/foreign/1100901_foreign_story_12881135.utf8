	The Hague (Netherlands), Aug. 31 (AP): Dutch investigators today questioned two men arrested at Amsterdams airport after US authorities found suspicious items in their checked luggage, including a mobile phone taped to a bottle, a knife and a box cutter.        
	The pair were arrested yesterday morning at Schiphol Airport after getting off a United Airlines flight from Chicago, where their decision to change their flight plans raised flags in the US, officials said.        
	They were being held at the airport for questioning, but neither has been charged with any offence in the Netherlands, said Martijn Boelhouwer, spokesman for the national prosecutors office. Under Dutch law, the men can be held without charges for up to six days.        
	Edmond Messchaert, a spokesman for the Dutch National Coordinator for Counterterrorism, said his agency was aware of the case but would not comment further. Dutch authorities do not release the names of suspects in criminal investigations. Boelhouwer would not confirm their nationalities or say if US authorities had requested their extradition.        
	But a US law enforcement official identified the men as Ahmed Mohamed Nasser al Soofi and Hezam al Murisi.        
	Al Soofi had an address in Detroit, Michigan, the official said. Another US law enforcement official said the men had not been charged with anything in the US.         
	Al Soofi was questioned as he went through security in Birmingham, Alabama, on his way to Chicago, one of the officials said.        
	 He told the Transportation Security Administration authorities he was carrying a lot of cash. Screeners found $7,000 on him, but he was not breaking any law by carrying that much money.

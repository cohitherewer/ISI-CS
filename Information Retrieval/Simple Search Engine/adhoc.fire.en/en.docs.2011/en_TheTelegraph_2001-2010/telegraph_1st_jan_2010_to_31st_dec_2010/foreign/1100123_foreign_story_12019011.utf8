The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hillary speech angers China
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hillary speech angers China
                            
	Beijing, Jan. 22 (Reuters): China hit back at US criticism of Internet censorship and hacking today, warning that relations between the two global heavyweights were being hurt by a feud centred on Web giant Google.        
	US secretary of state Hillary Clinton yesterday challenged Beijing and other authoritarian governments to end Internet censorship, an issue that has jumped to the heart of US-China ties after Google threatened to quit China due to hacking and Web restrictions.        
	Chinas foreign ministry said the US criticisms could hurt relations between the worlds biggest and third biggest economies, already strained by disagreements over trade imbalances, currency values and US weapons sales to Taiwan.        
	The US has criticised Chinas policies to administer the Internet and insinuated that China restricts Internet freedom, said spokesman Ma Zhaoxu. This runs contrary to the facts and is harmful to China-US relations. We urge the US to respect the facts and cease using so-called Internet freedom to make groundless accusations against China, Ma said in a statement carried on the foreign ministry website www.mfa.gov.cn.        
	But the spokesman also indicated that his government did not want to see the dispute overwhelm cooperation with the Obama administration, which has sought Beijings backing on economic policy and diplomatic standoffs, such as Iran and North Korea.        
	Ma said each side should appropriately handle rifts and sensitive issues, protecting the healthy and stable development of China-US relations.        
	Yesterday, Chinese vice-foreign minister He Yafei played down the dispute with Google and indicated that his government was more worried about broader economic and political disputes that could flare up in coming months. Clintons speech criticised the cyber policies of China and Iran, among others.

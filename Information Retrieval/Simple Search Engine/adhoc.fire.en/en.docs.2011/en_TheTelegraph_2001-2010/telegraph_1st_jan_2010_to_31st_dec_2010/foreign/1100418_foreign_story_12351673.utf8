	Warsaw, April 17 (Reuters): Poland paid an emotional tribute today to President Lech Kaczynski, his wife Maria and 94 other mostly senior political and military officials killed in a plane crash a week ago in Russia.        
	Up to 100,000 mourners, many clutching red-and-white national flags threaded with black ribbons, packed into the vast Pilsudski Square in central Warsaw to commemorate the victims of the countrys most devastating accident since World War II.        
	They all had their dreams and hopes for the future of their homeland. This is a serious test for us to understand those hopes well and take them into the future, Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who had been a political rival of Kaczynskis, told the crowd.        
	This is the most we can do for them. We are here to remember them. Poland is here to remember them. We will not forget, Tusk said. Behind him on the podium a tall, white cross rose up between two large black panels bearing the portraits of all the dead, whose names an actor read out one by one.        
	Kaczynskis twin brother Jaroslaw, a former Prime Minister who now heads Polands main Opposition party, sat at the front of the mourners with other family members.

                              Fighting obesity                            
	New York, March 17 (AP): PepsiCo plans to remove sugary drinks from schools worldwide, following the success of programmes in the US aimed at cutting down on childhood obesity.        
	The company said yesterday it will remove full-calorie, sweetened drinks from schools in more than 200 countries by 2012, marking the first such move by a major soft drink producer.        
	Both PepsiCo Inc., the worlds second-biggest soft drink maker, and number one player Coca-Cola Co. adopted guidelines to stop selling sugary drinks in US schools in 2006.        
	The World Heart Federation has been negotiating with soft drink makers to have them remove sugary beverages from schools for the past year as it looks to fight a rise in childhood obesity, which can lead to diabetes, heart problems and other ailments.        
	PepsiCos move is what the group had been seeking because it affects students till age 18, said Pekka Puska, president of the group.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BlackBerry faces Gulf shut threat
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      BlackBerry faces Gulf shut threat
                            
	Aug. 1 (Reuters): Over a million BlackBerry users face being cut off from key services in Saudi Arabia and the UAE after authorities stepped up demands on maker Research In Motion (RIM) for access to encrypted messages sent on the smartphone.        
	BlackBerrys Messenger application has spread rapidly in the Gulf Arab region but because the data is encrypted and sent to offshore servers, it cannot be tracked locally. Attempts have been underway in India, too, to find a way out.        
	Certain BlackBerry services allow users to act without any legal accountability, causing judicial, social and national security concerns, the United Arab Emirates Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) said in a statement.        
	The UAE said it would suspend BlackBerry Messenger, email and web browser services from October 11 until a fix was found while industry sources said Saudi Arabia had ordered local telecom firms to freeze Messenger this month.         
	Sundays moves cap wrangling with regulators over the issue that began in 2007.        
	India raised similar security concerns last week and Bahrain in April warned against using BlackBerry Messenger to distribute local news. As far back as 2007, France cautioned officials about using the services.        
	Indian security officials are concerned that BlackBerrys encrypted data could be used to co-ordinate acts against the state.        
	 The UAE, home to Gulf financial hub Dubai, said it would halt BlackBerry services until an acceptable solution is developed and applied.        
	Users of the device said that could mean disruptions for companies and individuals who rely on the services, including almost 700,000 in Saudi Arabia and some 500,000 in the UAE.        
	Its a final decision but we are continuing discussions with them, Mohammed Al Ghanem, director general of the UAEs TRA told Reuters.        
	Censorship has got nothing to do with this, he said, calling it instead a suspension due to RIMs lack of compliance with UAE regulations.        
	Authorities noted there is no such problem with services on smartphones from Nokia or Apples iPhone. RIM officials were not immediately available for comment.        
	In Saudi Arabia, BlackBerry handsets have become the must-have gizmo for Saudi youths, enabling them to connect with members of the opposite sex in a deeply conservative society.        
	In the UAE, which is slowly emerging from an economic slowdown brought about by the global financial crisis and Dubais property crash, some worried the move was aimed at curbing free speech.         
	I think there will be such an uproar, it probably wont happen and a solution will be found, said Irfan Ellam, Al Mal Capital telecom analyst, referring to the mooted BlackBerry services ban. BlackBerry is seen as essential by many companies, so if you want to attract business to your country it doesnt make much sense to ban these BlackBerry services, said Ellam.

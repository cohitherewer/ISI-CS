                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lady Gaga starves to stay fit, says book
                              bizarre                            
	London, Sept. 4 (PTI): Pop star Lady Gagas penchant for the bizarre is not limited to clothes only.        
	The singer reportedly has an unhealthy eating pattern and starves herself to stay fit, says a new book.         
	Written by Gagas former tour manager David Ciemny, Poker Face: The Rise and Rise of Lady Gaga says the singer was hospitalised six times in 2009 because of her yo-yo dieting which caused her to get dangerously ill.        
	The 24-year-old star, who burst on the pop scene with her album The Fame in 2008, goes to dangerous lengths to fit into her bizarre costumes, reports the Daily Mail.        
	When I say she was sick, I mean physically and mentally, says Ciemny. According to the writer, Gaga would go on junk food binges while on tour and would gorge on sweets.

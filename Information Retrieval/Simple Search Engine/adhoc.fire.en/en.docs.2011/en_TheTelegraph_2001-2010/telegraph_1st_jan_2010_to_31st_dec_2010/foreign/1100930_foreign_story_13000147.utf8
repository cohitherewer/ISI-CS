The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US, China army talks
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US, China army talks
                            
	Washington, Sept. 29 (Reuters): China and the US are resuming high-level military dialogue, with talks scheduled in Hawaii in mid-October and more in Washington later this year, the Pentagon said today.        
	The announcement signaled an end to Chinas freeze on military contacts with the US, imposed after the Obama administration notified Congress in January of a potential $6.4 billion arms package for Taiwan, which Beijing considers a rogue province.        
	US and Chinese officials would meet for talks as part of a maritime agreement in Hawaii on October 14-15. They would then hold high-level defence consultative talks in Washington later in the year, a Pentagon spokesperson said.        
	Lower-level contacts between the US and Chinese militaries would resume as well.        
	Asked whether this represented the end of the freeze, Colonel Dave Lapan said: Id say yes.        
	Weve agreed to resume these types of engagements, he said.        
	The decision to resume talks followed a trip by Michael Schiffer, US deputy assistant secretary of defence for east Asia, to Beijing this week.        
	The intent was to have a conversation about how to reinvigorate and put onto a normal track our military-to-military exchanges, Lapan said.        
	Chinese state media quoted a senior defence official today saying China and the US would have military dialogue and exchanges at an unspecified time in the future.        
	Ties between Washington and Beijing have been tested this year over US arms sales to Taiwan, Internet policy, Tibet, Chinas currency and Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea.        
	The US trade deficit with China, worth $226.9 billion in 2009, has fuelled trade disputes.        
	US-South Korean military drills have also sparked an outcry in China, despite official US assurances they are aimed at North Korea, not Beijing. The exercises followed the sinking of a South Korean warship and have been billed as a deterrent to the North.

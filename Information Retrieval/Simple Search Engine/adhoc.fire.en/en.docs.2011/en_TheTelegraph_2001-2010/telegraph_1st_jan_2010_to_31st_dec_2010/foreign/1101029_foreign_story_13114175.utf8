The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bonds car sells for 2.9 million
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bonds car sells for 2.9 million
                            
	London, Oct. 28 (Reuters): An American businessman bought James Bonds 1964 Aston Martin DB5 for 2.9 million at a London auction yesterday.        
	The car driven by Sean Connery in his portrayal of the suave but lethal British secret agent in Goldfinger and Thunderball sold for less than its 3.5-million pre-sale estimate to businessman Harry Yeaggy, auctioneers RM Auctions said.        
	This is a car that Ive always wanted, after all it is the most famous car in the world, Yeaggy said in the statement. My plan is to display it in my private car museum in Ohio just as it is. Yeaggy is only the second ex-factory owner of the distinctive silver-coloured car. Seller Jerry Lee purchased the car direct from the Aston Martin Lagonda factory for $12,000 in 1969.

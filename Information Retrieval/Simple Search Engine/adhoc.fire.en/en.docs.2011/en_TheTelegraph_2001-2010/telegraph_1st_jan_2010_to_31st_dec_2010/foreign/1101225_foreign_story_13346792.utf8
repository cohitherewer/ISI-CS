                              Claes Borgstrom                            
	Stockholm, Dec. 24 (AP): The two Swedish women accusing Julian Assange of sex crimes are not pawns of the CIA nor do they hunger for revenge or money  they just seek justice for a violation of their sexual integrity, their lawyer said.        
	Claes Borgstrom, a self-professed feminist who used to be Swedens ombudsman for gender equality, told The Associated Press he finds it very upsetting that Assange, his lawyers and some supporters are suggesting the case is a smear campaign against WikiLeaks, the secret-spilling website Assange founded.        
	Hes been spreading false rumours that he knows are untrue. Its reckless against these two women, Borgstrom said by phone yesterday.         
	They, too, are supporters of WikiLeaks. They support its work.        
	Assange denies the allegations of sexual misconduct, which his lawyers say stem from a dispute over consensual but unprotected sex. He has not been charged.        
	The lawyer said Assange had every right to reject the womens sex claims but says Assange is, in essence, accusing them of breaking the law by suggesting they are driven by ulterior motives.        
	There is no truth to this whatsoever, he added.

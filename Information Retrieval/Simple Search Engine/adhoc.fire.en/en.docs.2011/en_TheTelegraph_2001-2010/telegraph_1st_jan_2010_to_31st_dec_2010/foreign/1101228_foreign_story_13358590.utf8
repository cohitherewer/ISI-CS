          MURRAY WARDROP                          Tim Burton with Helena Bonham Carter                                  
	Dec. 27: With their own separate houses next door to each other, the living arrangements of Helena Bonham Carter and her partner Tim Burton have often raised eyebrows.         
	But the actress has finally revealed the reason for their twin properties  she cannot stand Burtons snoring at night.         
	Rather than undergo an operation to his nose which might cure the condition, the pair instead opted for two homes side by side in Belsize Park, north London, to ensure no sleepless nights.         
	Bonham Carter has insisted there is nothing unusual about the arrangement and that her relationship with the award-winning director is enhanced by having their own personal space.         
	The 44-year-old divides her time between the two properties which she shares with Burton, 52, their two children Billy Ray and Nell and a nanny. In an interview with Radio Times, the Alice In Wonderland star said: A lot written about me is wrong.         
	They say Tim and I are a mad couple with subterranean tunnels between our adjoining houses, and that our children live down the road with another couple.         
	We just have two houses knocked together because mine was too small. We see as much of each other as any couple, but our relationship is enhanced by knowing we have our personal space to retreat to. Its not enforced intimacy. Its chosen, which is quite flattering  if you can afford it.         
	She added: Tim does snore, and thats an element. Weve tried lots of remedies that dont work.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Millions for A Day    
	 June 19: John Lennons handwritten lyrics to A Day in the Life, have sold for $1.2 million at an auction, double their pre-sale high estimate, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Lennons handwritten lyrics to the song, the final number on the Beatles album, Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, had been expected to fetch between $500,000 to $700,000 at the Sothebys New York auction.      
	The most amount ever paid for Beatles lyrics at auction was $1.25 million in 2005 for All You Need Is Love. However, A Day In the Life has set a record in sterling because of the fluctuating exchange rate (All You Need Is Love sold for 690,000).

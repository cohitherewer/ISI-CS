The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Forbidden Apple left behind in bar

	New York, April 20: For anyone who has ever lost a mobile phone, remember this: it could be worse.         
	You could be the person who left his phone in a bar in California. And it wasnt just any phone; it was a supersecret version of the next iPhone. That model is not expected to be formally unveiled for a couple of months.        
	For the people at Apple, it must be like a bad version of the guy walks into a bar joke.        
	The company is known as the most secretive in Silicon Valley, and leaks are rare. But after the phone prototype was left in a bar in the Silicon Valley town of Redwood City, photos of the device began appearing over the weekend in technology blogs, sparking a frenzy of hype among the Apple-obsessed.        
	Before long, pictures of the product appeared on Gizmodo, a technology news site, whose editors ripped it apart  as if it were an alien from another planet  to dissect its features. The website said late yesterday that the phone belonged to an Apple engineer.        
	The phones authenticity was hotly debated, but most bloggers concluded it was real. And a person with knowledge of Apples hardware plans who was not authorised to speak on behalf of the company confirmed to The New York Times that it was real.        
	Apple declined to comment.It is very stunning, said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, who has been following Apple for nearly three decades. Apple has such tight control on new products, and they are kept under wraps diligently and religiously until the day of their release. If it is true, it is really a first.         
	Some wondered whether the phone was planted by Apples formidable publicity machine.         
	For the sake of the person who dropped it, I hope this is a devious marketing scheme, said Paul Saffo, a veteran Silicon Valley forecaster. But I think it is unlikely. There is no one else on the planet whose shoes I would less like to be in it at the moment.         
	In a blog post yesterday detailing how it obtained the phone, Gizmodo said it was left by an iPhone software engineer at Gourmet Haus Staudt, a German specialty store and beer garden in Redwood City.The person who found the phone peddled it to Gizmodo, which bought it for $5,000, Nick Denton, chief executive of Gawker Media, which owns Gizmodo, said by instant message.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

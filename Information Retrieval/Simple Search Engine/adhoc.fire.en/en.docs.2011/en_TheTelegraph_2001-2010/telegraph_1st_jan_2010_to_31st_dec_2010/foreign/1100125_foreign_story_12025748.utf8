	Shosharak, (Afghanistan), Jan. 24: If luck is the battlefields final arbiter  the wild card that can trump fitness, training, teamwork, equipment, character and skill  Lance Corporal Ryan T. Mathison experienced its purest and most welcome form.         
	On a Marine foot patrol here through the predawn chill of Friday morning, he stepped on a pressure-plate rigged to roughly 11kg of explosives. The device, enough to destroy a pickup truck or tear apart several men, was buried beneath him in the dusty soil.         
	It did not explode.         
	Mathisons weight triggered the detonation of one of the booby traps two blasting caps. But upon giving an audible pop and tossing small stones into the air, the device failed to ignite its fuller charge  a powerful mix of mortar rounds and homemade explosives spiked with motorcycle parts, rusty spark plugs and jagged chunks of steel.         
	Mathison and several Marines near him were spared. So began a brief journey through the Talibans shifting tactics and the vagaries of war, where an experience at the edge of death became instead an affirmation of friendship, and in which a veteran Marine reluctantly assumed for a morning one of the infantrys most coveted roles: that of the charmed man.        
	Goddamn Matty, man, said Corporal Joshua D. Villegas, the patrols radio operator, allowing his eyes to roam over the intact Marine after the patrol had backed away from the dud. Lucky son of a bitch.        
	Homemade bombs, which the military calls improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, become the insurgents killing tool of choice in the Afghan war, a complement to the Talibans assault rifles, machine guns, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades. They serve as a battlefield leveller for elusive fighters who are wary of meeting western forces head-on.        
	No matter their determination or rising level of experience, those who manufacture or place the bombs still make mistakes, as evidenced by events on Friday morning.        
	Mathison and his group were headed to knoll to settle into an observation post beside a cemetery and watch over a road dubbed Blue Moon. The cemetery overlooks part of the small village of Shosharak, including a house from which the Taliban have often fired on Marine patrols.        
	The Marines radioed for a team that specialises in dismantling explosives and backed off the knoll.        
	By the time the disposal team arrived, sweeping down Blue Moon with metal detectors, most of the Marines understood how lucky they had been. We were what? Ten meters from it? said Joseph R. Korte, 20, the patrols trauma medic.        
	Five, said Lance Corporal Hickson, 21.         
	Medic Korte looked over at Mathison, who was crouched against a wall. That would have killed you and Q, he said, using Lance Corporal Quirumbays nickname.         
	Mathison is a big Marine, thick at the neck and light on his feet, and a veteran of a tour in Iraqs Anbar province. He seemed to be suspending belief. He listened to his friends in silence.         
	Im still calling it nothing, he said at last. Im going with that it was nothing.        
	He finished his thought. Makes me feel better, he said.        
	The rest of the patrol would not have it. Well, Matty, said Hickson, his voice rising. You might want to stop drinking, stop cussing.         
	Lance Corporal Jacob M. Ohl, 19, interrupted. Hickson was reading the Bible last night, he said. Been to church three times in his life, and last night he was reading the Bible.        
	No one seemed sure what to think. They passed cigarettes, except for Mathison: he pulled a lollipop from a plastic bag and popped it into his mouth.        
	He watched the two Marines in the disposal team working on the hill. Mathison had not wanted to accept that it was a bomb. He was beginning to shift his point of view.         
	If this really was an IED, then you aint drinking with me, he said. Because Im done drinking. Im going back to the way I was before I joined the Corps.        
	Villegas, the radio operator, jogged over. Matty, I love you, he said as he ducked along the wall.         
	The arrival of the radio operator meant the Marines now had an infantrymans oxygen: information. They could overhear radio traffic between the patrol leader and the disposal team.        
	Word began to reach them. The pressure plate had been connected to two 82-mm mortar rounds and a directional fragmentation charge weighing roughly 9kg. The meaning of that sunk in. If it had exploded, it would have killed more than the two nearest Marines.        
	Oh God, dude, one of the Marines said. Another strung together a profane phrase. The first word was dodged. The last was death.        
	Oh Matty, get over here, said Hickson. The two men hugged. They slapped each others backs. They let go.         
	Mathison was convinced. It really had been a bomb. Were all lucky, man, he said. That would have hurt us all.        
	A few minutes later, Staff Sergeant Christopher J. Dreher, from the disposal team, called for the man who had stepped on the pressure plate. The staff sergeant had collected evidence from the bomb and rigged a small charge of plastic explosive to destroy what remained. He asked Mathison to ignite the blast.        
	If that IED had worked like it was supposed to? the staff sergeant said. Bye-bye, sweetheart.         
	Fire in the hole! he shouted three times. Then the blast shook the earth. Dirt, stone and bits of metal showered the ground for several seconds  the end of a weapon that had nearly decimated a small patrol.

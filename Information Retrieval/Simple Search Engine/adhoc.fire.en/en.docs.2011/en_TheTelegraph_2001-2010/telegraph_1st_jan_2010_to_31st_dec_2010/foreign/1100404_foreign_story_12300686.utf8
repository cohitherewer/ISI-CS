The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | iPad inspires passive consumption, discourages innovation
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      iPad inspires passive consumption, discourages innovation
          JOSHUA BRUSTEIN                          No tinkering please                                  
	New York, April 3: On a day in which the majority of tech news consists of breathless examination of the first round of iPad Apps, Cory Doctorow writes on the blog Boing Boing that the iPad will discourage innovation.        
	I believe  really believe  in the stirring words of the Maker Manifesto: if you cant open it, you dont own it. Screws not glue, he wrote in a blog post.         
	Instead of encouraging a new generation of innovators by allowing people to lift its hood and tinker, Doctorow writes, Apple encourages passive consumption  if you want to customise your devices, you buy something from Apples menu of apps.        
	Apples tight control over software development for its products has been an issue in the past. Many developers have long complained about the strict, sometimes arbitrary-seeming standards it keeps over what Apps it offers through its App store.         
	The fact that iPhones and the iPad arent compatible with Flash  meaning that an enormous amount of content doesnt work on the devices  has bothered others. And Apples decision to restrict some sexually-themed apps brought a recent spate of attention to the power Apple holds over developers.        
	Early last month the Electronic Frontier Foundation published a copy of the licensing agreement that developers have to sign to sell their apps through the App Store. Among the requirements: developers who used the companys software development kit could not sell their work through other platforms, even if Apple rejected it, and a prohibition against discussing the agreement itself. Its frustrating to see Apple, the original pioneer in generative computing, putting shackles on the market it (for now) leads, Fred von Lohmann, a staff attorney with the group, wrote in a blog post at the time.

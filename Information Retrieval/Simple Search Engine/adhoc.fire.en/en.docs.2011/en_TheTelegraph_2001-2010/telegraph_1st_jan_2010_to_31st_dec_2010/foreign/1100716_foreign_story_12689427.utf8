The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Apple calls urgent meet
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Apple calls urgent meet
  - Key topic of discussion will be iPhone 4: Tech giant        CLAUDINE BEAUMONT                          Recall unlikely                                        
	July 15: Apple has announced that it will be holding a news conference at its Cupertino headquarters tomorrow to discuss the iPhone 4        
	The company started contacting US-based technology journalists yesterday, inviting them to the hastily convened news conference.        
	Apple has given no further clues about the nature of the event, but has confirmed that the key topic for discussion will be iPhone 4.        
	 The company has faced a barrage of criticism in recent weeks for the way in which it has handled a series of problems with its flagship device. Many users have reported a loss of reception whenever the hold the phone in their left hand, covering one of the antenna built in to the stainless steel band that runs around the middle of the device.        
	Apple said that such problems were common to all mobile phones, while Steve Jobs, Apples chief executive, responded to one angry customers email by telling him to simply stop holding his iPhone like that.        
	Apple has already said that it will be issuing a software fix to correct a long-standing problem with the way in which iPhones display bars of reception, but this patch will not address the hardware issue.        
	Earlier this week, a leading analyst warned that a recall of iPhone 4s would cost Apple around $1.5 billion. Apple sold more than 1.7 million iPhone 4s in its first three days on sale.        
	Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with Bernstein Research, said such a recall was highly unlikely, and that Apple would be more likely to give away cases to customers affected by the issue.        
	Consumer Reports, a US consumer watchdog, also issued a damning review of the iPhone 4, highlighting the signal problems, and concluding that it could not recommend the device as a result. It also urged Apple to fix the issue quickly, at no additional cost to customers.        
	The emergency news conference is almost unheard of for Apple, which prides itself on the carefully-timed release of information, and has dealt with other problems in the past simply by issuing an open letter from Jobs.        
	However, the company has come in for strong criticism for the way it has handled these signal problems, with many branding its attitude towards loyal customers as arrogant.        
	I think the fact theyve called this news conference at such short notice is indicative of the seriousness of the situation, and the way in which its snowballed, said Geoff Blaber, an analyst with CCS Insight.

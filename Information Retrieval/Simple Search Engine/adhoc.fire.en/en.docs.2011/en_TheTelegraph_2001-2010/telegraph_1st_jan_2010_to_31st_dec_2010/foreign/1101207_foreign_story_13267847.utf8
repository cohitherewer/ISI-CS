	Kylie acting    
	 London, Dec. 6 (PTI): Pop star Kylie Minogue seems to have been bitten by the acting bug as she switches gears to concentrate more on acting.       
	Minogue shot to fame in the long-running soap opera Neighbours and is currently chalking out plans to return to acting after filming a big-screen cameo as a tattooed rockstar in Jack and Diane.      
	Ive already filmed (Jack and Diane), its a really independent film shot in New York. I just flew in for my one day of filming, spent half of it getting covered in fake tattoos, said Minogue, 42. I just love being on set, I love filming, she added.

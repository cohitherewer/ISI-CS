The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cloud over Blair honour
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Cloud over Blair honour
                            
	London, Sept. 5 (PTI): Queen Elizabeth may withhold plans to honour Tony Blair after being disappointed over revelations in the former Prime Ministers memoirs.         
	Blair was in line to be appointed to the Order of the Thistle, the highest Scottish honour.         
	The Sunday Express quoted insiders as saying the Queen was irked by Blairs alleged breach of royal protocol with his revelations of personal conversations in Buckingham Palace.        
	It was felt the parts that opened old wounds, including Princess Dianas death, were beyond the pale.        
	A commentator said: It is a well-known convention that details of private conversations between the royal family and the Prime Minister stay private.

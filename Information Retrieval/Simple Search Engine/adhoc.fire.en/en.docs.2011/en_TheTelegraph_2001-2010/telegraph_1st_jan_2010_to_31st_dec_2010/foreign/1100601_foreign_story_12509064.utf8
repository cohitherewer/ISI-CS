	Chicago, May 31 (AP): Good friends, good food and the comforts of his own home.        
	President Obama enjoyed all three when he brought his family home to Chicago for a long Memorial Day holiday weekend. It was the First Familys first sleepover at their red-brick home in more than a year.        
	Obama began his Sunday with his customary workout at a private gym. The President was supposed to be back at the White House on Monday.        
	Before taking office in January 2009, Obama expressed a desire to visit his $1.6 million home in the citys Hyde Park neighbourhood about every six weeks. Our friends are here. Our family is here. We are going to try to come back here as often as possible ... at least once every six weeks or couple of months, he told the Chicago Tribune back then.        
	But the demands of the presidency have thwarted his intentions, including the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, a year-long debate over health care  and his daughters busy schedules of weekend soccer and basketball games, birthday parties and sleepovers.        
	First lady Michelle Obama, daughters Malia and Sasha, Obamas mother-in-law Marian Robinson and family dog Bo arrived in Chicago on Thursday night. On Friday, Obama interrupted his getaway to visit the Louisiana coast for an update on efforts to stop the flow of oil into the Gulf. He also sought to assure coastal residents, and others unhappy with the federal governments response to the nations largest oil spill, that he is in command.        
	Back in Chicago on Saturday, Obama indulged in one of his favourite sports  a game of basketball  at the University of Chicago Lab School where his daughters were enrolled when the family lived in Chicago. Some reporters also briefly saw Michelle Obama in the backyard of their home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Facebook puts users in groups

          MIGUEL HELFT                          Zuckerberg in Palo Alto. (AP)                                  
	Palo Alto (California), Oct. 7: Facebook is trying to become a bit more like the real world.        
	The company yesterday introduced a feature that allows users to interact with small groups of people, like their family, high school friends or colleagues.        
	The move is an effort to address a longstanding problem: Facebook friends often span a broad range of relationships that include relatives, classmates, casual professional acquaintances or jogging partners  and not everyone wants all of them to see his or her information.        
	With the new feature, called Groups, Facebook hopes to encourage users to upload more photos, videos and other information to the site while giving them new ways to control who sees what.        
	Some privacy advocates welcomed Groups, but others worried that it would give Facebook even more information about users, which it could provide to marketers and others.        
	In an interview, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, said the feature, which has been in development for months, was not created in reaction to the recent series of privacy mishaps that have forced the company to roll back new features and apologise to users.        
	We think about this stuff a lot, Zuckerberg said, referring to privacy. Often people dont think we think about it as much as we do.        
	He said Groups was simple in concept but technically difficult. At a news conference at Facebook headquarters here, he noted that Groups was not the companys first effort to let users share more selectively.        
	Facebook has long allowed users to create lists of friends, but that feature has largely failed.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

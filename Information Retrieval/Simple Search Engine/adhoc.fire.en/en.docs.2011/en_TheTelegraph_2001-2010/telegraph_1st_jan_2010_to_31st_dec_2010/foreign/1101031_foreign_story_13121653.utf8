	Paris, Oct. 30: Oxford Universitys international fundraising programme announced yesterday that it had reached a significant milestone: 1 billion, becoming the largest university fundraising campaign in Europe.        
	The universitys ultimate goal is 1.25 billion, a target announced in August 2004 when fundraising began and after receiving 230 million in donations last year.        
	This fundraising plan, similar to what some American universities have done for years, is relatively new in the European higher education sector and it comes at a time of reduced government funding and overall economic downturn.        
	In a statement released by the university, Oxfords vice-chancellor, Prof. Andrew Hamilton, described the donations as fundamental to Oxfords future.        
	Prof. Hamilton, who recently finished a 12 years working at Yale University, a school more accustomed to private funding, said he believed philanthropy would become increasingly important for British universities as the changes outlined in a recent report on education financing, written by John Browne, begin to take effect.         
	Oxford also announced that Vivien Duffield, the chairman of the fundraising campaign  called Oxford Thinking  has decided to step down.

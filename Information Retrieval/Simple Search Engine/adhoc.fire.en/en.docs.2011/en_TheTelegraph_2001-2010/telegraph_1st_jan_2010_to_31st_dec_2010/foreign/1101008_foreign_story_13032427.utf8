	London, Oct. 7 (Reuters): A lost flute concerto by 18th century composer and virtuoso violinist Antonio Vivaldi has been discovered by an academic among a set of dusty papers housed in Scotlands National in Edinburgh.        
	The extraordinary find, a 300-year-old copy of the Italian Baroque composers original manuscript, comprises the parts for Il Gran Mogol, one of a quartet of national concertos. The others, entitled La Francia, La Spagna and LInghilterro remain lost. The musical score was found and authenticated by Southampton University researcher.

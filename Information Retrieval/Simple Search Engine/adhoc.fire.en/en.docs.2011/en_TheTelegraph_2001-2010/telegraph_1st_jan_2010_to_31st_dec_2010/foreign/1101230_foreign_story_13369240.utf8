	Quirky Depp    
	 London, Dec. 29 (PTI): Actor Johnny Depp is famous for his love of quirky roles and with The Tourist doing badly at the box office, the Hollywood star admits that he is better off playing eccentric characters.      
	Depp has popularised offbeat characters like Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland and Edward Scissorhands in his movies.      
	Depp, 47, says he loves hiding behind wigs and make-up in his films, reports the Daily Express. Captain Jack is always going to be a part of me, he said, adding that he is not in the mood to hang up his bandana and eyeliner just yet.      
	I like going back to him and seeing what we can cook up. Its tougher to play someone like my character in The Tourist.     
	Reese ties    
	 Dec. 29: Reese Witherspoon is engaged to Hollywood agent Jim Toth, reports The Daily Telegraph. A representative for the actress confirmed that the couple will wed and that they are extremely happy. The 34-year-old actress was previously married to actor Ryan Phillippe. She has two children with him and they divorced in 2008. Witherspoon won an Oscar for her performance in Walk the Line. She stars in the recently released comedy How Do You Know. Toth is an agent for Creative Artists Agency. Witherspoon is a CAA client but is represented by another agent. The couple started dating in January, shortly after Witherspoon ended her three-year relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal.

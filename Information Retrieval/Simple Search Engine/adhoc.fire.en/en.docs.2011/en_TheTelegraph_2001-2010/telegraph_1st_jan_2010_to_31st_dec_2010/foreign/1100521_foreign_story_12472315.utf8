	Paris, May 20 (Reuters): Art thieves stole paintings by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani and two other well-known artists from a Paris museum in a heist worth 100 million euros ($124.2 million).        
	Officials from the Musee dArt Moderne de la ville de Paris said they discovered the five paintings, which included works by Fernand Leger and Georges Braque, were missing after noticing a smashed window pane as they opened for business today.        
	This is a serious crime to the heritage of humanity, said Christophe Girard, culture deputy for the mayor of Paris. Girard said the theft was committed by one or more individuals who were obviously organised.        
	Museum officials said the paintings were worth about 100 million euros in total, revising an earlier figure of 500 million euros released by the police and public prosecutors.        
	The theft is the latest in Paris after robbers stole 32 drawings at the Picasso Museum worth 8 million euros last June and raises questions as to what could be done with the works.        
	Robert Read, head of art and private clients at specialist insurer Hiscox in London said private buyers were unlikely to have ordered the robbery as art was acquired to be exhibited.        
	Its more likely to be criminals trying to exhort money out of the museum, state or who trade it in the underworld for drugs or weapons, he said.        
	The stolen works were Picassos Dove with Green Peas, Matisses Pastorale, Braques Olive tree near Estaque, Modiglianis Woman on the range and Legers Still life with candlesticks. Picassos Dove  a painting dating from the Spanish masters Cubist period  itself is worth 22 million euros.         
	Museum employees found a window had been broken at the rear of the east wing of the Palais de Tokyo built during the Universal Exhibition of 1937.        
	The museum has sophisticated alarm systems, close circuit television and three guards were on hand last night.         
	Local television said the alarm system had not been triggered.        
	We must let the police find out how the security system was evaded especially as these three watchmen saw nothing and did not react, Girard said.

	London, Jan. 1: Van Morrison says claims he has become a father again are a completely and utterly unfounded Internet hoax.        
	In a statement, the 64-year-old said he had been the victim of hackers after a message appeared on his website earlier this week announcing the birth of a new son, George Ivan Morrison III.        
	The widely-reported post, which has since been removed from the site, claimed producer Gigi Lee had given birth to the boy  the spitting image of his daddy.        
	 But the Moondance and Brown Eyed Girl singer insisted he was still happily married to Michelle Morrison  the mother of two of his children.        
	Claims were made relating to my personal life in a statement purporting to come from me, Morrison said.        
	The comments which appeared on my website did not come from me. They are completely and utterly without foundation.        
	For the avoidance of all doubt and in the interests of clarity, I am very happily married to Michelle Morrison with whom I have two wonderful children.        
	The notoriously private star said Tuesdays web post was the second time his website had been hacked into during the last three months.        
	I have asked my management team to carry out an immediate investigation, he added.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

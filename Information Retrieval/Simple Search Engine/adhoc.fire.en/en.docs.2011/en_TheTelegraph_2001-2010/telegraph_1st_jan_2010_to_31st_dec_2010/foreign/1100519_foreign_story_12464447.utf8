	Bangkok, May 18 (Reuters): The Thai government dismissed proposed peace talks today to end a nine-week crisis that has killed 67 people and threatened to tear the country apart, calling on thousands of anti-government protesters to disperse.        
	As the prospects for official talks unravelled, fighting erupted again in the Din Daeng district north of a Bangkok shopping area occupied by about 5,000 protesters whose leaders say they are willing to fight to the death to topple Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.        
	Id rather stay here, be proud and die fighting than die in my village when Im old, said Chamlat Ladlao, a protester from central Lopburi province speaking in the barricaded protest site.        
	They said they were willing to enter ceasefire talks brokered by senators after five days of chaotic street fighting that has killed 39 people, nearly all civilians, and wounded nearly 300.        
	But the government said it would only join the talks if the protests end, a condition the red-shirted demonstrators have consistently rejected, leaving talks once again at a dead end with thousands of troops tightening a cordon around them.        
	Tourists and foreign investors are leaving in droves, squeezing the life out of one of Asias most dynamic cities and southeast Asias second-biggest economy.        
	Thats taking a deepening toll on an economy projected to grow as much as five percent this year, finance minister Korn Chatikavanij told Reuters. We have to admit that the long-running protest has been affecting the capability and opportunities for businesses, including those not in the protest area, he said.        
	The disruption has already spread to shippers and truckers, according to the Federation of Thai Industries, delaying exports of around 3,000 tonnes of Thai white sugar among other shipments, according to traders.        
	In Din Daeng, troops fired warning shots as protesters burned kerosene-soaked tyres and hurled petrol bombs. At least two protesters were shot, a Reuters witness said. By evening, a Siam City Bank branch was on fire and loud blasts could be heard.        
	The fighting today was the lightest since violence erupted last Thursday with the shooting of a general allied with the red-shirted protesters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Korea reinforces military role
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Korea reinforces military role
          MARK MCDONALD                          Kim Jong-un                                  
	Seoul, Sept. 28: A series of military promotions reinforced the leading role of the armed forces in North Korean political life, as the youngest son and sister of Kim Jong-il, were made four-star generals before a landmark meeting of the Korean Workers Party today.        
	Kim Jong-il was renominated as the head of the party  to a thunderous standing ovation in the Mamsudae Assembly Hall in Pyongyang, according to North Korean state television.        
	But it was the elevation of his son, Kim Jong-un, that created the real interest and excitement among diplomats and political analysts. His promotion was the first clear and public signal that he has a serious political future in North Korea, and is perhaps on track to succeed his father as leader.        
	This promotion of Kim Jong-un to four-star general carries a lot of weight in North Korea, and it has the connotation of very senior top brass, said Lee Sung-yoon, a North Korea expert at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. This is a very big deal.        
	Kim Kyong-hui, the leaders sister, who is said to be a formidable political force in her own right, also was promoted, a move that Lee said was a bit rare for a woman.        
	Kim Kyong-hui is the wife of Jang Seong-taek, often regarded by outside analysts as the No. 2 man in the North. Together they could serve as protectors and mentors for the younger Kim, who is just 27 or 28, as he learns the levers of power in the secretive communist state.        
	Kims learning curve could be a short one, as his fathers health has been in question since he suffered a stroke in 2008.        
	Kim Jong-il, 68, has had to fast-track the promotion of his son as heir apparent, many analysts say, a situation very different from his own two-decade tutelage under his father, Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994. The last Workers Party gathering of this size and scope was held in 1980, when Kim Jong-il was designated as the clear successor to his father.        
	This is a step towards turning Kim Jong-un into a songun leader, a symbolic gesture of upholding him as a military leader, said Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute near Seoul.

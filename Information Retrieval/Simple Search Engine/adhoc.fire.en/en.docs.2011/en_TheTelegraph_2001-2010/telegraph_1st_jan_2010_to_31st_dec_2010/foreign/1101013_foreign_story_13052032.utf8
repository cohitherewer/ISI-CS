The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Too much screen time bad for kids 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Too much screen time bad for kids 
                            
	New York, Oct. 12 (Reuters): More than two hours a day spent watching television or playing computer games could put a child at greater risk for psychological problems regardless of their activity levels, according to a British study.        
	Researchers from the University of Bristol studied more than 1,000 children aged 10 and 11.        
	Over seven days, the children filled out a questionnaire reporting how much time they spent daily in front of a television or computer and answering questions describing their mental state  including emotional, behavioural, and peer-related problems. Meanwhile, an accelerometer measured their physical activity.        
	The odds of significant psychological difficulties were about 60 per cent higher for children spending longer than two hours a day in front of either screen compared with those exposed to less screen time, the researchers report in the journal Pediatrics.        
	For children with more than two hours of both types of screen time during the day, the odds more than doubled.

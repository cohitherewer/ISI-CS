	Freddie film    
	 Los Angeles, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Ready, Freddie, Go.      
	Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen is set to play flamboyant rocker Freddie Mercury in a dramatic feature focusing on his glory days as the frontman of Queen, its producers said yesterday.      
	The untitled film is being written by Peter Morgan, the British scribe behind The Queen and The Last King of Scotland. No director is attached yet. Shooting will begin next year, said producer Graham King, whose GK Films is partnering on the project with Robert De Niros Tribeca Productions.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jane Fonda suffers breast cancer scare
                              Relieved                            
	Nov. 13: Actress Jane Fonda has said she was diagnosed with breast cancer.        
	Fonda, who is also a fitness guru, said she had a routine mammogram check-up a few weeks ago when the doctor discovered a small cancerous tumour.        
	She subsequently had the tumour removed earlier this week and is now considered 100 per cent cancer free, according to her publicist, adding: Shes completely fine and its business as usual for her. Writing on her Internet blog, Fonda said: I had a scare with a non-invasive breast cancer but it is ALL OUT NOW!!!        
	She added: I am so lucky. We got it early and it was, as I said, non-invasive. I want to thank my friends and fans who have written beautiful letters. It has meant a lot to me.        
	Non-invasive breast cancer, where the cancerous cells have not spread, accounts for about one in five of new breast cancer cases. Fonda, an Oscar-winning actress, is continuing to promote her latest fitness video, which is due for release in the US. Experts say breast cancer in many cases is preventable. Many lifestyle parameters can be modified to lower the risk of developing the disease.

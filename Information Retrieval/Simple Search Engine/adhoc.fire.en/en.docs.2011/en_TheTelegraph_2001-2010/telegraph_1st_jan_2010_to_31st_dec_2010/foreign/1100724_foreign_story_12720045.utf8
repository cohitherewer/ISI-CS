	Kathmandu, July 23 (Reuters): Nepals parliament failed today for the second time this week to elect a new Prime Minister, extending a political vacuum that threatens a fragile peace process.        
	In a run-off poll, Maoist chief Prachanda and Ram Chandra Paudel of the Nepali Congress, won roughly the same votes as on Wednesday.

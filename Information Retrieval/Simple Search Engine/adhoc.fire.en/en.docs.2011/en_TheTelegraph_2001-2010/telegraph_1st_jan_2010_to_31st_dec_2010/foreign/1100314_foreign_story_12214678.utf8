The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | NY cabs cheated riders of millions
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      NY cabs cheated riders of millions
          MICHAEL BARBARO                          A taxi in New York. (AP)                                  
	New York, March 13: About 3,000 New York City taxi drivers routinely riders over two years by surreptitiously fixing their meters to charge rates that would normally apply only to trips outside the five boroughs, according to the citys Taxi and Limousine Commission.        
	The drivers scheme, the commission said, involved 1.8 million rides and cost passengers an average of $4 to $5 extra per trip. The drivers, officials said, flipped switches on their meters that kicked in the higher rates, costing New York city riders a total of $8.3 million.        
	The 1.8 million fares represent a tiny fraction of a total 360 million trips over the 26-month period in question.        
	Agency officials said, however, that they were alarmed enough that they immediately ordered the companies that manufacture the meters to create a system to alert riders when the higher rates are being charged. That is likely to be done through the digital screens facing the back seats of the cabs.         
	The commission said it began an inquiry after investigators, responding to a riders complaint, determined that a cab driver from Brooklyn, Wasim Khalid Cheema, had overcharged 574 passengers in just one month last year. Cheemas license has been revoked. He could not be reached for comment.        
	The commission then used GPS data, collected in every cab, to review millions of trips in New York city and found a huge number in which the out-of-city rates had improperly been charged, officials said.        
	The investigators determined that 36,000 drivers improperly activated the higher rate at least once, and that about 3,000 drivers did it more than 100 times.        
	The higher rate, reserved for rides in Nassau and Westchester counties, is 80 cents per one-fifth of a mile  twice the rate charged for rides in the five boroughs.         
	As described by officials, the fraud might rank as the biggest in the taxi industrys history.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Asterix swaps boar for burger, fries
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Asterix swaps boar for burger, fries
                              Gallic champion                            
	Paris, Aug. 18 (Reuters): A new McDonalds ad featuring Gallic champion Asterix enjoying a burger and fries has sparked outrage among French comic purists who see it as an insult to their national heritage.        
	The billboard shows the fearless Gaul and friends celebrating their traditional banquet at the fast-food chain  with Cacofonix the bard tied to a tree outside as usual. My childhood hero sacrificed like a wild boar! What next? Tintin eating at Subway? said one horrified blogger called sirchmallow.        
	How ironic, the indomitable Gauls making an advert for the invaders, was another outraged comment on Twitter.        
	The ad is of three designed by advertising agency Euro RSCG for McDonaldss Come as you are campaign.        
	The others feature Cinderella pulling into a McDrive on a pumpkin, and the Ghostface character from the film Scream tucking into a Big Mac.        
	McDonalds has frequently been the focus of anti-American sentiment in France and is seen by many to symbolise the threat to French culture and cuisine posed by globalisation and homogenised junk food.         
	In 1999, anti-globalisation protesters led by Jose Bove dismantled a McDonalds restaurant in southwest France, dumping the rubble outside the local town hall.        
	Asterix, meanwhile, whose plucky adventures fighting the Roman invaders first appeared in print in 1959, is often regarded as an emblem of Frances rebellious spirit.         
	Together with his jovial sidekick Obelix, he remains one of Frances best-loved comic characters and his books have sold some 325 million copies worldwide. This is not the first time, however, Asterix has succumbed to the forces of capitalism.         
	In 2001, McDonalds signed him up to replace Ronald McDonald in its marketing campaign to tie in with the release of the film Asterix and Cleopatra.

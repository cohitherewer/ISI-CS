	London, Nov. 23: The British government has bowed to industry pressure on the immigration cap by exempting the majority of migrant workers coming to the UK as part of the intra-company transfer (ICT) scheme.        
	Home secretary Theresa May today outlined plans to cap the number of non-EU skilled workers entering the UK by a fifth, from 28,000 a year down to 21,700.        
	However, the cap will not include some 22,500 workers transferred by international employers to the UK each year, under the ICT system  provided they meet new criteria. May said ICTs wishing to stay more than a year should earn a new, minimum salary of 40,000. The ICT visa route is used by Indian companies.

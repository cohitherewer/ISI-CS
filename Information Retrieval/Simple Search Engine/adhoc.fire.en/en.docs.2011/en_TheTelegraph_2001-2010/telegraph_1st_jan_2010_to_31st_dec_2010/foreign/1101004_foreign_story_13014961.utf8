The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Druids get tag of faith
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Druids get tag of faith
                            
	London, Oct. 3 (AP): Druids have been worshipping the sun and earth for thousands of years in Europe but now they can say theyre practising an officially recognised religion.        
	The ancient pagan tradition best known for gatherings at Stonehenge every summer solstice has been formally classed as a religion under charity law for the first time in Britain, the national charity regulator said yesterday. That means Druids can receive exemptions from taxes on donations  and now have the same status as such mainstream religions as the Church of England.        
	The move gives an old practice new validity, said Phil Ryder, the chairman of the 350-member Druid Network.        
	It will go a long way to make Druidry a lot more accessible, he said.        
	Druids have practised for thousands of years in Britain and in Celtic societies elsewhere in Europe. They worship natural forces such as thunder and the sun, and spirits they believe arise from places such as mountains and rivers. They do not worship a single god or creator, but seek to cultivate a sacred relationship with the natural world.        
	Although many see them as robed, mysterious people who gather every summer solstice at Stonehenge  which predates the Druids  believers say modern Druidry is chiefly concerned with helping practitioners connect with nature and themselves through rituals, dancing and singing at stone circles and other sites throughout the country believed to be sacred.        
	The Druid Network fought for nearly five years to be recognised under the semi-governmental Charity Commission, which requires proof of cohesive and serious belief in a supreme entity and a moral framework.        
	After initially rejecting the Druid Networks application, the Charity Commission decided this week that Druidry fits the bill.        
	There is sufficient belief in a supreme being or entity to constitute a religion for the purposes of charity law, the commission said.

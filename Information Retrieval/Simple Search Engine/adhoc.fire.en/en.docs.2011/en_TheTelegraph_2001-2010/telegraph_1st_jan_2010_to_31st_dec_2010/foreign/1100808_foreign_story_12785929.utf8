	Westlake (Ohio), Aug. 7: A wifes curiosity led to the discovery of her husband secret life and second wife on Facebook.        
	After a fairy tale 2005 wedding in Italy, John and Lynn France moved into their dream home in Westlake, where they added two sons to their family. But Lynn says, over time, John grew distant and disappeared for long periods of time.        
	Then one day on a hunch, she clicked on the Facebook account of a woman she suspected her husband was having an affair with, and discovered that John had married the woman in 2008 at Disney World in Florida.        
	Lynn says the discovery left her speechless. Its heart-wrenching and its shocking and its just too many emotions to put into words, she told Fox 8 News. Lynn says she believes her husband is guilty of bigamy and filed a complaint with Westlake police after John returned from Florida earlier this year, took the couples two sons and returned to the Sunshine State.

	London, May 30 (PTI): A junior minister has been warned over posting controversial comments, including one in which she reveals doubts about her new boss and another in which she criticises a former royal family member, on her Internet diary linked to Twitter.         
	Home office minister Lynne Featherstone has been asked by senior civil servants not to write freely on her website, the Daily Mail said.        
	 In common with many other ministers, Lynne Featherstone has been blogging for several years. The minister is well aware of her responsibilities under the ministerial code, a home office spokesperson said.

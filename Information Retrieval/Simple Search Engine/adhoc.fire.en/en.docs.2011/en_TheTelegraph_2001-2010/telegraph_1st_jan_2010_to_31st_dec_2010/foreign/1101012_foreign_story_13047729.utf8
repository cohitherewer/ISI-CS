          CATHERINE RAMPELL                                      (From top) Peter Diamond, Christopher Pissarides, Dale Mortensen                          
	New York, Oct. 11: The 2010 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded today to Peter A. Diamond, Dale T. Mortensen and Christopher A. Pissarides for their work on markets where buyers and sellers have difficulty finding each other, and in particular on the difficulties of fitting people to the right jobs.         
	For decades, the researchers have studied markets that are not made up of identical, cookie-cutter units  as is the case with the job market, where workers have different skills and weaknesses, and where all companies have different types of jobs they need to fill. In many cases, there are significant obstacles to finding the ideal match between a buyer and a seller, like matching a job-provider to a job-seeker.         
	Professor Diamond, 70, an MIT professor and a nominee to the Federal Reserve Board who was effectively blocked by the Senate in August, first developed a broad theoretical framework for studying markets with so-called search costs in 1971. Professors Mortensen, 71, of Northwestern University, and Pissarides, 62, of the London School of Economics, later worked with Professor Diamond to apply the framework to the job market in particular, and how government policy could improve and speed up the matching of workers to jobs.         
	The Laureates models help us understand the ways in which unemployment, job vacancies, and wages are affected by regulation and economic policy, according to the citation from the prize committee.         
	Some of the applications of the research include understanding why unemployment rises during recessions, why similar workers get different wages, why wages do not fall much during recessions even though that might make additional hiring more attractive to employers, and how so many people can be unemployed even when there are a large number of job openings available.         
	Their work has suggested, for example, that unemployment benefits can have the unintended consequence of prolonging joblessness by making it less costly to be without work.         
	While the applications of Professor Diamonds Nobel-winning work are broad, his practical experience was questioned earlier this year when he was nominated for a Fed governor position.         
	The Nobel in economic science is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and is not one of the original prizes created by Alfred Nobel. Rather, it is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. In addition to a medal and a diploma, the laureates receive 10 million Swedish kronor, or about $1.5 million.         
	Last year, the prize was awarded to social scientists, Elinor Ostrom at Indiana University, and Oliver E. Williamson of the University of California, Berkeley                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

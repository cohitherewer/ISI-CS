The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Panel: Homeopathy not medicine
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Panel: Homeopathy not medicine
                              mixed messages                            
	London, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Britain should end its state funding for homeopathic treatments because they are scientifically implausible and work no better than placebos, an influential parliamentary panel said today.        
	The Science and Technology committee said homeopathic products are not medicine and should no longer be licensed by medicine regulators. Homeopathy producers should not be allowed to make medical claims on product labels without evidence, it added.        
	The committee accused the government of sending out mixed messages about homeopathic remedies by saying that while there is no evidence to back them, they can still be paid for by Britains public National Health Service (NHS).        
	It sets an unfortunate precedent for the department of health to consider that the existence of a community which believes that homeopathy works is evidence enough to continue spending public money on it, committee chairman Phil Willis said. This also sends out a confused message, and has potentially harmful consequences.        
	An election is due in Britain later this year and political leaders are under pressure to come up with any saving they can to bring down the countrys ballooning public deficit.         
	Ministers estimate the NHS spends around 152,000  a tiny fraction of its around 100 billion  on homeopathic remedies each year. In its report on homeopathy, the committee agreed with the government that evidence shows homeopathy is not efficacious  meaning it works no better than a placebo, or dummy pill.        
	Explanations for why homeopathy would work are scientifically implausible, it said.        
	Homeopathy, which originated in Germany in the 1700s, is based on a principle that like cures like. The theory is that substances that prompt certain symptoms can also treat those same symptoms if given in a highly diluted form.        
	The practice is controversial because many of its central concepts do not accord with modern science. Many studies have found homeopathic remedies are no more effective than placebos.        
	Critics say the homeopathy industry has made millions out of selling little more than sugar pills to vulnerable patients.        
	Paula Ross, chief executive of the Society of Homeopaths, rejected the findings and accused the committee of wasting public money by turning its inquiry from one on the governments policy on homeopathy to one about whether homeopathy works.        
	We would have preferred to see the government put money into much needed research into how actually homeopathy works, she said.        
	She argued that evidence shows homeopathy is effective beyond placebo, but scientists have yet to understand how. The committee said homeopathy wasa placebo treatment and the government should have a policy on placebos  an area it said ministers were reluctant to touch because prescribing placebos usually relies on some degree of patient deception.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Assange fears US extradition
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Assange fears US extradition
                                                
	Ellingham (England), Dec. 17 (Reuters): WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said today that he was the target of an aggressive US investigation and feared extradition to the US was increasingly likely.        
	The 39-year-old Australian computer expert, who Swedish authorities want to question over alleged sexual offences, has angered the US by releasing secret diplomatic cables on his website and teaming up with newspapers around the globe to amplify the impact of the disclosures.        
	Speaking to reporters from the grounds of the English country house where he was sent after his release on bail this week, Assange denounced what he called a smear campaign against him and said he expected more attempts to tarnish his name.        
	The risk we have always been concerned about is onward extradition to the United States and that seems to be increasingly serious and increasingly likely, Assange told reporters in the sprawling grounds of the house in eastern England where he must spend Christmas and New Year.        
	Asked if he was facing a US conspiracy, Assange told reporters: I would say that there is a very aggressive investigation. A lot of face has been lost by some people, and some people have careers to make by pursuing famous cases.        
	US media reports say American prosecutors could charge Assange with espionage and seek his extradition if they can show he helped a US intelligence analyst, suspected of being behind the leaks, collect the classified material. Assange has denied any knowledge of the former US Army Specialist Bradley Manning.        
	Assange has described the curbs on him as hi-tech house arrest. As part of his bail conditions, he must stay at an 18th-century mansion owned by former British army officer Vaughan Smith, situated close to the city of Norwich, around three hours drive from London.

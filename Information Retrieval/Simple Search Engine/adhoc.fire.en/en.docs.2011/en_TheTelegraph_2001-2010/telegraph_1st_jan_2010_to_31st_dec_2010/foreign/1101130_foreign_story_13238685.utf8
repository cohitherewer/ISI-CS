	Los Angeles, Nov. 29 (Reuters): Canadian comic actor Leslie Nielsen, star of a string of madcap spoof movies including Airplane! and The Naked Gun, died of complications from pneumonia in Florida yesterday, a spokesman said. He was 84.        
	Nielsen is probably best known for playing the bumbling cop Lt. Frank Drebin in the Naked Gun franchise, but enjoyed a movie and television career spanning more than 60 years. The spokesman said Nielsen died in a hospital near his home in Fort Lauderdale

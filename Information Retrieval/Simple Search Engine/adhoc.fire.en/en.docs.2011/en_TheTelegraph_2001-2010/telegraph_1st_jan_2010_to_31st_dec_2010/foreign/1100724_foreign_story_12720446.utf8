	July 23: Adding to a drumbeat of concern about the nations dismal college-completion rates, the College Board warned yesterday that the growing gap between the US and other countries threatens to undermine American economic competitiveness.         
	The US used to lead the world in the number of 25- to 34-year-olds with college degrees. Now it ranks 12th among 36 developed nations. The growing education deficit is no less a threat to our nations long-term well-being than the current fiscal crisis, Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board, warned at a meeting on Capitol Hill of education leaders and policy makers, where he released a report detailing the problem and recommending how to fix it. To improve our college completion rates, we must think P-16 and improve education from pre-school to higher education.        
	While access to college has been the major concern in recent decades, over the last year, college completion, too, has become a leading item on the national agenda. Last July, President Obama announced the American Graduation Initiative, calling for five million more college graduates by 2020, to help the US again lead the world in educational attainment. This month, on becoming chairman of the National Governors Association, Governor Joe Manchin III of West Virginia announced that he would lead a college-completion initiative. In May, Grantmakers for Education, an organisation for those who make gifts to educational programmes, convened a group of philanthropists to talk about how to bolster college-completion rates.

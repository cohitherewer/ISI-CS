The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Web of intrigue around Chelseas wedding
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Web of intrigue around Chelseas wedding
          SHERYL GAY STOLBERG AND NATE SCHWEBER                          Clinton: Publicity shy                                  
	New York, July 17: One weekend afternoon in April, Dan Bleen, the manager of Le Petit Bistro, an upscale French restaurant in Rhinebeck, New York, a quaint Hudson Valley town, received a mysterious telephone call from the owner of Astor Courts, the centrepiece of a nearby 50-acre estate.        
	The caller wanted to make a reservation, she told him, for some very special guests, whose identities she would reveal moments before they arrived.        
	The guests, it turned out, included Chelsea Clinton, the publicity-shy daughter of the former President and current secretary of state. Clinton and three girlfriends sat at a secluded table, chatting animatedly and sampling appetisers, salads, entrees and a dessert, accompanied by a nice Beaune Burgundy wine.        
	It seemed unremarkable at the time. But now, the dinner has become yet another morsel of evidence in a New York-to-Washington web of intrigue over the social event of the season: the impending marriage of Clinton, 30, to Marc Mezvinsky, 32, an investment banker at 3G Capital Management and a son of two former Democratic members of Congress, one of whom served prison time for fraud.        
	The wedding, set for July 31, is so cloaked in secrecy that in Washington, where the mother of the bride holds down a day job running international diplomacy for President Obama, details are harder to ferret out than the Presidents Afghanistan strategy.         
	Even guests do not know the locale; invitations came with instructions to be within driving distance of Manhattan, plus a promise that specifics would be sent a week before the big day.        
	That has not prevented some educated guessing. The current betting is that the Clinton-Mezvinsky nuptials will take place in Rhinebeck, at the Astor Courts, a 13,000-foot Beaux Arts pavilion built between 1902 and 1904 for John Jacob Astor IV and designed by Stanford White to evoke the Grand Trianon at Versailles.         
	The Clintons have refused to confirm the reports; the mansions owner, Kathleen Hammer, a political donor to Hillary Rodham Clinton who made Chelseas restaurant reservation, did not return email messages or calls.        
	Americans are eternally fascinated with presidential children, and perhaps none more so than Chelsea, who arrived at the White House as a gawky 12-year-old with frizzy hair and braces, and grew up before the nations eyes, under a cone of silence that she has broken only rarely, to campaign for her mother, for instance, when Hillary Clintons bid for the presidency was in jeopardy.        
	Today, she is a chic strawberry-blonde, with experience working at a hedge fund, a deep interest in public policy and, as of January, a masters degree from Columbias Mailman School of Public Health.        
	Yet for Americans of a certain age, the enduring image of Chelsea Clinton is that of the 18-year-old college girl walking on the White House lawn, her back to the camera, holding one hand of each parent  literally the glue binding her family together after her fathers painful confession of marital infidelities. Even then, she seemed to exude a combination of dignity and distance.        
	Chelsea is such a private person, and she hates the thought of people roaming around with cameras, said one Clinton family friend who, like other guests, spoke only on condition of anonymity. She doesnt want to dredge up things that happened a long time ago. She just wants to have a wedding.        
	In Mezvinsky, she has found a partner whose life experiences bear a striking resemblance to her own. The two first met as teenagers in Hilton Head, South Carolina, during a Renaissance Weekend, the annual intellectual and spiritual fest popularised by the Clintons.         
	Both attended Stanford University, though their romance did not bloom until a few years ago.

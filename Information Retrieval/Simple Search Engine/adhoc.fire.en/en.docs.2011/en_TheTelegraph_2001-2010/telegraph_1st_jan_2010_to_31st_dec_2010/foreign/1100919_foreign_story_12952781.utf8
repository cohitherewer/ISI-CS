	Pinto sizzle    
	 Los Angeles, Sept. 18 (PTI): Indian actress Freida Pinto is sure to win over plenty of fans with her latest photospread for GQ magazine where she is clad in a series of risque leather outfits.      
	Pinto looks the part of a Hollywood pin-up as she posed in leather minis and, in one picture, with a knife cutting open a pomegranate. Pinto, 25, who shot to fame as Latika in Slumdog Millionaire, completed the look with red nail varnish and tousled hair. The actress is busy promoting her latest film, Woody Allens You Will Meet A Tall Dark Stranger.

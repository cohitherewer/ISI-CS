	Lohan warrant    
	 Beverly Hills, May 20 (AP): A judge issued a warrant today for Lindsay Lohans arrest after the actress missed a mandatory hearing. Bail was set at $100,000.      
	Lohan, 23, was due in court for a progress report on her probation stemming from two arrests in 2007. Her attorney, Shawn Chapman Holley, said Lohans passport was stolen while she was at the Cannes Film Festival and was unable to return to Los Angeles in time for todays hearing.      
	She did, in fact, have airline tickets, Holley told the judge. From our standpoint, there is a valid reason for her not being here today. Holley said Lohan will be back in the US by tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | WikiLeaks to publish remaining documents
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      WikiLeaks to publish remaining documents
                              Julian Assange                             
	Stockholm, Aug. 14 (AP): WikiLeaks will soon publish its remaining 15,000 Afghan war documents, despite warnings from the US government, the organisations founder said today.        
	The Pentagon has said that secret information will be even more damaging to security and risk more lives than WikiLeakss initial release of some 76,000 war documents.        
	This organisation will not be threatened by the Pentagon or any other group, WikiLeaks founder and spokesman Julian Assange told reporters in Stockholm. We proceed cautiously and safely with this material.        
	He said WikiLeaks was about halfway though a line-by-line review of the 15,000 documents and expected to publish them within weeks. Assange said innocent parties who are under reasonable threat would be redacted from the material.

	Relaxed Marilyn    
	 New York, Feb. 5 (Reuters): Photographs of Marilyn Monroe appearing relaxed and lounging around a New York apartment nine months before she died were unveiled today.      
	Photographer Len Steckler shot the black-and-white images of Monroe when she unexpectedly arrived at his apartment in December, 1961, to visit his friend, Pulitzer-prize winning poet Carl Sandburg.

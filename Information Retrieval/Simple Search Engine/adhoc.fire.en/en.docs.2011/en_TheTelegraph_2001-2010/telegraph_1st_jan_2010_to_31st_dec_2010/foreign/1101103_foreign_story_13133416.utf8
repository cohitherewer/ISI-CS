	Berlin, Nov. 2 (AP): Police were investigating a suspicious package at German Chancellor Angela Merkels office today, hours after small mail bombs exploded outside the Russian and Swiss embassies in Athens in attacks blamed on far-Left domestic extremists.        
	Merkel was in Belgium when the package arrived in the mailroom of her office. Merkels spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that it showed marks that indicated the possibility of explosives and police were immediately alerted.        
	Explosives experts continue to examine the package. The chancellory was not evacuated. Several German media outlets cited unspecified official sources as saying the package was personally addressed to Merkel and the Greek economy ministry was given as the return address.         
	Greek police destroyed at least three more suspected bombs in Athens. No group claimed responsibility for todays attacks, which caused no injuries. No warning was given.

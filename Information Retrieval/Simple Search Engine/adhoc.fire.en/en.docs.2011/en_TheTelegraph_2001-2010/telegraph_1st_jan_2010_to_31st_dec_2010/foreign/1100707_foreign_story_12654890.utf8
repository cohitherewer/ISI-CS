                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Michael held for car crash
                                          
	London, July 6 (Reuters): British singer George Michael has been arrested after his car hit a building on a road in north London at the weekend, police said today.        
	The police were called to the scene at around 3.35am local time (0235 GMT) on Sunday. The man aged in his 40s was arrested on suspicion of being unfit to drive, a spokesperson said.        
	The police do not name individuals when making preliminary statements, but the spokesman was speaking in response to questions about Michael, who is 47. He was taken to a north London police station and bailed to return in mid-August pending further inquiries.        
	The star, who became famous as part of the band Wham! before launching a successful solo career, was banned from driving for two years in 2007 and sentenced to 100 hours of community service after admitting driving when unfit because of drugs.

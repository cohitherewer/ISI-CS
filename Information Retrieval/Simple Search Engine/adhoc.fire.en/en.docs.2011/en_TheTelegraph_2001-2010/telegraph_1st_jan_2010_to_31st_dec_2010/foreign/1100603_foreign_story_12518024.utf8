The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jobs muses on all things Apple
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jobs muses on all things Apple
          MIGUEL HELFT                          Perfect timing                                  
	June 2: For Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, the timing of his public appearance at the D8 conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, could not have been better.         
	Last week, Apple surpassed Microsoft to become the worlds most valuable technology company. A little more than a decade ago, Apple was struggling for its life, and many tech pundits were predicting its demise.        
	So Jobss wide-ranging interview with conference hosts Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher began, appropriately, with a softball question: How did it feel to stand at the top of the technology heap.        
	For those of us who have been in the industry a long time, it is surreal, Jobs said. But it doesnt matter very much. It is not whats important. It is not why any of our customers buy our products. I think it is good for us to keep that in mind. But it is a little surreal.        
	Jobs then hit on all the news that has surrounded Apple recently  the stolen iPhone prototype, the war over Flash with Adobe, the suicides at Chinese contract manufacturer Foxconn, AT amp;Ts network problems, the rivalry with Google and more.         
	He didnt make any news or announce any new products or partners, but he delivered some interesting tidbits. Perhaps most significantly, he said Apple has no plans to get rid of Googles search and maps services on the iPhone or iPad.        
	We have some Google properties on our phone, Jobs said. Just because we are competing with somebody doesnt mean you have to be rude.        
	Jobs also appeared to pour cold water on reports that Apple was about to unveil a new version of Apple TV, saying that the digital television business was plagued with a series of problems, including challenges in distributing new products. Thats why when we said Apple TV is a hobby, thats why we used that phrase, he said.        
	Jobs was far more circumspect when he was asked whether there might soon be an iPhone running on a network other than AT amp;Ts in the US. Jobs bit his lip as we appeared to think how to answer. There might be, he said. After he was pressed about when that might happen, he added: The future is long. I cant talk about that stuff. Speculation has been building that Apple may soon unveil a phone running on Verizon Wireless.

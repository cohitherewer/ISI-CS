	Khar (Pakistan), Dec. 25 (AP): A female suicide bomber, dressed in a burqa, detonated her explosives-laden vest killing at least 43 people at an aid distribution centre in northwestern Pakistan today.        
	 The bombing appeared to be the first suicide attack staged by a woman in Pakistan, and it underscored the resilience of militant groups in the countrys tribal belt despite ongoing military operations against them.        
	The bomber struck in the main city in Bajur, a region near the Afghan border where the military has twice declared victory over Taliban and al Qaida insurgents. It also came a day after some 150 militants killed 11 soldiers in a coordinated assault in the adjoining tribal region of Mohmand where the army also has carried out operations.        
	Top government official in Mohmand, Amjad Ali Khan, said helicopter gunships backed by artillery pounded militants hideouts today, killing 40 militants.        
	In Bajur, the bomber was queuing to enter the food aid distribution centre in the town of Khar when she was questioned by police at a check point, local government official Tariq Khan said.        
	Police asked for her identity, but she ran towards the centre and lobbed hand grenades at the police, Khan said.         
	She exploded herself when she reached the crowd of about 300. Khan said six policemen were among the 43 killed and more than 102 people were wounded, at least 30 critically.        
	The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack through its spokesman, Azam Tariq.        
	He suggested that the victims were targeted because most belonged to the Salarzai tribe, which was among the first to set up a militia  known as a lashkar  to fight the Taliban in 2008. Other tribes later formed similar militias to resist the militants.        
	All anti-Taliban forces  like lashkars, army and security forces  are on our target, Tariq said. We will strike them whenever we have an opportunity. Police said the victims were from various parts of the Bajur tribal region who gather daily at the centre to collect food tokens distributed by the World Food Programme and other agencies to conflicted-affected people in the region.         
	The people were displaced by an army offensive against Taliban militants in the region in early 2009. Islamist militants battling the state have attacked buildings handing out humanitarian aid in Pakistan before.        
	Tariq Khan and another local official, Sohail Khan, said an examination of the human remains has confirmed the bomber was a woman. Hasan Askari Rizvi, a Lahore-based security and political analyst, said the suicide bombing appeared to be the first carried out by a woman in Pakistan. It is no surprise. They can use a woman, a child or whatever, Rizvi said. Human life is not important to them, only the objective they are pursuing of undermining state power, he added.         
	Male suicide bombers often don the burqa as a disguise. In 2007, officials initially claimed Pakistans first female suicide bomber had killed 14 people in the northwest town of Bannu but the attacker was later identified as a man. Akbar Jan, 45, who sustained leg wounds in the bombing, said from his hospital bed that people were lining up for the ration coupons when something exploded with a big bang.

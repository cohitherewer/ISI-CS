	Aug. 26: Nadja Benaissa, a German pop singer who infected her partner with HIV, escaped a prison sentence yesterday after making a tearful apology for her cowardly behaviour.        
	Benaissa, 28, a member of the popular German girl band No Angels, kept her diagnosis a secret and knowingly exposed several men to the virus. A court in Darmstadt, western Germany, convicted her of causing grievous bodily harm and two counts of attempted bodily harm by having unprotected sexual intercourse. One of her partners, a 34-year-old talent agent, contracted the virus.        
	Benaissa received a two-year suspended sentence and was ordered to carry out 300 hours of community service. State prosecutor Peter Liesenfeld said the court was lenient because Benaissa had expressed regret in court.        
	The half-Moroccan singer broke down during closing arguments in the trial and sobbed: I was a coward. I am sorry from the bottom of my heart. I would love to turn back the clock, but I cant. Benaissa wept again as she learned that she would not be jailed. She could have faced up to 10 years behind bars. Judge Dennis Wacker said he passed the relatively light sentence because Benaissa had learned to be responsible and deal with her illness.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Police raid Fonseka office
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Police raid Fonseka office

	Colombo, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Police raided the office of Sri Lankas defeated presidential candidate today and arrested 15 ex-military members of his staff, aides said.        
	It comes two days after troops surrounded Fonsekas hotel on suspicion of a coup plot.        
	General Sarath Fonseka lost Tuesdays election to incumbent Mahinda Rajapaksa by 1.8 million votes after a bruising campaign with personal attacks by both. In May last year, Fonseka and Rajapaksa had stood together in victory over the Tamil Tiger separatists after a 25-year war.        
	The police Special Task Force broke into the office of Sarath Fonseka, aide Asanka Magedara told Reuters.        
	Police arrested 15 of Fonsekas supporters who were in the office at the time of the raid. They seized all the computers and mobile phones there, said Shiral Laktilake, a lawyer for Fonseka.        
	After the raid, the inside of the office was mostly cleaned out, with boxes, electronic items and papers dumped on the floor. Police spokesman I.M. Karunaratne said he had heard of a raid but could not immediately confirm it.        
	Opposition officials said the raid was designed to intimidate them and stop their plans to protest against the results.         
	Fonseka has said he will launch a court challenge.        
	Editor arrested        
	Also today, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) legislator Vijitha Herath said police arrested Chandana Sirimalwatte, editor of the Lanka newspaper.         
	The journal is seen as favouring the JVP, a Marxist party which joined other Opposition parties to back Fonseka. On Wednesday, soldiers surrounded the luxury hotel where Fonseka and other Opposition leaders went after polling finished and vote counting was proceeding.

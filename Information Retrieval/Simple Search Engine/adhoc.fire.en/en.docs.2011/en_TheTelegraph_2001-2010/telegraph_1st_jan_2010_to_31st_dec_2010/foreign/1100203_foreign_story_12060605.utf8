The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Blow to Bangla religious parties
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Blow to Bangla religious parties
          FARID HOSSAIN                           The Supreme Court in Dhaka                                  
	Dhaka, Feb. 2: The Bangladesh Supreme Court today upheld a ruling paving the way for banning parties which base their politics on religion.         
	The decision of the six-member Supreme Court panel is bad news for the Jamaat-e-Islami, the countrys largest party seeking to establish Islamic rule, and ally Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.         
	An alliance of the BNP and the Jamaat was in power between 2001 and 2008. The panel, headed by Chief Justice Md Tafazzul Islam, gave its decision after six days of hearing on the subject.         
	The high court had declared as illegal and unconstitutional a 1979 amendment of the Constitution by then military ruler Gen. Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP.         
	That move, known as the 5th Amendment, struck down secularism as one of the four basic state principles, allowing religion-based parties to operate.        
	The change saw dozens of Islamic parties come up, challenging secular groups like the Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.         
	Propagation of anti-India sentiments has also been a feature of these Islamic parties.         
	BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three Jamaat lawyers had challenged the high court ruling in the Supreme Court.         
	Todays ruling means Bangladesh is now free to restore the four basic constitutional principles: democracy, socialism, secularism and nationalism.         
	Banning religion-based politics is among the electoral pledges made by Hasinas Awami League. Law minister Shafique Ahmed had recently said that the government would consider banning religion-based parties.

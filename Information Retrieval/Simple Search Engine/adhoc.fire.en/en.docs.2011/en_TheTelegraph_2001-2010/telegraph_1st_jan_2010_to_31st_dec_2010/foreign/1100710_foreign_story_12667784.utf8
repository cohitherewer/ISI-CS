The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Largest spy swap after Cold War takes off

	Vienna, July 9 (AP): The US and Russia orchestrated the largest spy swap since the Cold War, exchanging 10 spies arrested in the US for four convicted in Russia in a tightly choreographed diplomatic dance today at Viennas airport.        
	Two planes  one from New Yorks La Guardia airport and another from Moscow  arrived in Vienna within minutes of each other, parked nose-to-tail at a remote section on the tarmac, then spent about an hour and a half before departing just as quickly. A small bus was seen driving between the two planes.        
	The swap completed, a Russian emergencies ministry Yakovlvev Yak-42 plane left Vienna, reportedly carrying the 10 people deported from the US. Shortly afterwards, a maroon-and-white Boeing 767-200 that brought those agents in from New York took off, apparently with four Russians who had confessed to spying for the West.        
	No information was immediately available as to the planes destinations. But the Russian flight was thought to heading for Moscow, while the US charter was likely flying to London.        
	Vienna has long been involved in such Cold War-like machinations, the capital of neutral Austria being a preferred place to work on treaties and agreements meant to reduce US-Soviet tensions.        
	Both countries won admissions of crimes from the subjects of the exchange  guilty pleas in the US and signed confessions in Russia. One alleged Russian spy wanted in the US was still a fugitive after jumping bail in Cyprus.        
	In exchange for the 10 Russian agents, the US won freedom for and access to two former Russian intelligence colonels who had been convicted in their home country of compromising dozens of valuable Soviet-era and Russian agents operating in the West. Two others also convicted of betraying Moscow were wrapped into the deal.        
	One ex-colonel, Alexander Zaporozhsky, may have exposed information leading to the capture of Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames, two of the most damaging spies ever caught in the US.        
	US officials said some of those freed by Russia were ailing, and cited humanitarian concerns in part for arranging the swap in such a hurry. They said no substantial benefit to US national security was seen from keeping the captured low-level agents in US prisons for years.        
	This sends a powerful signal to people who co-operate with us that we will stay loyal to you, said former CIA officer Peter Earnest. Even if you have been in jail for years, we will not forget you.        
	The 10 Russian agents arrested in the US had tried to blend into American suburbia but been under watch for up to a decade by the FBI.         
	Their access to top US national security secrets appeared spotty at best, although the extent of what they knew and passed on is not publicly known.        
	The lawyer for one of them, Vicky Pelaez, said the Russian government had offered her $2,000 a month for life, housing and help with her children  rather than the years behind bars she could have faced in the US if she had not agreed to the deal.        
	In an elaborate round of dealmaking, US officials met on Monday in Russia with the convicted spies and offered them a chance for freedom if they left their homeland. Russian officials in the US held similar meetings with the agents captured by the FBI.

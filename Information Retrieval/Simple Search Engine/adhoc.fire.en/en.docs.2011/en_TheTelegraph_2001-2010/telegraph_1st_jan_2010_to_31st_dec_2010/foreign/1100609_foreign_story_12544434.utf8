The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Brazil beauty beyond blonde

          ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO                          Bundchen: Not the only one                                  
	Restinga Seca (Brazil), June 8: Before setting out in a pink SUV to comb the schoolyards and shopping malls of southern Brazil, Alisson Chornak studies books, maps and websites to understand how the towns were colonised and how European their residents might look today.        
	The goal, he and other model scouts say, is to find the right genetic cocktail of German and Italian ancestry, perhaps with some Russian or other Slavic blood thrown in. Such a mix, they say, helps produce the tall, thin girls with straight hair, fair skin and light eyes that Brazil exports to the runways of New York, Milan and Paris with stunning success.        
	Yet Brazil is not the same country it was in 1994, when Gisele Bndchen, the worlds top earning model, was discovered in a tiny town not far from here. Darker-skinned women have become more prominent in Brazilian society, challenging the notions of Brazilian beauty and success that Bndchen has come to represent here and abroad.        
	Tas Arajo just finished a run as the first black female lead in the coveted 8pm soap opera slot. Marina Silva, a former government minister born in the Amazon, is running for President. And over the past decade, the income of black Brazilians rose by about 40 per cent, more than double the rate of whites, as Brazils booming economy helped trim the inequality gap and create a more powerful black consumer class, said Marcelo Neri, an economist in Rio de Janeiro.        
	Even prosecutors have waded into the debate over what Brazilian society looks like  and how it should be represented. S Paulo Fashion Week has been forced by local prosecutors to ensure that at least 10 per cent of its models are of African or indigenous descent.        
	Despite those shifts, more than half of Brazils models continue to be found here among the tiny farms of Rio Grande do Sul, a state that has only one-twentieth of the nations population and was colonised predominantly by Germans and Italians.        
	Indeed, scouts say that more than 70 per cent of the countrys models come from three southern states that hardly reflect the multiethnic melting pot that is Brazil, where more than half the population is non-white.        
	On the pages of its magazines, Brazils beauty spectrum is clearer. Non-white women, including celebrities of varying body types, are interspersed with white models. But on the runways, the proving ground for models hoping to go abroad, the diversity drops off precipitously. Prosecutors investigating discrimination complaints against S Paulo Fashion Week found that only 28 of the events 1,128 models were black in early 2008.        
	The pattern creates a disconnect between what many Brazilians consider beautiful and the beauty they export overseas. While darker-skinned actresses like Juliana Paes and Camila Pitanga are considered among Brazils sexiest, it is Bndchen and her fellow southerners who win fame abroad. I was always perplexed that Brazil was never able to export a Naomi Campbell, and it is definitely not because of a lack of pretty women, said Erika Palomino, a fashion consultant. It is embarrassing.

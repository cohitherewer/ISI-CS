The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak to probe AQ Khan over Iran ties
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pak to probe AQ Khan over Iran ties
          SALMAN MASOOD                          Hands clean                                  
	Islamabad, March 22: The Pakistani government has filed a petition in the nations high court seeking to investigate Abdul Qadeer Khan over recent reports about his ties to Irans nuclear program, a government lawyer said today.         
	The petition was filed today hours before a court in Lahore was to announce a verdict on Khans plea to have his travel restrictions relaxed. Khan has confessed to running the worlds largest nuclear proliferation network.         
	The court is expected to issue its ruling on Wednesday on both petitions, according to lawyers for the government and Khan.        
	The government filed its request in an effort to investigate Khan regarding recent news reports in which he was said to have confessed to supplying Iran with sensitive information related to the nuclear programme.        
	A copy of the government petition obtained by The New York Times cited two articles published on March 10 and 14 by The Washington Post that have national security implications for Pakistan as they contain allegations related to nuclear programme and nuclear cooperation. Further they have likelihood of adversely affecting friendly ties with the government of Iran and Iraq. The petition requested the court to direct Khan to refrain from interacting with foreign media.        
	The article published on March 14 reported that Khan had disclosed in a written document that Pakistan gave Iran drawings related to a nuclear bomb, parts of centrifuges to purify uranium and a secret worldwide list of suppliers.        
	 The article published on March 10 cited a nuclear weapons expert who said members of Khans network had reached out to Saddam Husseins government in 1990.        
	Both Khan and the Pakistani government have denied these claims.        
	The government appeared to have filed its request partly to stall the court ruling on Khans petition, and it came as Pakistans powerful army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, was in the US for high-level security talks. Syed Ali Zafar, the lawyer for Khan, called the governments petition irrelevant.        
	Todays government application is mischief by the government, as it wants to defer the case, Zafar said. He added that Khan had been given a public affidavit saying that his hands are clean.

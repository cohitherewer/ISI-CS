          BENJAMIN WEISER                          A sketch of Faisal Shahzad in a New York court. (AP)                                  
	New York, June 22: The suspect in the failed Times Square bombing pleaded guilty today, in an abrupt and expedited end to a terrorism case that extended to Pakistan and an Islamic militant group there.         
	The defendant, Faisal Shahzad, 30, listened as each of 10 counts was read to him in Federal District Court in Manhattan, and indicated he understood the charges and penalties he faced.         
	Shahzad recounted how and why he conceived the plot, travelling to Pakistan last year, joining the Taliban and receiving training in how to construct a bomb. And despite his admission of guilt and his extended cooperation with the authorities since his arrest, Shahzad was unapologetic, characterising himself as part of the answer to the US terrorising the Muslim nations and the Muslim people.         
	I want to plead guilty, and Im going to plead guilty 100 times over, he said, because until the hour the US pulls its forces from Iraq and Afghanistan, and stops the drone strikes in Somalia and Yemen and in Pakistan, and stops the occupation of Muslim lands, and stops killing the Muslims, and stops reporting the Muslims to its government, we will be attacking US, and I plead guilty to that.         
	The plea and Shahzads comments came four days after a federal grand jury returned an indictment that offered new details about the governments accusations that Tehrik-i-Taliban had assisted Shahzad in his plot.         
	In court, he admitted receiving the training, saying he had gone to find the Taliban and learned how to build a bomb that he planned to detonate as part of his plan.         
	With them, I did the training to wage an attack inside the United States of America, Shahzad said.         
	Any kind of attack? Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of Federal District Court asked. It would have been any kind of attack, Shahzad said, but I was given bomb training, and thats what I learned there.

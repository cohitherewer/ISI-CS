                          Liu Xiaobo                    
	Jinzhou, China, Oct. 9 (AP): The worlds newest Nobel Peace Prize winner remained unreachable in a Chinese prison today, while his wifes mobile phone was cut off and the authoritarian government continued to censor reports about democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobos award.        
	Police kept reporters away from the prison where Liu is serving an 11-year sentence for subversion, and his lawyer said that Lius wife  who had been hoping to visit him today and tell him the news  has disappeared and may be in police custody.        
	Chinese authorities, who called Liu a criminal shortly after his award yesterday and said his winning desecrates the prize, sank today into official silence.        
	Only state-run Global Times newspaper spoke out today. An editorial in its Chinese-language edition called the award an arrogant showcase of Western ideology and said it disrespected the Chinese people.        
	But one Chinese newspaper cartoonist, Kuang Biao, posted an image on his blog yesterday of a Nobel prize medal behind bars. Another well-known blogger, Ran Yunfei, wrote today: In an era in which the Internet is gradually making information available to everyone, trying to hide from any Chinese the news that Liu Xiaobo has won the Nobel Peace Prize is hopelessly stupid behaviour  the more one tries to hide it, the more obvious it becomes.        
	Some of Chinas most prominent activist lawyers said today they were being harassed by police as they took advantage of the peace prize to try to reconcile differences among themselves.        
	In naming Liu, the Norwegian-based Nobel committee honoured his more than two decades of advocacy for human rights and peaceful democratic change  from the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989 to a manifesto for political reform that he co-authored in 2008 and which led to his latest jail term.        
	President Barack Obama, last years peace prize winner, has called for Lius immediate release.        
	But there was still no word from the winner himself. The mobile phone of his wife, Liu Xia, was turned off today as she was expected to be visiting the prison to meet her husband.        
	Shes disappeared. Were all worried about them, Lius lawyer, Shang Baojun, said today.

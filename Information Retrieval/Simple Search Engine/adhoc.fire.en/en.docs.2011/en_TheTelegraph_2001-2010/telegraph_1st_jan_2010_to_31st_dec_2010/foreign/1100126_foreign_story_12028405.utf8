                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Malik faces contempt charges
                              Malik: In trouble                            
	Islamabad, Jan. 25 (PTI): Pakistans Supreme Court today launched contempt proceedings against interior minister Rehman Malik for interfering in a probe into alleged financial irregularities in a state-run steel firm.        
	It rejected his explanation as being devoid of an apology. The court issued the notice to Malik after initiating suo motu proceedings on the basis of a media report.        
	The court took action against Malik as he had transfered Federal Investigation Agency chief Tariq Khosa, who was investigating the reasons for the Rs 22 billion loss incurred by the Pakistan Steel Mills.         
	The interior minister personally appeared at the court and presented his written reply. However, a two-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, said it was not satisfied with his explanation. The court scheduled the next hearing for February 18 when the bench will initiate contempt of court proceedings against Malik.

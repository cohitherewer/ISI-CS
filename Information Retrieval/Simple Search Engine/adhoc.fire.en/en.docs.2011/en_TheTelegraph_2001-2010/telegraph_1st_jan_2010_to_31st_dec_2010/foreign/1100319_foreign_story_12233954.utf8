  - Police traced kidnappers from Pak to Paris and Spain        ALAN COWELL                          Sahil Saeed with his father Raja Naqqash in Islamabad on Thursday. (AFP)                                        
	Paris, March 18: From the video, it might have seemed a moment as unexceptional as it was fond  a boy playing soccer with his father on a sunlit lawn, sending messages of affection back home to his mother.        
	Mummy, I miss you, the boy with the shaved head and big eyes tells the camera at the prompting of his father. Mummy, I love you. But the images of Sahil Saeed, age 5, and his father, Raja Naqqash, made public today, offered a closing chapter in a harrowing saga of kidnappers, cops, ransom and surveillance.        
	Sahil and his father, both from Oldham in northwest England, were on vacation with relatives in Jhelum, Pakistan, when armed robbers burst into the house where they were staying on March 4 and seized the boy, demanding $155,000, for his release.        
	Kidnappings for ransom are not unusual in Pakistan, but this one became prime-time, front-page news in Britain, with close-up shots of weeping relatives filling television screens while the boys whereabouts remained a mystery  until Tuesday when the boy was found wandering in fields 20km from Jhelum.        
	As the authorities in Spain, Britain, Pakistan and France pieced together the story, the police got their first break when a call from the kidnappers to Sahils father, demanding ransom, was traced back to Spain.         
	The callers told Naqqash, 28, to go to Manchester, near Oldham. When he got there, he was told in another phone call to head on to Paris with the ransom.        
	By this time, according to the official account, an international police operation was under way. As Sahils father handed over the ransom money to two people on a street in Paris, a surveillance team tracked the exchange and followed the presumed kidnappers to the village of Constanti, in Spains northeastern region of Catalonia.        
	When Sahil walked free in Pakistan, a Spanish SWAT team stormed the apartment house near Barcelona and seized roughly $147,500 of the ransom money, mobile phones and a computer. The Spanish police also arrested two Pakistani men and a Romanian woman, who was accused of having travelled to Paris with one of the men to take the ransom money from Naqqash.

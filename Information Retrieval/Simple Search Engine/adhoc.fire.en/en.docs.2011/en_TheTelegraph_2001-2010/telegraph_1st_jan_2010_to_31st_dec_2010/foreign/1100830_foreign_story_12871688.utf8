	Muzaffargarh, Pakistan, Aug. 29: In Pakistan, where politics has long been a matter of pedigree, Jamshed Dasti is a mongrel. The scrappy son of an amateur wrestler, Dasti has clawed his way into Pakistans Parliament, beating the wealthy, landed families who have ruled here.         
	In elite circles, Dasti is reviled as a thug, a small-time hustler with a fake college degree who represents the worst of Pakistan today. But here, he is hailed as a hero, living proof that in Pakistan, a poor man can get a seat at the rich mens table.         
	Dastis rise is part of a broad shift in political power in Pakistan. For generations, politics took place in the parlours of a handful of rich families, a westernised elite that owned large tracts of land and sometimes even the people who worked it. But Pakistan is urbanising fast, and powerful forces of change are chipping away at the landed aristocracy, known in Pakistan as the feudal class.         
	The result is a changing political landscape more representative of Pakistani society, but far less predictable for the US. Dasti, 32, speaks no English. His legislative record includes opposition to a sexual harassment bill. He has 35 criminal cases to his name and is from the countrys conservative heartland, where dislike of America runs deep.         
	How this plays out is crucial to Pakistans future. The countrys fast-expanding, flood-weary population needs local government as never before but with political power shifting and institutions stillborn, the state has never been less able to provide it.         
	You have scarcity arising everywhere, said Ali Cheema, chairperson of the economics department at Lahore University of Management and Science. Scarcity creates conflict. Conflict needs mediation. But the state is unable to do it.         
	In Dastis area, one of the hardest hit by the recent flooding, the state has all but disappeared. Not that it was ever very present. In the British colonial era, before Pakistan became a separate country, the state would show up a few times a month in the form of a representative from the Raj dispensing justice.         
	Later, the local landowner took over. For years, feudal lords reigned supreme, serving as the police, the judge and the political leader. Plantations had jails, and political seats were practically owned by families.         
	Instead of midwifing democracy, these aristocrats obstructed it, ignoring the needs of rural Pakistanis, half of whom are still landless and poor more than 60 years after Pakistan became a state.

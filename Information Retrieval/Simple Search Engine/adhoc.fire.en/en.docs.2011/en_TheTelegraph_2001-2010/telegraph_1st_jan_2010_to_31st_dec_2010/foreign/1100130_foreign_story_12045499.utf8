          SUNDARARAJAN MURARI                              
	Colombo, Jan. 29: President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said that the law of the land would deal with former army commander Sarath Fonseka over his charge that defence secretary Gothabaya Rajapaksa had ordered the shooting of LTTE leaders who were ready to surrender during the closing stages of the war.        
	Talking to the media last evening in Colombo, President Rajapaksa said he did not want to get personally involved in the matter. Fonseka allegedly made the charge in an interview to the Sunday Leader newspaper. He retracted the statement after the government threatened to take legal action. However, the paper stands by the interview.         
	On the dissolution of parliament, whose term ends on April 19, Rajapaksa said he would do it before he leaves for Russia. Rajapaksa, who won in 16 of the 22 districts and trailed Fonseka in the remaining six which are mostly in the Tamil minority areas, said polling in the north and east itself is a triumph of democracy. The fact that the vote was split between the government and the Opposition was a welcome feature, the President said.        
	He added: Although I did not emerge the winner in the north, I am glad that people entered the democratic process after a long break and cast their ballot for the ruling party and the Opposition.

	Swank sizzler    
	 London, March 9 (PTI): Its hard to stand out in a crowd at the Oscars. However, actress Hilary Swank was determined to make sure all eyes were on her as she turned out for the Vanity Fair party.      
	Swank, who won two best actress Oscars for her role in Boys Dont Cry and Million Dollar Baby, arrived in a daring Armani Prive dress that plunged almost to her navel and scooped incredibly low at the back.       
	Swanks modesty was saved only by a piece of sheer mesh which kept the bold neckline from gaping wide open, reports the Daily Mail.      
	The 35-year-old star complimented the dress with a Charleston diamond pendant, a Roger Vivier handbag and platform heels by Jimmy Choo. Swank skipped the main Oscar ceremony where the actresses had shied away from showing too much skin.

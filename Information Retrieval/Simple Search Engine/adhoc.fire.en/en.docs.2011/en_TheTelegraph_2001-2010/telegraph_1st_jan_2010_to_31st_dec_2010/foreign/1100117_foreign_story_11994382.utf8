The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Yahoo dragged into Google row
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Yahoo dragged into Google row 
                              Reckless giant                            
	Shanghai, Jan. 16 (Reuters): Yahoo got pulled into a growing row between China and Google today, as its Chinese partner slammed Yahoos statements supporting Google while a source revealed the search giant had stayed silent about cyber-attacks.        
	Yahoo knew it had been a target of sophisticated Chinese cyber attacks on US firms before Google alerted the company to them, but remained silent while its bigger rival went public, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.        
	Yahoos Chinese partner, e-commerce firm Alibaba Group, in which it owns a 40 per cent stake, nonetheless called reckless Yahoos comment last week that it stood aligned with Googles positions.        
	Meanwhile, a Google spokeswoman today denied Chinese online reports that it has already decided to shut down its google.cn site.        
	Alibaba Group has communicated to Yahoo! that Yahoos statement that it is aligned with the position Google took last week was reckless given the lack of facts in evidence, the firm said in a statement today.        
	Yahoo said Wednesday it stood aligned with Googles position that attacks on company networks are deeply disturbing and that violation of Internet user privacy is something that must be opposed.        
	That was a day after Google announced it might exit the China market after suffering a sophisticated cyber-attack on its network that resulted in the theft of its intellectual property.        
	Google said it was no longer willing to filter content on its Chinese language google.cn search engine, and would try to negotiate a legal unfiltered search engine, or exit the market.        
	Its spokeswoman said today that Chinese reports that Google has already taken a decision were untrue, and denied that employees have been put on paid leave. Its business as usual, she said.        
	She said she was unaware whether China staff have been denied access to codes, as some bloggers have said, but added that Google is still scanning its systems following the attack. Alibaba, which runs Taobao, Chinas largest online retailer, as well as Chinas largest e-commerce website Alibaba.com, has had a testy relationship with Yahoo ever since the departure of Yahoos former chief executive Jerry Yang.        
	Yahoo folded its search business and invested $1 billion in Alibaba Group in 2005 in exchange for a 40 per cent stake. The US search giant sold its stake in Alibaba.com late last year, surprising Alibaba executives near their 10th-year anniversary.        
	It is believed that Alibaba wants Yahoo to sell its stake in the wider group, but Yahoo has said it views the now multi-billion dollar stake in Alibaba as a key investment in China. In China, companies tread carefully on topics sensitive to the Chinese government.        
	 Firms like Baidu Inc , NetEase.com and Sina tend to self-censor without much prodding from the government.

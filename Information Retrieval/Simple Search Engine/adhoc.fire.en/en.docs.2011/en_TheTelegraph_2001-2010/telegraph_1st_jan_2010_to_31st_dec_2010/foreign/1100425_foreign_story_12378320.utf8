	London, April 24 (AP): Airlines today appealed to passengers to give up their seats to stranded travellers, as carriers across Europe attempted to clear a backlog of thousands of tourists grounded by the ash cloud spewed from Icelands volcano.        
	British Airways and Virgin Atlantic appealed for passengers booked on long-haul flights next week to consider giving up their seats to make way for travellers still stuck because of flight disruptions.        
	A week of airspace closures caused by ash clouds gusting from Icelands Eyjafjallajokull volcano caused the worst breakdown in civil aviation in Europe since World War II. More than 100,000 flights were cancelled and airlines are on track to lose over $2 billion.        
	Its a very difficult situation and weve had to deal with a lot of complexity, aircraft stuck in different parts of the world, crew stuck in different parts of the world, British Airways chief executive Willie Walsh said.        
	Flight authorities in Europe say the majority of the continent is now free of volcanic ash, and most airline services are operating as normal. Several carriers said they were laying on extra flights to help the stranded return home.        
	Icelands civil protection agency said Eyjafjallajokull was still spewing ash, but that the plume was now around 3km high  not large enough to reach jet streams. Most airports in Iceland were closed.        
	Pall Einarsson, a geophysicist at the University of Iceland, said Eyjafjallajokull was being closely monitored.        
	At Londons Gatwick Airport  the citys second busiest hub  Daniel Starks, a 39-year-old farmer, said he was one of 200 tourists stuck on the Spanish island of Tenerife for an extra five days as a result of the disruptions. Theres a lot still out there that cant get back, he said.        
	About 20,000 French citizens were still stranded in foreign airports  primarily in the US and east Asia  according to an estimate yesterday. France made $1.3 million available in aid to French travellers to help cover expenses because of ash-related delays.        
	A spokesperson for Germanys Deutsche Lufthansa AG said only a few passengers were still stranded abroad.        
	There are only a few passengers who are still waiting to get on a plane abroad to get back to Germany, but since there is always a few empty seats on our planes, we are taking care of this on an individual basis and are filling up those vacant seats, Peter Schneckenleitner said.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama split lip gives him superfluous trouble
                              President Obama and his wife Michelle at the White House. (AP)                            
	Washington, Dec. 6 (PTI): Suffering from a split lip, President Barack Obama found it difficult to pronounce the word superfluous at a major White House event.        
	Obama, a gifted orator, grappled with the word at this years Kennedy Center Honours yesterday as he read from an opinion by Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. Its this lip. Its hard to say, Obama said to chuckles from the audience. You try it when youve had 12 stitches.        
	 Obama got a dozen stitches on his lip after being elbowed during a basketball game on November 26. He received applause from the crowd when he finally managed to pronounce the word, included in a 1926 dissent from Holmes in defence of the arts, reported CNN . To many people, the superfluous is necessary, Holmes wrote. The theatre is necessary. Dance is necessary. Song is necessary. The arts are necessary. They are a necessary part of our lives.        
	Obama added: The men and women here to night embody that idea. Tonight it is my honour to offer them the appreciation of a grateful nation.        
	 This years Kennedy Center honorees include country-and-western singer-songwriter Merle Haggard; ex-Beatle Paul McCartney; veteran Broadway composer Jerry Herman; dancer and choreographer Bill T. Jones; and television host and actress Oprah Winfrey, a fellow Chicagoan and an early Obama supporter.        
	 At a reception in the East Room of the White House prior to the awards ceremony, Obama applauded this years honorees. Each of these honorees help us understand the human experience  to illuminate our past, to help us understand our present, and to give us the courage to face our future, he said. While the President spoke of each honorees accomplishments he used a single sentence to sum up his take on the reigning queen of daytime talk: Michelle and I love Oprah, he said.        
	 Winfrey, a woman accustomed to celebrating others accomplishments, was visibly moved by yesterdays recognition. It feels like you on your very best day, she said. It feels like when every single thing in your life comes together in one moment to say: Wow. That actually happened for me. Among the Presidents guests were actress Julia Roberts, Winfreys friend Gayle King, actors Alec Baldwin and Sidney Poitier and singer and former Kennedy Center honoree Diana Ross.

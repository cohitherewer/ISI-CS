	New York, Feb. 12: Former President Bill Clinton was taken to a New York hospital yesterday after experiencing chest discomfort and underwent what his cardiologist called a successful procedure to clear a blocked artery.        
	The former President was released from the hospital early this morning. Television footage showed Clinton, 64, walking to his vehicle as he left the hospital and later arriving home in the New York suburb of Chappaqua.        
	Clinton, who has a history of heart trouble, had two stents inserted into one of his coronary arteries after a bypass graft from an operation nearly six years ago became obstructed, Dr Allan Schwartz, the head of cardiology at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital, said last night at a news conference outside the hospital in Washington Heights.         
	Within two hours of the procedure, Clinton was up and walking again, and Dr Schwartz said he planned to allow him to return to work on Monday.        
	I expect President Clinton to resume his very active lifestyle, Dr Schwartz said. He added that the condition was not a result of the Presidents work or eating habits. President Clinton has really toed the line in terms of diet and exercise, he said, adding that Clintons cholesterol numbers were normal.        
	Dr Schwartz said Clinton began complaining of chest discomfort even when he was not exerting himself over the last few days, but an associate said he had waited until yesterday to go to the hospital because of the snowstorm that hit the East Coast. He arrived about noon and, Dr Schwartz said, underwent tests that found no evidence of a heart attack.        
	The episode came days after Clinton returned from Haiti, where he serves as the UN special envoy and is helping coordinate recovery from last months earthquake. Clinton was talking about Haiti on a cellphone with his wifes chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills, even as he was being wheeled into the operating room.

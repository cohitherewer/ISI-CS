	Los Angeles, Aug. 21: The founding of Google, the Internet giant, is to be the subject of a Hollywood film.        
	 It follows the soon-to-be-released The Social Network, directed by David Fincher, which chronicles the founding of Facebook, the social networking website.        
	According to Deadline Hollywood, the entertainment industry blog, the film will be based on the Ken Auletta book Googled: The End of the World As We Know It and will tell the story of founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page.        
	Michael London, the films producer, told Deadline Hollywood: Its about these two young guys who created a company that changed the world and how the world in turn changed them. The heart of the movie is their wonderful edict: dont be evil.        
	Page and Brin founded Google while they were PhD students at Stanford University in the 1990s. They are now billionaires.

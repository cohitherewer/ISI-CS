	Moscow, Oct. 29: Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin has long cultivated a tough-guy image, whether going shirtless on horseback or tossing aside a foe on the judo mat.        
	But yesterday, after showing up at a news conference with what looked like a black eye, Putin, 58, was engulfed in speculation that he may have met his athletic match, or had a face-lift, or undergone dental surgery, or was just, as his spokesman said, suffering jet lag.        
	The questions started on Wednesday in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, where Putin seemed to have heavy makeup around his eyes in an appearance with that countrys leaders, according to reporters who were there. One Ukrainian publication speculated that he had had plastic surgery, a possibility that was perhaps far-fetched because earlier this week his face had no noticeable blemishes.        
	Even one of Russias most respected independent newspapers, Kommersant, could not help dwelling on the change, especially around Putins left eye.

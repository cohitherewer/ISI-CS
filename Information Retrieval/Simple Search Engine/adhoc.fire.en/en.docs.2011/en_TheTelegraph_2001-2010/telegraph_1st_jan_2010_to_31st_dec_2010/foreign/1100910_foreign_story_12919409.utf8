                          Unfair advances                          
	Los Angeles, Sept. 9 (Reuters): A former bodyguard for Britney Spears filed a sexual harassment lawsuit yesterday, accusing the pop star of repeatedly parading herself around in the nude and having sex in front of him.        
	Fernando Flores also accused Spears, 28, of causing him emotional distress by having violent quarrels with her boyfriend in front of her two children, and swearing at him to fetch her beverages.         
	According to the lawsuit filed in a Los Angeles court, Flores began working for Spears in February 2010. He alleges that the Circus singer made repeated, unwanted sexual advances, summoned him to her room to expose her naked body, and engaged in numerous sex acts in front of him.        
	Celebrity website TMZ.com reported that in one alleged incident, Spears was wearing a white lace see-through dress when she intentionally dropped an object on the floor close to Flores and bent over to pick it up. Flores also accuses his security firm employers of ignoring or mocking his complaints over the alleged actions by Spears.

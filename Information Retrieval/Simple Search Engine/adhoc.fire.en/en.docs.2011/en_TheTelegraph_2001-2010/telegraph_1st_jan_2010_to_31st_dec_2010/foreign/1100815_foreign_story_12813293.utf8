	Sukkur (Pakistan), Aug. 14 (AP): Cholera has surfaced in flood-ravaged Pakistan, the UN confirmed today, adding to the misery of 20 million people made homeless by the disaster, the government said.         
	A fresh surge of floodwater swelled the Indus river, threatening previously spared cities and towns in the south.        
	The UN has appealed for an initial $460 million to provide relief to Pakistan but has said the country will need billions to rebuild once the floodwaters recede.         
	One case of cholera was confirmed in Mingora, the main town in the Swat Valley, UN spokesman Maurizio Giuliano said today. But other cases were suspected, and aid workers are now responding to all those exhibiting acute watery diarrhoea as if it is cholera, Giuliano said.        
	Cholera can lead to severe dehydration and death without prompt treatment, and containing cholera outbreaks is considered a high priority following floods.        
	Because of the flooding, Pakistan cancelled celebrations today marking its creation and independence from Britain in 1947.        
	President Asif Ali Zardari met flood victims in the northwest, and UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon was expected to visit affected regions tomorrow.        
	The floods have killed about 1,500 people, and aid workers have warned that diseases could raise that toll.        
	The Pakistani crisis began in late July, when unusually heavy monsoon rains tore through the country from its mountainous northwest. Hundreds of thousands of homes have been destroyed.        
	Agriculture has been severely hit, with an estimated nearly 700,000 hectares of farmland wiped out. UN officials, citing government figures, previously said about 14 million Pakistanis were directly or indirectly affected.        
	But in a televised address to the nation today, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said 20 million were now homeless. He did not elaborate, and it was unclear how many of those people were briefly forced to leave their homes and how many had lost their houses altogether.        
	Fresh flood waves swelled the Indus river today, threatening nearby cities, towns and villages in southern Sindh province, said a senior meteorologist.

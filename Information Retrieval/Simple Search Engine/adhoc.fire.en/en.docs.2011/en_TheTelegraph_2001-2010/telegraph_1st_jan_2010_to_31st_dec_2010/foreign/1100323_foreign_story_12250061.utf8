The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama wins health battle, loses cause
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama wins health battle, loses cause
          K.P. NAYAR                          Obama at the White House. (AP)                                  
	Washington, March 22: Barack Obama won his biggest political battle since entering the White House last night, but lost his presidential cause.        
	Emerging in the East Room of the White House shortly before midnight at the end of a rare Sunday debate in the US House of Representatives which lasted 10 hours, Obama said of a health care reform bill that he will now sign into law: This isnt radical reform. But it is major reform. This legislation will not fix everything that ails our health care system. But it moves us decisively in the right direction. This is what change looks like.        
	The passage of the 1,990-page, 400,000-word legislation has divided America like seldom before. On the eve of the vote in Congress, Right-wing opponents of the reform bill, shouted nigger at Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a civil rights icon who was nearly beaten to death in Alabama during an anti-segregation march nearly half a century ago.        
	Another member of the Congress was spat upon while Barney Frank, an openly gay member of Congress, was called a faggot by an unruly crowd outside the Capitol Building.        
	The vote split Americas monolithic Catholic church, with bishops urging Congressmen to vote against the bill and nuns defying the bishops and collectively supporting Obamas health care reform.        
	Inside the normally sedate House of Representatives, the scene was no different. When Bart Stupak, who steered a block of fellow anti-abortion Democrats in the final hours of the debate towards a compromise with Obama and secured a majority for the bill got up to speak, a Republican shouted that he was a baby killer.        
	Not a single Republican voted for the bill last night. Thirty four Democrats revolted and went along with the Opposition, giving House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who gambled and risked the Sunday exercise, a wafer-thin majority of three votes more than the 216 that was needed to pass the legislation. Several Democrats are expected to lose their seats in the November election to the House of Representatives because, as of now, Obamas version of health reform is unpopular in many parts of the US, thanks to lies and disinformation spread by opponents of change.        
	The President rationalised last night that I know this wasnt an easy vote for a lot of people. But it was the right vote...Tonight, we answered the call of history.        
	But without the reform bill, many more Democrats would have lost in November, in that case, in Democratic strongholds: the partys base would have abandoned the leadership which came to power in the Congress and in the White House on a promise to reform Americas broken health care.        
	And if the House had voted no last night, Obama would have been crippled for the rest of his presidency.        
	In the end, Obama diluted his presidential cause and gave up on the many promises he made during the campaign, agreeing to a bill crafted by his party in the Senate and in the House of Representatives that reads more like a piece of legislation which the Republicans would have written.

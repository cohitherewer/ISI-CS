The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UN team allowed to visit Lanka
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      UN team allowed to visit Lanka
                            
	Colombo, Dec. 18 (AP): Sri Lanka has backtracked and will now allow a UN team to visit the country and share evidence gathered during an investigation into whether war crimes were committed during the final phase of the islands bloody civil war, a cabinet minister said today.        
	UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon appointed a three-member panel last June to look into alleged human rights abuses during the decades-long war.         
	The Sri Lankan government resisted the move, calling it an infringement of its sovereignty and vowed not to issue visas for the UN team.        
	Human rights groups have repeatedly called for investigations of Sri Lankan troops and the now-defeated Tamil Tiger rebels during the war that ended in May 2009.

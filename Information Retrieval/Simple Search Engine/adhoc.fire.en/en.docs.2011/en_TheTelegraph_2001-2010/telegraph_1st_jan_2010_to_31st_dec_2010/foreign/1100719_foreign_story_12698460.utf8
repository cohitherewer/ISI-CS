The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ban on veil will be   un-British
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Ban on veil will be   un-British
                                  
	London, July 18 (Reuters): Britains parliament should not try to ban the wearing of full-length veils in public, immigration minister Damian Green said after Frances lower house passed a bill which could see Muslim women fined for wearing the burqa.        
	Its very unlikely and it would be undesirable for the British parliament to try and pass a law dictating what people wore, Green told The Sunday Telegraph of the UK.        
	I stand personally on the feeling that telling people what they can and cant wear, if theyre just walking down the street, is a rather un-British thing to do, he added. Were a tolerant society.        
	His comments came as one of his fellow Conservative members of Parliament, Philip Hollobone, said he would refuse to hold meetings with Muslim women unless they removed their face veil.

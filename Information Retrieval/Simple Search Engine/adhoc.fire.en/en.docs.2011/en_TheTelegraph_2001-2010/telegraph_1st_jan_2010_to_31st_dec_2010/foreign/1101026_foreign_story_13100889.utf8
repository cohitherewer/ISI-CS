	Copiapo (Chile), Oct. 25: Jos Ojeda can barely sleep without the comfort of a miner nearby to confide in when dreams shake him awake.         
	Omar Reygadas, a great-grandfather more used to comforting than being comforted, cries easily. And Edison Pea, the miner who kept himself grounded by running miles underground most days, was hospitalised last week for emotional distress.        
	It has been 12 days since viewers around the globe watched, captivated, as one by one the 33 miners trapped in the San Jos mine near here were pulled from nearly half a mile beneath the Atacama Desert. While the world has begun to move on, the men left behind are just starting to grapple with the enormousness of what happened to them. The miners are collectively knows as Los 33        
	They have, so far, remained mostly true to one another and the promises they made to speak only on their own terms. Some details of the mens ordeal have slowly slipped out, as many news organisations vied for their attention.        
	But the men have resisted breaking a pact they made to keep the most gripping details of their two months in captivity to themselves in the hope that together they can secure book or movie deals, as well as build their best case for a lawsuit against the mine. They have held especially close what happened in the first 17 days after the gold and copper mine collapsed, the time before they knew rescuers were still searching for them.        
	In interviews over the past several days with The New York Times, four miners who agreed to speak without pay offered a view into the intense emotional struggles they faced underground, and now above.        
	Reygadas, 56  the 17th miner to be rescued and one of the oldest to have been trapped  spoke the longest, for more than two hours. He said he entered his first mine at 7, with his father, who was a miner. He does not scare easily; he survived two previous collapses at the San Jos mine and narrowly escaped a third that killed another miner. But in the first days after the latest cave-in in August, he said, he cried, rolling over on his damp cardboard bed to face the wall so no one could see.        
	Im not embarrassed to say I cried, but I cried from helplessness, he said. Id be lying if I said I wasnt scared too, but I knew how to keep it inside to avoid sparking fear in others. Reygadas said he was loading his truck just before going to lunch on August 5 when he felt what seemed like an explosion. The pressure from falling rock almost blew out his ears, he said.

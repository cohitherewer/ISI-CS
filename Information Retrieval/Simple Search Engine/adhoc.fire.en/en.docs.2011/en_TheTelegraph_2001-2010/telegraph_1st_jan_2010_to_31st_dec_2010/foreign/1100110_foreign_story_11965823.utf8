                              Legally happy                            
	London, Jan. 9 (PTI): Actress Reese Witherspoon did not shed even a tear after breaking up with actor Jake Gyllenhaal and even enjoyed a lunch with a female friend after the split.         
	 Just a few weeks after the couple ended their three-year romance, the Oscar-winning actress was all smiles as she met a female friend for lunch, reports the Daily Mail. Looking casual in a checked shirt and grey skirt, the 33-year-old actress looked happy as she caught up with a friend over sushi in Los Angeles.         
	Witherspoon had plenty to talk about with her blonde friend as they dined at the Sugar Fish Sushi restaurant, before making a pitstop at the Tavern Cafe for takeaway coffee. With a wide smile across her face, the Legally Blonde star presented her friend with a belated Christmas gift before saying goodbye.

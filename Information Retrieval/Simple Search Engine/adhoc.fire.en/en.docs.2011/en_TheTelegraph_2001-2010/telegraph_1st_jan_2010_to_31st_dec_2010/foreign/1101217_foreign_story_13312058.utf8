                              Blake Edwards: Big heart                            
	Los Angeles, Dec. 16 (AP): Blake Edwards, the director and writer known for clever dialogue, poignance and occasional belly-laugh sight gags in Breakfast at Tiffanys, 10 and the Pink Panther farces, is dead at age 88.        
	Edwards died from complications of pneumonia yesterday morning at St Johns Health Centre in Santa Monica, said publicist Gene Schwam. Blakes wife, Julie Andrews, and other family members were at his side. He had been hospitalised for about two weeks.        
	Edwards had knee problems, had undergone unsuccessful procedures and was pretty much confined to a wheelchair for the last year-and-a-half or two, Schwam said. That conceivably may have contributed to his condition, he added.        
	At the time of his death, Edwards was working on two Broadway musicals, one based on the Pink Panther movies. The other, Big Rosemary, was to be an original comedy set during Prohibition, Schwam said.        
	His heart was as big as his talent. He was an Academy Award winner in all respects, said Schwam, who knew him for 40 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BP tests to check spill
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      BP tests to check spill
          BY MATTHEW BIGG                          Tony Hayward                                  
	New Orleans, July 4 (Reuters): A supertanker adapted to scoop up oil from the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico began tests yesterday amid a report that some major investors expect the energy giant to replace its top executives.        
	The vessel named A Whale and dubbed a super skimmer is operating just north of the blown out well as part of a two-day test watched by the US Coastguard, said Bob Grantham, spokesman for TMT Shipping Offshore, which owns the ship.        
	If all goes to plan, TMT hopes to sign a clean-up contract for the ship, which can remove up to 500,000 barrels (21 million gallons) of oil and water mix from the sea surface a day, according to crew members.        
	Efforts by BP to contain the damage returned to normal after a hurricane and the British company said its oil-capture systems at its leaking well collected or burned off 25,290 barrels of oil during operations on Friday.        
	The storm passed through the spill area off the coast of Louisiana without doing major damage.        
	But the corporate fall-out from the worst offshore oil spill in US history appeared far from over.        
	The Financial Times newspaper reported BP investors expected to see a change in the companys leadership, possibly once the leak is capped, with both chief executive Tony Hayward and chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg in jeopardy.        
	When this is over there will be a full investigation, and we would expect some action to replace the top team, the British newspaper quoted a top 10 UK shareholder as saying in its Saturday edition.        
	Without steps to steady the ship, BP could become a takeover target of companies like ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell or PetroChina, the FT said, citing a source working on BPs strategy. A BP spokesman declined to comment.        
	BPs market capitalisation has shrunk by about $100 billion and its shares have lost more than half their value since the spill began.        
	Company executives have been under intense pressure since an April 20 rig explosion killed 11 workers and unleashed the torrent of oil now threatening wildlife and the tourist and fishing industries in the Gulf region.        
	The Obama administration has also criticised the companys response to the crisis, now in its 75th day.        
	The US Interior Department, one of the depart- ments spearheading Washingtons response to the spill, could issue a revised offshore oil drilling moratorium for US waters in the coming week.        
	A federal court last week lifted a six-month drilling ban imposed by the Obama administration as a result of the spill. The new moratorium is expected to be more flexible and could be adjusted to allow drilling in certain subsea fields.        
	In a related development, a US presidential panel to probe the cause of the spill and recommend new rules to prevent future disasters will hold its first public meeting in New Orleans on July 12 and 13, its co-chairs said on Saturday.

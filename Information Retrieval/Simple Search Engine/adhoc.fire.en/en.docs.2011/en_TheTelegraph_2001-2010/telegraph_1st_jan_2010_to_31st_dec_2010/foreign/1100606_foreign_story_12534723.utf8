The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Venice sells heritage to plug cash black hole

	Rome, June 5: They are as integral a part of Venice as its gondoliers and canals, but the lagoon city is being forced to sell off dozens of historic palazzos in order to bolster fast-diminishing funds.        
	Magnificent mansions, embellished with gothic arches and carved stone balconies, are being sold to the highest bidder, with the majority being turned into hotels. Several of them look directly on to the Grand Canal, the historic waterway which winds through the heart of what was once known as La Serenissima (The Most Serene).        
	However, preservation groups say that converting so many palaces into hotels does not make economic sense because Venices existing hotels are struggling to fill their rooms. The trend risks turning the city into even more of a tourist ghetto, devoid of other economic activity.        
	Between 2000 and 2007, more than 40 new hotels opened in Venice, and the number of private homes converted into budget bed and breakfasts rose by more than 1,000 per cent, creating an over-supply of accommodation. Selling off the palaces is an ad hoc strategy driven by panic, said Anna Somers Cocks, the chairman of the UK-based Venice In Peril Fund. Its like auctioning the family silver instead of sorting out your estate.        
	Its very recent  its all happened in the last five years or so. We think it would be much better to offer some of the palazzos to research institutes, for instance.         
	That would bring in a much wider variety of people. Otherwise you end up with a dislocated city, devoted only to tourism.        
	 Venices council says the sale of the palazzos reflects harsh economic reality, as the city tries to adapt to a sharp fall in its public finances.        
	Earnings from the council-owned casino, near the world famous Rialto Bridge, which provides the city with a quarter of its annual income, are significantly down because high-rollers have been hit by the global economic crisis.

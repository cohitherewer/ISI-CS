	July 23: Orlando Bloom, the British actor, has married Miranda Kerr, an Australian supermodel, in a secret ceremony, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The couple have been dating since 2007 and only announced their engagement one month ago. A spokesman for Kerr said that she was on honeymoon with Bloom, who has appeared in Pirates of the Caribbean and Lord of the Rings, but did not confirm exactly when they were married. It is thought the wedding took place in Los Angeles.    
	Darth raider    
	Setauket, New York (AP): A man in a Darth Vader mask at a bank has entered the dark side. Police say the man entered a Chase bank branch on Long Island on Thursday, displayed a gun and demanded money. A surveillance camera caught the thief wearing a blue cape and camouflage pants. The bandit escaped from the bank with an undetermined amount of cash.

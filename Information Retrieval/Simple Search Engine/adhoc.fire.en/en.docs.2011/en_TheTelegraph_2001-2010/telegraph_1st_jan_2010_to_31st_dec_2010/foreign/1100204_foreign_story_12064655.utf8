                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      37 detained over Rajapaksa plot
                              Nervous                            
	Colombo, Feb. 3 (PTI): Sri Lankan authorities are questioning 37 persons, including a brigadier, a colonel and some army deserters, who were detained for their alleged role in a plot to assassinate President Mahinda Rajapaksa.        
	More information has surfaced in the bid to assassinate the President during the elections, Lankan newspaper, the Daily News, reported today in its online edition, quoting defence sources. It is learnt that there were plans to assassinate the President and his family members after the final result of the election was announced by the commissioner, the paper said.        
	Rajapaksa secured a landslide victory, defeating his former army chief Sarath Fonseka in the January 26 poll with a 17 percentage point margin, according to official results.         
	Since the day after the election, the government has made increasing allegations that Fonseka and his supporters may have been plotting a coup. Troops surrounded the hotel where Fonseka stayed on election night, in what the military said was a dragnet to arrest army deserters with him it believed may be plotting the coup.        
	A Special Police Squad, led by a senior DIG, detained the suspects under Emergency Regulations.        
	The paper said 23 former military members of Fonsekas staff were taken into custody after the police raided his office in Colombo on Saturday.        
	According to investigators, arms and cash found in a Colombo temple were taken there from the former army chiefs office. The police have also taken two Tamils into custody in connection with supplying arms which were found in the temple, the paper said.        
	Top Opposition leaders also visited the hotel when Fonseka was staying there.        
	Opposition protest        
	Thousands of Opposition supporters took to Colombos streets today to protest the results of the presidential election, which they say was marred by fraud.        
	The Opposition says the vote was rigged and has said it will mount a court challenge. After the street rally, protesters gathered in a field in central Colombo to listen to speeches from Opposition politicians.        
	 Election protests are rare in this island nation, but the demonstration reflected the bitter nature of a presidential campaign that pitted former allies against one other.        
	The President is not behaving like someone who has won the election with such a big majority, Fonseka told the flag-waving and cheering crowd.         
	His actions and his retribution on opponents suggests that he is nervous.        
	Fonseka today lodged a complaint with the Lankan election chief claiming that burnt polling cards had been discovered at some places.        
	The differences in numbers seen at the counting centres and those that were received in Colombo are a major concern, Fonsekas secretary Seneka De Silva told the Daily Mirror.        
	The Island newspaper said detectives are also probing whether there was an alleged plot to cause mayhem on the day after the polls.        
	However, the Lankan elections chief today rejected the fraud allegations. I reject all analysis about the releasing of the results. I worked 37 hours continuously in my office on the day of elections, commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake said today.

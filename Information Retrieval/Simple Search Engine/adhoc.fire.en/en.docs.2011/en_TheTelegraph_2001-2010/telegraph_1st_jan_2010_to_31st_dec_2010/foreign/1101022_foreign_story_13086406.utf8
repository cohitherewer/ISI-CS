The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lords suspend Paul and peers
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lords suspend Paul and peers
                            
	Oct. 21: The peers Manzila Pola Uddin, Swraj Paul and Amirali Alibhai Bhatia have been given lengthy suspensions from the House of Lords after wrongly claiming thousands of pounds in expenses.        
	They were suspended after the upper chamber approved the damning judgments on their expenses claims by the Privileges and Conduct Committee.        
	Uddin was suspended until the end of the parliamentary session in 2012 and told to repay 125,349.10. Bhatia was sidelined for eight months and has already repaid more than 27,000. Paul was suspended for four months and has already returned 41,982.        
	The sanctions are the toughest imposed on misbehaving members for more than 300 years.        
	Uddin and Bhatia were found to have acted not in good faith by incorrectly declaring their main homes in order to claim generous overnight allowances.        
	An initial investigation decided that Paul had also acted not in good faith in his home designations.        
	However, the committee rejected this finding on appeal, accepting that although utterly unreasonable and negligent, he had not been dishonest and had already returned 41,982 last year.        
	In Uddin and Bhatias cases, the sanctions are significantly heavier than those meted out to Labour members Truscott and Taylor of Blackburn after a political lobbying scandal last year.        
	The pair were excluded for around six months and became the first to be suspended from the upper house since the 17th century. The expenses abuses centre around the allowance of 174 a day that was, until recently, available to peers whose main home was outside the M25.        
	Uddin claimed more than 100,000 between 2005 and 2010 by stating that her main residence was a small flat in Maidstone, Kent, rather than her family home in east London.        
	Bhatia had claimed 27,446 in expenses on the basis that his main home was a small flat occupied by his brother in Reigate, Surrey, even though he and his wife were listed on the electoral roll at their long-standing address in Hampton, southwest London. Paul, a steel magnate and one of Britains wealthiest men, lived in London but designated a one-bedroom flat in an Oxfordshire hotel that he owned as his main home.         
	All three also claimed travel expenses.         
	A Labour Party spokesman confirmed that Paul had resigned his membership, while Uddin had been suspended amid moves to expel her.        
	Speaking to NDTV tonight, Paul said that the committee recommended his suspension despite finding that he had not acted dishonestly or in bad faith in claiming certain allowances.         
	The Lords have said, the Privileges Committee, there was no bad faith, there was no dishonesty. It was an error. I paid the money almost twice as much than they were supposed to have complained.

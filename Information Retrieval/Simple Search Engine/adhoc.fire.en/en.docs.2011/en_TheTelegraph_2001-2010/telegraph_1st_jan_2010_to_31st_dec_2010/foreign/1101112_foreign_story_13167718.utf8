                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      PwC staff rate female colleagues in email
          PETER HUTCHISON                              
	London, Nov. 11: PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of Britains largest accountancy firms, has launched an investigation after male staff at one of its branches in Ireland were found circulating emails where they rated the attractiveness of their female colleagues.        
	The emails, which were sent between up to 17 male staff at PwCs Dublin office, included pictures of 13 women who had recently joined the company.        
	In the emails the male employees were asked to nominate their top ten women based on looks.        
	The women, whose pictures were accompanied by their names and departments, all recently joined the accountancy firm as trainee accountants or associates.        
	After being sent amongst PwC staff the emails were forwarded on to workers at other businesses and went viral across the Internet.        
	It is thought that the source of the original email, which had a subject line of this would be my shortlist for the top 10, has been traced.        
	The company were alerted to the emails by the Irish Independent newspaper and launched an investigation.        
	Carmel Connor, PwCs human resources partner, told the paper: We are taking this matter extremely seriously and are launching a full investigation. We will take all necessary steps and actions in line with our firms polices and procedures.        
	She added that the company had not yet contacted the men involved and refused to say whether they would be sacked.         
	PwC is the second biggest accountancy firm in the world.        
	Earlier this year an accountant at one of the so-called Big Four gained global celebrity after sending a scathing email to colleagues when he lost his job.        
	A woman suing her former company for alleged sex discrimination has told an employment tribunal how her boss allegedly chased a female colleague around their office before spanking her across his knee.        
	Angelina Ashby, 40, who worked for the Chesterfield based marine supplies firm, Cathelco, also accused sales manager Peter Smith of sitting female staff on his knee, viewing sex toys and blow up dolls on the Internet.

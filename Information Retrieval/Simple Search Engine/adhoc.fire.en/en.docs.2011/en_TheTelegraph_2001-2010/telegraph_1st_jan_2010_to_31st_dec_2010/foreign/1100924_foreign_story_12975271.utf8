The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cherie attacks executives for being sexist
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Cherie attacks executives for being sexist
                              Token women                            
	Sept. 23: Cherie Blair has attacked men from some of the worlds biggest companies for their treatment of female employees, accusing them of putting token women on their boards.        
	Speaking at a lunch at the UN summit in New York, Cherie Blair surprised onlookers by turning a talk on women in poor countries into a critique of the corporate guests.        
	She told international executives in America to deal with the injustices they deal women in their own back yard before telling developing countries what to do.        
	 The wife of the former Prime Minister, who is a leading barrister, had to be asked to stop talking after exceeding her allotted three minutes by another 70 seconds.        
	She told executives from Coca-Cola, GlaxSmithKline, Sony and dozens of other companies that it is not just about the private sector helping the developing world to empower women.        
	Because the women who work in your organisations would give a hollow laugh if you go back and say: Oh, we believe in empowering women in the developing world and helping women, Cherie Blair said.        
	In fact, on your boards you have no women, or you just have token women, and in your senior management and in your middle management, women are not given the access to equal pay, equal opportunity and are not truly valued.        
	So the private sector, if theyre concerned about this, they have to begin in their own backyard.        
	Among the other 83 guests at the lunch were Nick Clegg, the deputy Prime Minister, and Bob Geldof, the anti-poverty campaigner. While Cleggs table discussed education, Geldofs spoke about combating poverty and hunger.        
	Guests were served a complimentary lunch of chicken palliard with roasted vegetables and gruyere cheese, served on a bed of mixed greens, candy walnuts and crumbled Boursin cheese drizzled in a raspberry vinegarette.        
	For dessert, they were served flourless chocolate cake with wild berry coulis.        
	Quran burning         
	British police say they have arrested six men on suspicion of stirring racial hatred after they posted a video on the Internet in which they appear to burn two Qurans on September 11.        
	Northumbria police say the men posted bail and were released.        
	They will face further court hearings for their actions in the town of Gateshead in northern England, police said in a statement.        
	The arrests were made public today. Police said two men were arrested on September 15 and four on September 22. Police would not say how much bail was required.        
	The arrests follow a controversy that started when a Florida pastor said he would burn a Quran on the anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks.

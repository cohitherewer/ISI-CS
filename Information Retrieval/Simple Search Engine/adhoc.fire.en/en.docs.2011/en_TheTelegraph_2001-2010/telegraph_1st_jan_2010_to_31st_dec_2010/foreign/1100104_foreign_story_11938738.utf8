                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Antonia reveals her life with Pinter
          PATRICK SAWER                           Harold Pinter                                 
	London, Jan. 3: Harold Pinters widow Antonia Fraser will reveal intimate details of her life with the playwright for the first time.         
	The writer and historian, who has until now jealously guarded her privacy, is publishing a memoir of her marriage to Pinter, who died of cancer on Christmas Eve 2008.         
	Fraser has drawn heavily on her diaries to write the memoir, Must You Go? My Life with Harold Pinter, which will be published on January 11.         
	In it she tells how she first met Pinter  across a crowded room, but it was lunchtime, not some enchanted evening  and how their relationship was sealed when, in 1975, she invited him in after he gave her a lift home from a dinner party.         
	He stayed until six in the morning, with extraordinary recklessness, she writes.         
	Although Fraser, who had been married to Conservative MP Hugh Fraser, accepted Pinters proposal of marriage in June 1975, it was another five years before he managed to obtain a divorce from his first wife, Vivien Merchant.         
	She writes: Harold and I belonged to the same class. I will call it the Bohemian class.         
	Shortly before he died in his hospital room  as she was reading Leo Tolstoys Resurrection next to him  they agreed to be eventually buried side by side in Kensal Green cemetery, in northwest London.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama boosts Muslim ties

	Jakarta, Nov. 9 (Reuters): President Barack Obama said today that Washingtons effort to reach out to the Muslim world was earnest and would help improve US security, although he acknowledged that there was still more work to do.        
	Obama arrived today on a twice-postponed trip to Indonesia, the worlds most populous majority-Muslim state. Before leaving tomorrow, he plans a major speech reaching out to the Muslim world that would tout Indonesia as an example of an emerging democracy and tolerant society.        
	With respect to outreach to the Muslim world, I think that our efforts have been earnest and sustained, he said at a joint news conference with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.        
	We dont expect that we are going to completely eliminate some of the misunderstandings and mistrust that have developed over a long period of time, but we do think that were on the right path.        
	Obama still enjoys strong support in Indonesia, even as confidence in him has dropped in other Muslim states since he made a first major speech in Cairo in June 2009 reaching out to the Muslim world.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Volcano kills its spiritual caretaker 
                          Maridjan: Time to die                    
	Mount Merapi (Indonesia), Oct. 28 (AP): For 23 years, Maridjan spoke to Mount Merapi, appeasing its unpredictable spirits by throwing offerings of rice, clothes and chickens into the volcanos gaping crater.        
	Many villagers took his word  not that of government officials or seismologists  as the last on when it would erupt. And the 83-year-old did appear to predict the volcanos latest eruption  which killed 33 people this week  but did not heed the warning himself.        
	As Merapi began spewing 1,000 degree Celsius gases and thousands of villagers streamed down the mountains slopes, Maridjan refused to budge. His rigid body was found yesterday, prostrate on the ground in the typical Islamic prayer position and caked in heavy white soot.        
	Today, high-profile politicians, soap opera stars, singers and hundreds of family and followers flocked to this funeral on the slopes of the mountain that had been entrusted to his care by a late king.         
	Televisions crews and reporters added to the chaos, jostling for position, as family and friends tried to say their last goodbyes. I never thought he was going to leave us in such a way, said Prabukusumo, the brother of the sultan in the nearby court city of Yogyakarta who now tasked with choosing his successor. Hes lived through so many, much bigger eruptions. Im still in shock.        
	 But a friend said Maridjan seemed to be expecting his death.When asked by his close friend, Wansafyudin, days before the eruption if it might not be better to leave, he refused, according to the English-language Jakarta Globe newspaper.        
	My time to die in this place has almost come, he reportedly said. Indonesia, the worlds largest archipelago, is located on the so-called Ring of Fire, a series of fault lines that are prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity.

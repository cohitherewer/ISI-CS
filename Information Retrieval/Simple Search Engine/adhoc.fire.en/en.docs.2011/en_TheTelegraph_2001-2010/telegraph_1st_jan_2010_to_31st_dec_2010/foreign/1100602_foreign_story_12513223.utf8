The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | American computer is worlds fastest
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      American computer is worlds fastest
                                  
	June 1: The Jaguar, an American computer that can perform as many calculations in a day as a normal computer can in 100 years, has been crowned as the worlds fastest supercomputer.        
	The Jaguar, built by the Cray company and housed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, has a top speed of 1.75 petaflops per second, according to a bi-annual top 500 supercomputer survey. A petaflop is equivalent to 1,000 trillion calculations.        
	The $120 million Jaguar has been used by scientists to simulate the explosion of stars, the flow of uranium into the Columbia river from ageing underground storage facilities, and the effects of climate change.        
	The US is home to around half the supercomputers on the top 500 list, which was published at the International Supercomputing Conference in Hamburg, Germany. However, China, which has unabashed ambitions to build the worlds fastest computer, now has 24 of the worlds fastest machines.

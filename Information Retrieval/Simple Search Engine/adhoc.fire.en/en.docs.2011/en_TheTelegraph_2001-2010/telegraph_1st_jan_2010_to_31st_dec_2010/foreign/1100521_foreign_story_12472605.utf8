	Washington, May 20 (Reuters): Researchers trying to make synthetic life in the lab have booted up a hollowed-out bacterium using a human-made genome in a major step towards making synthetic life.        
	They hope to use their stripped-down version of a bacterium to eventually engineer custom-made microbes.        
	This is the first synthetic cell thats been made, and we call it synthetic because the cell is totally derived from a synthetic chromosome, made with four bottles of chemicals on a chemical synthesizer, starting with information in a computer, said genome pioneer Craig Venter, who led the research.        
	This is the first self-replicating species that we have had on the planet whose parent is a computer, he added.        
	Venter has said he would like to try to make bacteria to produce fuel, to design algae that can vacuum up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and to use in making better vaccines.        
	This becomes a very powerful tool for trying to design what we want biology to do, Venter said at a news conference.        
	Reporting in the journal Science, Venters team said they worked with a synthetic version of the DNA from a small bacterium called Mycoplasma mycoides transplanted into another germ called Mycoplasma capricolum, which had most of its insides removed.        
	After many false starts, the new microbe came to life and began replicating in the lab dish.

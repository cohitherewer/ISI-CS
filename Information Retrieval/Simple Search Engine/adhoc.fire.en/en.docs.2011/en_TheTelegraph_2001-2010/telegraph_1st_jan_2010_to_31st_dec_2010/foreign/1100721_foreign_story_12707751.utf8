The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Playboy launches work-safe website
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Playboy launches work-safe website
                              Playboys new website on display at the company offices in Chicago. (AP)                            
	Chicago, July 20 (AP): Playboy Enterprises Inc. launched a website today that it swears will be safe to browse while at work, eliminating the need for men to throw themselves over their computer screen when the boss walks by.        
	TheSmokingJacket.com will contain none of the nudity that makes Playboy.com NSFW not suitable for work. Instead, it will rely on humour to reach Playboys target audience, men 25 to 34 years old, when they are most likely to be in front of a computer screen.        
	A lot of our audience logs on (to Playboy.com) after work and we saw that we were missing a golden opportunity to reach guys when theyre online the most: when theyre sitting at their desk, not working, sending emails to their friends, said Jimmy Jellinek, Playboys editorial director.        
	The site, named after one of Playboy founder Hugh Hefners favourite pieces of clothing (silkpajamas.com was taken), wont include the long interviews or in-depth articles found in Playboy.        
	Instead, its meant to be decidedly un-serious. Or, in the parlance of its audience, ROFL  rolling on the floor, laughing. Among the original content visitors to the site will see is a list of signs that show a man has given up trying to attract women.

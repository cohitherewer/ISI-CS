                              LIKE SUMMER                            
	Los Angeles, Sept. 1 (PTI): Actress Demi Moore may be close to touching 50, but she proved that she still has a figure to die for by posting a series of pictures of herself in a bikini on Twitter.        
	Moore, 47, posed provocatively in her bathroom wearing a bikini, using her iPhone to take the photographs at the Los Angeles home she shares with husband Ashton Kutcher, 32. Maybe this is more like summer, wrote the actress on her Twitter page.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China axe on riot-zone boss
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China axe on riot-zone boss
                            
	Beijing, April 24 (PTI): Chinas Communist Party today replaced the chief of the restive Xinjiang region, accused of pursuing hard-line policies against Uyghur Muslims, in a major administrative shuffle in the province where 200 people were killed in communal clashes last year.        
	Wang Lequan, the unpopular provincial party chief of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, has been replaced by Zhang Chunxian, a moderate.        
	Observers say Wangs hard-line policies against the ethnic Uyghur majority had led to the riots last July. No immediate reason was given for replacing the 65-year-old Wang, who served as the party boss in Xinjiang for 15 years.        
	The outgoing provincial chief, regarded as a loyalist of President Hu Jintao, has been made deputy secretary of the powerful political and legislative affairs committee of the Communist Party of Chinas central committee, which oversees the top administrative apparatus in the country.        
	The hard-line policies pursued by Wang, a Han, against Uyghurs, included his emphasis on teaching the Chinese language and a ban on civil servants sporting beards and wearing headscarves. These steps, observers said, were resented by residents, aggravating their discontent against the dispensation. Wang began a crackdown on Uygur separatists in 1997.        
	He was initially credited with the development of the provinces economy, in particular the oil industry, encouraging the settlement of Han workers from elsewhere in China.        
	Since last year, Hans too held demonstrations against him for his failure to contain the riots and demanded his recall, urging the government to provide better security in the aftermath of the riots that were followed by a spate of assaults using hypodermic needles.

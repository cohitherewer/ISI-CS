The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Berry is no fun, says Obama
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Berry is no fun, says Obama
                            
	Washington, July 30 (AFP): Barack Obama fought hard to keep his BlackBerry when he became President.        
	However, with only 10 people authorised to email the super-encrypted device, he admitted today that it is no fun. Obama also demonstrated a passing knowledge of popular culture in the first-ever appearance by a sitting President on a day-time television talk show.        
	He said that only 10 people have the address of his BlackBerry and the conversation is a bit stilted because messages will likely be archived. Ive got to admit, its no fun because they think that its probably going to be subject to the presidential records act, so nobody wants to send me the real juicy stuff, Obama said.

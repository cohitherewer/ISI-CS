	Los Angeles, March 19 (Reuters): Actress Sandra Bullocks husband yesterday broke his silence on reports that he cheated on his wife.        
	He told People magazine that he used poor judgment and asked his family to forgive me.        
	Jesse James, a custom motorcycle manufacturer and reality TV star who married Bullock five years ago, said he took responsibility for his actions but stopped short of admitting that he had an affair with another woman.         
	This has caused my wife and kids pain and embarrassment beyond comprehension and I am extremely saddened to have brought this on them. I am truly very sorry for the grief I have caused them.

	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Astronomers have discovered the first potentially habitable planet outside the solar system after 11 years of observations punctuated by at least two false alerts.         
	A six-member team of astronomers in the US today announced their discovery of a planet that lies in its stars habitable zone where temperatures appear to be just right to support liquid water on or near its surface.         
	The planet, named Gliese 581g, orbits a red dwarf star only 20 light years from the Sun and appears to be part of a star system with six planets, the astronomers said in a paper accepted by The Astrophysical Journal.         
	Scientists have detected nearly 500 extrasolar planets since the mid-1990s, and many of these are small and have rocky surfaces like Earth. But all are either too close or too far from their stars.         
	What separates 581g from other extrasolar planets is the fact that it is Earth-like, and it orbits its star in the middle of its habitable zone, said Nader Haghighipour, a team member at the University of Hawaii-Manoa.         
	There are several lines of evidence that point to the possibility that 581g may be habitable, Haghighipour told The Telegraph. The planet has a size and mass similar to that of Earth, it has a large enough gravity to hold on to an atmosphere just as Earth and its average surface temperature is between minus 31 degrees Celsius to minus 12 degrees Celsius.         
	Astronomers said the finding appears particularly significant because the star is close to the Sun, and the planet was detected within a few years of high precision scans of the sky.        
	If the local stellar neighbourhood is a representative sample of the galaxy as a whole, our Milky Way could be teeming with potentially habitable planets, the team wrote in their paper. The six planet system has structural similarities with the solar system.         
	A tight inner clutch of planets and a much more distant outer planet is in some respects eerily reminiscent of the solar system and its own inner clutch of terrestrial planets and distant Jupiter, the astronomers said.         
	Earlier studies by astronomers in Europe and the US had revealed four planets orbiting the red dwarf star, their orbital periods from three to 67 days. The new study has added two planets  Gliese 581g with an orbital period of 37 days, and another planet much farther away with an orbital period of 433 days.         
	We had planets on both sides of the habitable zone -- one too hot and one too cold -- and now we have [a planet] in the middle that is just right, quot; said Steven Vogt, a team member at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

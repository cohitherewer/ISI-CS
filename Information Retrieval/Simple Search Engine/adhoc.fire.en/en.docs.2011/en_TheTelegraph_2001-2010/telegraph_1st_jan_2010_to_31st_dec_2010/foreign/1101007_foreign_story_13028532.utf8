The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US sorry for attack on Pak soldiers
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US sorry for attack on Pak soldiers

	Islamabad, Oct. 6 (AP): The US apologised today for a recent helicopter attack that killed two Pakistani soldiers at an outpost near the Afghan border, saying American pilots mistook the soldiers for insurgents they were pursuing.        
	The apology, which came after the conclusion of a joint investigation, could pave the way for Pakistan to re-open a key border crossing that Nato uses to ship goods into landlocked Afghanistan. Pakistan closed the crossing in apparent reaction to the September 30 incident.        
	We extend our deepest apology to Pakistan and the families of the Frontier Scouts who were killed and injured, said the US ambassador to Pakistan, Anne Patterson.        
	Pakistan initially reported that three soldiers were killed and three injured in the attack, but one of the soldiers who was critically injured and initially reported dead ended up surviving, said Major Fazlur Rehman, the spokesman for the Frontier Corps.         
	Pakistani soldiers fired at the two US helicopters prior to the attack, a move the investigation team said was likely meant to notify the aircraft of their presence after they passed into Pakistani airspace several times.

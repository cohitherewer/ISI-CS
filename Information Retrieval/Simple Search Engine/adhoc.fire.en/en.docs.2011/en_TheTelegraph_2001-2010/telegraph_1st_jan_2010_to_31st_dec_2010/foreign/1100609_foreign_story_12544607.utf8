The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hundreds watch as Pak Taliban execute man
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Hundreds watch as Pak Taliban execute man
                                  
	Dera Ismail Khan (Pakistan), June 8 (AP): The Pakistani Taliban staged a public execution in front of hundreds of tribesmen in the countrys northwest today after an Islamic court convicted the man of killing two brothers, intelligence officials and a local resident said.        
	The execution illustrated the level of militant control in North Waziristan, a tribal area along the Afghan border. Many Islamist militants use North Waziristan as a base to launch attacks against Nato troops in Afghanistan.        
	The man who was executed today was caught by the Taliban minutes after he killed the brothers two weeks ago in Miran Shah, the main town in North Waziristan, said intelligence officials.        
	A Taliban court convicted him of murder and sentenced him to death, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media.        
	 After the ruling, the Taliban paraded the man on to a soccer field in Miran Shah surrounded by hundreds of tribesmen, said local resident Khan Ameer. As the Taliban watched, a brother of the slain men shot the convicted murderer six times, he said. Taliban in both Pakistan and Afghanistan enforce a strict form of Islamic law and often carry out public executions to demonstrate their power.        
	The Pakistani government has launched several offensives in the northwest to counter Taliban control. But it has been reluctant to target North Waziristan, saying the military is already stretched thin by ongoing operations.        
	Many analysts suspect the government is also hesitant because it doesnt want to cross Afghan Taliban fighters in the area.

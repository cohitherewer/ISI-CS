	Kansas City, July 4 (AP): When Brian Maupin made two snarky online videos poking fun at zealots of the iPhone and the Evo phone, he thought it was just a good way to vent some of the frustrations inherent in selling smart phones.        
	His employer, Best Buy, thought otherwise, even though the retailer, which sells both phones, isnt mentioned in either video.        
	Maupin, whos been selling phones at a Best Buy store in Independence since 2007, said he was suspended from his part-time job after posting two YouTube videos that slam fans of Apple Incs iPhone 4 and HTC Corps Evo 4G.        
	Maupin, 25, said he was told on Thursday he had a choice to either quit or the HR people can decide what they want to do. He said he would not quit and was told he could be fired over the matter.        
	The flap arose after Best Buy found out about two short animated videos Maupin made. The videos depict a Phone Mart salesman extolling the virtues of the Evo to an iPhone devotee, who cant be talked out of the decision to buy an iPhone.         
	The salesman, using loads of expletives, continues to try to show the Evo as a superior product. I dont care, the iPhone wonk says repeatedly. That video has so far gotten more than 1.6 million views.        
	Maupin said the company was also upset by earlier videos he had made pointing out some of the travails that come with selling small electronics. Those videos did mention Best Buy, but Maupin said he has taken them down after the company complained.

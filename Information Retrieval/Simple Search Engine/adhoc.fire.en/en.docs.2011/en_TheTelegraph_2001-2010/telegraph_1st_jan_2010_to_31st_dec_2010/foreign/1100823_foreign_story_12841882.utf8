	Sarajevo, Aug. 22 (Agencies): Hollywood star Angelina Jolie said after a visit to Sarajevo on Saturday she would soon start work on a love story set during the 1992-95 Bosnian War.         
	Jolie said in a statement issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), for whom she is a Goodwill Ambassador, that shooting for the movie would begin in autumn on the tale of a couple who meet on the eve of the war and the effect it has on their relationship.        
	The film is a love story, not a political statement, the statement said.        
	Jolie arrived on Friday for a surprise visit to Sarajevo and on Saturday met members of Bosnias inter-ethnic presidency to discuss ways to help thousands of returning war refugees.        
	Jolie visited returnees in eastern Bosnia in April with her partner Brad Pitt and promised then to come back.        
	She also said the movies cast would comprise actors from the various ethnicities of the former Yugoslavia.        
	I would like to involve as many local people as possible and learn as much as I can, Jolie said.        
	During her visit, Jolie met Haris Silajdzic, chairman of Bosnias three-member Presidency, and asked about ideas for projects she could support and both concluded that the absolute priority is education.

	Scarlett album    
	 Los Angeles, May 6 (PTI): After her first two albums, actress Scarlett Johansson is keen on a third and wants to make some original music now.       
	Johansson, 25, who has already released two albums, Anywhere I Lay My Head and Break Up, insisted that a third is on the cards because she had such fun making the two previous ones, reports MTV. I would love to do another album. The spirit has not moved yet in that direction, but I would never put that idea out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Academic: Austens prose may not be hers after all
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Academic: Austens prose may not be hers after all
          ANITA SINGH                          Actress Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen in a scene from Becoming Jane                                  
	Oct. 23: She is the great English novelist renowned for her polished prose, of whom it was once remarked: Everything came finished from her pen. Yet Jane Austen could not spell, had no grasp of punctuation and her writing betrayed an accent straight out of The Archers, according to an Oxford University academic.        
	Prof. Kathryn Sutherland said analysis of Austens handwritten letters and manuscripts reveal that her finished novels owed as much to the intervention of her editor as to the genius of the author.        
	 Page after page was written without paragraphs, including the sparkling dialogue for which Austen is known. The manuscript for Persuasion, the only one of her novels to survive in its unedited form, looks very different from the finished product.        
	The reputation of no other English novelist rests so firmly on the issue of style, on the poise and emphasis of sentence and phrase, captured in precisely weighed punctuation. But in reading the manuscripts it quickly becomes clear that this delicate precision is missing.        
	This suggests somebody else was heavily involved in the editing process between manuscript and printed book, Prof. Sutherland said.        
	The editor in question is believed to have been William Gifford, a poet and critic who worked for Austens second publisher, John Murray.        
	Gifford was a classical scholar known for being quite a pedant. He took Austens English and turned it into something different  an almost Johnsonian, formal style, Prof Sutherland said.        
	Austen broke many of the rules for writing good English. Her words were jumbled together and there was a level of eccentricity in her spelling  what we would call wrong.        
	She has this reputation for clear and elegant English but her writing was actually more interesting than that. She was a more experimental writer than we give her credit for. Her exchanges between characters dont separate out one speaker from another, but that can heighten the drama of a scene.        
	It was closer to the style of Virginia Woolf. She was very much ahead of her time.        
	Amongst Austens grammatical misdemeanours was an inability to master the i before e rule. Her manuscripts are littered with distant veiws and characters who recieve guests.        
	Elsewhere, she wrote tomatoes as tomatas and arraroot for arrowroot  peculiarities of spelling that reflect Austens regional accent, Prof. Sutherland explained.         
	In some of her writing, her Hampshire accent is very strong. She had an Archers-like voice with a definite Hampshire burr.         
	Over 1,000 of these handwritten pages will be placed online from Monday as the culmination of a three-year project led by Prof. Sutherland in collaboration with the Bodleian Libraries, Kings College London and the British Library.         
	The collection reunites the letters and manuscripts for the first time since 1845, when they were scattered by the terms of her sister Cassandras will.        
	 They range from fiction written in early childhood to the manuscript for Sanditon, the novel that Austen was writing when she died in 1817.         
	Sadly, the manuscripts for Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Emma, her most famous novels, were destroyed after being set in print.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Passengers left in limbo

  - Huge backlog of cancelled flights at NY airports        J. DAVID GOODMAN                          Jason Wulkowicz and his five-year-old daughter Louisa go sledding in Central Park, New York. (AFP)                                        
	Dec. 28: Buried beneath white powder for more than 24 hours, New York area airports turned today to the growing backlog of cancelled flights, an accumulation that could take far longer to address than the snow itself.         
	Even as flights resumed, ripple effects from over 4,000 cancelled flights threatened to leave passengers stranded till the New Year.         
	The departure boards were full of woe for holiday travellers as airlines struggled with de-icing planes, clearing gate areas of snow and staffing ticket counters. Many domestic flights were cancelled or delayed today and international service was limited.         
	We have arrivals, we have departures, but were still looking at a lot of cancellations, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It could take days to clear because you had two days of no flights.         
	A limited number of planes took off from La Guardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport last evening, though flights into and out of Newark Liberty International Airport did not resume until this morning. The rare extended shutdown of all three area airports stranded many passengers, although because airports were closed and flights cancelled rather than delayed, many avoided being stuck in terminals.         
	Still, more than 1,400 people spent the night in airports, the majority in JFK, according to the Port Authority.         
	Flights are going out at a much slower pace than normal and there are crew availability issues as well, said Allison Steinberg, a spokeswoman for JetBlue Airways. Our goal is to resume as normal as possible by tomorrow. Were doing all that we can.         
	The trouble for airlines lies in finding new flights for delayed passengers. Airlines were running at record levels of capacity even before Sundays storm blanketed the city with 51cm of snow during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.         
	Through the first nine months of the year, domestic flights were fuller than at any similar period since the department of transportation began tracking.         
	With airlines flying fights so full, finding available space on new flights into and out of New Yorks airports for nearly two days worth of passengers could take the better part of the next week.         
	Ground transportation to and from all three airports was improving as most major roads were cleared overnight, though bus service remained limited and many streets, especially outside Manhattan, were still impassible. Airport employees reported much slower commutes.         
	The AirTrain shuttle from Kennedy to the subway was out of service, though the Port Authority said it was working to replace the route with bus service.         
	New Jersey Transit officials said they would operate rail service on a holiday schedule today. Amtrak resumed limited service along the northeast corridor from Boston to Washington, which includes a stop at Newark International.         
	But as Gomez discovered, getting to the airport, while still difficult, is only the first of many difficulties.         
	It was just very uncomfortable to camp at an airport, he said. Every single time I try to get a cot, theyre all sold out. The 19-year-old said he had eaten very little because the food in the terminal is expensive and he is on a budget.

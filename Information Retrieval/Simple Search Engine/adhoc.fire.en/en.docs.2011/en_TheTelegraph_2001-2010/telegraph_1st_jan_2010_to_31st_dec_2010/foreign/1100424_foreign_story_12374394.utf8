The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Roman has to return to US: Court
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Roman has to return to US: Court
                            
	Los Angeles, April 22: (Reuters): Oscar-winning film director Roman Polanski has lost his latest bid to be sentenced while outside the US for having unlawful sex with a minor more than three decades ago.        
	Affirming the decision of a Los Angeles judge in January, a state appeals court yesterday ruled that the fugitive filmmaker, 76, must return to California before he can be sentenced and bring his 33-year-long legal saga to a close.        
	Polanski had fled the US for his native France in 1978 and is now fighting extradition from Switzerland.        
	The appellate panel found that Polanski had failed to demonstrate that Los Angeles superior court judge Peter Espinoza lacked the discretion to refuse his request to remain abroad while the case against him was concluded.        
	A spokesperson for Polanskis lawyers said they had no comment on whether there would be further appeals.

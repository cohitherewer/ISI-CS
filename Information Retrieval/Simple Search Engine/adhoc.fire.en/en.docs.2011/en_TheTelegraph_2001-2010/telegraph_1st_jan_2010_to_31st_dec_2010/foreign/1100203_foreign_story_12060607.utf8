	Melbourne, Feb. 2 (PTI): Australias international education industry suffered a massive blow with the collapse of eight English language colleges, leaving 2,300 foreign students in the dark over their future.        
	The single largest group affected is in Melbourne and has an estimated 530 students unable to complete their courses. Some had just one more week before the end of their course. A total of 390 employees have lost their jobs, The Age said.        
	The Japanese-owned GEOS, which operates a global chain of English language schools, closed its Australian operations yesterday. Voluntary administrators were appointed to nine companies that operate eight schools around Australia.        
	Administrator Ernst amp; Young said about 500 students were affected in Sydney, 480 in Perth, 260 in Brisbane, 150 in Cairns, 130 in Adelaide and 265 in the Gold Coast. A break-up of nationalities of the affected students was not available. The financial situation of the companies is such that the schools are not able to re-open, Ernst amp; Young said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palin criticism angers Obama
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Palin criticism angers Obama
                                Obama, Palin: Not an expert				                           
	Washington, April 9 (AP): President Barack Obama snapped back at Sarah Palin and her criticisms about his nuclear defence policy, calling the former Republican vice-presidential candidate not much of an expert on nuclear issues.        
	Obamas comments came when asked for a response about a Palin critique that he was like a kid poised for a playground fight who said: Go ahead, punch me in the face and Im not going to retaliate. Go ahead and do what you want to with me.        
	I really have no response, Obama told ABC television. Because last I checked, Sarah Palins not much of an expert on nuclear issues.        
	The interview occurred yesterday in Prague, where Obama signed a treaty with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that orders both nations to shrink their nuclear arsenals.         
	The deal has to be ratified by the Russian parliament and the US Senate. Palin was referring to another development on the nuclear front this week, a rewriting of American nuclear strategy.        
	Among many other elements of that new plan, the US makes plain that if a non-nuclear nation is in compliance with an international nonproliferation treaty, the US will not threaten or use nuclear weapons against it.        
	Its unbelievable. Unbelievable, Palin told Fox News on Wednesday. No administration in Americas history would, I think, ever have considered such a step that we just found out President Obama is supporting today.

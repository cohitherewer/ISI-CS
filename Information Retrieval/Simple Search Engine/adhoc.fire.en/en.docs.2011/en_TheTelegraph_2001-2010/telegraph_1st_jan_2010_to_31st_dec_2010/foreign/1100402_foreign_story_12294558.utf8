	Makhachkala (Russia), April 1 (AP): President Dmitry Medvedev made a surprise visit today to the violence-wracked southern province of Dagestan, telling police and security forces to use tougher, more cruel measures to fight the scum responsible for terrorist attacks.        
	Medvedev today copied the style of Russias powerful Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, both in his dress  a black T-shirt under a black suit coat  and his rough language in ordering that much more be done to stop the attacks. The measures to fight terrorism should be expanded, they should be more effective, more harsh, more cruel, if you please, he told federal and local officials in a televised meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Britain coalition pact
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Britain coalition pact
                            
	London, May 16 (Reuters): Britains new government will publish a fuller coalition agreement on a broad range of policies within two weeks, adding its actions will prove that the partnership works, Prime Minister David Cameron said today.        
	In an interview with BBC TV, Cameron also reiterated the governments view that the brunt of action to tackle a record budget deficit of more than 11 per cent of GDP should be spending cuts rather than tax rises.        
	Camerons centre-right Conservatives joined forces with the smaller centre-left Liberal Democrat party after the inconclusive May 6 parliamentary election to form Britains first coalition government since 1945.        
	The two parties set out an initial coalition agreement on Wednesday, covering decisions in key areas such as the economy and subjects on which they have radically different views such as immigration, defence and Britains relations with Europe. We already have a very good coalition agreement... we were able to look at the difficult areas of policy and agree those first, things like Europe and immigration and taxes, we have already done the heavy lifting, Cameron told the BBC.        
	We need a fuller coalition agreement covering other policy areas as well... there will be a longer form document out in the next couple of weeks.        
	Camerons coalition partner, Lib Dem leader and deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, was preparing to face a special conference of party members where the agreement, which many activists feel involved the party abandoning its core values, will be debated.        
	While the vote on Sunday, which comes as two polls suggested some Lib Dem supporters had switched to the centre-left Labour party, is unlikely to have an immediate impact on the coalition, a lack of endorsement from the wider party would embarrass Clegg and could raise questions about its longevity.

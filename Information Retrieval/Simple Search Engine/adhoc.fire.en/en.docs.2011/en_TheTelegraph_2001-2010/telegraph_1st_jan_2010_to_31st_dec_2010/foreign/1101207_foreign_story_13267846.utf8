                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      50 killed as suicide blasts strike tribal Pak
                            
	Peshawar, Dec. 6 (AP): A pair of suicide bombers disguised as policemen killed 50 people today in an attack targeting a tribal meeting called to discuss the formation of an anti-Taliban militia in northwest Pakistan, officials said.        
	The attack occurred on the grounds of the main government compound in Mohmand, part of Pakistans militant-infested tribal region. It was the latest strike against local tribesmen who have been encouraged by the government to take up arms against the Taliban.        
	The explosions also wounded more than 100 people, many of them critically, said Mian Iftikhar Hussain, information minister of neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.        
	 One of the reasons the attacks were so deadly was because the bombers had filled their suicide jackets with bullets, said Amjad Ali Khan, the top political official in Mohmand, who was at the compound in Ghalanai town when it was attacked.        
	These bullets killed everyone who was hit, said Khan.        
	Both the bombers were disguised in tribal police uniforms, said Khan. One of them was caught at the gate of the compound, but he was able to detonate his explosives, he said. One of the wounded in the attack was 45-year-old Qalandar Khan, who came to the compound to visit an imprisoned cousin and was hit by the second explosion. There was a deafening sound and it caused a cloud of dust and smoke and a subsequent hue and cry, said Khan, lying in a hospital bed in his blood-soaked clothes. There were dozens on the ground like me, bleeding and crying. I saw body parts scattered in the compound.

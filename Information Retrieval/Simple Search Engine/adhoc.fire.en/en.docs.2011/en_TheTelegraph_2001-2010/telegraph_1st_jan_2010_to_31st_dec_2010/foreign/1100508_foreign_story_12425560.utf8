The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cameron, Brown woo Clegg in hung House
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Cameron, Brown woo Clegg in hung House
          AMIT ROY                          Samantha Cameron, the wife of Conservative Party leader David Cameron, at the family home in London. (AP)                                  
	London, May 7: Britain has a hung parliament after yesterdays general election of the kind all too familiar to Indian politicians.        
	 Gordon Brown has not yet telephoned my very good friend Manmohan Singh for advice on how to form a coalition but in true Indian style the horse trading has begun.        
	The big question is whether Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader, will get into bed with David Cameron or be seduced by Brown. Or will he sleep with one and then, if that does not work out, be a real political tart and go with the other?        
	Just on the basis of the numbers, Brown should have stepped down today as Prime Minister.        
	This may yet come to pass for Brown has led the Labour Party to one of its most humiliating defeats in decades. Labour have lost 91 seats to end up with 258.        
	With all but two constituencies not declared, Cameron has 305 seats, a gain of 91. He has just fallen tantalisingly short of the magic figure of 326 which would have given him an absolute majority in the new 650-seat Commons.        
	Contrary to expectations, the Lib Dems, have performed shockingly badly. They thought their time had come and they would be able to increase their number of MPs from 63 to 90 or even 100  their number is actually down to 57.        
	By and by, pundits will have to explain why Cleggmania, generated by Cleggs widely admired performance in the prime ministerial debates on television with Cameron and Brown, did not translate into more seats.        
	The final result, with 36 per cent of the popular vote cast for the Tories, 29 per cent for Labour and 23 per cent for the Lab Dems, is remarkably close to the prediction that had been made in the exit poll within a minute or so of the booths closing at 10pm last night: 307 for the Tories, 255 for Labour and 59 for the Lib Dems. This was adjusted minutes later to 305 for the Tories, 255 for Labour and 61 for the Lib Dems.        
	Given these numbers, Cameron has a choice of either forming a minority administration or an alliance, if not a formal coalition, with the Lib Dems.        
	But Brown, who seems determined to try and remain Prime Minister, has offered the Lib Dems immediate legislation to try and change Britains first past the post method of selecting MPs to proportional representation.                  
	The constitutional position is that Brown remains Prime Minister until he chooses to resigns or loses the confidence of the Commons. It may take a few days to sort out a deal but given the extent of Brown humiliation, most analysts are suggesting that it will be Cameron who will be Prime Minister.        
	With an international financial crisis caused by Greece getting worse almost by the hour, Brown, Cameron and Clegg realise that a Tory-Lib Dem or a Labour-Lib Dem deal has to be made swiftly in the national interest before Britain becomes engulfed by the gathering storm.        
	There were reports that Cameron and Clegg were due to meet tonight following the Tory leaders offer to the Lib Dems which came an hour after Brown had made his pitch.        
	Cameron did not use the word coalition in a public statement but stressed he was making a big open and comprehensive offer to Clegg. The difficulty for Clegg is that he cannot make up his mind without consulting his entire party, which could take several days.        
	Cameron even offered to discuss proportional representation, a subject as dear to the Lib Dems as it is anathema to the Tories. Brown has offered immediate legislation.        
	TV appearances do matter in modern Britain and it has to be said Cameron appeared more confident and assured and more prime ministerial as he said: I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our countrys big and urgent problems  the debt crisis, our deep social problems and our broken political system.        
	Brown, in marked contrast, had faced the cameras with the door of 10, Downing Street behind him, and offered what a Tory described as a big bribe.        
	 With the outcome of the general election we find ourselves in a position unknown to this generation of political leaders, with no single party able to have a Commons majority, and therefore have a majority government, said Brown, who claimed he was as speaking as prime minister with a constitutional duty to seek to resolve the situation for the good of the country, not as the leader of the Labour Party.        
	He acknowledged Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg should clearly be entitled to take as much time as they feel necessary. Clearly should the discussions between Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg come to nothing, then I would, of course, be prepared to discuss with Mr Clegg the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties. My view is clear, there needs to be immediate legislation on this to begin to restore the public trust in politics and to improve parliaments standing and reputation, a fairer voting system is central. And I believe that you, the British people, should be able to decide in a referendum what the system should be.        
	Clegg, who finds himself wooed by both sides, will probably have to decide to back Cameron given the size of Labours defeat.        
	A Labour cabinet minister, Ed Balls, last night summed up the confused state of British politics: The people have spoken but we dont know what they have said.

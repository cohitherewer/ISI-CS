The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Life in prison for would-be NY bomber
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Life in prison for would-be NY bomber
                              Faisal Shahzad                            
	New York, Oct. 5 (Reuters): A smirking Pakistani-born US citizen who tried to set off a car bomb in New Yorks busy Times Square was sentenced today to life in prison after he defiantly said more attacks on America were imminent.        
	Faisal Shahzad, 31, had pleaded guilty in June to a failed May 1 bombing in Manhattan. He admitted he received bomb-making training from the Pakistani Taliban and that this group, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, had funded the bomb plot.        
	Shahzad, who arrived in the Manhattan federal courtroom in shackles, wearing a blue prison tunic and a white prayer cap, smiled and addressed US district judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum before he was sentenced to life without parole.        
	We Muslims dont abide by human-made laws because they are always corrupt, he said, denouncing the presence of US and Nato forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and mentioning al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.        
	Furthermore, brace yourselves because the war with Muslims has just begun, he said. Consider me the first droplet of the flood that will follow.        
	The defeat of (the) US is imminent and will happen in near future, he said. We are only Muslims ... but if you call us terrorists, we are proud terrorists and we will keep on terrorising you.        
	The judge noted that Shahzad recently became a US citizen, saying he falsely swore allegiance to his country. His desire is not to defend the United States and Americans but to kill them, she said.        
	The defendant has repeatedly expressed his total lack of remorse, his desire, if given the opportunity, to repeat the crime, Cedarbaum said.        
	Shahzad, who lived in the neighbouring state of Connecticut, parked a smoking sports utility vehicle in Times Square with its engine running and hazard lights flashing on a balmy springtime Saturday evening.        
	A bomb squad diffused the crude device, which included firecrackers and propane gas tanks, in Times Square, which is 5.5km north of the World Trade Center, destroyed in the September 11 attacks.        
	Shahzad, whose wife and two children live in Pakistan, told investigators he thought his bomb would kill at least 40 people, and that he had planned a second bombing attack two weeks later. A second target was not identified.        
	The son of a retired Pakistani air vice marshal, Shahzad was arrested aboard a Dubai-bound jetliner at New Yorks John F. Kennedy International Airport two days after the attempted attack. He had been on his way back to Pakistan.        
	Shahzad pleaded guilty to 10 charges, including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted terrorism transcending national borders. Prosecutors had sought a mandatory life term for Shahzad.        
	Faisal Shahzad is a remorseless terrorist who betrayed his adopted country, Manhattan US attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.        
	The judge urged Shahzad to reflect on his actions and whether the Quran wants you to kill lots of people.        
	Shahzad said: The Quran gives us the right to defend, and thats what Im doing.        
	He added:I am happy with the deal God has given me.

	Washington, Oct. 6: President Barack Obama has made light of a lectern malfunction, telling his audience all of you know who I am after his presidential seal clattered to the floor.        
	The President had been delivering a speech to an audience of women last night in Pittsburgh. Im sure theres somebody back there thats really nervous right now, dont you think? Obama joked about the staff member who had hung the seal on the front of his lectern so precariously.        
	Theyre sweating bullets, he said.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

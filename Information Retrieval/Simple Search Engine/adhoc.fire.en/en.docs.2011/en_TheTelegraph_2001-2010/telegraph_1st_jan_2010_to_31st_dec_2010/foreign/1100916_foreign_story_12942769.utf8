          ROB CRILLY                          Waste of money                                  
	Islamabad, Sept. 15: Plans for a monument to Benazir Bhutto have provoked anger in Pakistan where thousands of people are demanding that its 7 million cost be used instead to help millions displaced by the countrys floods.        
	Bhutto, a former Prime Minister of Pakistan, was assassinated in a suicide attack in December 2007. Asif Ali Zardari, her husband, is now President, and the 10-acre park and library complex in her name received approval at the start of the month.        
	The monument has been more than two years in the planning and had already attracted the ire of political opponents and campaigners before the floods. The government has estimated that the floods have caused damage of $43 billion.        
	Kamran Shafi, a former press secretary to Bhutto and columnist for the Dawn newspaper, has led the call to scrap the project. It looks extremely bad when so many people are without medicine or homes, he said. The idea is silly.

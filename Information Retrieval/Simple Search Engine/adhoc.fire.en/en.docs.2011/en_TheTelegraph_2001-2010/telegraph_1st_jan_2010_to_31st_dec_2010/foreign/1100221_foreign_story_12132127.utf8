                              Penn                            
	Los Angeles, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Oscar-winner Sean Penn, as infamous for problems with the paparazzi as he is famous for acting, has been charged with two crimes after a run-in with a photographer last year and could face jail time if convicted, Los Angeles prosecutors said yesterday.        
	Penn, 49, was charged with misdemeanour battery and vandalism after allegedly kicking a photographer in the leg and breaking his camera last October at an upscale shopping centre in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles, the city attorneys office said.        
	The incident was caught on video and shown on celebrity news website TMZ.com.

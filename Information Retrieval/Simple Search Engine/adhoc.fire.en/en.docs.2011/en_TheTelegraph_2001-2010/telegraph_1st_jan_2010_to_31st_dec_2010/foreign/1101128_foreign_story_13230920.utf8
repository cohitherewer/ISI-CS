                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Qantas A380 returns to air after accident
                              A Qantas flight, an Airbus A380 bound for Singapore and London, takes off from Sydney airport. (Reuters)                            
	Sydney, Nov. 27 (AP): A Qantas A380 carrying more than 450 passengers, including the airlines chief executive, took to the skies today in the first flight by one of its superjumbos since a midair engine explosion three weeks ago triggered a global safety review.        
	Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said he was flying the first leg of the Sydney-Singapore-London flight as a sign of the airlines conviction that it had completed all modifications and other checks on the Rolls-Royce engines, and the planes were safe to fly.        
	We are 100 per cent comfortable with it, Joyce told reporters. If we werent, we wouldnt be restarting the operations today.        
	Qantas grounded its six A380s after a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine on one of the superjumbos disintegrated shortly after takeoff from Singapore on November 4, sending shrapnel slicing through a wing and causing multiple problems for the pilots before they managed to safely land the jetliner back in Singapore.        
	Investigators say leaking oil caught fire in the engine and heated metal parts, causing them to disintegrate. Experts say chunks of flying metal cut hydraulics and an engine-control line in the wing of the A380, causing the loss of control of a second engine and loss of some braking power, fuel leaks and more than 50 on-board warnings.        
	It was the most serious safety incident for the worlds largest and newest jetliners. Other airlines using the Trent 900 engine on A380s  Singapore Airlines and Germanys Lufthansa  also briefly grounded some planes while safety checks were conducted.        
	 Qantass checks have been more exhaustive than those of the other airlines. It has replaced 16 of the Trent 900 engines  each A380 has four of the bus-sized engines. Qantas is putting just two of its A380s back into service.

	Elitist Ford    
	 Chicago, Jan. 16 (PTI): Actor Harrison Ford has been branded an elitist by the mayor of Chicago after the veteran actor waded into a debate about the citys former airport.       
	The 67-year-old actor is a keen pilot who landed in trouble after he criticised Mayor Richard M. Daley over his controversial decision to bulldoze the Meigs Field airport in 2003 and turn it into a public park, reports the Chicago Sun Times.      
	(I am) furious. I dont think Ive been as angry about anything in a long time. (Closing the airport was) unthinkable. Im still livid about it, Ford said.       
	Daley has now hit back at the The Indiana Jones star, insisting Ford has no idea about what is in best interest for the people of Chicago. Hes a multi-millionaire. He can fly anyplace he wants in the country. He doesnt live in Chicago. I dont want to call him elitist, but it is.

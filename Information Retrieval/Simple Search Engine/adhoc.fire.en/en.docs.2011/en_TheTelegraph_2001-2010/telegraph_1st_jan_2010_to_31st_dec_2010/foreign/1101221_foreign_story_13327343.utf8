The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | North Korea holds fire after drills by South

	Pyongyang (North Korea), Dec. 20: An ominous showdown between North and South Korea was forestalled today after the North withheld military retaliation to South Koreas live-fire artillery drills on an island the North shelled last month after similar exercises.         
	The North claims the island and surrounding waters and had threatened brutal consequences beyond imagination if the drills went forward. But a statement from the Norths official news agency tonight said it was not worth reacting to the exercise, and one by the Norths military said: The world should properly know who is the true champion of peace and who is the real provocateur of a war.         
	The apparent pull back created a palpable feeling of relief in South Korea, where many people had been bracing for a showdown.         
	Political analysts could only speculate why the North, one of the worlds most closed and secretive societies, chose not to repeat last months sharp military response. Then, its hour-long barrage of Yeonpyeong island, just eight miles from the North Korean coast, left two South Korean soldiers and two civilians dead.         
	Governor Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former envoy to North Korea who spent five days on an unofficial visit here to try to break through the Norths isolation, said the talks had yielded important progress on its nuclear programme, including a resumption of visits by UN inspectors. Maybe we had a little impact, he said of the Norths restraint over the drills.         
	After repeated delays attributed to bad weather, the drills began this afternoon local time. The 94 minutes of operations included F-15K fighter-bombers overhead and shelling into waters claimed by both Koreas. Some 20 American military personnel took various support and observer roles.         
	South Korea insisted that the drills were routine and that it had the sovereign right to conduct such exercises, even at a time of such heightened tensions. The North has made a series of provocative moves this year: sinking a South Korean warship in March, leaving 46 sailors dead; shelling the island last month; and revealing a new nuclear facility at its complex in Pyongyang.

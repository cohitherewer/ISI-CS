	New York, May 7 (Reuters): New York police closed off part of Times Square in midtown Manhattan today as part of an investigation into an abandoned food and drinks cooler.        
	The New York police bomb squad later said the cooler was not a threat and opened the streets to traffic.        
	Earlier, several blocks of Seventh Avenue was closed to traffic and pedestrians. It appeared that no buildings had been evacuated.         
	The cooler was found by a police officer on patrol in the pedestrian mall at West 46th Street and Broadway, Browne said.        
	A failed bomb attack in the Times Square on Saturday has heightened security in the city. Prosecutors on Tuesday charged Faisal Shahzad, 30, with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and trying to kill and maim people in the US.

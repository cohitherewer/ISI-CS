The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Baghdad Sheraton hit by blast
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Baghdad Sheraton hit by blast
                            
	Baghdad, Jan. 25 (Reuters): Three large car bombs rocked well-known Baghdad hotels today, killing at least 36 people.        
	Police said at least 71 people were wounded in the separate suicide car bombings, which went off within minutes of one another. Some of the casualties were police.         
	The first blast occurred near an entrance of the Ishtar Sheraton hotel, a Baghdad landmark on the eastern side of the Tigris river. The shock wave blew open doors, shattered windows and sent thick dust swirling into the Reuters offices nearby.        
	A giant mushroom cloud of debris rose from the blast site as ambulances and fire trucks rushed to the scene. Towering concrete blastwalls protecting the hotel along the Abu Nawas riverside boulevard fell like dominoes. The blast took place across from a park frequented by families and picnickers.        
	Police said another blast went off just outside the al-Hamra hotel, which has been a hub for many western journalists since the 2003 US invasion. A final bomb appeared to have blown up near the Babylon hotel, which is used by Iraqi travellers.        
	Chemical Ali dead        
	Iraq today executed Ali Hassan al-Majeed, Saddam Husseins cousin and widely henchman known as Chemical Ali, for crimes against humanity.

	Lohan tattoo     
	 Los Angeles, July 26 (PTI): Lindsay Lohan added a tattoo to her collection of body art just before the start of her jail term and the image she chose was that of a innocent girl.      
	Lohan, who is serving a 90-day jail term for drunken driving, began work on her new tattoo but could only get the outline done.      
	The marking was visible on Lohans upper left arm when she was taken from court to prison. The image is of a little girl with curly locks who has her eyes closed.

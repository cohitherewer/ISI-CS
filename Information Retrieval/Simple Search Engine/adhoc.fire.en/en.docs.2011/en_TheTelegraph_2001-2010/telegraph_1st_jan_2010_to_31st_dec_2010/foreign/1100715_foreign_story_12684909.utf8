	Kabul, July 14: At least eight members of the American-led forces in Afghanistan were killed in attacks in southern Afghanistan yesterday and today, Nato officials said, including three American troops who died in a nighttime assault on an Afghan police post in Kandahar.        
	Four of the troops, Nato said, were killed by an improvised bomb attack in southern Afghanistan today, but officials did not immediately provide any details on the nationalities of the dead, or where the attack had occurred. Another service member died today after what it called a small-arms attack in the south.

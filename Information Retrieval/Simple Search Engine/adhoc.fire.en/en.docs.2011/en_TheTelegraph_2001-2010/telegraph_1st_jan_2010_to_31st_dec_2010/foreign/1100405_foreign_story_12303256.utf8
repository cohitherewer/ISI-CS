The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Petty gossip: Vatican

	Vatican City, April 4 (Reuters): A leading cardinal, making an unusual address in defence of Pope Benedict at the pontiffs Easter Sunday Mass, said the Church would not be intimidated by petty gossip about sexual abuse of children by priests.        
	But in his own Easter address hours later, the Pope, looking at times weary, did not mention the scandal that has engulfed the Church and posed a crisis in his five-year-old pontificate.        
	The surprise speech by Cardinal Angelo Sodano was the first time in recent memory that the ritual of a papal Easter Sunday Mass was changed so someone could address the Pope at the start.        
	Holy Father, the people of God are with you and will not let themselves be influenced by the petty gossip of the moment, by the trials that sometimes assail the community of believers, Sodano said.        
	The change of protocol underscored just how much the Vatican is feeling the pressure from a growing scandal concerning sexual abuse of children by priests and reports of a possible cover-up that have inched closer to the pope himself.        
	Later, the Pope did not mention the scandal in his twice-yearly Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) address, which touched on a series of world problems.        
	Sodano, a former secretary of state, praised Benedict as the solid rock that holds up the Church.        
	The Church is with you! Sodano told the Pope to the cheers of thousands of people holding umbrellas in St Peters Square.        
	His speech of solidarity listed those who support the Pope, particularly the 400,000 priests who generously serve in schools, hospitals and missions around the world. This was a clear attempt to underscore the Vaticans position that only a tiny minority of priests has abused children.        
	Victims are seeking consolation and healing and should not be insulted and told that our speaking out is petty gossip, said Barbara Blaine, a leader of the US-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP).        
	The Pope has said the truth should be exposed. They cant have it both ways, she told Reuters.        
	The celebrations leading up to Easter have been clouded by accusations the Church in several countries mishandled and covered up abuse of children by priests. Shaken by the crisis, the Vatican has several times accused the media of trying to smear the pope. Some reports have accused him of negligence in handling abuse cases in previous roles as a cardinal in his native Germany and in Rome.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak avoids showdown with court over judges
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pak avoids showdown with court over judges
                              Gilani in Islamabad. (Reuters)                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 17 (Reuters): The Pakistan government averted a potentially destabilising dispute with the judiciary today, withdrawing orders from the President appointing two judges that the Supreme Court had opposed.        
	Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said the decision to withdraw the order, which Zardari issued on Saturday and the Supreme Court blocked hours later, had dispelled political tension.        
	 Gilani, speaking to reporters after meeting Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, said the withdrawal of the orders and their replacement with new ones would boost stability. This is in the best interests of Pakistan ... and all the political forces in the country and that would strengthen and stabilise the system, Gilani said.        
	It is completely over, Gilani said when asked about the political tension. The row looked set to become a distraction for the government of the nuclear-armed US ally.        
	The court had said at the weekend that Zardaris orders were apparently a violation of the Constitution as the President had not consulted the Chaudhry.

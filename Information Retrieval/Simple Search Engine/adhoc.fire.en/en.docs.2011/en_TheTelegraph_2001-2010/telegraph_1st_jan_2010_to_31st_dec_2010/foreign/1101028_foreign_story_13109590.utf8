	Beckham argument    
	 Los Angeles, Oct. 27 (PTI): They are one of Hollywoods most enduring couples but David and Victoria Beckham had an argument in front of a studio audience at the Ellen DeGeneres Show.       
	The LA Galaxy player sparked an argument with his wife, former Spice Girl Victoria, by telling Ellen DeGeneres that she is less tidier than him.      
	Beckham said that he is very tidy and shes not which, he said, drives her crazy. Victoria, who was in the audience, responded by saying: He always says that he is tidy, but youre not actually that tidy are you David. Beckham later said: Were going to have our first argument in eleven years!.

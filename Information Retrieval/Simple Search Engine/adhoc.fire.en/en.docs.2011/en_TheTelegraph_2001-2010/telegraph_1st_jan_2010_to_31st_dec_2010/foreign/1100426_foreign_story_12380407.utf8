                              Hawking being kissed by a woman in Texas                            
	London, April 25: Stephen Hawking has suggested that aliens almost certainly exist but has warned humanity not to try to contact them.         
	One of the worlds leading scientists makes the claim in a new television documentary series, beginning on the Discovery Channel next month.         
	Hawking said that in a universe with 100 billion galaxies, each containing hundreds of millions of stars, it was unlikely that Earth was the only place where life had evolved.         
	To my mathematical brain, the numbers alone make thinking about aliens perfectly rational, he said, according to The Sunday Times.         
	The real challenge is working out what aliens might actually be like.         
	Hawking said they could be microbes  basic animals such as worms, which have been on Earth for millions of years, but suggests that extraterrestrial life could develop much further.         
	We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we wouldnt want to meet, Hawking said.         
	I imagine they might exist in massive ships, having used up all the resources from their home planet. Such advanced aliens would perhaps become nomads, looking to conquer and colonise whatever planets they can reach.         
	The scientist, who is paralysed by motor neurone disease, warned that contact with alien life could spell disaster for the human race.         
	If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much as when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didnt turn out very well for the American Indians, Hawking said.

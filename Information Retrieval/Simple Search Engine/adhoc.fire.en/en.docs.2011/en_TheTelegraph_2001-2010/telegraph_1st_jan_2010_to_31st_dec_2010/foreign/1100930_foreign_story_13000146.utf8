                                        Naomi Campbell		    
	London, Sept. 29 (PTI): Supermodel Naomi Campbell has said she does not want to be regarded as a role model because she has made many mistakes in her life.         
	Campbell has been involved in a number of scandals including various claims of assault. The supermodel, however, has said despite being flawed, she is trying her best to be a better person, Contactmusic reported.         
	I make many mistakes. Im not a perfect human being. I have to learn from my mistakes. And a lot of the ones Ive made have been public.        
	So I always get nervous when people speak about something that sounds like a role model, because I dont know if Ive been a great role model myself. I dont think I have in certain aspects of my life.         
	Despite her problems, the 40-year-old has said she never thinks about her mistakes but allows herself time to get back on track again.         
	But Im trying to do better. I admit to my mistakes. I admit to the things that Ive done wrong. I admit it. But Im trying to do right by myself and my life now.         
	I dont get depressed. When I feel an attack, I withdraw. I disappear, I replenish, and then I come back. Im not going to wallow in self-pity and not live my life, she said.

	Beijing, Dec. 8 (Reuters): China is conducting a sweeping crackdown on dissent before Fridays awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to jailed dissident Liu Xiaobo, casting the net wide to prevent friends and family attending the ceremony in Oslo.        
	Liu is serving an 11-year jail term for subversion. His wife, Liu Xia, is under house arrest. Even family members of little-known dissidents have been prevented from leaving China.        
	Lu Yuegang, who lost his job in 2006 at the China Youth Daily after a supplement was banned over provocative content, said his wife had been stopped from travelling to Hong Kong.        
	Nobody has given a reason. She goes to Hong Kong regularly for work. We think its probably to do with the Liu Xiaobo issue, Lu told Reuters.        
	In the frozen northern region of Inner Mongolia, police have detained the wife of one of Chinas longest-serving political prisoners, Hada, ahead of his expected release on Friday. Police have pressured Hadas son Uiles to cut off ties with his parents, promising him a nice job, beautiful house and even a pretty girlfriend if he agrees, according to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Centre.        
	A number of upcoming sensitive events that will simultaneously take place on December 10, including Liu Xiaobos Nobel Prize award, Hadas release, and the UN Human Rights Day celebration, are making the Chinese authorities extremely nervous, the groups Enghebatu Togochog told Reuters.        
	About 150 Chinese pro-democracy activists living outside mainland China and several lawmakers from Hong Kong were likely to travel to Oslo for the award ceremony.

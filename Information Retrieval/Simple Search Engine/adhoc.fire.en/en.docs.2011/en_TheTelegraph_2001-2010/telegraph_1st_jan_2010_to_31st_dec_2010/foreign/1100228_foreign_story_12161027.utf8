	Feb. 27: SeaWorld Orlandos killer whale show will reopen without staff in the water days after an orca killed one of the trainers, the companys chief said.        
	Tilikum, the 12,000-pound orca bull that dragged Dawn Brancheau under water, eventually drowning her, will continue to perform. But no one will be allowed in the water with him or any of the companys other killer whales until an investigation is finished, Jim Atchison, SeaWorlds chief executive, said.        
	Brancheau was on a platform at the side of the pool, rubbing the whale after a performance on Wednesday when the animal grabbed her ponytail in his mouth.

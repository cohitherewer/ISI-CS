The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK couple in record 56m lottery win
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      UK couple in record 56m lottery win
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Feb. 16: What do you do if one morning you wake up and find you have won 56million on the lottery?        
	 This is the dilemma that faces property maintenance worker Nigel Page, 43, and his partner, Justine Laycock, 41, an estate agent, whose ordinary lives in their ordinary three-bedroom semi-detached house in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, will be transformed by their record win.        
	The couple have hit the EuroMillions jackpot by sharing 113 million with another ticket holder in Spain.        
	They comfortably exceed the previous UK record when Pound91m was split last November between a couple, Les and Sam Scadding, from Newport, South Wales, and a syndicate of seven Liverpudlian call-centre workers.        
	For starters, Page and Laycock, who have three children from previous marriages  Ella, 12, is the formers daughter, and Georgia, 15, and Jacob, 11, are the latters daughter and son  will give up their jobs. They have said they will help out close family and friends and donate to their childrens school as well as some charities.        
	 However, it takes real imagination to work out how to spend 56 million.        
	Page hasnt quite recovered from the shock of turning on his computer and reading a message from Camelot, the organisation that runs the lottery: Congratulations  you have won 56 million.        
	He will never forget the moment: I started shaking and couldnt speak. I just kept looking at the screen in front of me but couldnt say a word.        
	 As a repair man who in India would be called a mistiri, Page has been making do with an old white van.        
	 Im going to treat myself to a new car, he said. Ill probably go a little more upmarket now. A BMW X5 or a Range Rover  just to get the kids and the dog in.        
	One tv reporter mused the dog could now afford a whole estate to himself.        
	Since its launch in 1994, the National Lottery has created more than 2,400 millionaires and paid out more than 36 billion. Statistically, lottery players have less chance of winning than, say, Mohammed Azharuddin has of batting for India again. But that does not stop people spending Pound10-20 every week on playing the lottery  and it is usually the poorest who dream of making it big.        
	The publicity generated by this latest bonanza will encourage even more people to play the lottery, especially in a time of recession.        
	There have been suggestions as to what Page and Laycock could do with Pound56m.        
	 For an exclusive holiday home, they could buy Baliceaux, a 320-acre Caribbean island located five miles from Mustique, which is on the market for 19 million.        
	They are able to rescue beleaguered Portsmouth Football Club. They could also considering purchasing a 1930 Bugatti Type 41 Royale, the worlds most expensive car, which is expected to fetch 6.3 million at auction. Only six such vehicles were produced  so, in theory, the couple could buy all six.        
	They dont intend to move from Cirencester to an upmarket area of London, for example, which is just as well. They cannot aspire to be Lakshmi Mittals neighbour in Kensington Palace Gardens where it would probably cost nearer 250 million for the privilege.

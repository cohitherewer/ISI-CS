	Former Conservative deputy leader William Hague is the new foreign secretary and ex-finance minister Ken Clarke will run the justice department. Other key appointments include Conservative Theresa May as interior minister, Conservative Liam Fox as defence secretary and Tory George Osbourne as chancellor of the exchequer. Lib Dem Vince Cable, a former economist, is expected to have a role overseeing banking and business. Cameron, 43, took over as Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg as his deputy. Ian Duncan Smith was named as welfare and pensions secretary.

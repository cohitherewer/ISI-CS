	New York, May 2: About 12 hours had passed since a T-shirt vendor in Times Square had alerted police to a suspicious SUV that was packed with a bomb. But by 7am Sunday, with the SUV towed away and the streets safe and reopened, the vendor was tired, cranky and reluctant to say much about his feat.        
	Im fed up, said the vendor, who declined to give his name as he headed towards a taxicab in Times Square around 7am. Weve been up since 6am of yesterday morning.        
	The vendor, who was swarmed by television cameras, wore a name tag around his neck that identified him as Lance Orton. A law enforcement official confirmed that his first name was Lance.        
	The vendor had seen smoke billowing from the rear of the SUV, which was parked awkwardly near the curb and was running, shortly before 6.30pm on Saturday. Within moments, the vendor alerted a mounted police officer; the officer smelled gunpowder near the car and an evacuation of Times Square was ordered.        
	Around 6.30am on Sunday, the vendor and several others he worked with collected the T-shirts and tables they had abandoned on 45th Street and Broadway when Times Square was first evacuated. After collecting his belongings, the vendor walked down 45th Street in search of a taxicab to take him home.        
	Im not going to say nothing, Im not going to say nothing, he said when first approached by a gaggle of reporters.        
	As he walked down the street, employees from Juniors restaurant stood outside applauding him. He briefly entered the restaurant before heading toward 44th Street.        
	He walked with a limp, had a cane, wore a white fedora and had a hoop earring in his right ear.        
	When asked if he was proud of his actions, he said: Of course, man. Im a veteran. What do you think?        
	The vendor said that he had served during the Vietnam War and had been selling wares on the street for about 20 years.        
	I dont have too much of a choice, nobodys giving me a job, he said.        
	He said that he was reluctant to speak with members of the media because they had twisted his words when they interviewed him in recent years.        
	He got into the back seat of the taxi, took off his hat and used it to fan his face.        
	Before he left, he was asked what he had to say to New Yorkers.        
	See something, say something, he said.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

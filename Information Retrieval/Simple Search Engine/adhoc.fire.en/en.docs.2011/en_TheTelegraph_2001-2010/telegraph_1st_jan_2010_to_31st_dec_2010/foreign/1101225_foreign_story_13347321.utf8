	Inspired Paris    
	 London, Dec. 24 (PTI): Reality TV star Paris Hilton said she she is inspired by boyfriend Cy Waits as he brings out the best in her.       
	The hotel heiress is currently enjoying a Christmas vacation in Hawaii with Waits and her family. Just had a great work out with my love. The first time Ive ever worked out on vacation. He really inspires me to be the best I can be, (sic) tweeted the Hilton, 29.     
	Gaga tops    
	London (PTI): Pop star Lady Gaga has beaten singer Alicia Keys to top the list of the most charitable celebrities for the year 2010. Gagas outspoken support for gay rights and her never-ending effort in the campaign for the repeal of the US militarys Dont Ask, Dont Tell policy placed her at the number one slot with Keys following her, who led the charge against HIV this year.    
	Helen age    
	 London (PTI): Actress Helen Mirren thinks growing old has made her increasingly scared of career risks. Mirren, 65, says she has grown less inclined to go off the beaten track with her work because she needs the security that comes with stability in professional life. I try not to be but, you know, as you get older, you get more frightened. The realities of life start coming in on you and you realise that you do want security and so on and so forth. So you start working towards that and thats when you start losing your idealism, which is sad, said Mirren.

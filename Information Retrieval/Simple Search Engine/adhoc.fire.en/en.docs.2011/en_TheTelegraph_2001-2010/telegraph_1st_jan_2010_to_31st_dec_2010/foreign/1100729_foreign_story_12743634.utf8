	Islamabad, July 28 : A Pakistani passenger plane crashed in heavy rain near Islamabad today, killing all 152 people on board, officials said, in the worst aviation accident in Pakistan.        
	Two Americans were among the victims, a US embassy spokesman told Reuters. He had no further details.        
	There are no survivors and everyone on board has been killed, chief of operations Islamabad police, Bina Amin told The Telegraph after he returned from the crash site.        
	The scene at the crash site was very gloomy with human limbs hanging with bushes and charred bodies beyond any recognition, Amin said, adding: We have found some equipment from the site, which could be the black box.        
	He said that except for a few, none of the bodies were intact. They were all charred beyond recognition.        
	The Airbus 321, belonging to private airline Airblue, crashed into a heavily wooded and hard-to-access hillside while flying from Karachi. More than 90 bodies had been recovered so far, but the bad weather was making recovery efforts difficult.        
	We have suspended the air operation because of rain. It will take a long time to clear the area. Theres no way to transport bodies from the site except via helicopters and even helicopters cannot land there, said Aamir Ali Ahmed, senior city government official, said.

	Rescuers said they had to dig through the rubble with their bare hands, with fire and thick smoke hampering their work. The fire has since been extinguished, but access to the hillside remained limited to pedestrians and helicopters.        
	The plane lost contact with the control room of the Islamabad International Airport at 0443 GMT. It was carrying 146 passengers and six crew members. The pilot was given directions to land either on runway I or II, interior minister Rehman Malik told reporters. The plane was at 792 metres before landing but suddenly it went to 3,000, which was unexplained.        
	If the visibility to the runway was so poor then it should have been diverted.        
	If you look at the position of the wreckage its clear that the plane went beyond safety margins. It should have manoeuvred within five miles of the runway but it did not happen, said Ejaz Haroon, managing director of state-run airline PIA.        
	The crash site is on the Margalla Hills facing Islamabad, about 300 metres up the side of the hills. Smoke could be seen from some districts of the city after the crash.        
	While todays crash is the worst aviation accident on Pakistani soil, PIA has had two worse disasters.         
	In 1979 and 1992, PIA jets crashed in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Kathmandu, killing 156 and 167 people, respectively.        
	Within Pakistan, the last major aviation accident was in 2006 when a PIA plane crashed near the central city of Multan killing 45 people.

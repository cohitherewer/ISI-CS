The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tariq Aziz sentenced to death
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Tariq Aziz sentenced to death
          JACK HEALY                          Aziz: Not just a diplomat                                  
	Baghdad, Oct. 26: Tariq Aziz, a former top aide to Saddam Hussein, was sentenced to death by an Iraqi court today for crimes against members of rival Shia political parties.        
	The ruling was the latest in a series of criminal cases against Aziz, 74, who as foreign minister and, later, deputy Prime Minister became the bespectacled face of . Husseins government during and before the Persian Gulf war of 1991, which was triggered by Iraqs invasion of oil-rich Kuwait.        
	Because Hussein seldom left Iraq because of fears about his safety, Aziz represented Iraq in the diplomatic world. He surrendered to American forces in 2003, aware that he was among Iraqs most hunted officials.        
	In March 2009, Aziz was sentenced to 15 years in prison for crimes against humanity, and was acquitted earlier that year on charges of ordering a 1999 crackdown against Shia protesters after a revered Shia cleric was assassinated.        
	Azizs lawyers were not immediately available for comment, and it was unclear whether they would appeal the sentence. Nor was it clear when the sentence would be carried out. Azizs lawyers have long claimed he was only responsible for Iraqs diplomatic and political relations, and had no ties to the executions and purges carried out by Husseins Baathist government. Hussein, who was ousted as President by an American-led invasion in 2003, was himself hanged in 2006.        
	Death sentences were also handed down today to other former officials in Husseins government: Abed Hammoud, a former secretary to Hussein, and former interior minister Sadoon Shaker.        
	Earlier this year, Aziz, a Christian from the Chaldean sect, was reported in poor health. In January, the American military said in a statement that he suffered a blood clot in the brain. He was taken to an American military hospital north of Baghdad for treatment.        
	Aziz, a former foreign minister, is also serving a seven-year prison sentence for a case involving the forced displacement of Kurds in northern Iraq.        
	In a recent interview with The Associated Press, he predicted he will die in prison, citing his old age and lengthy prison sentences. Under Hussein, Aziz cultivated a reputation as a cigar-smoking, whisky-drinking, well-travelled diplomat who used his official posts to justify the invasion of Kuwait, the efforts to obscure Husseins programme to develop unconventional weapons, the mass killings of Kurds and Shias in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the use of chemical weapons at the Kurdish town of Halabja, among other things.        
	Only weeks before the American-led invasion in 2003, he had an audience with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican, one of dozens of encounters with world leaders.

										      MARTIN BECKFORD      London, Jan. 3: Traditional spellings of English words could be killed off by the Internet within a few decades, according to a leading language expert. 
  The advent of blogs and chatrooms has meant for the first time in centuries printed words are being widely distributed without first having been edited or proofread first, according to Professor David Crystal of the University of Wales, Bangor. 
  As a result, writers can choose to spell words differently without being corrected and their new versions enter common parlance. 
  He predicted that within a few decades, the simplified or invented spellings favoured by many Internet users could replace the current, more complex versions that were standardised in the 18th century with the advent of dictionaries. 
  It could mean that current Net slang mdash; such as deliberately writing ldquo;teh rdquo; instead of ldquo;the rdquo;, ldquo;2moro rdquo; instead of ldquo;tomorrow rdquo; or ldquo;thx rdquo; for ldquo;thank you rdquo; mdash; becomes introduced to mainstream publications. 
  Crystal, a pioneer of language theory, said many traditional spellings beared no relation to meaning or pronunciation. ldquo;The vast majority of spelling rules in English are irrelevant in the sense that they don rsquo;t stop you understanding the word in question, rdquo; he said. 
  ldquo;If I spell the word rhubarb without an lsquo;h rsquo; you have no trouble understanding it whatsoever. Why do we spell it with an lsquo;h rsquo;? Because some guy in the 16th century said it was good to put an lsquo;h rsquo; in because it would remind you of the history of the word. rdquo;

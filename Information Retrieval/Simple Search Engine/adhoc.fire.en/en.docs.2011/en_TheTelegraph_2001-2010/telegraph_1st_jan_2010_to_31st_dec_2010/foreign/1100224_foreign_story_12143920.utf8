	Beijing, Feb. 23 (AP): The Chinese Communist Party issued a new code of ethics today as the countrys fight against widespread corruption intensifies, the partys Central Committee announced.        
	The warning to party officials against abusing their power comes just days before the start of the annual National Peoples Congress, which brings about 3,000 delegates to Beijing.         
	The ethics code warns party members of 52 unacceptable practices, including taking cash as a gift, using their power to benefit family members, being involved in profitable activities and using public money for personal interests, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.        
	The code is significant for ... building a clean government, Xinhua cited the ethics code as saying. It said the code replaces one introduced on a trial basis in 1997.

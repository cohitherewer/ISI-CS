The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Avatar, Hurt Locker lead Oscar field
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Avatar, Hurt Locker lead Oscar field
                                  
	Los Angeles, Feb. 2 (Reuters): Oscar voters broke with several traditions today, including handing nominations for best film to two science-fiction movies, among them box-office smash hit Avatar which earned nine nominations overall.        
	The Iraq war movie The Hurt Locker also had nine nominations, including one for Kathryn Bigelow, who will be competing against ex-husband James Cameron, the mastermind of Avatar, for the best director award.        
	Bigelows nomination was a rarity. Only three other women, including Sofia Coppola for 2003s Lost in Translation, have been nominated for best director in the 80-plus years since the worlds top film honours have been given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. No woman has ever won.        
	Joining Avatar and The Hurt Locker in the best film field is the Disney animated movie Up, about an elderly man and young boy who go on an adventure after he ties helium-filled balloons to his house.         
	Meryl Streeps performance in Julie amp; Julia earned her 16th Oscar nomination, including a 13th for lead actress. She passed Katharine Hepburn with 12 in the top category to become the most-nominated lead actress in Oscar history.        
	Academy voters expanded field of best film nominees from five movies to 10 this year. Other films on the list include Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds.        
	Veteran Oscar watcher Tom Neil of awards website TheEnvelope.com called the race a close battle between major studio film Avatar and low-budget flick The Hurt Locker.         
	Nominations for best actor to Jeff Bridges playing a drunk country singer in Crazy Heart, George Clooney as a corporate hatchet man in Up in the Air, Jeremy Renner as a bomb specialist in The Hurt Locker, Colin Firth for A Single Man and Morgan Freeman for Invictus.

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      I will fight all the way for democracy
                                          
	Bangkok, May 19 (Reuters): Thousands of Red Shirt supporters in a fortified camp appeared calm as Thai troops staged a bloody operation to disperse anti-government protesters today. Some were eating or sleeping. Others prepared for battle.        
	Protesters showed no obvious sign of fear, as gunfights raged at the entrance to their encampment, and as troops broke through burning barricades that sent black smoke engulfing office towers, hotels, malls and embassies in Bangkoks commercial district.        
	Im not scared, I will fight all the way for democracy. Were not armed, we having nothing. They have guns. We are here in peace, said protester Somkiet Thongdamuang, a 38-year-old farmer from Kampheng Phet province.        
	But peace was nowhere to be seen as troops moved closer to the camp in a major operation that killed at least four people and wounded an estimated 50 people, the Thai News Agency said.        
	Thai television showed bodies being dragged away or hurriedly carried to safety, as ambulances ferried people to hospitals. Two journalists were among the wounded and one western journalist identified as an Italian was believed dead.        
	The military operation, apparently part of a final offensive to disperse protesters, had successfully gained control of the Lumpini Park area south of the protest camp, said a government spokesman.

	Sandra stage    
	 Los Angeles, June 7 (Reuters): Actress Sandra Bullock made her first public appearance since revelations of her husbands extramarital affairs, taking the stage at a Hollywood awards show on Saturday night.      
	Bullock showed up at cable channel Spike TVs Guys Choice Awards to accept an entertainer of the year trophy.      
	Lets be honest here, just for a moment. Were all going to be honest, right? Bullock said onstage as she held the antler-shaped award. Did I win this for being entertainer of the year, or did I win this because of the spectacular IED (improvised explosive device) explosion that became my personal life?

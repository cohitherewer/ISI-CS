	Moscow, June 18 (Reuters): A 71-year-old Russian grandmother has been issued with a restriction order by Moscow police for swindling businessmen out of more than half a million dollars, a spokesman for the force said today.        
	The geriatric fraudster, identified only by her first name Svetlana, posed as an influential lobbyist between 2007 and 2008, during which she committed the crime, popular daily Izvestia reported.

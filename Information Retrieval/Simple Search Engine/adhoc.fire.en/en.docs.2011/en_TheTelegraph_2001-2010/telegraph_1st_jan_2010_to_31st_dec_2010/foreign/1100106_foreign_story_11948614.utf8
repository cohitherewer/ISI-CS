The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | CIA bomber was double agent

          RICHARD A. OPPEL JR., MARK MAZZETTI AND SOUAD MEKHENNET                          turnaround                                  
	Islamabad, Jan. 5: The suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officers and a Jordanian spy last week was a double agent who was taken onto the base in Afghanistan because the Americans hoped he might be able to deliver top members of al Qaidas network, according to western government officials.        
	The bomber had been recruited by the Jordanian intelligence service and taken to Afghanistan to infiltrate al Qaida by posing as a foreign jihadi, the officials said.        
	But in a deadly turnabout, the supposed informant strapped explosives to his body and blew himself up at a meeting on Wednesday at the CIAs Forward Operating Base Chapman in the southeastern province of Khost.        
	The attack at the CIA base dealt a devastating blow to the spy agencys operations against militants in the remote mountains of Afghanistan, eliminating an elite team using an informant with strong jihadi credentials. The attack further delayed hope of penetrating al Qaidas upper ranks, and also seemed potent evidence of militants ability to strike back against their American pursuers.        
	It could also jeopardise relations between the CIA and the Jordanian spy service, which officials said had vouched for the would-be informant.        
	The Jordanian service, called the General Intelligence Directorate, for years has been one of the CIAs closest and most useful allies in West Asia.        
	In a telephone interview, a person associated with the Pakistani Taliban identified the bomber as Humam Khalil Mohammed, a Jordanian physician. Western officials said that Mohammed had been in a Jordanian prison and that he was recruited by the Jordanian spy service.        
	The bomber was not closely searched because of his perceived value as someone who could lead American forces to senior Qaida leaders, and because the Jordanian intelligence officer had identified him as a potentially valuable informant.        
	They and others who were interviewed spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the matter. Current and former American officials said yesterday that because of Mohammeds medical background, he might have been recruited to find the whereabouts of Ayman al-Zawahri.        
	Agency officers had travelled from Kabul to Khost for a meeting with the informant, a sign that the CIA had come to trust the informant and that it was eager to learn what he might have gleaned from operations in the field, according to a former CIA official with experience in Afghanistan.

	Avatar Globes    
	 Beverly Hills, Jan. 18 (AP): The Golden Globes gave top honours to James Camerons Avatar.      
	Cameron claimed best drama and best director for his science-fiction blockbuster. It set him up for a possible awards sequel to 1997s Titanic. Camerons epic about the doomed oceanliner won the same prizes and went on to dominate the Oscars.       
	Avatar asks us to see that everything is connected, all human beings to each other, and us to the Earth. And if you have to go four and a half light years to another, made-up planet to appreciate this miracle of the world that we have right here, well, you know what, thats the wonder of cinema right there, Cameron said.

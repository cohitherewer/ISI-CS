The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Facebook to simplify controls
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Facebook to simplify controls
                            
	New York, May 26 (AP): Facebook is simplifying its privacy controls.        
	The changes come amid complaints about recently announced features, including instant personalisation that tailors other websites to users Facebook profiles. Protesters have been organising campaigns to quit Facebook and privacy groups have complained to regulators.        
	One complaint has been over the fact that while Facebook allows users to hide their list of interests on their personal profile pages, the user would still show up elsewhere as liking that band, company or hobby. The new privacy settings will be extending to those other places as well.        
	In a news conference today, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is also making it easier for users to decline the instant personalisation feature. Its not yet clear whether the latest changes will quell user unease.

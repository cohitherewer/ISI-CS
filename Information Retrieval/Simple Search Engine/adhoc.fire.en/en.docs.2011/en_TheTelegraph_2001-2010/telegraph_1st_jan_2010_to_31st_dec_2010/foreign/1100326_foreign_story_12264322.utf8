The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pope spared US priest who abused deaf boys
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pope spared US priest who abused deaf boys
          LAURIE GOODSTEIN                          Failure to act                                  
	New York, March 25: Top Vatican officials  including the future Pope Benedict XVI  did not defrock a priest who molested as many as 200 deaf boys, even though several American bishops repeatedly warned them that failure to act on the matter could embarrass the Church, according to Church files newly unearthed as part of a lawsuit.        
	The internal correspondence from bishops in Wisconsin directly to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the future pope, shows that while church officials tussled over whether the priest should be dismissed, their highest priority was protecting the church from scandal.        
	The documents emerge as Pope Benedict is facing other accusations that he and direct subordinates often did not alert civilian authorities or discipline priests involved in sexual abuse when he served as an archbishop in Germany and as the Vaticans chief doctrinal enforcer.        
	The Wisconsin case involved an American priest, the Rev. Lawrence C. Murphy, who worked at a renowned school for deaf children from 1950 to 1974.         
	But it is only one of thousands of cases forwarded over decades by bishops to the Vatican office called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, led from 1981 to 2005 by Cardinal Ratzinger. It is still the office that decides whether accused priests should be given full canonical trials and defrocked.        
	In 1996, Cardinal Ratzinger failed to respond to two letters about the case from Rembert G. Weakland, Milwaukees archbishop at the time. After eight months, the second in command at the doctrinal office, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, now the Vaticans secretary of state, instructed the Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial that could lead to Father Murphys dismissal.        
	But Cardinal Bertone halted the process after Father Murphy personally wrote to Cardinal Ratzinger protesting that he should not be put on trial because he had already repented and was in poor health and that the case was beyond the churchs own statute of limitations.        
	I simply want to live out the time that I have left in the dignity of my priesthood, Father Murphy wrote near the end of his life to Cardinal Ratzinger. I ask your kind assistance in this matter. The files contain no response from Cardinal Ratzinger.        
	The New York Times obtained the documents, which the church fought to keep secret, from Jeff Anderson and Mike Finnegan, the lawyers for five men who have brought four lawsuits against the Archdiocese of Milwaukee.         
	The documents include letters between bishops and the Vatican, victims affidavits, the handwritten notes of an expert on sexual disorders who interviewed Father Murphy and minutes of a final meeting on the case at the Vatican.        
	Father Murphy not only was never tried or disciplined by the churchs own justice system, but also got a pass from the police and prosecutors who ignored reports from his victims. Three successive archbishops in Wisconsin were told that Father Murphy was sexually abusing children, the documents show, but never reported it.

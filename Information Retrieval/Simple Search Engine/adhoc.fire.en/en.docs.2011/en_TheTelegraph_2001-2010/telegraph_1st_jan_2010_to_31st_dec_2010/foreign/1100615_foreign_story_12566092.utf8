	Osh (Kyrgyzstan), June 14: Four days of sudden, brutal violence has begun reshaping the ethnic landscape of this Central Asian nation, with more than 70,000 ethnic Uzbeks reported to be flooding into Uzbekistan and thousands more massed at the border.        
	On the outskirts of this southern city, where mobs from the countrys ethnic Kyrgyz majority marauded for three days, Uzbeks barricaded themselves behind walls and barriers thrown together from rocks, burnt-out cars and building materials. Outside, Kyrgyz men were poised with bats and iron bars, saying they needed to defend the region from a plot by Uzbekistan to seize it. There was no sign of police or army interference.        
	Death to Uzbeks had been spray-painted on many wrecked buildings, beside intact structures that had been labelled Kyrgyz.        
	The Kyrgyz said the Uzbeks were heavily armed, but only one gun could be spotted in visits to three such besieged neighbourhoods today. The proportions of the violence was gradually coming into focus, though estimates of the dead ranged widely.        
	Kyrgyz officials gave the latest death count as 125. But Pierre-Emmanuel Ducruet, a spokesman for the International Committee for the Red Cross who arrived in Osh today, said inspections of the citys morgues suggested that more than 700 people had been killed in Osh alone, and that not less than 3,000 people were in need of medical help, mostly for gunshot wounds.        
	Red Cross workers had been unable to reach many victims, he said.        
	The problem is that there is not sufficient control over the situation by interior troops or the army, Ducruet said. Its difficult to give an idea of what is going to happen. It started very quickly and very easily. It can either stop, or it can continue for a few days.        
	A Kyrgyz official estimated that more than 10,000 Uzbeks had fled to Uzbekistan, while the government there put the figure far higher, at 75,000. Ducruet estimated the number at 80,000, and he said Uzbekistan had few resources to accommodate the influx and there was no way to be sure their needs would be met.

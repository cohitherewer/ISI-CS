The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Rebel Thai general shot in head
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Rebel Thai general shot in head
  - Renegade leader was hit while talking to New York Times reporter        THOMAS FULLER                          Khattiya Sawasdipol                                        
	Bangkok, May 13: A renegade Thai general was shot in Bangkok today as the military prepared to encircle the barricaded encampment of anti-government protesters.        
	The general, Khattiya Sawatdiphol, 58, was struck in the head by a bullet during an interview with this reporter about 7pm on the street in central Bangkok, near a park occupied by his hardline followers.         
	This reporter, who was facing the general and about two feet away, heard a loud bang not unlike a firecracker. The general fell to the ground, with his eyes wide open, and protesters took his apparently lifeless body to the hospital, screaming out his nickname. Seh Daeng has been shot! Seh Daeng has been shot! protesters shouted amid growing panic.        
	Gunshots were heard in the minutes following, and there were later reports that 20 people had been injured, though whether from gunfire, a stampede, or some other cause was unclear. Within hours, protesters were clashing with security forces in Bangkoks Lumpini Park.        
	The general was abhorred by both the government for disloyalty and also by most of the protest leaders for what they suspected was his role in fomenting violence. Still, he had assumed control of security for the protesters, placing his own black-shirted paramilitary fighters at entrances to the makeshift barriers around their encampment. He claimed the loyalty of a small but intense group of protesters.        
	When the bullet struck him Khattiya was inside the barricades, facing a road, overpass and a business district with several tall buildings. Wearing his usual camouflage uniform, he was answering a question about whether the Thai military would be able to penetrate the area.        
	The government announced earlier today that armoured personnel carriers would be used to cordon off the area in what appeared to be the beginning of an operation to disperse the thousands of protesters who are camped out outside shopping malls and luxury hotels.        
	Khattiyas last words before being shot were: The military cannot get in here. Those words were spoken in Thai.        
	The protesters, known as the red shirts, started their mass demonstration two months ago seeking the dissolution of parliament. But the movement has fractured, and the leaders ultimate aims have become less clear.        
	The general had been called a terrorist by the Prime Minister, who named him as the chief obstacle to the compromise plan. Commanding his own paramilitary force of former rangers, Khattiya was suspended without pay from the armed forces. A special committee was considering whether to strip him of his rank.

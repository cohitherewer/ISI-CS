                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      NY bedbug epidemic hits UN building
                              The UN headquarters in New York                            
	United Nations, Oct. 28 (Reuters): New York citys bedbug epidemic has spread to yet another landmark in the city that never sleeps  the UN, officials at the world organisation said yesterday.        
	The pests appeared at places like the Empire State Building and Bloomingdales before reaching the citys centre of international diplomacy on the east side of Manhattan.        
	The UN press office said a bedbug-sniffing dog had confirmed the presence of bedbugs in furniture in the basement of the Dag Hammarskjold Library, where the offices of the team overseeing the UN headquarters $1.9 billion renovation project are housed.        
	This furniture has been moved to a part of the building not occupied by staff to facilitate fumigation, it said. The library is a three-storey annex to the main building.        
	Bedbug infestations have been found in many public and commercial buildings throughout New York city indicating a worsening problem, the UN statement said.        
	In August, the pest extermination company Terminex said that New York is the most bedbug-infested urban centre in the US. Other cities in the top five were Philadelphia, Detroit, Cincinnati and Chicago.

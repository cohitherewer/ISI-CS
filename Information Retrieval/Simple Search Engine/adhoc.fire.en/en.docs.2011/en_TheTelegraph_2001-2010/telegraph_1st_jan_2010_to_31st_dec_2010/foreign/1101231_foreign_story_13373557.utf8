The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Twitter to the rescue of stranded travellers
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Twitter to the rescue of stranded travellers
          KIM SEVERSON                          Fast lane                                  
	Atlanta, Dec. 30: Some travellers stranded by the great snowstorm of 2010 discovered a new lifeline for help. When all else fails, Twitter might be the best way to book a seat home.         
	While the airlines reservation lines required hours of waiting  if people could get through at all  savvy travellers were able to book new reservations, get flight information and track lost luggage. And they could complain, too.         
	Since Monday, nine Delta Air Lines agents with special Twitter training have been rotating shifts to help travellers wired enough to know how to dm, or send a direct message. Many other airlines are doing the same as a way to help travellers cut through the confusion of a storm that has grounded thousands of flights this week.         
	But not all travellers, of course. People who could not send a Twitter message if their life depended on it found themselves with that familiar feeling that often comes with air travel  being left out of yet another inside track to get the best information.         
	For those in the digital fast lane, however, the online help was a godsend.         
	Danielle Heming spent five hours on Wednesday waiting for a flight from Fort Myers, Florida, back home to New York. Finally, it was cancelled.         
	Facing overwhelmed JetBlue ticketing agents, busy signals on the phone and the possibility that she might not get a seat until New Years day, she remembered that a friend had rebooked her flight almost immediately by sending a Twitter message to the airline.         
	She got out her iPhone, did a few searches and sent a few messages. Within an hour, she had a seat on another airline and a refund from JetBlue.         
	It was a much, much better way to deal with this situation, said Heming, 30, a student at New York University. It was just the perfect example of this crazy, fast-forward techno world.         
	Although airlines reported a doubling or tripling of Twitter traffic during the latest storm, the number of travellers who use Twitter is still small.         
	Only about 8 per cent of people who go online use Twitter, said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project, a non-profit organisation that studies the social impact of the Internet.         
	Of course, an agent with a Twitter account cannot magically make a seat appear. More often than not, the agents role is to listen to people complain. DeltaAssist is worthless, wrote Amy Zopfi who was stuck for hours in Salt Lake.

	Madonna gym    
	 Moscow, Dec. 10 (Reuters): Queen of pop and health guru Madonna will open a gym early next year near Red Square for Moscows designer-clad elite, who spend exorbitant sums on a fitness frenzy that has gripped the capital.      
	The state-of-the-art gym, to open in mid-March, will be the second of Madonnas Hard Candy Fitness gyms. The 52-year-old launched the brand in Mexico City last month. I know that we will create the ideal workout environment in Moscow, she said.

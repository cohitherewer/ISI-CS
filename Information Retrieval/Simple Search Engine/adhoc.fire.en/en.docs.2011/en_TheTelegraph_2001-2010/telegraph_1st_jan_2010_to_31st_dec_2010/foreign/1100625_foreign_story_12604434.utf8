	Sargodha, Pakistan, June 24 (AP): Five American men were convicted today on terror charges by a Pakistani court and sentenced to 10 years in prison in a case that has heightened concerns about westerners travelling to Pakistan to contact al Qaida and other extremist groups.        
	The trial of the young Muslim men from the Washington DC area was sensitive for the US, which has a duty to ensure justice for its citizens abroad but also has pushed Pakistan to crack down on militancy.        
	Prosecutors said email records and witness statements proved they used the Internet to plot terror attacks in Pakistan and nations allied with it. The father of one of the men said they were in Pakistan to attend his sons wed ding, but had intended to cross into Afghanistan for humanitarian work.        
	The judge handed down two prison terms for each man, one for 10 years on a criminal conspiracy charge, and the other for five years on the charge of funding banned organisations for terrorism. A copy of the decision seen by The Associated Press said the terms were to be served concurrently.        
	The men, all in their 20s, had faced up to life in prison. They were acquitted of three charges, including planning to wage war against the US and Afghanistan  allies of Pakistan.        
	The men said nothing when the verdict was read out, deputy prosecutor Rana Bakhtiar said.        
	Previously, the men claimed they were tortured by Pakistani police and FBI agents, charges denied by authorities here and in the US. Their lawyers said they would appeal the case.        
	The trial moved with unusual speed in a country where cases often drag out for years and where terror convictions are rare and often overturned on appeal.         
	The trial was closed to journalists and observers and was heard by a single judge in a special anti-terrorism court.        
	The men have been identified as Ramy Zamzam of Egyptian descent, Waqar Khan and Umar Farooq of Pakistani descent, and Aman Hassan Yemer and Ahmed Minni of Ethiopian descent. One allegedly left behind a farewell video in the US showing scenes of war and casualties and saying Muslims must be defended.        
	Umar Farooqs father, Khalid Farooq, called the verdict a great disappointment and insisted the men had not planned to fight in Afghanistan, but had wanted to do humanitarian work such as helping orphans.        
	The men also wanted to see Umar get married in Sargodha, the father said.        
	The men were arrested at Farooqs home in Sargodha after he said he told them to avoid Afghanistan.         
	I will right away go to the high court, even to the International Court of Justice, to get these innocent youths justice, said Farooq, who was not allowed to watch the trial.

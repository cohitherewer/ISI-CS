	Beijing, Oct. 18 (Reuters): China must make a major breakthrough in its industry-heavy growth and advance vigorous but steady political reform to keep the worlds second-biggest economy from faltering, Communist Party leaders said today.        
	Chinas map for a new phase of growth driven by spending by hundreds of millions of workers and farmers was issued at the end of a party Central Committee meeting, which settled on the nations next five-year development plan starting in 2011.        
	Over that time, the Chinese economy is forecast to grow by around 50 per cent to $7.5 trillion, powering past Japan and moving closer to the biggest economy by far, the US.        
	But officials fear domestic imbalances could drag down that ascent by suppressing demand and stirring unrest. Premier Wen Jiabao has said growth could be stifled if the government fails to become more open and accountable.        
	China aims to achieve major breakthroughs in economic restructuring and maintain stable and relatively fast economic growth, the party meeting decided, according to the official Xinhua news agency.        
	The one-party government will also make vigorous yet steady efforts to promote political restructuring, Xinhua reported.        
	There are no signs that any political reforms would threaten the partys iron grip on power.        
	The 200 or so voting members of the committee promoted Vice-President Xi Jinping to the body overseeing the Peoples Liberation Army, making clearer that he is likely to succeed President Hu Jintao as top leader after late 2012.        
	Whatever their final pecking order, Chinas rising leaders are likely to stick to the current recipe of refocusing the economy on domestic demand and avoiding bold political experiments.        
	President Hu has said China must generate more inclusive growth, narrowing the gap between a wealthy urban elite and millions of workers and farmers.        
	The share of personal income in the distribution of national income should be increased, the meeting announcement said.        
	Zhang Ping, head of the National Development and Reform Commission, an agency that steers economic policy, said the key to shoring up economic growth was stronger social welfare and cheaper housing to unfetter household consumption.        
	Expanding domestic demand is the guiding long-term strategy of our countrys economic and social development, Zhang told a Communist Party newspaper, the Study Times.        
	The focus of the next stage of economic work must be tapping the role of domestic demand, especially consumer demand, in generating economic growth, he told the paper, issued by the Central Party School, which trains rising officials.        
	Tapping greater household spending while easing strains on resources and the environment presents Beijing with a daunting list of reforms that could hit the raw nerves of companies and government officials who have benefited from current policies.

	Aug. 13: Champagne is considered possibly the finest drink created, but it now turns out its enjoyment rests on how you pour the sparkling wine just as much as who made it.        
	A leading French scientist has proclaimed that there is a correct way to pour champagne into a glass. Namely, drinkers should pour it just as they would a bottle of fizzy cola or bottle of beer  by tilting the glass.        
	Though the technique is instinctive to barmen around the world, perhaps only a French professor  and one based in Champagne at that  would dedicate months of study into how best to transfer the liquid from the bottle to a glass.        
	 Prof. Grard Liger-Belair at the University of Reims conducted a series of tests, including using thermographic equipment, into how much carbon dioxide was lost during the process of pouring champagne.         
	They used two different pouring methods, at three different temperatures. One involved pouring champagne straight down the middle of a glass  The champagne method, according to Prof Liger-Belair. This is the method employed by hosts nervous about their guests glasses overflowing with bubbles.         
	The other method involved pouring champagne down the side of an angled glass, as if it were beer. It preserved up to twice as much carbon dioxide, crucial for passing on the distinctive taste and mouth feel of the sparkling wine. They also showed that cooler champagne temperatures help reduce carbon dioxide loss.

	Dhaka, Dec. 14 (Reuters): A fire at a multi-storey garment factory near Dhaka killed up to 24 people today and injured more than 100, television channels said.         
	More than 10,000 people, most of them women, work at the complex, Arifa Ahmed, an official of the factory owned by the Hamim Group, said.        
	The good luck was that many of them were out for lunch (when the fire started), Ahmed said.        
	Firefighters were trying to douse the blaze and rescuers were retrieving the injured and getting trapped workers out of the factory at Ashulia, 25km north of the capital.         
	Police and fire service officials told Reuters that there were casualties, but could not say how many.         
	At least 50 people with serious burns were taken to hospitals.

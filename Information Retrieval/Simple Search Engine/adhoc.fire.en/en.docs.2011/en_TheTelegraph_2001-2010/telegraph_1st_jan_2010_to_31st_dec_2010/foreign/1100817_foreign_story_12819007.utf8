The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 3.5m children in Pak at risk: UN
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      3.5m children in Pak at risk: UN

	Islamabad, Aug. 16: As Pakistan reels from its worst floods in memory, UN officials said today that 3.5 million children and infants were at a particularly high risk of diseases borne by dirty water.        
	Clean water is an urgent need, said Maurizio Giuliano, a UN spokesman, who said the international agencies dealing with children and health were both suffering from shortages of funds. The UN, whose secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, flew over flooded areas of Pakistan yesterday, has appealed for international donations of $460 million, but only one-third of that of that has been provided, Giuliano said in a telephone interview.        
	There was a first wave of deaths caused by the floods themselves, Giuliano said.         
	But if we dont act soon enough there will be a second wave of deaths caused by a combination of lack of clean water, food shortages and water-borne and vector-borne diseases.        
	He said as many as six million people were at risk of diseases including diarrhoea-related illnesses and dysentery, typhoid and forms of hepatitis. We may be close to seeing this second wave of death, he said. The picture is a gruesome one.        
	With a shortage of aid funds, relief workers were currently able to provide clean water to only one million of the 6 million people in need, Giuliano said. Many people had no adequate shelter or proper food, he said, and, as in any crisis, children are among the most vulnerable.        
	The long-term economic and political damage wrought by the huge inundation is also likely to be costly. Roads, bridges and communications networks across the country have been severely damaged, Pakistani officials said.        
	Arbab Alamgir Khan, the federal minister for communications, said damage to roads alone was estimated at around $76 million, much of it in the northern province of Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, where the floods started as monsoon rains pounded down earlier this month.        
	The threat of long-term damage has raised fears that the flood damage in Pakistan, a central pillar of American regional strategy to combat the Taliban and al Qaida, will add further instability to a mix of weak government and economic woes.        
	In the latest surge, floodwater submerged vast areas of Baluchistan and Sindh after causing massive destruction in the countrys north and in central Punjab .        
	Television footage from helicopters showed a seemingly endless vista of muddy water, freckled with palm trees. The distribution of aid seemed chaotic in some parts with people jostling for handfuls of food thrown from trucks.        
	In Baluchistan in the southwest, rail service was suspended for three days starting today from the provincial capital, Quetta, to Punjab and Sindh and floods were threatening the town of Osta Muhammad. Officials said today they were trying to evacuate thousands of residents there, while thousands more were stranded in Dera Murad Jamali town. In Punjab, a second round of flooding threatened some areas.

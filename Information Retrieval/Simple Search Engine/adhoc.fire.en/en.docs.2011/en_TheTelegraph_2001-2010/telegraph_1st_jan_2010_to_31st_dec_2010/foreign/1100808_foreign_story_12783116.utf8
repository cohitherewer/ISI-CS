                              HUGE FAN                            
	Aug. 7: Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has been offered a part in the hit US crime series CSI.        
	 Producers have asked the French First Lady to accept a role after she wrote to Hollywood executives telling them she was a fan of the show.        
	Carol Mendolson, a producer from the show, said she was preparing to make a two-hour long CSI television movie set in Paris. Carla Bruni wrote to us to say she absolutely adored our show, she told Frances Pure People. So we would be delighted to offer her a part in our CSI film set in France.        
	She may live to regret the offer, however, after it emerged Carla Bruni-Sarkozy recently took 35 takes to get a scene right in a walk-on role in Woody Allens latest film Midnight in Paris.         
	According to witnesses, she was forced to shoot so many times because she kept looking directly into the camera. She seemed to be struggling to avoid looking directly into the camera, which didnt impress Woody, one said.        
	The scene could not have been simpler, but she wanted to make it a big one. Thats why she had to keep shooting it over and over again.

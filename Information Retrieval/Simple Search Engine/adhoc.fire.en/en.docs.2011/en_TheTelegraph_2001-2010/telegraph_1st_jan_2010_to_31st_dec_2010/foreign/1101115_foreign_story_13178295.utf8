	Dhaka, Nov. 14: A 15-hour drama played out yesterday led to a strike that brought Bangladesh to a standstill today.         
	The process to evict former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia from her home of 38 years started around 7am yesterday and ended late afternoon with her leaving the cantonment house, by when streets in the country were already laden with violence.         
	The latest political feud between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Awami League over the house, the ownership of which has been challenged in Bangladeshs top court, today spilled over to the streets of the country with clashes being reported from all major cities.         
	Hundreds of anti-riot police wielding tear-gas bombs were seen standing on roads as activists  protesting the alleged forcible eviction of the leader of the Opposition and BNP party chief Zia from her house yesterday  resorted to violence during the dawn-to-dusk strike that the party had announced yesterday.         
	Perhaps among the worst affected today were the hundreds who had planned to go home for Id-ul- Zuha. Now, they are not only stranded on the streets on the eve of the festival but are also vulnerable to violence.         
	Earlier in the afternoon, a bus was set on fire and a Molotov cocktail was hurled at a police van as protesters held the nation hostage. Dozens were reported injured as clashes erupted in all the major cities of the country. Among those injured are a former minister and a policeman when violence erupted in BNPs regional office in Chittagong, one of the countrys biggest cities. BNPs headquarters in central Dhaka was cordoned off by barbed wire and the police used coloured water to disperse lawyers who were supporting the strike outside the Supreme Court.         
	Most shops and businesses in Dhaka and in other parts of the country remained closed fearing damage, while many office-goers were seen walking to their offices in the morning. Schools were closed and at least two major exams were called off due to the strike.         
	A police van was burnt by rioters in Dhaka even as the government encased the city in a tight security ring with at least 10,000 heavily armed policemen and 2,000 members of the elite Rapid Action Battalion patrolling the streets.         
	Policemen in Dhaka were seen chasing away protesters as they threw stones at vehicles that were plying despite the strike. At least 100 people were arrested for being involved in sporadic clashes with the police and damaging vehicles.         
	This is the second time that a strike has been called by the Opposition during the current governments tenure. The first was called on June 27 this year.         
	In a news conference, a BNP secretary general told the media that the party had decided to step up anti- government protests after Id-ul-Zuha.         
	The people have not only expressed their lack of confidence, but also their hatred towards the government. But we know that even then the government will not be alert, he said. So, we will go for tougher movement until the government quits.         
	They swooped down on our workers like tigers, charging batons indiscriminately and arresting them at random, he said, accusing the police of brutally stopping his activists from protesting         
	He also claimed that at least 150 activists were arrested throughout the country.         
	Hours after her eviction yesterday from the cantonment residence, 66-year-old Zia said that she was humiliatingly dragged out of the house in clothes she was wearing.         
	The government had controversially leased the house in 1981 to the BNP chief following her husband and ex-president Ziaur Rahmans assassination.

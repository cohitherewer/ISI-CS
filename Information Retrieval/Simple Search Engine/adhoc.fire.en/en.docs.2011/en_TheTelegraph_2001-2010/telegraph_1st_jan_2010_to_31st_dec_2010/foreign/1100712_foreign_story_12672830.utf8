                              Naoto Kan: Vulnerable                            
	Tokyo, July 11 (Reuters): Voters dealt Japans government a stinging blow in upper house elections today, a reverse that could thwart its ambitions to curb the countrys massive public debt and threaten Prime Minister Naoto Kans job.        
	Kans Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) were set to win just 47 seats and its tiny partner, the Peoples New Party, none, losing their combined majority in parliaments upper house, exit polls showed.        
	The polls show the Democrats far short of Kans goal of winning 54 seats, a result that leaves him vulnerable to a challenge from inside his own party.        
	Kan, however, was quoted by public broadcaster NHK as telling a ruling party lawmaker that he would stay.        
	The Democrats, who have relied on the support of the Peoples New Party to control the upper house, will almost certainly stay in power by virtue of their majority in parliaments lower house.        
	But they will need to seek new partners to control the upper chamber, complicating policymaking as Japan struggles to engineer growth and rein in public debt nearly twice the size of GDP.        
	Kan lost the election calling for a sales tax hike, said Koichi Haji, chief economist at NLI Research Institute. That is a huge setback for fiscal reform. Now the question is whether Kan can stay in power or not.        
	The Democrats swept to power last year promising to cut waste and focus spending on consumers to boost growth.

          FIONA GOVAN                          Bardem and Cruz: Match made in Oscar heaven                                  
	Madrid, July 14: Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem have married in a secret ceremony in the Bahamas, it emerged today.        
	The Oscar-winning Spanish actors, who fell in love on the set of Woody Allens 2008 romantic comedy Vicky Cristina Barcelona, tied the knot earlier this month, ending months of speculation over their nuptial plans.        
	The couple were married in the beginning of July at a friends house in the Bahamas. It was a small ceremony with just family members.        
	The bride wore a dress designed by John Galliano, her longtime friend according to Cruzs Hollywood publicist Amanda Silverman.        
	Cruz, 36, and Bardem, 41, met when they starred opposite each other as lusty teens in Bigas Lunas film Jamon, Jamon, in 1992. But it was not until they were cast together as a couple with a tempestuous relationship in Woody Allens comedy 15 years later that they formed an off-screen romance.        
	Cruz, a longtime muse of Spanish director Pedro Almodovar, has previously been linked romantically with Hollywood actors Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey. She won a best supporting actress Oscar in 2009 for her role in Vicky Cristina Barcelona.        
	Bardem, won an Academy Award in 2007 for his role as a psychopathic hitman in No Country for Old Men.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

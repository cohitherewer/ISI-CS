	Nov. 20: The Prince of Wales has indicated for the first time that the Duchess of Cornwall could become Queen Camilla when he ascends to the throne.        
	Until now, the prince has always stuck to the line that his wife will be known as Princess Consort when he is king. But in an interview on US television, he suggested the duchess could be given the title of Queen.        
	The proposed title of Princess Consort was concocted under the previous Labour government to minimise controversy when the prince married his second wife in 2005.        
	At the time, ministers and royal aides were concerned that the public had not warmed to the duchess, and felt the prospect of her becoming queen would not be accepted.        
	With the death of Diana, Princess of Wales still fresh in the memory, it was also decided that the duchess should avoid using the title Princess of Wales. The prince, however, has always believed privately that the duchess should become his queen, and in the last five years her down-to-earth manner has made her increasingly popular with the British people.        
	Asked by NBCs Brian Williams if the duchess would become queen, the prince, who seemed taken aback by the question, said: Thats, wellwell see, wont we? That could be.        
	Although aides insisted the prince had been caught off guard and there had been no change in the official position, the comment will be seen by many as an indication of his inner thoughts. The interview was recorded in August at the Castle of Mey.

          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, May 19: A Pakistani court on Wednesday ordered the telecommunication authorities to block Facebook for inviting its members to post caricatures considered blasphemous.        
	The short order by the Lahore High Court came on a petition filed by a group of local lawyers, as thousands of Facebook members in Pakistan expressed strong indignation, describing decision of the Facebook management to post the cartoons as quot;highly condemnable quot;.        
	Judge Sajjad Chaudhry, in his short order, directed Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) to immediately block the Facebook, which has hurt feelings of millions of Muslims all over the world.        
	 quot;Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom has directed the PTA to block the URL of the Facebook Fan Page in Pakistan quot;, a senior government official said in Islamabad.        
	 An official of the PTA,which regulates internet traffic in the country, said such material absolutely stood against the values of religious         
	tolerance and peaceful coexistence arousing deep anguish and distress across the Muslim world.        
	 Hundreds of people posted their comments on different blogs, condemning the Facebook management and describing the act as quot;outrageous. quot;        
	 quot;What the Facebook management has done is highly condemnable and should serve as an eye opener for every one particularly Muslims, quot; said Mateen Haider while posting his comments on Googlegroups blog.        
	 Another blogger Agha Ali Raza called for boycotting the Facebook to quot;show faith and love for Prophet Muhammad quot;.        
	He added that, quot;This is the right time to act in a strong way and We (the Muslim) should all deactivate Facebook account permanently quot;        
	Six people were killed and dozens of others injured all over Pakistan in January 2006 during violent protests over publication of similar blasphemous cartoons in Danish and some other European newspapers.         
	Pakistan government recently refused to extend visa of an Islamabad-based correspondent of Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten over repeated publication of sacrilegious cartoons and informed him that Islamabad could not longer guarantee his security.        
	The Jyllands-Posten and its rival Politiken published a series of blasphemous cartoons which annoyed Muslims all over the world and sparked angry protests in 2005 and 2006.

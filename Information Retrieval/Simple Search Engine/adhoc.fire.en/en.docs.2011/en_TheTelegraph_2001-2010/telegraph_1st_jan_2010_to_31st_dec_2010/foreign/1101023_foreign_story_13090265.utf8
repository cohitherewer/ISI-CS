	Beijing, Oct. 22: Thousands of Tibetan students in western China have protested since Tuesday against proposals to curb or eliminate the use of the Tibetan language in local schools, according to reports from Tibet advocacy groups and photographs and video of the protests circulating on the Internet.        
	The protests are the largest in Tibetan areas since the March 2008 uprising that began in Lhasa and spread across the Tibetan plateau. But unlike those protests, these have been peaceful and have involved mostly students.        
	A protest against the proposed policies was also held in Beijing this afternoon, drawing hundreds of Tibetan students at a prominent university that specialises in teaching ethnic minorities, according to witness reports and photographs.        
	The widespread protests over language reveal the deep resentment that many Tibetans feel over policies formulated by the Han, Chinas dominant ethnic group, that Tibetans say are diluting their culture.         
	The latest resistance is over a proposal to shift school instruction fully or almost fully to Chinas official language, Mandarin. The protests this week have mostly unfolded in Tibetan towns in Qinghai province, a vast, sparsely populated region.

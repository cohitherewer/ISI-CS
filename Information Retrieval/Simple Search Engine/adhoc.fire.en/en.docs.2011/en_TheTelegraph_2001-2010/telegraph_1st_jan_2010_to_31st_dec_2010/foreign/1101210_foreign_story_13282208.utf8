                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Putin lashes out at West over leaks

	Moscow, Dec. 9 (Reuters): Prime Minister Vladimir Putin lashed out at the US today over leaked US diplomatic cables, saying the West had no right to preach to Russia about democracy.        
	When asked about cables which cast him as Russias alpha-dog ruler of a corrupt and undemocratic bureaucracy, Putin snaspped: Do you think the American diplomatic service is a crystal clean source of information? Do you think so?        
	He then went on to criticise the West over the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. If it is full democracy, then why have they hidden Assange in prison? Thats what, democracy? Putin said.        
	So, you know, as they say in the countryside, some peoples cows can moo, but yours should keep quiet. So I would like to shoot the puck back at our American colleagues, Putin said at a briefing.        
	The phrase is a colloquial term which is a Russian equivalent of the pot calling the kettle black.        
	The leaked US cables cast Putin as a ruler who allows a venal elite of corrupt officials and crooked spies to siphon off cash from the worlds biggest energy producer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Knight and Day to test if Tom is the guy
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Knight and Day to test if Tom is the guy

	Los Angeles, June 26 (AP): Early in his latest spy caper, Knight and Day, Tom Cruise flashes that billion-dollar grin and proclaims: Im the guy.        
	But is he?        
	Cruise definitely is the guy who rang up $3 billion at the domestic box office since the early 1980s, making him one of the most enduring hit makers in Hollywood history. He also is the guy who veered into his own personal bizarro world with Scientology rants that alienated or even offended fans and his love-drunk bouncing act on Oprah Winfreys couch as he proclaimed his devotion to Katie Holmes.        
	His box-office returns soured, and he made some career choices which, while not disastrous, were not the sort to restore a stumbling star to the audiences good graces.        
	With Cruises erratic behaviour now a few years in the past, Knight and Day is the first real test of whether the dashing idol of Top Gun and Rain Man has lost his appeal.        
	The short answer is, I hope not. Those challenges have been there, but I think he has moved past that, said Chris Aronson, head of domestic distribution for 20th Century Fox, the studio behind Knight and Day. I think he still is the guy. If you look over the course of history, there are very few actors who are the guy as long as he has been and are still rolling along.        
	Enough time has passed, and he has tried to make amends, said Chuck Walton, an editor for movie-ticket website Fandango.com. This is sort of the perfect summer movie vehicle for him. I think most, if not all, is forgiven. ... Look at Robert Downey Jr. Hes had plenty of things in the past and it hasnt stopped him.        
	It is Cruises first all-out action adventure since 2006s Mission: Impossible III and the first movie since 1996s Jerry Maguire in which he turns on his romantic charm.        
	The movie reunites Cruise with Vanilla Sky co-star Cameron Diaz. Known for a tireless work ethic, Cruise hurled himself into action scenes that could have been handled by stunt men and continually added spontaneous flourishes to his character, said Knight and Day director James Mangold.        
	 The quot;Im the guy quot; exchange was Cruises invention, Mangold        
	said. Diazs June Havens, who restores classic cars for a living,        
	has just had a near-fatal encounter with Cruises Roy Miller, a        
	secret agent who might be a good guy or a rogue spy gone bad.        
	 When Roy reappears in her life, June stammers to her        
	ex-boyfriend, quot;This is the guy. quot; Cruise riffs off that line and        
	delivers a memorable moment as Roy beams and agrees, repeating quot;Im        
	the guy quot; like a mantra.        
	 quot;None of that was written. It was just Tom overhearing her and        
	just flowing, creating a vibe on the set, quot; Mangold said. quot;Im the        
	guy. Hey, Im the guy. You realize on how many levels this was        
	true. He is the guy in the movie. He is the spy, he is the romantic        
	lead who will sweep her off her feet.        
	 quot;Hes also just the guy. I am Tom Cruise, and I am here, and I        
	will knock it out of the park. quot;        
	 Whether quot;Knight and Day quot; will be a home run or a swing and a        
	miss is in the hands of fans now. Distributor Fox feels it has a        
	good movie, but quot;Knight and Day quot; is a tough sell, an original        
	story not based on a comic book, video game or other property with        
	built-in familiarity.        
	 Besides the uncertainty of Cruises box-office pep, quot;Knight and        
	Day quot; arrives during a fitful period for Hollywood. It is the time        
	of year when movie fans traditionally flock to blockbusters, only        
	this year known quantities such as quot;Sex and the City 2, quot; quot;The        
	A-Team quot; and Russell Crowes quot;Robin Hood quot; have failed to live up        
	to expectations.        
	 Already stung by weak returns for quot;The A-Team quot; and        
	 quot;Marmaduke, quot; Fox has scrambled to build buzz for quot;Knight and        
	Day quot; with sneak peak screenings last Saturday in about 500        
	theaters. The studio also moved up the release date by two days to        
	last Wednesday, hoping audiences will talk up the film and boost        
	ticket sales through the weekend.        
	 Opening weekend often is a make-or-break deal. But quot;Knight and        
	Day quot; has it harder than most movies, sandwiched between two of the        
	seasons biggest releases, last weekends blockbuster quot;Toy Story        
	3 quot; and next weeks hotly anticipated sequel quot;The Twilight Saga:        
	Eclipse. quot;        
	 If quot;Knight and Day quot; does not find an audience this weekend, it        
	probably never will.        
	 quot;Everybodys nervous about every movie this summer. If Sex and        
	the City or a Russell Crowe movie underperform, why wouldnt you be        
	worried about a film like Knight and Day? quot; said Paul        
	Dergarabedian, box-office analyst for entertainment Web site        
	Hollywood.com. quot;There are no sure bets anymore. The audience is so        
	fickle that you just dont know. quot;        
	 Cruise turns 48 next month, and while he retains his boyish good        
	looks, its hard to maintain an action career at that age and        
	beyond, particularly with the personal baggage dogging him.        
	 As his public image sagged in 2006, quot;Mission: Impossible III quot;        
	came out to some of the best reviews in the series, yet it took in        
	just $134 million, by far the worst return for the franchise.        
	 Cruise has done serious roles, earning Academy Awards nominations        
	for quot;Born on the Fourth of July, quot; quot;Jerry Maguire quot; and        
	 quot;Magnolia. quot; His three films since quot;Mission: Impossible III quot;        
	showed new sides to the actor, with middling results.        
	 The war-on-terror drama quot;Lions for Lambs quot; flopped, part of        
	Cruises ill-fated effort to revive moribund United Artists, the        
	banner whose founders included Charles Chaplin and D.W. Griffith.        
	 He drew praise for a hilarious supporting role in quot;Tropic        
	Thunder, quot; playing a bald, foul-mouthed studio boss. Cruise reprised        
	the character at the recent MTV Movie Awards, and he is planning to        
	play him again in a big-screen spinoff.        
	 Cruise critics gleefully laid in wait to mock quot;Valkyrie, quot; his        
	World War II Nazi saga in which he donned an eyepatch to play the        
	German colonel who led an assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler. The        
	movie wound up getting decent reviews, and while it was not a big        
	hit, it did respectable business.        
	 A fourth quot;Mission: Impossible quot; installment is in the works,        
	though coming after quot;Knight and Day, quot; even Cruise fans think he        
	needs to focus less on the spy game and find more diverse roles.        
	 quot;When I first heard about Knight and Day being put into        
	production, I thought, another spy movie, quot; said Daniel Hubschman,        
	content coordinator for Hollywood.com and a Cruise fan since he saw        
	 quot;Top Gun quot; at age 7. quot;I would like to see Tom Cruise move away        
	from spy action. Whether its comedy, straight-up action, sci-fi        
	action. Thats the one thing that might detract from this movie. quot;        
	 Even if quot;Knight and Day quot; flops, the film reveals that he has        
	not lost the magnetism that made him a star in the first place. He        
	will have other shots to restore his box-office trajectory, whether        
	with quot;Mission: Impossible IV quot; or some other project.        
	 quot;I saw my first Tom Cruise movie when I was in high school. Ive        
	grown up with him as a star of my generation, and THE star of my        
	generation, quot; said quot;Knight and Day quot; director Mangold. quot;With his        
	talent and uncanny relationship with the camera, hes one of the few        
	true movie stars in the last century of film. quot;

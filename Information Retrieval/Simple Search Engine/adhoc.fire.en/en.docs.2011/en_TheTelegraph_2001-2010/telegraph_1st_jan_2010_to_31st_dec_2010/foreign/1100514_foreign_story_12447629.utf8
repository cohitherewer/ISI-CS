	New York, May 13: Federal authorities today raided several locations in the northeast and took many people into custody as part of an ongoing investigation into the failed Times Square car bombing, according to a statement released by the FBI in Boston.        
	It said the actions do not relate to any known immediate threat to the public or active plot against the United States and were undertaken based on evidence that was gathered in the investigation that followed the car bomb attempt on May 1.        
	We can confirm that search warrants have been executed in several locations in the northeast in connection with the investigation into the attempted Times Square bombing, said the statement, released by the office of Warren Bamford, the special agent in charge of the FBIs Boston office.        
	A number of people who were encountered by the agents as they executed the warrants were taken into custody for immigration violations, the statement said.        
	It added that the bureau could provide no further details, citing the ongoing investigation. The US attorneys office in Manhattan, which is prosecuting the case, and the New York FBI office, which is handling the investigation into the failed attack, both declined to comment.        
	Faisal Shahzad, a Pakistani-born US citizen, has been charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction in the Times Square bomb attempt. He has yet to appear in the US district court in Manhattan, and law enforcement officials have said he is cooperating.        
	Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. has said the Pakistani Taliban helped with the bombing attempt.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

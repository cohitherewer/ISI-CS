	8 Gagas in wax    
	 London, Nov. 6 (PTI): Popstar Lady Gaga is all set to surpass her rivals as Madame Tussauds is planning to introduce not one but eight wax figures of the eccentric singer in its museums.       
	She will be immortalised with a series of wax models that will be enshrined as a part of a multi-million dollar project.       
	The Gaga figures will highlight eight of her most famous looks, including the Phillip Tracey telephone hat she wore in London earlier this year and the white dress and lace face mask she donned at the 2010 Brit Awards.      
	A statement from Madame Tussauds says: As one of the biggest and most unique talents in the world, she is the perfect subject for the biggest figure launch in Madame Tussaudss history. All styles being worked on are classic Gaga. The launch will be the biggest in the history of the museum chain.

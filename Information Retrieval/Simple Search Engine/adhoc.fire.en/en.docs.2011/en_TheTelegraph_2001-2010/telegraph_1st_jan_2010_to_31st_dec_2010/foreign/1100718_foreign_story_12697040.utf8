The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lohan will go to jail: Lawyer
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lohan will go to jail: Lawyer
                                Lohan and Shapiro	                          
	Los Angeles, July 17 (Reuters): Lindsay Lohans new attorney, celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro, said yesterday the troubled actress will go to jail as recently ordered by the judge overseeing her probation.        
	Last week, California Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel ordered Lohan to begin serving a 90-day jail sentence on July 20 for violating the terms of her probation on drunk driving charges because Lohan had missed alcohol education classes.        
	Since then, Lohans previous attorney, Shawn Chapman Holley, resigned and media reports surfaced on Thursday this week that Lohan hired Shapiro but may be trying to avoid jail.        
	I have agreed to represent Ms Lohan on the condition she comply with the terms of probation, including a requirement of jail imposed by Judge Marsha Revel, Shapiro said in a statement yesterday.        
	Ms Lohan is suffering from a disease that I am all too familiar with. Hopefully, I can be of assistance to Ms Lohan and Judge Revel in implementing a treatment approach recommended by medical professionals for Ms Lohans long term recovery and sobriety, the statement said.        
	Shapiro is a well-known Los Angeles attorney who has represented many Hollywood stars over the years, and he was part of the dream team of attorneys who represented football player .J. Simpson in his trial for the murder of his wife. Shapiros son Brent died in 2005 due to a combination of drinking alcohol and taking the drug ecstasy. Since then, Shapiro has been dedicated himself to helping others overcome their own addiction problems.

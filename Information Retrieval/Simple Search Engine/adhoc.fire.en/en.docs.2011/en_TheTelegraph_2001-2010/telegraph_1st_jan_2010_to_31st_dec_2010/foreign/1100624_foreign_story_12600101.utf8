The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama boots out general over magazine interview
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama boots out general over magazine interview

	Washington, June 23: President Obama removed Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal as commander of American forces in Afghanistan today, and tapped as his replacement the generals boss, Gen. David H. Petraeus, the architect of the 2007 surge in Iraq.        
	Obama, standing with Petraeus and Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr in the White House Rose Garden to underline the continuity and solidity of his Afghan policy, said that he had regretfully accepted McChrystals resignation.        
	Obama said he had done so not out of personal insult, but because a magazine article featuring contemptuous quotes from the general and his staff about senior administration officials had not met standards of behaviour for a commanding general, and threatened to undermine civilian control of the military.        
	War is bigger than any one man or woman, whether a private, a general or President, Obama said. As difficult as it is to lose General McChrystal, I believe it is the right decision for national security.        
	I welcome debate among my team, he said, but I wont tolerate division.        
	Obama stressed that the change in leadership did not signal a shift in his overall war strategy in Afghanistan, where thousands of new American troop levels have been arriving in recent months among increasing casualties and growing questions about the progress of the war.         
	It is a change in personnel, but it is not a change in policy, Obama said.        
	Earlier today, McChrystal met President Obama for about 20 minutes . He and Obama began their one-on-one discussion just before 10am (local time), after the general had met military leaders at the Pentagon.The article in Rolling Stone magazine quoted McChrystal and his aides speaking critically of nearly every member of the Presidents national security team, saying President Obama appeared uncomfortable and intimidated during his first meeting with the general, and dismissing Vice-President Biden as Bite Me.        
	Defence secretary Robert M. Gates, once the generals biggest supporter, criticised McChrystal for a significant mistake while Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was described by a senior aide as deeply disappointed by the comments. But Hamid Karzai, the Afghan President, and his powerful half brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, mounted a full-throated defence of McChrystal.        
	The infighting has been made more severe by the increasingly perilous situation on the ground. Violence in Afghanistan is on the rise. The mission to pacify Marja and Kandahar is far off track.

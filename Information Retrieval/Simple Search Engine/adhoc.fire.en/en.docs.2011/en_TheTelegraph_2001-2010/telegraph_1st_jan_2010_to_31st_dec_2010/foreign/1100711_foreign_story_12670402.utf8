  - Angry voice calls American soldiers uniformed assassins        LARRY ROHTER                          A bust of Mark Twain. (AP)                                        
	Wry and cranky, droll and cantankerous  thats the Mark Twain we think we know, thanks to reading Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer in high school.        
	But in his unexpurgated autobiography, whose first volume is about to be published a century after his death, a very different Twain emerges, more pointedly political and willing to play the role of the angry prophet.         
	Whether anguishing over American military interventions abroad or delivering jabs at Wall Street tycoons, this Twain is strikingly contemporary.        
	 Although the autobiography also contains its share of homespun tales, some of its observations about American life are so acerbic  at one point Twain refers to American soldiers as uniformed assassins  that his heirs and editors, as well as the writer himself, feared they would damage his reputation if not withheld.         
	From the first, second, third and fourth editions all sound and sane expressions of opinion must be left out, Twain instructed them in 1906. There may be a market for that kind of wares a century from now. There is no hurry. Wait and see.         
	Twains decree will be put to the test when the University of California Press publishes the first of three volumes of the 5,00,000-word Autobiography of Mark Twain in November.         
	Twain dictated most of it to a stenographer in the four years before his death at 74 on April 21, 1910. He argued that speaking his recollections and opinions, rather than writing them down, allowed him to adopt a more natural, colloquial and frank tone, and Twain scholars who have seen the manuscript agree.         
	In popular culture today, Twain is Colonel Sanders without the chicken, the avuncular man who told stories, Ron Powers, the author of Mark Twain: A Life, said in a phone interview. Hes been scrubbed and sanitised, and his passion has been kind of forgotten in all these long decades. But here he is talking to us, without any filtering at all, and what comes through that we have lost is precisely this fierce, unceasing passion.         
	Next week the British literary magazine Granta will publish an excerpt from the autobiography, called The Farm. In it, Twain recalls childhood visits to his uncles Missouri farm, reflects on slavery and the slave who served as the model for Jim in Huckleberry Finn, and offers an almost Proustian meditation on memory and remembrance, with watermelon and maple sap in place of Prousts madeleine.         
	I can see the farm yet, with perfect clearness, he writes. I can see all its belongings, all its details.         
	Of slavery, he notes that colour and condition interposed a subtle line between him and his black playmates, but confesses: In my schoolboy days, I had no aversion to slavery. I was not aware there was anything wrong about it.         
	Twains opposition to incipient imperialism and American military intervention in Cuba and the Philippines, for example, were well known even in his own time. But the uncensored autobiography makes it clear that those feelings ran very deep and includes remarks that, if made today in the context of Iraq or Afghanistan, would probably lead the right wing to question the patriotism of this most American of American writers.         
	In writing about an attack on a tribal group in the Philippines, Twain refers to American troops as our uniformed assassins and describes their killing of six hundred helpless and weaponless savages as a long and happy picnic with nothing to do but sit in comfort and fire the Golden Rule into those people down there and imagine letters to write home to the admiring families, and pile glory upon glory.         
	He is similarly unsparing about the plutocrats and Wall Street luminaries of his day, who he argued had destroyed the innate generosity of Americans and replaced it with greed and selfishness. The world believes that the elder Rockefeller is worth a billion dollars, Twain observes. He pays taxes on two million and a half.         
	The material in Volume 1 that was omitted from previous editions amounts to maybe as little as 5 per cent of the dictations, said Harriet E. Smith, chief editor of the autobiography. But there will be a much higher percentage in Volumes 2 and 3, each expected to be about 600 pages.         
	Some of Twains most critical remarks about individuals are directed at names that have faded from history. He is especially hard on a countess who owns the villa in which he lived with his family in Florence, Italy, in 1904. He describes her as excitable, malicious, malignant, vengeful, unforgiving, selfish, stingy, avaricious, coarse, vulgar, profane, obscene, a furious blusterer on the outside and at heart a coward.         
	On critics, he writes. I believe that the trade of critic, in literature, music, and the drama, is the most degraded of all trades, and that it has no real value, Twain writes. However, let it go, he adds. It is the will of God that we must have critics, and missionaries, and Congressmen, and humourists, and we must bear the burden.         
	As aggrieved as he sometimes appears in the autobiography, the reliable funnyman is in evidence too. Twain recalls being invited to an official White House dinner and being warned by his wife, Olivia, who stayed at home, not to wear his winter galoshes. At the White House, he sought out the first lady, Frances Cleveland, and got her to sign a card on which was written He didnt.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | India to find Pak tougher to handle
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      India to find Pak tougher to handle
          K.P. NAYAR                                    Zardari (top) and Kayani                                  
	Washington, Nov. 30: Dealing with Pakistan may become considerably more difficult for India following the leak of a quarter million secret US diplomatic cables, many of which show Islamabad, its rulers, its army and its policies in an unflattering light.        
	In a rare, but significant background briefing for editors at the armys General Headquarters in Rawalpindi yesterday, a very senior Pakistani military official referred to the WikiLeaks disclosures as proof that his country had transited from the most sanctioned ally to the most bullied ally of Washington.        
	Coinciding with the elaborate briefing, Pakistans Chief of Army Staff, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, called a meeting of his Corps Commanders, which takes place periodically at the General Headquarters.        
	Yesterday, however, Kayani also sought the participation of the armys Principal Staff Officers and Formation Commanders at this meeting, which discussed the security environment around the country and operational preparedness of the defence forces.        
	Although the official word was that the meeting and the briefing had nothing to do with WikiLeaks and was planned in advance, the leak of US diplomatic dispatches was known in advance and the general view was that Kayani was engaged in a morale-boosting exercise.        
	That New Delhi would find Pakistan more intransigent in bilateral dealings was evident from a key thrust in the briefing for editors where the military underlined that the armys approach would continue to be almost wholly India-centric.        
	Although the briefer sought anonymity from the editors, sources in Islamabad said that he was Kayani himself, aided by several generals.        
	His statement about Pakistan being the most bullied ally of the US is pregnant with significance for India. If the US continues to bully Pakistan, it is in no position to bully Washington back: at best, it can put up pinpricks for the Americans in the war against al Qaida and the Taliban. But even here, its options are limited because Pakistan relies on huge, billion-dollar handouts from Washington and its army relies almost entirely on American weaponry.        
	This came through in a briefing in Karachi  also yesterday  by the US Coordinator for Economic and Development Assistance to Pakistan, Robin Raphel, who insisted that aid to Pakistan was conditional on Islamabad broadening its tax net.        
	So Pakistans best bet is to bargain with US instead of alienating Washington and remaining friends at any cost. In a situation where the Americans are even making prescriptions to Pakistan on its tax laws, Islamabad is bound to feel more bullied instead of less.        
	So the worry in New Delhi is that, in return, Kayani and President Asif Ali Zardari will take out their frustrations on India.        
	The WikiLeaks disclosures are considerably humiliating for ordinary Pakistanis, not to speak of its establishment.         
	One cable quoted Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan describing Zardari to the Americans as dirty but not dangerous and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as dangerous but not dirty.        
	He then shrugs: This is Pakistan, implying what can you do with a country like that.        
	Another cable quotes Saudi Arabias head of state, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz as telling Americans that Zardari is the biggest obstacle to Pakistans progress. When the head is rotten, Abdullah adds, it affects the whole body.        
	These are comments by leaders whom successive Pakistanis in office have lauded as brothers.        
	In such a quandary, the easiest way to boost Pakistans battered self-esteem would be to be more tough on India, more uncompromising in negotiations with New Delhi and to step up militancy in Kashmir or terrorism elsewhere in India.        
	Already, the foreign office in Islamabad today set in motion what appeared to be an effort to paint the countrys establishment as patriotic and uncompromising in the face of a global assault on Pakistans pride and its sovereignty.        
	No one can touch Pakistans nuclear facilities and assets... Pakistan did not allow any transfer of the fuel from the experimental reactor, the foreign ministrys spokesman Abdul Basit said at a briefing.        
	His comment was in response to a leaked cable from May last year in which the US ambassador in Islamabad wrote that Pakistan had refused to permit a visit of technical experts to remove highly enriched uranium from a nuclear reactor in Nilore, near Islamabad.        
	The thrust of the spokesmans briefing was that Pakistan had stood its ground and that it would be uncompromising in its nuclear stance.         
	The logical next step to such bravado would be to be seen as being tough with India on Kashmir and other bilateral issues, which would give the government a diversion and greater credibility among its people.

	Moscow, March 29: Investigators were still marching in and out of the Lubyanka subway station this morning, but Nina Ivanovna, a 57-year-old pensioner, was not waiting around to hear what they were going to say.        
	She stared coldly at the staircase where wounded and weeping passengers had streamed away from the chaos of a suicide bombing, and said, with a curl of her lip, who she thought was behind it.        
	Its the Chechens, she said. They will never let us live in peace. Solzhenitsyn correctly said that we should build a Great Wall of China to keep them away from us. They should be locked away. They hate us, and they will always hate us.        
	During the six years since the last suicide bomb attack on the Moscow metro, Muscovites came to think of themselves as comfortably insulated from the guerrilla war going on in the Caucasus. They lost the jittery reflexes of a decade when Russians refused to board airplanes beside a veiled woman, or waited for the last train car because they assumed suicide bombers would get on at the front.        
	That fear reshaped the Russian state at the beginning of this decade. Vladimir V. Putin, then President, used the terrorist threat to justify a sweeping consolidation of power and was credited with bringing the years of violence to an end.         
	But old anxiety rushed back to the surface today, when commuters handed over wads of cash to taxis rather than descend into the subway.        
	Many were asking the same question: Is it starting again?        
	You know, I dont think it ever actually stopped, said Aleksandr Zharkov, 22, a graduate student in mathematics, standing near one of the bombing sites. He said he had sought out information on the Internet about fighting in the Caucasus, and been surprised by how much was still going on.         
	As long as its still going on there, he said, it can happen anywhere.        
	Some onlookers today said it was clear what was needed  a crackdown. Tamerlan Khaloyev, 69, a retired teacher who is from the Caucasian region of North Ossetia himself, stood in the teeming square and mourned the iron order of the Soviet Union.        
	In the Soviet time there were no suicide bombers, he said. Stalin took care of all them. They did as he said.        
	Then he turned regretfully to the hump of land in the middle of the square, which for decades housed a towering statue of Feliks E. Dzerzhinksy, the founder of the Bolshevik secret police.         
	In 1991 a cheering anti-Communist crowd pulled down the monument. If it was still standing, Khaloyev said, none of this would be going on.

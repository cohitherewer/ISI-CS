	Bruni buzz    
	 London (PTI): French First Lady Carla Bruni has claimed that she isnt sure how long her marriage to President Nicolas Sarkozy would last. In an interview to Britains Sky News, the former Italian supermodel-turned-singer described her relationship with Sarkozy as a fairytale but gave a half-hearted response when asked about whether her marriage was for ever.

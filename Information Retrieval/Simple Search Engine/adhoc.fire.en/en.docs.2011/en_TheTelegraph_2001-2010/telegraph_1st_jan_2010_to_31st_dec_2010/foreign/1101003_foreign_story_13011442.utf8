          NICK ALLEN                          Rowling and Winfrey in Edinburgh. (AP)                                  
	Los Angeles, Oct. 2: J.K. Rowling, the Harry Potter author, has left fans on tenterhooks by not ruling out the possibility of another book.        
	The author said the characters from the phenomenally successful series are in my head still and one day she could definitely write several new books about them.        
	In an interview with US television chat show host Oprah Winfrey, the author added: Im not going to say I wont. I love writing them.        
	 While not ruling out a follow up Rowling said that for now she has moved on to a new phase of her writing.        
	She said: I have to write for my own mental health. I need to write. I love it. I need to do it. In the hour long interview conducted in Edinburgh she said finishing the final Harry Potter book had been like a bereavement.         
	She said: It was huge, although I knew it was coming. Initially I was elated, but then I cried like I havent cried since my mother died. The author also described the vagaries of fame, including her Beatles-esque US tour.        
	She said: There came a point where it was crazy. I kept saying to people: Yeah, Im coping but the truth was there were times when I was barely hanging on by a thread.         
	Im a writer. Theyre never going to want pictures of me on the beach in a bikini. I was never prepared for it. More than 400 million copies of the books about the boy wizard have been sold.

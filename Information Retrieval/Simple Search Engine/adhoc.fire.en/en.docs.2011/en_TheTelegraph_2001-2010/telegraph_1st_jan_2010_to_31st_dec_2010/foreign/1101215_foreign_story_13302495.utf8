          RAVI SOMAIYA AND ALAN COWELL                          Assange: Under restrictions                                  
	London, Dec. 14: After a week in detention facing possible extradition, Julian Assange, the founder of the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group, was ordered released on $310,000 bail by a court today as he challenges a Swedish prosecutors demand for his extradition to face questioning about alleged sex offenses.         
	Judge Howard Riddle ordered that Assange appear again in court on January 11. He also said that between then and now he must reside at Ellingham Hall, a Georgian mansion in Bungay, eastern England, owned by Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club, which is used mainly by journalists. Assange must spend every night at the mansion and will be electronically tagged so the police can track his movements, the judge said.         
	Additionally, Assange will be under curfew every day from 10pm to 2am and from 10am to 2pm and will be required to report daily to the police from 6pm to 8pm. His passport is already with the police and, under the terms of his bail, he is not permitted to try to travel abroad.         
	A British lawyer acting for Swedish authorities who had opposed bail said nothing had changed since it was denied a week ago. The Swedish government said it would appeal against Assanges release, but one of this lawyers said he probably would not be released until tomorrow morning.         
	 Assange was wearing a dark blue suit and a white shirt open at the collar. Reporters said he seemed paler and more fatigued than at the first hearing on December 7 when bail was denied. When the judge announced that bail would be granted today, Assange gave a thumbs-up sign to the packed courthouse.         
	The case has generated enormous international interest with figures in the Obama administration weighing whether to prosecute him, critics vilifying him and supporters depicting him as a hero and martyr. Crowds of media crews and reporters built up around the court near parliament early today, mingling with Assanges followers.         
	An Australian newspaper, the Sunshine Coast News, reported today that his mother, Christine Assange, had flown to London to be with him.         
	In a 10-minute telephone conversation with his mother, the newspaper said, Assange declared: My convictions are unfaltering. I remain true to the ideals I have always expressed. These circumstances shall not shake them. If anything, this process has increased my determination that they are true and correct.         
	Christine Assange was among around 100 people  mainly lawyers and journalists  crammed into Court No. 1 at City of Westminster Magistrates Court for her sons arrival.         
	Assange arrived in the court building several hours before the afternoon hearing, according to reporters at the court house.

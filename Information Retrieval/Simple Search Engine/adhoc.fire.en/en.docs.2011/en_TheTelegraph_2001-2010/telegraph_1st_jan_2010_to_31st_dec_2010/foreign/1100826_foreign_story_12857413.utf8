	Sean no to acting    
	 London, Aug. 25 (PTI): Sean Connery, whose acting career has spanned more than six decades, insists that he is done with the world of showbiz and will never act in films again.       
	According to the Daily Record newspaper, Connery, who turned 80 today, said: I dont think Ill ever act again. I have so many wonderful memories but those days are over.       
	Connery said he plans to spend his birthday with his wife Micheline and other loved ones at his home in the Bahamas. The former James Bond also plans to eat non-stop to put on some weight which he lost after a recent surgery.

	Karachi, Nov. 5 (Reuters): A small plane chartered to international oil company ENI crashed after taking off from Pakistans Karachi airport today, killing all 21 on board, officials said.        
	The aircraft, a Beech 1900C twin-engine turboprop operated by the private JS Air, crashed inside a military ordnance compound close to Karachis Jinnah International Airport.        
	JS Air spokesman Nadeem Hanif said 17 ENI passengers were onboard, along with two pilots, a technician and a security guard. Italian oil company ENI, one of the largest foreign producers in Pakistans energy sector, said in a statement in Milan that 15 of its passengers were ENI employees while the two worked for a contractor.        
	The Italian foreign office in Rome said one Italian was killed. Aviation officials in Karachi had earlier said there was at least one foreigner on board. Pervez George, a spokesman for Pakistans Civil Aviation Authority, said the aircraft was en route to an oil field near Bhit Shah in Sindh.

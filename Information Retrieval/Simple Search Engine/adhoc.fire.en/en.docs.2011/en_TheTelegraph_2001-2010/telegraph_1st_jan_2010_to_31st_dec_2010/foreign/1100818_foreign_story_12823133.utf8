	Jerusalem, Aug. 17 (Reuters): A discharged Israeli female soldier was condemned by Israeli and Palestinian authorities yesterday for posting pictures of herself on Facebook posing next to bound and blindfolded Palestinians.        
	Former conscript Eden Abergil is seen in two pictures from her album entitled Army  The best period of my life next to hand-bound and blindfolded Palestinian men at an undisclosed location in the occupied West Bank. The other 26 pictures visible from the album show Abergil posing with friends and comrades from her army service days.        
	Abergil, who could not be reached for comment, is no longer directly answerable to the military because she has been discharged but an army spokesman said she could still be called to account for her actions.        
	In light of the fact that she was discharged last year, all the details have been turned over to commanders for further attention, the spokesman said.        
	He declined to say what action might be taken against Abergil but said the military was looking to see if a case could be brought against her. A police spokesman said he was unaware of any civilian complaint lodged in the matter.        
	This is shameful behaviour by the soldier, the military spokesman added.

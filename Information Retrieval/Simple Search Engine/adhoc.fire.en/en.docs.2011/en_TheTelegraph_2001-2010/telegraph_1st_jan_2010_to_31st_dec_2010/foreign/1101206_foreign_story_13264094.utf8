The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Britains homeless minister
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Britains homeless minister

	London, Dec. 5: Grant Shapps, the minister with responsibility for Britains homeless, has taken to sleeping in his parliamentary office following the crackdown on MPs expenses.         
	He is the multi-millionaire minister with his own private plane whose portfolio includes responsibility for Britains homeless.         
	But Grant Shapps may have taken his ministerial brief too far  he has taken to sleeping on a camp bed in his parliamentary office.         
	Shapps is one of a growing number of MPs sleeping in the House of Commons after new rules were introduced curbing expenses claims for overnight stays in London.         
	The minister even sent a photograph of his makeshift office bed to Commons authorities to highlight his plight. The only bar to enjoying a good sleep, he confessed, was the chimes of Big Ben every quarter of an hour.         
	Another MP, David Davies, who is chairperson of the Welsh Affairs Committee, was allowed to claim 79.99 for a camp bed and a further 15.98 for a pillow, duvet and sheet, which he uses to bed down at night in his Commons office  despite the fact that MPs are barred from sleeping in their offices overnight on health and safety grounds.         
	The unusual sleeping arrangements are revealed in a series of emails sent by half a dozen MPs to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which oversees parliamentary expenses.         
	A tough new regime introduced after the expenses scandal has caused growing anger among many MPs who say the crackdown has gone too far and that they are now being financially penalised for carrying out their parliamentary duties.         
	Last week MPs voted to order Ipsa to revise its new rules.        
	Although Shapps can catch trains or be driven home in his ministerial car after late night debates, he then has to wake up so early the next morning to attend ministerial meetings it means not getting enough sleep.         
	Davies, the MP for Monmouth (about 180km from London), is entitled to hotel expenses but complained to authorities the 130 per night limit was too low for hotels in Westminster.         
	Another MP, whose identity has not been revealed, wrote to Ipsa to point out he had comforted a distressed female MP whom he had found crying because she was fed up with the humiliation of being woken up by the cleaners at 0600 when she camps in a Lady Members sitting room.         
	Under the new rules, a total of 128 MPs representing constituencies in and around London are not entitled to a second home allowance nor regular hotel expenses.

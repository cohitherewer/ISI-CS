	Gentle Sting    
	 Vancouver, June 3 (Reuters): Sting, former frontman of The Police, kicked off a world tour of his greatest hits yesterday but replaced the familiar guitar, drum and base riffs with the gentle strains of oboes, violins and cellos.      
	Backed by the London Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, the 58-year-old rocker rolled out crowd-pleasers like Roxanne in front of a sold-out crowd. I normally dont like pop music with orchestras because you end up sawing long notes behind pop ballads, Sting said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak gain in Taliban arrest

  - Officials say militants capture a ploy to stop secret Afghan talks        DEXTER FILKINS                          A man wades through floodwaters with a boy in the village of Basira, Pakistan.

	Islamabad, Aug. 23: When American and Pakistani agents captured Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Talibans operational commander in Karachi last January, both countries hailed the arrest as a breakthrough in their often difficult partnership in fighting terrorism.        
	But the arrest of Baradar, the second-ranking Taliban leader after Mullah Muhammad Omar, came with a beguiling twist: both American and Pakistani officials claimed that Baradars capture had been a lucky break. It was only days later, the officials said, that they finally figured out who they had.        
	Now, seven months later, Pakistani officials are telling a very different story. They say they set out to capture Baradar, and used the CIA to help them do it, because they wanted to shut down secret peace talks that Baradar had been conducting with the Afghan government that excluded Pakistan, the Talibans longtime backer.        
	In the weeks after Baradars capture, Pakistani security officials detained as many as 23 Taliban leaders, many of whom had been enjoying the protection of the Pakistani government for years. The talks came to an end.        
	The events surrounding Baradars arrest have been the subject of debate inside military and intelligence circles for months. Some details are still murky  and others vigorously denied by some American intelligence officials in Washington. But the account offered in Islamabad highlights Pakistans policy in Afghanistan: retaining decisive influence over the Taliban, thwarting India, and putting Pakistan in a position to shape Afghanistans postwar political order.        
	We picked up Baradar and the others because they were trying to make a deal without us, said a Pakistani security official. We protect the Taliban. They are dependent on us. We are not going to allow them to make a deal with Karzai and the Indians.        
	Some American officials still insist that Pakistan-American cooperation is improving, and deny a central Pakistani role in Baradars arrest. They say the Pakistanis may now be trying to rewrite history to make themselves appear more influential.        
	These are self-serving fairy tales, an American official said. The people involved in the operation on the ground didnt know exactly who would be there when they themselves arrived. Other American officials suspect the CIA may have been unwittingly used by the Pakistanis for the larger aims of slowing the pace of any peace talks.        
	At a minimum, the arrest of Baradar offers a glimpse of the multilayered challenges the US faces as it tries to prevail in Afghanistan. It is battling a resilient insurgency, supporting a weak central government and trying to manage Pakistans leaders, who support the Taliban and accept billions in American aid.        
	A senior Nato officer in Kabul said that in arresting Baradar and the other Taliban leaders, the Pakistanis may have been trying to buy time to see if President Obamas strategy begins to prevail. If it does, the Pakistanis may eventually decide to let the Taliban make a deal. But if the Americans fail  and if they begin to pull out  then the Pakistanis may decide to retain the Taliban as their allies.        
	We have been played before, a senior Nato official said. That the Pakistanis picked up Baradar to control the tempo of the negotiations is absolutely plausible.        
	As for Baradar, he is now living comfortably in an ISI safe house, the official said. Hes relaxing, he added.        
	Many of the other Taliban leaders, after receiving lectures against freelancing peace deals, have been released to fight again.        
	Exactly why the ISI became so alarmed at the Afghan peace talks is unclear. In retrospect, paranoia seems to have figured as much as national self-interest.        
	A senior Afghan official said that beginning late last year, his government had reached out to a number of Taliban leaders to explore the prospect of a deal. Among them were Baradar and another Taliban leader named Tayyib Agha.         
	The Afghan official declined to say who met the Taliban leaders, but reports of such meetings have since surfaced. Ahmed Wali Karzai, the Presidents brother, reportedly met Baradar in January, according to a former Afghan official and a former Nato official. Karzais brother denies it.        
	A Pakistani spiritual leader close to the Taliban leadership said that, earlier this year, he had received a message through an intermediary that Karzai wanted to talk peace. We rejected it, he said. The discussions with Baradar and the other Taliban were in their early phases, but they seemed promising, the Afghan official said.         
	When Pakistani intelligence officials learned of the overtures, they became unnerved by what they saw as an attempt by the Afghans to strike a peace deal without them. In particular, the ISI suspected the Americans were orchestrating the talks.

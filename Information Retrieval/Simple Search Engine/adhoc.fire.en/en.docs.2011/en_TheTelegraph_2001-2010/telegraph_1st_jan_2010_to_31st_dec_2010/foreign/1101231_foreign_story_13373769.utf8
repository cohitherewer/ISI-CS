The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Russia tycoon jailed till 2017 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Russia tycoon jailed till 2017 
                              Khodorkovsky: Stunned                            
	Moscow Dec. 30 (Reuters): Former tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky had his jail term extended until 2017 today after being convicted of theft and money-laundering in a trial condemned in the West as politically motivated.        
	Moscow judge Viktor Danilkin granted the prosecutors request and ordered Khodorkovsky to serve 14 years in prison, including his current eight-year term and counting from the day of his arrest at a Siberian airport in October 2003.        
	With Khodorkovsky and co-defendant Platon Lebedev watching from a glass-walled courtroom cage at the close of their trial, the judge said there was no way they could be reformed without isolation from society.        
	Khodorkovsky, once Russias richest man and head of the now defunct Yukos oil company, is in the final year of an eight-year sentence imposed after a politically charged fraud and tax evasion trial that shaped Vladimir Putins 2000-2008 presidency.        
	Russia said the trial was a matter for its courts and rejected as groundless US suggestions that the verdict resulted from selective justice. The US state department sharply criticised the sentencing.         
	We remain concerned by the allegations of serious due process violations, and what appears to be an abusive use of the legal system for improper ends, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said.        
	One of the young tycoons who built fortunes after the Soviet Unions 1991 collapse, Khodorkovsky fell out with Putins Kremlin after airing corruption allegations, challenging state control over oil exports and funding Opposition parties.        
	Dressed in black, Khodorkovsky, whose previous sentence was due to end next October, stood stunned as Danilkin announced the sentence.

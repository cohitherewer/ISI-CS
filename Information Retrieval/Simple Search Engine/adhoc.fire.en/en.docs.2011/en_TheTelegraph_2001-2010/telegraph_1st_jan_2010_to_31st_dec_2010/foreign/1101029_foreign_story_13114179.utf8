The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fast Internet reaches Everest base camp

	Kathmandu, Oct. 28 (Reuters): A private telecom firm took high-speed Internet facilities to the top of the world today when it launched Nepals first 3G services at the base camp of Mount Everest.        
	The installation could help the tens of thousands of mountain climbers and trekkers who visit the Mount Everest region in the Solukhumbu district every year. They have to depend on expensive satellite phones to remain in touch with their families as the remote region lacks proper communication facilities.        
	Nepali telecom company Ncell said its new facility is the first 3G setup at the base camp of Mount Everest, the worlds tallest mountain at 8,850 metres .        
	This achievement is as mighty as the altitude as 3G high-speed internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services to the people living in the Khumbu Valley, trekkers, and climbers alike, said Lars Nyberg, chief of Nordic telecoms firm TeliaSonera , which owns 80 per cent of the firm.        
	Ncell is a joint venture between local investors and TeliaSonera.

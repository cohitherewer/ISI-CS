The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Salma says no to space
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Salma says no to space
                            
	Los Angeles, May 16 (PTI): Mexican beauty Salma Hayek has abandoned her dreams of space travel with Richard Bransons Virgin Galactic team because she was too concerned for her safety as a mother.         
	The actress insists she is not much of a risk-taker since she had her daughter Valentina in September 2007, with her husband, French fashion executive Francois-Henri Pinault, Instyle magazine reported.         
	The 43-year-old actress has given up many thrill-seeking adventures, including a once-in-a-lifetime chance to orbit the planet with the Virgin boss spaceliner, due next year.         
	I love scuba diving and used to dive where sharks were, and now? No more sharks. Everything became about the baby. You are in second position, or third. My dream was to go into space, Hayek said.

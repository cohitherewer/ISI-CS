  - General Petraeus takes charge of Afghan Nato forces before beef-up                             David Petraeus                                  
	Kabul, July 4 (Reuters): The nine-year war in Afghanistan has reached a critical stage, US General David Petraeus said today as he formally took command of the 150,000-strong Nato-led force fighting a growing Taliban insurgency.        
	We are engaged in a tough fight. After years of war we have arrived at a critical moment, Petraeus told guests at a change-of-command ceremony at the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) headquarters in Kabul.        
	We all recognise the threat that the Taliban, al Qaida and the other associated syndicate of extremists pose to this country, this region and to the world, he said.        
	Petraeus was last week appointed to lead all foreign forces in Afghanistan after his predecessor, General Stanley McChrystal, was dismissed for insulting remarks he and aides made about the US administration in a magazine interview.        
	The shift comes at a time when the Taliban are at their strongest since being overthrown in 2001, and with ISAF casualties mounting daily.         
	Petraeus, wearing camouflage fatigues and speaking near a marble column dedicated to ISAF troops killed in the Afghan campaign, told senior commanders and several Afghan ministers that his appointment signalled a change in command, not strategy.         
	Despite last month being the bloodiest yet for international troops, he said gains were being made in the increasingly difficult war and a pushback by insurgents had been expected ahead of an offensive by US and Nato troops on Taliban strongholds in the countrys south.        
	Nothing has been easy in Afghanistan, he said. However, we can all take heart from the progress that has been made on the security front and beyond.        
	Petraeus landed in Kabul on Friday after his appointment was confirmed by the US Senate and the US House of Representatives approved $33 billion in funding for a troop surge he hopes will turn the tide of the war.         
	The surge will bring to 150,000 the number of foreign troops in Afghanistan just as a new strategy takes root. It entails tackling the Taliban in the south while relying on the government to simultaneously improve local governance and development.        
	We must demonstrate to the Afghan people and to the world that al Qaida and its network of extremist allies will not be allowed to once again establish sanctuaries in Afghanistan, Petraeus said.        
	His appointment could be a last throw of the dice for Washington to end an increasingly costly conflict that is draining Western budgets. He is charged with not only winning the war against a growing Taliban insurgency, but also with starting a promised withdrawal of US forces from July next year as Afghan security forces assume more control of the country.

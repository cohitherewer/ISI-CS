	Farnborough, July 18 (Agencies): Boeings new 787 Dreamliner touched down in Britain today on its first trip outside the US, thrilling hordes of eager planespotters who came out to see the breakthrough carbon-composite plane.        
	The airliner, the first passenger jet to be largely built from lightweight and environmentally friendly composite material, is the first of the five test aircraft to leave the US airspace.        
	Its appearance at Farnborough air show, which alternates years with the Le Bourget show outside Paris as the premier aerospace and defence industry gathering, comes as Boeing and arch European rival Airbus seek to rejuvenate plane sales in the aftermath of the global recession  and face new threats to their competitive duopoly.        
	It is the first time the pair will line up their flagship products, with Airbus A380 superjumbo taking part in flying displays during the show.        
	Raymond Jaworowski, a senior aerospace analyst with Forecast International, said Boeing hopes to show the program is on the right track after years of difficulties.        
	The fact that they are able to bring it to Farnborough, it just is kind of a signal to the industry that We have things worked out. It will help, he said.                  The Boeing 787 Dreamliner at the Farnborough air show on Sunday. (AP)      
	Boeing is showing off the aircraft at Farnborough as analysts note that the US company and its EADS-owned European competitor Airbus are facing growing competition from Canadas Bombardier, Chinas state-owned Comac, Russias Irkut and Brazils Embraer.        
	Boeing has 863 orders from 56 companies worth about $150 billion for the 787, which has been plagued by problems since the programme launched in 2004 and is more than two years behind schedule.        
	Boeing reported another potential setback on the eve of Farnborough, warning that the delivery of the first plane to a customer may slip again  this time into early 2011.        
	Boeing said that it still hopes to deliver its first 787 to Japans All Nippon Airways later this year, but warned of a potential delay because of the need for additional testing and changes to inspection equipment.        
	Faulty parts built by Boeings suppliers, including problems with the aircrafts tail, have caused many of the previous delays  in a change from normal production, Boeing has relied on suppliers from around the world to build large portions of the plane, before assembling the parts.        
	In a shift away from traditional aluminum and titanium, nearly all of the aircrafts fuselage and wings are made of composites. That allows the widebody jet to use 20 percent less fuel than similar planes and make less noise, while providing passengers with more room, cleaner air and wider windows.        
	The plane, which has a list price of around $161 million for a basic model, is configured in two versions  a 787-8 carrying 210-250 passengers and a 787-9 carrying almost 300 people.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Italian film producer dead
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Italian film producer dead
                              Dino De Laurentiis                            
	Los Angeles, Nov. 11 (AP): Dino De Laurentiis, an Academy Award-winning Italian film impresario and producer of Serpico and Barbarella who helped revolutionise the way movies are bankrolled and sold, has died. He was 91.        
	The producers daughter said her father was surrounded by family when he died last night at his home in Beverly Hills.         
	De Laurentiis was a legend of Italian New Wave filmmaking. His works also included Bitter Rice, La Strada and Barbarella.         
	He was tiny, but tough, a veritable Napoleon on the set and utterly tireless. Such a little lion, was how his second wife, producer Martha De Laurentiis, put it when he turned 80.

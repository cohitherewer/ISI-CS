          JAMES BONE                              
	New York, Jan. 16: Is little Mikey really a terrorist?         
	That is the question America is asking after it emerged that the eight-year-old Cub Scout from New Jersey is frisked every time he flies because his name is on a US terror watchlist. Michael Mikey Hicks, whose father is a US Navy veteran and mother a photojournalist who has flown with the US Vice-President, has been the target of extra security measures at airports since he was 2. Why would a kid be a terrorist? he asks.        
	Michael is not on the US governments no-fly list of 2,500 people considered too dangerous to be allowed into the air. However, his name appears to be among, or to closely match, one of the 13,500 on the selectee list who are singled out for extra airport security.        
	His parents first learnt of his status when they could not get him a seat for a flight to Florida because, as an airline official explained, he was on the list. He was patted down for the first time aged 2 as he passed through Newark airport in New Jersey. Michael has been asked to see the supervisor whenever he checks in for a flight. On a recent trip to the Bahamas he was frisked on the way out and searched more aggressively on the return flight.        
	Michael is the apparent victim of Americas increasingly heavy-handed system of airline security. The attempted underwear bombing of a Detroit-bound flight on Christmas Day led US officials to add even more names to the countrys terror watchlists.        
	Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who is charged with trying to explode a bomb, was identified as a possible problem when his father in Nigeria alerted the US embassy that he had expressed extreme views before disappearing.        
	On its website, the Transportation Security Administration, which is responsible for airport security, insists that no eight-year-old boy is on the no-fly list.        
	Airlines can and should automatically deselect any eight-year-olds out there that appear to be on a watchlist, it says. Whether youre 8 or 80 the most common occurrence is name confusion and individuals are told they are on the no-fly list when, in fact, they are not.        
	Michaels mother, Najlah Feanny Hicks, has enlisted the help of her congressman to get the listing removed. You could have seen that he was 2; that he was 3, 4 or 5. Now its scary because hes 8. What happens when he is 16? she asked on the television channel CBS2.

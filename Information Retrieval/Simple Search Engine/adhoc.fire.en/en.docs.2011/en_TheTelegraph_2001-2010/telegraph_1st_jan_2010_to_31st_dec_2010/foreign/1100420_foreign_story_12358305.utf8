	Brussels, April 19 (Reuters): The EU reached a deal today to cut the size of a no-fly zone caused by a cloud of ash from an Icelandic volcano, under pressure from frustrated airlines losing $250 million a day.        
	Although some countries were opening airspace, officials said they expected less than a third of flights to operate in Europe today, the fifth day of a flight clampdown that has stranded passengers worldwide and halted freight flights.        
	On a national and European level, we have decided to move step by step towards a normalisation, within the framework of strict security requirements, German transport minister Peter Ramsauer told N24 television.        
	An EU diplomat said earlier that there seemed to be a consensus around creating new zones with a smaller no-fly zone near to the volcano, and a wider zone where flights would be subject to safety restrictions and checks, but no ban. He said the new regime was expected to go into force at 0600 GMT tomorrow.        
	The European Commission said it might approve compensation to cushion airline losses from the shutdown.        
	This volcano has crippled the aviation sector, firstly in Europe, and is now having worldwide implications. The scale of the economic impact (on aviation) is now greater than 9/11 when US airspace was closed for three days, International Air Transport Association head Giovanni Bisignani said. He said airlines were losing $250 million a day in revenue.                  A Lufthansa cargo plane lands at Frankfurt. (AFP)       
	We must move away from this blanket closure and find ways to flexibly open air space, step by step, he said. EU competition chief Joaquin Almunia said the EU Commission was considering easing stringent rules for state aid.        
	British Airways, which says it has lost $22-30 million a day in passenger and freight revenue, said it had asked the EU for compensation.         
	Millions of passengers have been stranded or had their travel disrupted. We cant fly because of the volcano, so they dropped us off at Rome, and now were trying to get up north but its chaotic, said Mark, a Briton stuck at Romes central station, trying to make his way back to Duesseldorf in Germany.        
	The European aviation control agency Eurocontrol said today it expected between 8,000 and 9,000 flights to operate in Europe.        
	That would represent just 30 per cent of normal flight traffic, compared to earlier predictions by EU officials that half of flights could be operating today.         
	Over the weekend only a fifth of normal flights were flown. Figures released by Eurocontrol showed 80,000 fewer flights in Europe since Thursday compared to the same period a week ago.        
	Austria and the Czech Republic opened their airports today. Some countries opened their airspace but others kept no-fly decrees in place. Italy closed its northern airspace after briefly opening it today.        
	France said it would progressively reopen airports.        
	Businesses dependent on fast air freight felt the early impact of the disruption. Kenyas flower exporters said they were already losing up to $2 million a day.         
	AI Chicago flights        
	Air India said it will resume its flights from and to Chicago from Monday.        
	AI 126D (Chicago-Mumbai) is scheduled to depart from Chicago at 4pm (local time) and arrive in Mumbai on Tuesday at 8.30pm IST, a press release issed in Mumbai said.         
	On the same day, AI 144D (Newark-Ahmedabad) will depart from Newark at 2pm (local time) and arrive in Ahmedabad on Tuesday at 5pm IST, the release said.

	Butler fortune    
	 New York, May 13: A Hollywood actress has cut her family out of her will and left her entire $8.4 million fortune, including two homes in New Yorks Dakota Building, to her Nepali butler, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Ruth Ford, who died last year at 98, was best known for the salon she created at her beautiful, art-lined Manhattan apartment, frequented by William Faulkner.      
	The apartment, is now in the hands of Indra Tamang, raised in a mud house in rural Nepal but for the past three decades the Ford familys loyal servant.

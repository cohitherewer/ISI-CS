The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Missions in Rome hit by parcel blasts
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Missions in Rome hit by parcel blasts
                            
	Rome, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Italian police said today they were checking all embassies in Rome after two people were injured in separate explosions at the Swiss and Chilean missions in what Romes mayor called a wave of terrorism.        
	There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the incidents bore similarities to an episode in Greece last month in which far-Left militants sent parcel bombs to foreign governments and embassies in Athens.        
	Its a wave of terrorism against the embassies, Rome mayor Gianni Alemanno told reporters.        
	The two victims were both working in the mailrooms of their embassies when the packages blew up in their hands.

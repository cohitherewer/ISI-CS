The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jolie steps into a mans shoes
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jolie steps into a mans shoes
          STEVEN ZEITCHIK                          Jolie in a scene from Salt. (AP)                                  
	Los Angeles, July 22: Salt director Phillip Noyce knew he had some serious dedication on his hands when he showed Angelina Jolie the facade of the apartment building that her character climbs in one scene, Spider-Man style, 11 stories above the ground.        
	We walked up to the building and I told her: So, the double will do it and youll be back in the studio. And she said: No, I want to do it myself, Noyce recalls. I said sure because I didnt think there was any way it would pass muster with the insurance company anyway. And three weeks later, we were shooting it. With Angelina.        
	If Angelina Jolie is sui generis  the worlds only Oscar-winner who can also sell baby photos for millions, among other traits  Sonys Salt marks a new chapter in her already unconventional book. Not only does the actress play the lone lead in a big-budget summer action movie, but she was deemed a suitable replacement for Tom Cruise, the man who once wore the crown of the worlds biggest action star and who was originally cast as the films title character.         
	Instead of Edwin A. Salt, superspy and father, as the initial script had it, filmgoers tomorrow will be introduced to Evelyn Salt, superspy (without children).        
	The film concerns well-reputed CIA agent Salt who is accused of being a Russian sleeper spy.         
	Early on, she goes on the run  a violent spree that alternately assures her innocence and supports her accusers  that pretty much doesnt let up until the final credits. The compact, high-octane film harks back to such twisty Cold War thrillers as No Way Out  who works for the Russians and who for the Americans?  but with the pacing and shoot-em-up abandon of a present-day action picture.        
	Much of what we see, however, is a significant departure from the original plan. In July 2008, Cruise, weighing his next career move, decided not to make the movie. Sony executives, producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Noyce gathered for an emergency meeting on how to save their big summer film. Noyce credits Sony Pictures chief Amy Pascal for suggesting Jolie.

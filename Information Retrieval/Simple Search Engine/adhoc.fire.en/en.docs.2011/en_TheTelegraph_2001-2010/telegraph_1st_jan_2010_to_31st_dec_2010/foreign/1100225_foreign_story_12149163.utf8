The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jemima gets even on Twitter
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Jemima gets even on Twitter
                            
	Islamabad, Feb. 24 (PTI): Jemima Khan, the British heiress and former wife of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, is using Twitter quite efficiently to poke fun at her ex-husband.         
	My son, aged three, was playing with a one-armed action man. What happened to him? I asked. Abba said he had been stealing so it was cut off, tweeted Jemima a few days ago.         
	Though Jemima still retains the Khan surname and maintains cordial relations with Imran, she seems to be finally seeing him in a new light.         
	Churchill said: A fanatic is one who cant change his mind and wont change the subject. Thats my entire family (and my ex-husband), her latest tweet read.         
	A fellow Twitter user Sufyan Arshad replied: To some extent IK (Imran Khan) is that sort of person but Qasim, Salman and (still you) matter a lot for him!        
	To this, Jemima sought to make light of the matter, saying: That was meant entirely fondly. In fact, trying to convince him to start ready steady ranting on Twitter. Jemima lives with her sons, Salman, 11, and Qasim, 9, in London.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Google template for 21st century town

	Feb. 20: It is no secret that Silicon Valley is one long string of company-dominated towns. Hewlett-Packard and Palo Alto. Intel and Santa Clara. Apple and Cupertino.        
	But within this web, there is a more intense intersection where the template for a 21st-century company town is being laid down. The company is Google. The town is Mountain View.        
	In a sense, the end result is the same mix of plans, dreams and frustration, of civic-corporate boosterism and local concern about the giant in their midst that Henry Ford might have found familiar in Dearborn, Michigan, a century ago. Indeed, a hint of friction crept into the Google-Mountain View union this month as the company moved to safeguard its option to expand along the citys northern edge.         
	But if the debate over the companys physical footprint harks back to traditional company-town tensions, that should not obscure that this new version of the old model has a modern accent.        
	For Google, Mountain View is part home, part developable land and part beta test for the company. For the city, Google is part economic engine, part benefactor and a soon-to-be real-estate developer with an opportunistic eye for underused assets  like, say the landing strip at Moffett Field, a former Navy air station, where jets of Google executives now come and go.        
	Perhaps uniquely, Google is also casting itself as a partner with Nasa, now the proprietor of Moffett Field. This partnership is making Mountain View a stop along the virtual route to Mars and the real route to the Moon. Its a cool anomaly because the company-town tradition had basically died in the US, said Jerry Davis, a professor at the University of Michigan, who has written about the ties between companies and cities.         
	Historically, company towns have grown up around organisations with large manufacturing operations that can support thousands of local workers. To attract top executives to often less-than-ideal locales, the companies donated large sums to cultural institutions.        
	The main reason Ford put money into the Detroit Symphony Orchestra is to make it plausible to recruit executives to Detroit, Prof. Davis said.              
	 It was a human-resources move as much as it was philanthropic.                                  NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

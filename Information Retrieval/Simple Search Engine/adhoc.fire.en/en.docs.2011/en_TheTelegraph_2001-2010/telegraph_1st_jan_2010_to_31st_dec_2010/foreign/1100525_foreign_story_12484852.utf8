The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Koreas step up war rhetoric
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Koreas step up war rhetoric

	Seoul/Beijing, May 24 (Reuters): South Korea today announced steps to tighten the vice on the Norths already stumbling economy in punishment for sinking one of its navy ships, with both sides intensifying war-like rhetoric.        
	South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, in a nationally televised address, also said he would take the issue to the UN Security Council, whose past sanctions are already sapping what little energy North Koreas economy has left.        
	The US, which backs Seoul, said that the situation was highly precarious. China, the Norths only major ally, urged calm.        
	The mounting tension follows last weeks report by international investigators accusing the North of torpedoing the Cheonan corvette in March, killing 46 sailors in one of the deadliest clashes between the two since the 1950-53 Korean War.        
	The US, which has 28,000 troops on the peninsula, threw its full support behind South Korea and said it was working hard to stop the situation from worsening. With US secretary of state Hillary Clinton in Beijing, Washington pressed China to rein in the hermit state.        
	The vitriolic comments across the heavily defended border are rattling investors and niggling at diplomatic relations. Few analysts believe either Korea would dare go to war. The Norths military is no match for the technically superior South Korean and U.S. forces.

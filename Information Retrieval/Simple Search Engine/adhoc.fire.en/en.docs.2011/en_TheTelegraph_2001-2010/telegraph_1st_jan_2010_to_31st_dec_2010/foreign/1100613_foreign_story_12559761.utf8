	Omaha (Nebraska), June 12 (AP): The price of lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett has topped $2 million again, breaking a previous record for the most expensive charity item ever sold on eBay.        
	The final price of $2.6 million was announced last night after this years online charity auction. The amount is even pricier than the $2.11 million bid in 2008s Buffett lunch auction.        
	Robert Chatwani, director of global citizenship for eBay, said its the largest ever single auction for charity thats been sold on eBay in its 15-year history. I tell you, some people really want to have lunch with Warren Buffett, huh? Chatwani said. Its really exciting. The lunch auction benefits the Glide Foundation, which provides social services to the poor and homeless in San Francisco.

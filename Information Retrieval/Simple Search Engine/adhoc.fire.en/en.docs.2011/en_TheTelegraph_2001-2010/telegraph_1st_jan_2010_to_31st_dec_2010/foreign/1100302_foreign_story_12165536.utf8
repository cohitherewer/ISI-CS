	Dichato (Chile), March 1 (Reuters): The sun had barely risen over the Chilean fishing town of Dichato on Saturday morning when the three giant waves roared in from the Pacific.        
	The first two surges startled the towns 7,000 residents, who had already been violently awakened by the earthquake that wrought destruction across a swathe of central Chile.        
	But it was the third surge, a huge wall of water, that tore up and smashed houses, swept cars out to sea and sucked peoples possessions into the sea, destroying more than three-quarters of the towns buildings.        
	The last one almost wiped the village off the map, said David Merino, surrounded by a scene of water-logged destruction in the village, which was among the closest settlements to the 8.8-magnitude quake.        
	It was still unclear how many people died in Dichato, where distraught residents wandered the picturesque tourist town trying to salvage possessions and gazing at their ruined homes in scenes reminiscent of the Asian tsunami in 2004 that smashed into coastlines from Thailand to India.        
	We dont have anything. We lived by fishing, and we lost everything. How are we going to live? said 50-year-old fisherman Jose Castillo, holding his fishing knife and a bag as he scoured the ruins of the town for food and water.        
	I had a side business renting chairs and kept the money in a box but the sea took everything away.        
	Other small towns along Chiles central Pacific coast had similar stories of devastation wrought by three waves triggered by the quake.         
	About 350 people were killed by the quake and tsunamis in the town of Constitucion alone, and the overall quake death toll of 711 was expected to rise.        
	All I have left is what I am wearing  my coat is all thats left of my uniform, said one policeman in Dichato as he surveyed the wreckage of his home.

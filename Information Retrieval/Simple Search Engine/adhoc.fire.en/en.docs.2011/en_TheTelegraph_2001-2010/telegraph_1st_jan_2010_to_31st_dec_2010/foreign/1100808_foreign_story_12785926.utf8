	Charsadda (Pakistan), Aug. 7: As public anger rises over the governments slow and chaotic response to Pakistans worst flooding in 80 years, hardline Islamic charities have stepped into the breach with a grassroots efficiency that is earning them new support among Pakistans beleaguered masses.        
	Victims of the floods and political observers say the disaster has provided yet another deeply painful reminder of the anaemic health of the civilian government as it teeters between the ineffectual and neglectful.        
	The floods have opened a fresh opportunity for the Islamic charities to demonstrate that they can provide what the government cannot, much as the Islamists did during the earthquake in Kashmir in 2005, which helped them lure new recruits to banned militant groups through the charity wings that front for them.        
	In just two districts in this part of the northwest, three Islamic charities have provided shelter to thousands, collected tens of thousands in donations and served about 25,000 hot meals a day a since last Saturday  six full days before the government delivered cooked food.        
	The West says we are terrorists and intolerant, but in time of need, were the ones serving the people, said Maulana Yousaf Shah, the provincial leader of one of the groups, Jamiat-ulema-e-Islam.        
	Mian Adil, the vice-chairman of another group, Falah-e-Insaniyat, said the aid he distributed at a centre in one of the districts, Nowshera, came with a message attached  not to trust the government and its western allies.        
	Falah-e-Insaniyat is the charity wing and the latest front for Lashkar-e-Toiba, the group behind the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.        
	Jamaat-ud-Dawa is the political arm of Lashkar, which the UN has listed as a terrorist group.        
	Under pressure since the Mumbai attacks, Jamaat-ud-Dawa had lowered its profile. But now, at least one of its relief centres in Mianwali, in Punjab, boldly flies its trademark flag, displaying a black sword. The very visible presence of such groups shows they continue to operate openly from their strongholds in Punjab province, the nations heartland, to far-flung corners of the northeast, where they are expanding their legitimacy, and by extension, their ideology.        
	Their gains come as the US continues to struggle to win support in the region, despite lavishing billions of dollars in military and civilian aid on Pakistan since 2001 to encourage its help in fighting the Taliban and al Qaida.        
	Some experts predicted that the public resentment of the government generated by the floods could erode support from the militarys campaign against the militants, and give a boost to Pakistans Islamic parties, which remain small but influential.        
	A 30-year-old tobacco dealer, Gohar Aman, said he got a taste of the nearly complete absence of the governments response when he got in his car on Thursday to search for a relief post he could entrust with an $80 donation.        
	For 25 miles all he could find were centres run by hard-line Islamic groups.                            NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Ryder says she does not trust normal men
                              Ryder: Normal girl                            
	Los Angeles, Dec. 11 (PTI): Hollywood actress Winona Ryder refuses to date anyone from outside the movie industry because she mistrusts normal guys.        
	Ryder has been linked to a number of famous actors over the years and was engaged to co-star Johnny Depp in the early 1990s.        
	And Ryder admits she is reluctant to become involved with anyone who isnt part of Hollywood after a chance encounter with a fan left her mistrustful of men and their motives, reported Elle magazine.         
	I remember being at this bar called Tosca in San Francisco, and I met this guy one night. He was really cute, and we were talking, and then, like, he just said something about how he had always had a crush on me.        
	And I was suddenly mistrustful about why he was talking to me. I wanted to be just a normal girl flirting with a normal guy.        
	Its like you meet people, and they know this stuff about you. Its why you want to meet somebody whos in the same business, only because they understand more. But you dont necessarily want to be with another actor, said Ryder.

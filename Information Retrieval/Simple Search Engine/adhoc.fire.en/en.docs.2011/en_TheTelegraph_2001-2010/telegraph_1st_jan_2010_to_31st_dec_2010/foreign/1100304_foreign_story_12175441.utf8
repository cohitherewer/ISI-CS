          BEAN LEACH                          Frustrated                                  
	London, March 3: Prof. Stephen Hawking is considering leaving Cambridge University in protest over government cuts.        
	The worlds most famous physicist has been at the British university for nearly 50 years but is now looking at the possibility of moving to Canada. He is said to be frustrated with government cuts to universities, which he believes are hampering scientific progress.        
	 The best-selling author of A Brief History Of Time said scientific research in Britain is increasingly focused on industry rather than the pursuit of knowledge and discovery.        
	The 68-year-old is to spend two months at the Perimeter Institute, in Ontario, this summer and hopes to make the move permanent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 75 injured in Bangkok explosions
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      75 injured in Bangkok explosions

	Bangkok, April 22 (Reuters): A series of grenade blasts shook Bangkoks business district today, killing at least three people and injuring 75, heightening tensions during a showdown between troops and anti-government protesters.        
	Five explosions hit an area packed with heavily armed soldiers and studded with banks, office towers and hotels. Four were seriously wounded, including two foreigners, hospital officials and an army spokesperson said.        
	The grenades were fired into an area where hundreds of pro-government protesters were gathering.        
	The troops, many armed with M-16 assault rifles, have poured into the area since Monday to contain red shirt protesters, who have formed a barricade at an intersection leading into the bustling district.        
	Its worrying, seeing ambulances, people running away. The police and army dont seem to be in control, said Herman Koopman, a tourist from the Netherlands.        
	The blasts were caused by M-79 grenades, Colonel Sansern Kaewkamnerd said.         
	The grenades seemed to have been fired from the red shirt protest area, Sansern said. Leaders of the red shirts, who have been demonstrating in Bangkok for nearly seven weeks seeking new elections, denied they were responsible.        
	One explosion took place outside the headquarters of Charoen Pokphand Group, Thailands biggest agribusiness group and another landed near the Dusit Thani Hotel.        
	Many victims were wounded by shrapnel. Television footage showed blood splattered across sidewalks, office windows smashed and a chaotic scene as panicked residents carried the injured into ambulances.        
	After the blasts, troops blocked off roads with razor wire and trained their guns in the air looking to rooftops and an overhead railway system.        
	Not far from the explosions, tens of thousands of red-shirted supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra have fortified a Bangkok commercial district with home-made barricades, expecting the army to evict them any time.        
	The army earlier on Thursday warned it would forcibly disperse the mostly rural and urban poor protesters who have set up a self-contained village in a roughly 3 squarekm (1.9 mile) area of an upscale shopping and hotel area in central Bangkok.        
	Your days are numbered, Sansern said earlier on Thursday.        
	Any attempt to disperse them risks heavy casualties and the prospect of clashes spilling into nearby high-end residential areas.        
	Leaders of the red shirted supporters have said they would only leave when the embattled, military-backed government announces early elections.        
	The red shirts have been protesting that the British-born, Oxford-educated Abhisit Vejjajiva had come to power illegitimately, heading a coalition the military cobbled together after courts dissolved a pro-Thaksin party.        
	The protests are radically different from any other period of unrest in Thailands polarising five-year political crisis, analysts said.

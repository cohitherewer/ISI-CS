The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BA crew start 5-day strike
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      BA crew start 5-day strike

	London, May 24 (Reuters): British Airways cabin crew began a five-day strike today after talks broke down in a dispute over wages, jobs and working conditions and BA said no further negotiations were imminent.        
	The airline said it planned to operate more than 60 per cent of long-haul flights and more than 50 per cent of short-haul from Londons main Heathrow Airport, allowing 70 per cent of passengers to reach their destinations.        
	Flights from Londons Gatwick and City airports were not affected by the strike. Two more five-day strikes are planned if the dispute cannot be resolved following stoppages in March.        
	There are no more talks on the horizon, a BA spokesman said. Our operations are going very well so far today. BA said it would lease up to eight aircraft with pilots and cabin crews from other airlines to keep passengers on the move.        
	BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh and leaders of the labour union Unite, which represents the cabin crew, blame each other for a breakdown in communication.        
	I made an offer to Willie Walsh yesterday to put back our peoples travel concessions that hes vindictively and foolishly taken away from them and I would personally call this strike off, Unite co-leader Tony Woodley told BBC Radio.        
	The issue of travel allowances for cabin crew has become a major sticking point in the conflict, which comes at a difficult time for BA.

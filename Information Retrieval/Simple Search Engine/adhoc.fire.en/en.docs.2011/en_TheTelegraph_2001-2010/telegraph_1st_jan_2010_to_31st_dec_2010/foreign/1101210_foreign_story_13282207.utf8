                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Zuckerberg in giving pledge
                            
	New York, Dec. 9: Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook, has joined the ranks of Americas celebrity philanthropists by agreeing to give most of his multi-billion dollar fortune away to charity.        
	Zuckerberg, 26, who is thought to be worth almost $7 billion, has signed the Giving Pledge, a campaign led by Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, and Warren Buffett. He and Dustin Moskovitz, his Facebook co-founder, are among 17 new billionaires to have joined the initiative.        
	In a statement, Zuckerberg said: People wait until late in their career to give back. But why wait when there is so much to be done? With a generation of younger folks who have thrived on the success of their companies, there is a big opportunity for many of us to give back earlier in our lifetime and see the impact of our philanthropic efforts.

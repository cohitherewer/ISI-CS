                              Clinton: Emotional                            
	London, July 19: Hillary Rodham Clinton, the US secretary of state, has said that her daughter Chelseas approaching wedding is turning her and her husband into nervous wrecks.        
	In an interview with NBCs Andrea Mitchell in Islamabad, Hillary Clinton was asked about former President Bill Clintons role in the ceremony. You should assume that if he makes it down the aisle in one piece its going to be a major accomplishment, she said with a laugh. He is going to be so emotional, as am I.        
	Hillary Clinton stuck to her pledge not to reveal wedding details.        
	My lips are sealed, she said, adding: I am under very strict orders not to talk about,since it is a private matter.        
	Asked what she saw as the significance of this being an interfaith union, Hillary Clinton said it says a lot about the couples relationship. Chelsea Clinton is Christian; her boyfriend Marc Mezvinsky is Jewish.        
	Over the years, so many of the barriers that prevented people from getting married, crossing lines of faith or colour or ethnicity have just disappeared, Hillary Clinton said. Because whats important is: Are you making a responsible decision? Have you thought it through? Do you understand the consequences? And I think in the world that were in today we need more of that.

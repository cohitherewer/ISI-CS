	Sao Paulo, Nov. 1: Dilma Rousseff was elected the countrys first female President yesterday as Brazilians voted strongly in favour of continuing the economic and social policies of the outgoing President, Luiz Incio Lula da Silva.        
	Rousseff, who served as da Silvas chief of staff and energy minister, joins a growing wave of democratically elected female leaders in the region and the world in the past five years, including Michelle Bachelet in Chile, Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner in Argentina and Angela Merkel in Germany. Rousseff, 62, defeated Jos Serra, the former governor of S Paulo, with 56 per cent of the vote to 44 per cent, official numbers showed.        
	In choosing Rousseff, who has no elected political experience, voters sent a message that they preferred to give the governing Workers Party more time to broaden the successful economic policies of Lula da Silva, whose government deepened economic stability and lifted millions of Brazilians out of poverty and into the lower middle classes.        
	In her victory speech, Rousseff pledged to focus on eradicating poverty, which she described as an abyss that still keeps us from being a developed nation. She has indicated that she favours giving the state greater control over the economy, especially the oil industry, potentially steering the country further to the Left.        
	After serving two four-year terms, Lula da Silva was barred from seeking re-election, and he hand-picked Rousseff to be his successor, campaigning tirelessly for her.        
	He treated this campaign like a re-election campaign, a sociologist, Demtrio Magnoli, said last night.Though she could not match Lula da Silvas charisma, Rousseff won by dominating the north and northeastern parts of the country, as well as the key swing states Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais.

          MURRAY WARDROP                              
	London, Feb. 1: Paul Mason, the worlds fattest man, has lost more than 127kg after a life-saving operation.        
	Mason, 48, now weighs 311kg after undergoing gastric bypass surgery but the former postman is still believed to be the heaviest man in the world. He was taken to hospital from his home in Ipswich, Suffolk, for the treatment earlier this month after he ballooned to 444kg.        
	The operation involved having part of his stomach stapled off so that all the food he eats goes into a small pouch, vastly restricting the amount he can consume.        
	Mason, who has a compulsive eating disorder, is now said to be recovering well at St Richards Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex, and looking forward to shedding more weight. He had made the 233km journey to the specialist unit earlier this month in a reinforced ambulance.         
	In the build up to the surgery, Mason had been on crash diet to bring his weight down to a safe level for doctors to operate. He will spend two weeks in hospital and will require another operation in six months.        
	Paul is looking pretty well. He has lost a lot of weight, but has a lot more to lose, a National Health Service source told The Sun.         
	He said he has been waiting eight years for the procedure, but now that he weighs around 311kg its been worth the wait. He said his aim is to be able to get into a mobility wheelchair and eventually drive a car. Prior to the treatment, Mason admitted eating 20,000 calories a day, eight times the amount needed by an average man.

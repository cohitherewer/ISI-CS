	Santana engaged    
	 Los Angeles, July 13 (Reuters): Almost three years after his wife filed for divorce, rock guitarist Carlos Santana is marching to a new beat with his drummer.      
	The Grammy-winning virtuoso behind hits such as Black Magic Woman and Oye Como Va proposed to Cindy Blackman onstage during his concert last Friday in suburban Chicago, his label said yesterday.      
	Blackman, who had just performed a drum solo on the song Corazon Espinado, accepted, the couple kissed and the audience cheered, according to a statement from Sony Music.      
	Cindy and I are blessed to have found each other, Santana said in the statement. Being in love is a gift from the universe, and the spirit and vibrations that come with it are infinitely powerful. I look forward to expressing that incredible energy through my music, and in helping to tip the balance toward more love in the world with what Cindy and I share.

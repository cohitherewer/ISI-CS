The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban raid major base in Jalalabad
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Taliban raid major base in Jalalabad

	Jalalabad, Nov. 13 (Reuters): Taliban fighters attacked a foreign military base at the main airport in Afghanistans east today, one of four incidents in 24 hours that marked a sudden upswing in violence.        
	In an apparent demonstration that the insurgency has not been weakened despite Nato-led forces saying they have made gains, militants mounted attacks in Jalalabad and Kunar in the east and northern town Kunduz, as well as in the capital Kabul yesterday.        
	The attacks will likely send a clear message to Nato leaders who will gather for a summit in Lisbon next week that the security question in Afghanistan is still far from resolved, and that the Taliban remain a formidable enemy.        
	The spike in violence could not come at a worse time for European Nato leaders, who are feeling increasing pressure at home amid sagging support for the drawn-out war.        
	Todays attacks in Jalalabad, Kunduz and Kunar also came on the day that marked the ninth anniversary of the Taliban being overthrown in Kabul by US-backed Afghan forces for harbouring al Qaida before the September 11, 2001, attacks on the US.        
	The spike in violence also comes as President Barack Obama is due to review his Afghanistan war strategy next month.        
	His commanders have been talking up recent successes and he remains committed to starting a gradual troop drawdown from July 2011, but increased violence would send a terrible message after Obamas Democrats were mauled in mid-term elections last week.        
	It also comes as acceptance of the need for a negotiated settlement grows, with peace talks being approached gingerly.        
	Analysts say that the Taliban have proved in the past that they can time attacks to coincide with important events elsewhere in the world and that a sudden jump in such attacks would not be surprising given the high stakes.        
	They could at the same time be looking to position themselves as a legitimate ruling force again after holding off the Wests military strategy for the past nine years.        
	From one side, the Taliban would like to show that the United States could not defeat them militarily in the past nine years and from other side want to introduce themselves as an acceptable political force, too, said Ghulam Jelani Zwak, director of the Afghan Analytical and Advisory Centre.        
	In Jalalabad, at least eight insurgents, including two suicide bombers, attacked a forward operating base run by the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) which shares the main airport in the key eastern city near Pakistan.        
	 Smoke was seen rising from the area and explosions and gunfire were heard, a Reuters witness said. Helicopters flew overhead during the attack and the bodies of at least one suicide bomber and one other attacker were seen near the airport.        
	We killed six insurgents, two with suicide vests, a spokesman for ISAF said.        
	Afghan and ISAF troops responded after coming under small-arms fire, the coalition said.         
	It said no Afghan or ISAF troops were killed during the attack. A Reuters witness said the bodies of three fighters, dressed in Afghan army uniforms and carrying rocket-propelled grenades, small arms and a heavy machinegun, were lying near the base.

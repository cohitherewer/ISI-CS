	Mingora (Pakistan), May 25 (Reuters): Tribesmen in Pakistans Swat Valley have evicted about 125 relatives of Taliban militants from their homes to pressure insurgents to surrender, a community leader and a military spokesman said today.        
	The Pakistani Taliban are pushing to make a comeback in Swat a year after they were largely driven out of the scenic valley, where residents and officials said they were killing opponents and security personnel after imposing their rule. Despite being routed by the army, some militants stayed behind with relatives or in mountains. Others shaved their beards and blended in with the population, security officials say.        
	Keeping the Taliban from returning to former bastions is critical for ensuring long-term stability in Pakistan. A tribal jirga, or council of elders, had set a May 20 deadline for the militants to surrender or their families would face expulsion from their homes, a military spokesman said.         
	After the deadline, on May 21, the jirga expelled some 25 families, about 120-125 individuals, including women and children, from Swat, Colonel Akhtar Abbas told Reuters.        
	The army helped transport the evicted families, who put up no resistance, to Palay, a former camp for Afghan refugees, he said. The army was providing shelter and food, he said.

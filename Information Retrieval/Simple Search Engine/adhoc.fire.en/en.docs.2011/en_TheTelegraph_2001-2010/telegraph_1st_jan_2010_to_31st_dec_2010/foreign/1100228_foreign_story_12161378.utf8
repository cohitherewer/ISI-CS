The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obamas inner circle cracks, aide resigns
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obamas inner circle cracks, aide resigns
          K.P. NAYAR                            (Top) Desiree Rogers and Taleq and Michaele Salahi                          
	Washington, Feb. 27: Six weeks before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is to return to the White House, Desire Glapion Rogers, its ultra-glamorous social secretary who was widely believed to have been responsible for the presence of three gatecrashers at last Novembers state dinner for Singh here has resigned.        
	The resignation of Rogers, who was voted as Washingtons best-dressed woman last year and became the talk of the town by wearing $110,000-worth Fred Leighton yellow diamond earrings even for her print media interviews, represents much more than a routine departure of an administration official.        
	It is the first crack in President Barack Obamas close inner circle of Chicago friends whom he brought to the White House in January 2009 to create a kitchen cabinet that is often associated with heads of state or government.        
	It came on the same day that David Paterson, governor of New York, a Democratic majority state, announced that he will not run for election in November, joining a slew of Obamas partymen who are abandoning his drifting ship.        
	Twice crowned Queen of Zulu, an honour extended to a debutante during the annual Mardis Gras Carnival in New Orleans, Rogers was a stunner at the state dinner for Singh in her pearl-studded pale peach gown from the Daliesque Japanese design house Comme des Garcons.        
	But even before it was revealed that three persons had eluded White House security and sneaked into the state dinner, Rogers was criticised for being a guest herself with a seat at the table instead of supervising the proceedings from behind these scenes.        
	The Secret Service accepted full responsibility for the intrusion by socialites Michaele and Tareq Salahi as well as a Washington party promoter, Carlos Allen.        
	But the buck had to eventually stop with Rogers because there was no one from the social secretarys office at the gate identifying the guests along with the Secret Service.        
	In the weeks that followed the controversial security breach, the White House stoutly defended the well-connected Rogers, who has come to be known as the quot;eyes and ears quot; of first lady Michelle Obama in the last 14 months of the Obama presidency.        
	The social secretarys office operates from the first ladys east wing of the White House.        
	The US House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee held hearings about the security breach, but the White House declined to make Rogers available to testify at the hearings.        
	The first lady and the president issued a joint statement yesterday confirming the resignation of their friend. quot;When she took this position, we asked Desire to help make sure that the White House truly is the Peoples House, quot; the joint statement said.        
	 quot;And she did that by welcoming scores of everyday Americans through its doors. quot;        
	It is not clear if those who wrote the statement on behalf of the first couple thought through its contents or showed it to Rogers before it was released. Because ironically, that is precisely what Rogers did by allowing ordinary people, univited VIPs like the Salahis and Allen, into the White House. And she paying for it with her job.        
	White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the November security breach played no role in her decision to quit, but he is unlikey to be believed by anyone.        
	Gibbs said quot;she has not been asked to leave. She has decided it is time to go back to do other things she loved. quot;        
	Her last job before joining Obamas team was with the insurance giant, Allstate Corporation, where she was a member of the conglomerates executive committee.

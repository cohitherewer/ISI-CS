	Theron home    
	 London, June 21 (PTI): Following her split with boyfriend Stuart Townsend, actress Charlize Theron has decided to rent their Malibu beachhouse for $50,000 a month.      
	Theron used the house for romantic weekends with the Irish actor who moved out after their nine-year relationship ended in January this year. He is a co-owner of the house.       
	The three-bedroom cottage-style home comes with a much sought-after ocean front location, reports the Daily Mail.    
	Snap luck    
	 London (PTI): Private family photographs of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and her rock star husband Chris Martin were found on a train and returned by a manager at work. The pictures were found in the pocket of a jacket left on a train at Plymouth, Devon. Duty manager Matt Fearn recognised the Coldplay frontman and his wife in the snaps, and suspected the jacket might belong to a relative of Martin, who comes from Exeter. Instead of sending it to lost property, he contacted a local paper for help in tracking down the family and Martins father Anthony responded, reports the Daily Express.

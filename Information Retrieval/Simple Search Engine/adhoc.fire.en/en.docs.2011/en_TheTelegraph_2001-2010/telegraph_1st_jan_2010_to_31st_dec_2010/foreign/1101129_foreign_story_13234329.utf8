The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Leaks: Rickshaw driver to rotten head in Pak
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Leaks: Rickshaw driver to rotten head in Pak
          SCOTT SHANE AND ANDREW W. LEHREN                          Asif Ali Zardari                                  
	Washington, Nov. 28: A cache of a quarter-million confidential American diplomatic cables, most of them from the past three years, provides an unprecedented look at backroom bargaining by embassies around the world, brutally candid views of foreign leaders and frank assessments of nuclear and terrorist threats.         
	Some of the cables, made available to The New York Times and several other news organisations, were written as recently as late February, revealing the Barack Obama administrations exchanges over crises and conflicts.        
	The material was originally obtained by WikiLeaks, an organisation devoted to revealing secret documents. WikiLeaks intends to make the archive public on its website in batches, beginning today.        
	The state departments legal adviser, Harold Hongju Koh, wrote to a lawyer for WikiLeaks informing the organisation that the distribution of the cables was illegal and could endanger lives and disrupt military and counter-terrorism operations.        
	The cables show that nearly a decade after the attacks of September 11, 2001, the dark shadow of terrorism still dominates Americas relations with the world.        
	They depict an Obama administration struggling to sort out which Pakistanis are trustworthy partners against al Qaida and assessing whether a lurking rickshaw driver in Lahore was awaiting fares or conducting surveillance of the road to the American consulate.         
	Some of the revelations follow:        
	Pak N-fuel        
	Since 2007, the US has mounted a highly secret effort, so far unsuccessful, to remove from a Pakistani research reactor highly enriched uranium that American officials fear could be diverted for use in an illicit nuclear device.         
	In May 2009, ambassador Anne W. Patterson reported that Pakistan was refusing to schedule a visit by American technical experts because, as a Pakistani official said, if the local media got word of the fuel removal, they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistans nuclear weapons, he argued.         
	Zardari swipe        
	The cables also disclose frank comments behind closed doors. Dispatches from early this year, for instance, quote the ageing monarch of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah, as speaking scathingly about the leaders of Iraq and Pakistan.         
	The king called President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan the greatest obstacle to that countrys progress. When the head is rotten, he said, it affects the whole body.         
	Unified Korea        
	American and South Korean officials have discussed the prospects for a unified Korea, should the Norths economic troubles and political transition lead the state to implode.        
	The South Koreans even considered commercial inducements to China, according to the American ambassador to Seoul. She told Washington in February that South Korean officials believe that the right business deals would help salve Chinas concerns about living with a reunified Korea that is in a benign alliance with the US.         
	Afghan graft        
	When Afghanistans vice-president visited the UAE last year, local authorities working with the drug enforcement administration discovered that he was carrying $52 million in cash. With wry understatement, a cable from the American embassy in Kabul called the money a significant amount that the official, Ahmed Zia Massoud, was ultimately allowed to keep without revealing the moneys origin or destination. (Massoud denied taking any money.)        
	Qaida donors        
	Saudi donors remain the chief financiers of Sunni militant groups like al Qaida, and the tiny Persian Gulf state of Qatar, a generous host to the American military for years, was the worst in the region in counter-terrorism efforts, according to a state department cable last December.         
	Qatars security service was hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the US and provoking reprisals, the cable said.         
	Yemen our bombs        
	It has been previously reported that the Yemeni government has sought to cover up the American role in missile strikes against the local branch of al Qaida. But a cables fly-on-the-wall account of a January meeting between the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the American commander in West Asia, is nonetheless breathtaking.         
	Well continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours, Saleh said, according to the cable sent by the American ambassador, prompting Yemens deputy prime minister to joke that he had just lied by telling Parliament that Yemeni forces had carried out the strikes.         
	The authoritarian ruler of a conservative Muslim country, Saleh complains of smuggling from nearby Djibouti, but tells Gen. Petraeus that his concerns are drugs and weapons, not whiskey, provided its good whiskey.        
	Gaddafis nurse        
	Media reports had detailed the unhappiness of the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, when he was not permitted to set up his tent in Manhattan or to visit ground zero during a UN session last year.         
	But the cables add to the tale a touch of scandal and alarm. They describe the volatile Libyan leader as rarely without the companionship of his senior Ukrainian nurse, described as a voluptuous blonde. They reveal that Gaddafi was so upset by his reception in New York that he balked at carrying out a promise to return dangerous enriched uranium to Russia.

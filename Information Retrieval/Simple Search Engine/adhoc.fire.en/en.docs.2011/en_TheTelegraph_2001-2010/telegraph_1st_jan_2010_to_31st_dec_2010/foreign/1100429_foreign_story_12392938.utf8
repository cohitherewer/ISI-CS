                              Sad and scared                            
	New York, April 28 (AP): Sandra Bullock has filed for divorce from her husband, Jesse James, and is adopting a baby boy as a single parent, according to a story posted today on People magazines website (www.people.com).        
	Yes, I have filed for divorce, the 45-year-old Oscar-winning actress said in an interview with People. Im sad and I am scared.        
	Bullock and James, 41, began the adoption process four years ago, the report said, and brought three-and-a-half-month-old Louis Bardo Bullock home in January but decided to keep the news to themselves until after the Academy Awards.        
	In the interview, Bullock said she is savouring her new maternal status.        
	You wake up, you feed, you burp, you play, you do laundry, she said. Im still in that stage where Im just amazed with him and at life.        
	All I said when I met him was: Oh, there you are. It was like he had always been a part of our lives.        
	The baby, called Louis, is named after jazz great Louis Armstrong, who had particularly touched her with his signature song, What a Wonderful World, said Bullock.         
	James and Bullock separated in March after five years of marriage, following reports that James had been unfaithful. Bullock won the Oscar for best actress for her role in The Blind Side, on March 7. Within days of her win, the cheating allegations became public and Bullock went into seclusion.

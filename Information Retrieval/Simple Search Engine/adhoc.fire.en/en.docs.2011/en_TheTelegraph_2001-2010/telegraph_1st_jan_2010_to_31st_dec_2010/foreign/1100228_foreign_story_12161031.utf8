	Parachinar (Pakistan), Feb. 27 (Reuters): A suicide car bomber killed three policemen and a child today in an attack on a police station in a northwestern Pakistani town, police said.        
	The blast in the town of Karak, 200km southwest of Islamabad, came as police were on the alert for potential sectarian attacks on religious processions to mark the anniversary of the Prophet Mohammads birth. The blast destroyed part of police station and a nearby mosque, police official Gul Sadi Khan told Reuters, adding three policemen had been killed.

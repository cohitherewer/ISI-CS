	Colombo, Aug. 25 (AP): A Sri Lankan maid returned from her job in Saudi Arabia with 24 nails inside her body  the result of torture by the family who employed her, a doctor and government official said today.        
	L.G. Ariyawathis body is riddled with needles and nails,a doctor confirmed today.        
	Ariyawathi, 49, returned to Sri Lanka on Saturday from Saudi Arabia and was hospitalised the next day with severe pain at a facility about 160km from Colombo, according to media reports.        
	She told a local newspaper that her employers tortured her with the nails as punishment. They (employer and his family) did not allow me even to rest. The woman at the house had heated the nails and then the man inserted them into my body, Ariyawathi was quoted as saying in the Lakbima, a newspaper published in local Sinhalese language.

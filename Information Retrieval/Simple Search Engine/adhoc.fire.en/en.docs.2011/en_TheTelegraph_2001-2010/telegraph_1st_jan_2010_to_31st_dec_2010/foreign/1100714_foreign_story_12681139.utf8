	Kampala (Uganda), July 13: The Ugandan police announced today that they had found an explosives-laden vest at a popular nightclub here in the capital, thwarting another potential bomb attack just days after two deadly blasts ripped through crowds watching the World Cup championship game.        
	The authorities also said they had arrested four foreigners in connection with Sundays attacks, which left at least 76 people dead and raised concerns about the growing reach of the Somali militant group, the Shabab, which claimed responsibility for the bombings.        
	The police said the vest was rigged to a detonator that appeared to be a mobile phone, and had been left in a bag in the middle of a nightclub in Kampala. One would think that someone had just left their laptop or something, said Judith Nabakooba, a spokeswoman for Ugandas police.        
	Witnesses said they noticed the bag when they heard a mobile phone ringing from inside it, then called the police when they saw what the bag held. Authorities said that bomb experts had found the vest to be active before neutralising it.        
	Streets in Kampala were cordoned off last night and this morning, as rumours of another potential attack swirled through the jittery city. We are mobilising members of the public and putting them on high alert, Nabakooba said.

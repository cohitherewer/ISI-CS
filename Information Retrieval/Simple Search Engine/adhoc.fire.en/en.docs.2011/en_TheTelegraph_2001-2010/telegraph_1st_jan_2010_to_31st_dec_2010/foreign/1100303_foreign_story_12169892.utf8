The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Apple in patent row with HTC
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Apple in patent row with HTC
                                  
	Cupertino (California), March 2 (AP): Apple Inc. said today that it is suing Taiwans HTC Corp., accusing the handset maker of violating patents related to the iPhone.        
	HTC was the first company to manufacture a mobile phone based on Google Incs Android operating system, which has emerged as a significant competitor to the iPhone. It is also making the Nexus One phone, which Google is selling directly to consumers. Apple said HTC has infringed on 20 of its patents covering aspects of the iPhones user interface and hardware.        
	Apple is seeking unspecified damages and court orders to block HTC from selling the Android phones and other products in the US that it says violate its patents. We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or we can do something about it, Apple CEO Steve Jobs said. Weve decided to do something about it.        
	Sales of HTC products are not immediately threatened. Patent cases can take months or years to resolve, and agreements over licensing and royalty payments often emerge.        
	The complaints were filed with the US International Trade Commission, which has the power to block imports of products and parts made with contested technology, and the US district court in Wilmington, Delaware, which can award damages and order HTC to stop sales.        
	In an email message, HTC spokesman Linda Mills said the company only learned of the suit today through media reports and has not had time to review Apples claims.

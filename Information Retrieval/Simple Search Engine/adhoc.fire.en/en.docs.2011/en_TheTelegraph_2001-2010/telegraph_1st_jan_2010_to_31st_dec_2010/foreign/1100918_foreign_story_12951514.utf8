The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Exiled MQM leader stabbed in London
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Exiled MQM leader stabbed in London
                              Imran Farooq                            
	London, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Pakistani politician Imran Farooq, a leader of the MQM party influential in Karachi, was stabbed to death in London yesterday.        
	However, it was not clear if his killing was a result of political rivalry.        
	We are awaiting details and for police investigation, Faisal Subvaari, a senior member of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement  the dominant political party in Karachi, told Reuters.        
	Farooq, a founding member of the MQM, claimed asylum in Britain 11 years ago after more than seven years on the run from Pakistani police who accused him of involvement in murder and other serious crimes. He denied the charges.        
	In Karachi today, most shops and schools were closed and no public transport was available after the MQM announced 10 days of mourning.        
	A few vehicles were torched, police said.        
	We are confident that the culprit will be arrested and will be given exemplary punishment, Farooq Sattar, a senior MQM member and a minister in the government of President Asif Ali Zardari, told reporters in Karachi.        
	Sattar refused to speculate on the motives behind the killing, saying they were awaiting results of British investigations.        
	Up to 100 people were killed and hundreds wounded in several days of clashes in Karachi last month after MQM member Raza Haider, who was a Shia, was gunned down along with his bodyguard while attending a funeral.        
	A British police spokesman did not confirm Farooqs identity but said a 50-year-old man had suffered multiple head and stab wounds and was confirmed dead at the scene.        
	No arrests had been made, the spokesman said.        
	Farooq was one of several senior members of the MQM who have taken refuge in London. The partys top leader, Altaf Hussain, has lived in self-exile in the British capital since 1992. The party represents the descendants of Urdu-speaking migrants.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Passive smoke kills lakhs a year
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Passive smoke kills lakhs a year
                              KILLER HABIT                            
	London, Nov. 26 (Reuters): Passive smoking claims an estimated 600,000 lives each year, nearly 1 per cent of deaths worldwide, researchers from the World Health Organisation (WHO) have found.        
	In the first study to assess the global impact of second-hand smoke, WHO experts found that children are more heavily exposed to second-hand smoke than any other age group, with around 165,000 of them a year succumbing to it.        
	Two-thirds of these deaths occur in Africa and south Asia, the researchers, led by Annette Pruss-Ustun of the WHO in Geneva, wrote in their study.        
	Childrens exposure to second-hand smoke is most likely to happen at home, and the combination of infectious diseases and tobacco seems to be a deadly combination for children in these regions, they said.        
	Commenting on the findings in the Lancet journal, Heather Wipfli and Jonathan Samet from the University of Southern California said policymakers in certain parts of the world try to motivate families to stop smoking at home.        
	In some countries, smokefree homes are becoming the norm, but far from universally, they wrote.        
	The WHO researchers used data from 192 countries for a study that focussed on 2004. Their mathematical models estimate the number of lives and years of good health lost to passive smoking.        
	Worldwide, 40 per cent of children, 33 per cent of non-smoking men and 35 per cent of non-smoking women were exposed to second-hand smoke in 2004, they found.        
	This exposure was estimated to have caused 379,000 deaths from heart disease, 165,000 from lower respiratory infections, 36,900 from asthma and 21,400 from lung cancer.        
	The full impact of smoking can only be estimated once these deaths are added to the 5.1 million attributed to active tobacco use each year, the researchers said.         
	While deaths due to passive smoking in children were skewed towards poor and middle-income countries, deaths in adults were spread across countries at all income levels.        
	In Europes high-income countries, only 71 child deaths occurred, while 35,388 deaths were in adults. Yet in the countries assessed in Africa, an estimated 43,375 deaths due to passive smoking were in children compared with 9,514 in adults.        
	Pruss-Ustun urged countries to enforce the WHOs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which includes higher tobacco taxes, plain packaging and advertising bans, among other steps.        
	Policy-makers should bear in mind that enforcing complete smoke-free laws will probably substantially reduce the number of deaths attributable to exposure to second-hand smoke within the first year of its implementation, with accompanying reduction in costs of illness in social and health systems, she wrote.        
	Only 7.4 per cent of the world population currently lives in jurisdictions with comprehensive smoke-free laws, and those laws are not always robustly enforced.        
	In places where smoke-free rules are followed, the researchers said that exposure to second-hand smoke in bars and restaurants can be reduced by 90 per cent, and in general by 60 per cent.        
	Studies also show such laws help to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked and help smokers who seek to quit their habit.

	Moscow, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Two people died and dozens were injured today when a Russian plane ran off the runway during an emergency landing at Moscows Domodedovo airport, a Russian aviation official said.        
	The Tupolev airliner, operated by Dagestan Airlines, took off from Vnukovo airport, also outside Moscow, and made an emergency landing nearly 30 minutes later after all three engines failed.        
	Two people were killed, said Sergei Izvolvsky, an official at Russias state-owned aviation agency. The planes three engines stopped working nearly 80km away from Domodedovo and the navigation system failed. The reason why is not yet known, he said.        
	Of the passengers injured, eight were in critical condition, said Domodedovo spokeswoman Yelena Golanova.        
	The plane was carrying 163 passengers and nine crew, said Izvolvsky, adding 40 had been injured. Russian news wires, citing the ministry of health protection and social development, put the number of passengers hospitalised at 83.        
	Pictures showed the aircraft broken into three pieces, having slid off the runway and through trees. Passengers were seen emerging from the plane, which was surrounded by firefighters and medics.        
	The plane was heading for Makhachkala, capital of the Russian province of Dagestan. It was a model Tu-154 plane, the same type that crashed in April killing Polands President Lech Kaczynski.        
	Ageing infrastructure has taken its toll on Russias air industry.

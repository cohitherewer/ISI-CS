The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pope cries with abuse victims
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pope cries with abuse victims
                            
	Valletta, Malta, April 18 (Reuters): Pope Benedict prayed and cried with eight sexual abuse victims in Malta today and promised the Church was doing all in its power to bring the guilty to justice and protect the young.        
	It was emotional. Everybody cried, Lawrence Grech, a 37-year-old victim, said after the private meeting following the Popes Mass on the second and last day of his visit.        
	The meeting, announced only after it had finished, was Benedicts first such gesture since a new wave of sexual abuse scandals swept over Roman Catholicism in recent months. He had previously met victims in the US and Australia.        
	He prayed with them and assured them that the Church is doing, and will continue to do, all in its power to investigate allegations, to bring to justice those responsible for abuse and to implement effective measures designed to safeguard young people in the future, a Vatican statement on the meeting said.        
	That was one of the clearest statements yet from the Vatican that it wanted local bishops to co-operate with civil authorities in prosecuting priests who abused children.        
	He was deeply moved by their stories and expressed his shame and sorrow over what victims and their families have suffered, it said, adding he hoped their pain would heal.        
	A spokesperson said the Pope met them as a group and then spoke to each individually before they prayed together.        
	I lost my faith in the last 20 years, Grech, 37, said after the meeting. I told him you can fill up the emptiness, fill up what the priests took from me when I was young.         
	This experience is going to change my life. Now I can go to my daughter and say I believe, he said, breaking into tears.

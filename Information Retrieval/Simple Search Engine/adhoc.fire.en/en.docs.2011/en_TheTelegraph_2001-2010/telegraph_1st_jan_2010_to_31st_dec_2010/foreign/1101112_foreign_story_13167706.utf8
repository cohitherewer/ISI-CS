The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Osama names new chief to attack West
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Osama names new chief to attack West
          PRAVEEN SWAMI                          New strategy                                  
	Nov. 11: Osama bin Laden has appointed a new commander to spearhead al Qaidas offensive of operations against the West.        
	Known to western intelligence services by the alias Saif al-Adel, or Sword of the Just, al Qaidas new chief of international operations is believed to have conceived of the wave of strikes that set off terror alerts across Europe recently, as well as last weeks mid-air parcel-bomb plot.        
	US and Pakistani sources have told The Daily Telegraph that al-Adel is running several similar operations as part of a war of attrition intended to persuade western public opinion that the war against terror is unwinnable. This would clear the road for al Qaida to capture power in fragile states such as Somalia and Yemen.        
	His strategy, said Syed Saleem Shahzad, a Pakistani expert on al Qaida, is to stage multiple terror operations. A US counter-terrorism official said the idea was for small-but-often attacks that would hurt the West more than a one-off terror spectacular.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

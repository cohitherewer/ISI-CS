The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bangkok scrapes off riot mess
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bangkok scrapes off riot mess

	Bangkok, May 23 (Reuters): Thousands of Bangkok residents, angered by the riots that devastated their city, used razor knives today to scratch off anti-government posters and brooms to sweep away tonnes of rubbish left by protesters.        
	The army ended months of street rallies by red shirt protesters on Wednesday, using armoured personnel carriers and automatic rifle fire to evict them from the large parts of downtown Bangkok they had occupied.        
	A wave of arson and rioting, the worst in the countrys modern history, broke out as the red shirts withdrew.        
	I think the red shirts are not Thai people because they destroyed things, they destroyed Bangkok, they destroyed Thailand, said shop keeper Kasana Opasthanakoon. My friends have shops here, destroyed, they have nothing.        
	The red shirts, drawn from rural masses and the urban poor, are demanding new elections, saying they have been disenfranchised by a Bangkok elite backed by the military that is unwilling to share power with the common people.        
	They have said they will resume protests next month.        
	At the charred protest site in Bangkoks Rachaprasong district which the red shirts had occupied, thousands of people armed with straw brooms, plastic gloves, garbage bags and face masks, poured in after the army declared it clear of home-made bombs and other dangerous material.        
	We love Thailand, we love Bangkok. We will try and take back our city today, said Tor, a teacher, as she led a group of students.        
	Teenage girls from one of the citys most prestigious schools marched into the once-deadly no mans land, carrying a Students Lets Clean Project sign.         
	Nearby, other young Thais painstakingly scratched away a red shirt poster of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.        
	At least 54 people have been killed and over 400 injured in the violence since May 14. Almost 40 major buildings in the city were set on fire and the tourism and retail industries have been devastated.        
	As people cleaned the streets, they also took photographs and videos of the damage, especially of the gutted Central World, the second largest shopping mall in Southeast Asia.

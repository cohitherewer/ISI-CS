	Colombo, Dec. 12 (PTI): Sri Lanka has scrapped the Tamil version of its national anthem at official and state events, a move likely to further alienate the ethnic Tamils in the country.         
	Now the national anthem, Sri Lanka matha, can only be rendered in the majority Sinhala language at official events.         
	The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by President Mahinda Rajapksa, who pointed out that no country has its national anthem in more than one language.        
	The Tamil version is sung in the north and east of the country where the majority speaks Tamil.

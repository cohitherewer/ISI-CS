	London, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha have named their newborn daughter Florence Rose Endellion, Downing Street said today.        
	Endellion refers to the Cornish village of St Endellion, close to where the couple are holidaying and a place visited by David Cameron in the past.        
	Florence, the couples fourth child, was not expected until September, but after she was born yesterday, the Prime Minister joked he was open to suggestions of typical names from Cornwall.        
	Messages of congratulations have been sent by the Queen, Prince Charles, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Downing Street added.        
	David Cameron spent the night with his wife at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro where his daughter was delivered by Caesarean section, weighing 2.7kg. He said yesterday his job had been to make tea and toast. The couples two older children, Nancy, six, and Arthur, four, have visited their sister.

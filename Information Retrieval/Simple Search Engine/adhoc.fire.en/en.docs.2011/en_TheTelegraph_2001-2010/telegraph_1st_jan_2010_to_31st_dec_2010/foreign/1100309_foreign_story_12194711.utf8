The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iraq turnout defies blasts

	Baghdad, March 8: Defying a sustained barrage of mortars and rockets in Baghdad and other cities, Iraqis went to the polls in strength yesterday to choose a new parliament meant to outlast the American military presence here.        
	Iraqis are not afraid of bombs any more, said Maliq Bedawi, 45, defiantly waving his finger, stained with purple ink, to indicate he had voted, as he stood near the rubble of an apartment building in Baghdad hit by a huge rocket in the deadliest attack of the day.        
	Insurgents here vowed to disrupt the election, and the concerted wave of attacks  as many as 100 thunderous blasts in the capital alone starting just before the polls opened  did frighten voters away, but only initially.        
	The shrugging response of voters could signal a fundamental weakening of the insurgencys potency. At least 38 people were killed in Baghdad. But by days end, turnout was higher than expected, and certainly higher than in the last parliamentary election in 2005, marred by a similar level of violence.        
	Sunnis who largely boycotted previous elections voted in force, and an intense competition for Shia votes drove up participation in Baghdad and the south.        
	After seven years of a war whose rationale is deeply disputed in the US, the Obama administration viewed the vote as a test of Iraqs stability, a last milestone before the final withdrawal of American troops.        
	The short and fierce political campaign could end up either solidifying Iraqs nascent democracy or leaving the country fractured along ethnic and sectarian lines. But it was arguably the most open, most competitive election in the nations long history of colonial rule, dictatorship and war.        
	Despite a long delay, disputes over candidates qualifications, arrests, assassinations and finally an all-out assault by insurgents yesterday morning, the election took place with only a few reports of irregularities. And by last night, a rarity was emerging in a region dominated by authoritarian governments: an election cliffhanger.        
	After the polls closed at 5pm, party leaders said two coalitions seemed to have fared best: the one led by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, who has campaigned for a second time on improved security in Iraq, and another led by the former interim leader, Ayad Allawi.

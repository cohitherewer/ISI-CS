          ANDREW HOUGH                          Offensive                                  
	March 19: A row has erupted in West Asia after officials banned a Facebook user in Abu Dhabi for breaking the law after he insulted Islam by claiming to be Allah.        
	All Internet providers in the United Arab Emirates have been ordered to block the unnamed user after he alleged his claims were supported by verses of the Quran.        
	His actions sparked a wave of protest, with many calling on users to boycott the social networking site unless it was removed.        
	After dozens of complaints about the Arabic-language user, whose page on Facebook is titled God and Prophets, the countrys Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) announced this week it would ban the user from holding an Internet account.        
	But that decision was met with more protests from what some viewed as censorship of the Internet. The user claimed he was an atheist and did not believe in God but him or herself, West Asia reports claimed.        
	The user said that Muslim prophets would be able to connect with users through his page which contained Quranic verses and also appeared to mock Islam.        
	The site soon had more than 600,000 followers, with many critical of the site.        
	Mohammad Al Ganem, the authoritys General Manager, defended the authoritys decision to ban the site, saying it insulted Islam.        
	TRA received numerous calls and complaints from Internet users expressing their anger against unidentified people who created a site on Facebook that is offending to God, prophets, messengers, the Holy Quran and even to all Gods books, he said. He also was writing a new book falsifying himself as a God.

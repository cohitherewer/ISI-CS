            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Deccan Chargers on Monday threatened to pull out of the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) if their home league matches were not shifted back to Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam.         
	In a legal notice served on the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the IPL, franchise owners Deccan Chargers Sporting Ventures Ltd. said that they had not consented to the IPLs decision to move all their home ties to Mumbai and Nagpur, and urged the matter to be reconsidered.         
	Our client regrets to note that this decision has been taken by you arbitrarily, unilaterally, without our clients consent and in complete breach of the Franchise Agreement, the legal notice, from the Chargers to the BCCI and IPL, said.         
	The IPL had initially relocated only the inaugural match of its third edition, between the Chargers and Kolkata Knight Riders at Hyderabad on March 12, as well as the opening ceremony to Mumbais DY Patil Stadium.         
	On Saturday, IPL Chairman Lalit Modi announced in his Twitter page that the remaining six home matches of the Chargers, which were to be played at Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam, were moved to Mumbai and Nagpur as well.

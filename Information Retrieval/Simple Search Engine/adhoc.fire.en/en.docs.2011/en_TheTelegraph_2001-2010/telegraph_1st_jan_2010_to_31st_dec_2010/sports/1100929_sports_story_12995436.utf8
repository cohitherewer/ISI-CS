The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians are no longer wary   of SA pitches, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indians are no longer wary   of SA pitches, says Dhoni
                            
	Johannesburg: Indian cricketers are no longer wary of South African pitches after the Champions League Twenty20 tournament was hosted here, Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni told an Afrikaans daily.         
	Dhoni, who spoke to the newspaper after beating local team Warriors in the final, said that pitches in South Africa are no longer alien in nature for the senior India players.         
	Most of our players played here during the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and now again during the Champions League Twenty20. The experience of playing on these pitches has been invaluable, Dhoni said.         
	The Indians will be touring South Africa during the end of this year.         
	The Indian players playing for the Super Kings like top-order batsmen Murali Vijay and Suresh Raina, showed their mettle in the league games, as did spinner Ravichandran Ashwin who emerged as the highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 13 scalps.         
	Dhoni described Ashwin as an aggressive character who is up for any challenge.         
	He is a very smart bowler who does not need much guidance. He knows what is expected of him, Dhoni said, adding that he believed Ashwin would be a key player in the South African tour later this year.         
	Despite winning the biggest prize in world cricket of 17 million rand, Dhoni said the victory on Sunday was tinged with sadness because some of the players would play for different teams during the next edition of IPL  courtesy fresh auctions.         
	After being together for three years, the core wont remain the same as few of the players will play for different teams. Thats why we badly wanted to win this tournament. Thats our way of saying thank you, having enjoyed playing together for the past three years, Dhoni told the newspaper.         
	The Team India captain did not forgetting to mention that the venue here was very special to him as this was where he led India to victory in the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007.           (PTI)

            A STAFF REPORTER          Indian players celebrate their win over Kazakhstan, on Friday.   A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: In a bizarre incident that left the players and the spectators dazed, the Indian national anthem was stopped midway during its customary playing, before the home teams match against Kazakhstan, in the Asian Senior Mens Volleyball Championship at the Netaji Indoor Stadium, on Friday.         
	The organisers blamed it on the time limit specified in the protocol of the International Volleyball Federation.         
	Competition director A. Ramana Rao said there was little he could do to prevent it. He, however, wasnt present when the anthem was being played.         
	According to the protocol, national anthems cannot be played for more than 45 seconds. Since our national anthem runs up to 52 seconds, we were forced to cut it short Rao said.         
	None of the other countries participating in the tournament faced a similar situation since their national anthems are within the time frame.         
	The affair left the players confused. We were surprised Didnt know what was happening. I havent faced a similar situation before, said India captain Sanjay Kumar.         
	Coach Deshraj was equally shocked. We thought there must have been some problem with the music system Were not aware of any such rule which limits the timing of the national anthem.         
	But doesnt it amount to a show of disrespect towards the country? Our hands are tied and we simply went by the rule book, Rao tried to reason.         
	The protocol begins 31 minutes before the start of the match. A time frame is fixed for teams entering the court, flag hoisting, toss, national anthem, practice and warm-up, and introduction of match officials and players, he said.         
	But rules shouldnt be rigid, if it belittles the country. The Volleyball Federation of India, in fact, should take the initiative in forcing the international body to amend the protocol clause since it affects the country.         
	Weve got to find a way out Lets see how we can adjust the timing, said Rao.         
	Theres no doubt that the national anthem will be closely monitored on Saturday to prevent further embarrassment to the country.

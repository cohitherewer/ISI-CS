The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | East Bengal ready for Air India test
                                                                                                                       7                                        East Bengal ready for Air India test
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Trevor Morgan                           
	New Delhi: For the first time in many years, East Bengal will start title favourites when they begin their Durand Cup campaign against Air India at the Ambedkar Stadium on Saturday.         
	Having won 16 matches on the trot this season, the Federation Cup champions are also expected to bring in the spectators to the empty stands.         
	Desperate to get the crowd back, the Durand committee has made it a gate free tournament but the response so far has remained lukewarm.         
	The last time East Bengal won the Durand Cup was in 2004 when they tamed Mohun Bagan through a Chandan Das brace in the final.         
	Last season, their performance was one of the worst ever at the Delhi ground as they bowed out losing both the matches in the quarter final league.         
	If the East Bengal fans are hoping for a different script this time, they have solid reasons to feel so.         
	Currently, the Trevor Morgan-coached side is going through a phase that reminds one of the East Bengal team in the 70s.         
	The red and yellow brigade this season are a youthful team that has a bunch of upcoming footballers and four foreign recruits, who have been making a lot of difference.         
	So solid are East Bengal that they are not even feeling the absence of the players who are in the national camp. To add to it, the coach has plenty of players to choose from.         
	Even in defence, an area where one has be more careful, East Bengal have an array of Indian players like Naoba Singh, Ravinder Singh, Saumik Dey, Nirmal Chetri, Gurwinder Singh and Sunil Kumar, all of whom are capable of delivering the goods at this level.         
	East Bengal also have more goalscorers in their ranks than any other team.         
	While Tolgay Ozebey and Penn Orji are doing the bulk of the scoring, there are others like Eneke Ikenwa and Robin Singh, who are equally good in finding the target.         
	Our biggest work in hand is to keep the rhythm going, said Morgan, who left for a short tour of Agra immediately after the practice session in the morning.         
	We want to make it sure the winning run doesnt get broken here, the coach added.         
	Yet, the Saturdays match could be a test of skills for the 16-time champions in the three-team group.         
	In 1975 the crack East Bengal side were on a roll as they won 25 back to back matches but were held to a draw by Mumbais Mafatlal in the DCM tourney at the same venue.         
	Air India, however, are no match to the Mafatlal of the 70s.         
	Coached by Yusuf Ansari, Air India lost to Salgaocar in their opening match, and looked a struggling lot.

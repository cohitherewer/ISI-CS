	Chennai: Wimbledon finalist and world No. 6 Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic will lead the field at the 2011 Chennai Open ATP tournament.         
	Other top players who will play the tournament, between January 3-9, are defending champion Marin Cilic (world No. 14), Richard Gasquet (world No. 29), Jeremy Chardy (world No. 45) and Janko Tipsarevic (world No. 49). Commonwealth and Asian Games gold medallist Somdev Dev Varman, ranked 106 in the world, will get a direct entry. In the last two years, he had been granted a wild card.         
	This is one of the best fields weve had in recent years which underlines the growing stature of the Chennai Open, Ravi Krishnan of IMG, the company which owns the tournament, said Thursday. The three wild cards will be announced in December.         
	The meet will stay in Chennai at least till 2013, said Karti Chidambaram, organising chairman of the tournament.         
	For the first time, hawk eye technology will be in use on centre court. According to rules, each player is eligible for three challenges in each set under the system.         
	He also hoped that the doubles draw would feature Asian Games golden duo Dev Varman and Sanam Singh. The meet will also see Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi playing together in the draw.         
	The ATP has plans of trimming down the calendar from 2014 while there are plans of upgrading the Chennai Open to a 500 points meet.

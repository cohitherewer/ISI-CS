                                                                                                                       7                                      Elated Vinay thanks selectors 
                      
	Bangalore: His three-year wait finally over, Karnataka pacer Ranganath Vinay Kumar Friday vowed to put his best foot forward if he gets an opportunity in the forthcoming Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies.         
	It is always a great feeling to be given the honour of playing for the country, I am elated. I thank the selectors for recognising my performance. I will do my very best to vindicate their faith in me, HE said.         
	Vinay Kumar was rewarded for his consistent performance in domestic cricket as he was the only new face to be included in the 15-member squad, to be led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, for the mega-event starting next month.         
	I have to thank Anil Kumble, Rahul Dravid, Jawagal Srinath, Venkatesh Prasad and Sunil Joshi for backing me. They always stood behind me, said Vinay, who has had the rare privilege of taking Sachin Tendulkars wicket twice in the Indian Premier League.         
	I would also like to thank my coach Prakash Pawar, who is no more, and LM Prakash for recognising my talent and developing me into what I am today. K. Jeswanth and K. Sanath Kumar (Karnataka coaches) were also instrumental in shaping my career, he added.         
	Vinay revealed that he was grateful to former Karnataka bowler YB Patel. He would say that I will go on to play big cricket and always encouraged me. Even on his deathbed, he told someone to hand over a kit bag to me. I havent used it. I treasure it.         
	Vinays coach Prakash recalled his dedication as a 13-year-old.         
	I first saw him at the Mothiveerappa High School ground... He was a quick learner, rectifying his mistakes with each match.         
	I knew he would play for India one day, said Prakash.         
	His family was also ecstatic.         
	I am very happy for my son. I am sure he will perform well for the country, said Soubhagya, his mother.         
	Meanwhile, opener Gautam Gambhir feels that Indias prospect in the Twenty20 World Cup will depend on how fast the team acclimatises in the West Indies.         
	Its important how we adjust after reaching there. Its going to be the key and we have to go all guns blazing. We are hoping to put up a good show, said Gambhir.         
	The left-hander said most of the Indian players would reach the West Indies having played in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and that would stand them in good stead.         
	We are already in Twenty20 mode because of the IPL. So I think it will help us to play well there, the Delhi DareDevils player said on Friday. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridis action cost Pak dear: Ponting
                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridis action cost Pak dear: Ponting
                      
	Melbourne/Karachi: Taking a pot shot at Shahid Afridi for tampering with the ball during the fifth one-day International here, Australian captain Ricky Ponting said the Pakistani all-rounders action ended up costing his side a rare victory on what has been a nightmarish tour for the visitors.         
	Whitewashed in the Test series and trailing 0-4 in the one-day series, Pakistans misery was compounded when Afridi, who was the stand-in captain in place of an injured Mohammed Yousuf, was caught biting the ball during the fifth and final ODI at the Waca in Perth Sunday.         
	Afridi was subsequently banned for two Twenty20 matches after pleading guilty to the charge. Ponting said the ball-tampering incident might have taken Afridis mind off the proceedings on the ground which ultimately helped Australia clinch the match by just two wickets and blank Pakistan 5-0 in the series.         
	As soon as the Afridi thing happened, the umpires acted really well and changed the ball straight away, Ponting said.         
	I think he himself must have realised when they changed the ball, he had actually been caught in the act. He would have had all sorts of things going through his mind for the last couple of overs, and as captain you have enough going through your head without worrying about things like that, he added.         
	Afridi was charged with article 2.2.9 offence of the ICC Code of Conduct which relates to changing the condition of the ball in breach of Law 42.3 of the Laws of Cricket.         
	He will miss Pakistans next two Twenty20 Internationals against the same opponents on Friday in Melbourne and against England in Dubai on February 19.         
	Pakistan Cricket Board sources said immediately after television cameras showed Afridi biting into the ball to change its condition, a top official called up team manager Abdul Raquib and instructed him not to send Afridi for the presentation and instead ask regular captain Mohammed Yousuf to do that job.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Saturday extended the tenure of the three-member disciplinary committee, comprising Chirayu Amin, Arun Jaitley and Jyotiraditya Scindia, that is probing allegations of irregularities against Lalit Modi.         
	The extension of the panel, which would continue to function till the end of the inquiry, was approved by the working committee at a special general meeting on Saturday.         
	Besides this panel, a new disciplinary committee was also formed as per the constitution of the BCCI, chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty said.         
	The constitution requires the president to be one of the members. So while the committee that was formed to probe the allegations against Modi was given an extension, a new one with president Shashank Manohar, Chirayu Amin and Arun Jaitley was also formed and ratified, Shetty said.         
	The probe panel, a sub-committee of the Board, had a years term which expired at the end of September. However, the Board failed to reconstitute the panel at the annual general meeting on September 29, which allowed Modi to question its legality in the Supreme Court.         
	BCCI secretary N Srinivasan said that there would be no scope for finding a legal loop-hole by Modis camp now. There is no violation of the Constitution here, he said.         
	The members also ratified the disciplinary proceedings against Modi from September 29 to till date.         
	Officially, there was no other item except those regarding the disciplinary committee on the agenda of the SGM. But, a source said that plans were afoot to appeal the interim order of the Bombay high court which stayed the termination of Kings XI Punjab from the IPL last week.         
	The BCCI might wait for the decision of the high court which is hearing its appeal against an arbitrators stay on the Rajasthan Royals termination. The order is expected on Monday.         
	The BCCI also seems to be mulling the idea of postponing the IPL players auction set for January 8-9 but there was little clarity on the way ahead.         
	It all depends on the verdict of the court, you know, the source said.         
	Meanwhile, the SGM also witnessed Indias leading wicket-taker and former captain Anil Kumble attend his first Board meeting, as the newly-elected president of the Karnataka State Cricket Association.         
	Kumble later chaired a meeting of the National Cricket Academy as well. A meeting of the representatives of the state associations from the North-East was also held.

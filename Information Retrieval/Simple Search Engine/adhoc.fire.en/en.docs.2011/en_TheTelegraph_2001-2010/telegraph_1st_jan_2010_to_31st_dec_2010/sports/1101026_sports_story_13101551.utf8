The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir, Ishant return
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gambhir, Ishant return
            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES                            
	Calcutta/Chennai: Left-handed opener Gautam Gambhir and pacer Ishant Sharma returned after injury lay-offs as the national selectors Monday announced a full strength 15-member Test squad for next months series against New Zealand.         
	Gambhir and Ishant, who had to sit out of the second and final Test, against Australia, in Bangalore, because of knee injuries, have recovered sufficiently to be named in the squad, which has no new faces.         
	While upcoming batsman Cheteshwar Pujara has been retained, two other youngsters Abhinav Mukund and Jaidev Unadkat have been left out of the team announced by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) after a meeting of the selection committee here.         
	Yuvraj Singh again failed to find favour in the Test squad, with the selectors opting for Suresh Raina and Pujara as the middle-order batsmen, both of whom have done reasonably well when provided with the opportunity. Pujaras impressive show in the Bangalore Test, where he scored a fluent 72 in the second innings, ensured that he got the nod ahead of senior pro Yvuraj.         
	The team, to be led by Mahendra Singh Dhoni, have three fast bowlers in Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth and Ishant and three specialist spinners  Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra and Pragyan Ojha.         
	The Indian batting order looks formidable as it has stars like Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag, who have all been in fine nick in recent times. Laxman, who missed the Bangalore Test owing to back problems, has also been named in the squad.         
	The return of Gambhir means that opener Murali Vijay might not find a place in the playing XI in the Test series commencing from November 4, in Ahmedabad.         
	The team has performed extremely well against the Australians in both the Tests and one-day International series, particularly the Bangalore Test. The junior players have gelled well in the middle-order with the seniors. The bowlers, too, have done a remarkable job.         
	Going by this, we have picked the team for all the three Tests. I am confident that our players will continue their victory march, chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth said.         
	The utility of our bench strength was there for all to witness. This is a good sign for Indian cricket, Srikkanth said, adding that the team for the one-day series will be picked later.         
	Dhoni did not attend the meeting but he was consulted over phone by the five-member selection panel.         
	The focus during the series will clearly be on batting icon Tendulkar, who needs just one more century to complete 50 Test centuries in his illustrious career.

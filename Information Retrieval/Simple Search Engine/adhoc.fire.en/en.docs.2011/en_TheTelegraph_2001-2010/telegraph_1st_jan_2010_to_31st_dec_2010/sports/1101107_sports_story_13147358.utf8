	London: Investigation into spot -fixing scandal involving three Pakistan cricketers has gathered pace with London police submitting a second file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).         
	The documents claimed that trio of Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer  currently suspended from international cricket by the International Cricket Council (ICC)  accepted bribes to engage in spot-fixing during the fourth Test, against England, at Lords in August, a British newspaper reported.         
	Scotland Yard said evidence that there was a conspiracy to defraud bookmakers will be considered by the CPS, although the investigation remains ongoing.         
	Detectives interviewed four players (Butt, Asif, Aamer and Wahab Riaz) under caution and arrested the businessman Mazhar Majeed as part of the inquiry. Majeed is accused of accepting 150,000 to fix the actions of several players during a Test at Lords.         
	The Metropolitan Police has Saturday delivered a second file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service in connection with the investigation of alleged offences in relation to the fourth Test at Lords Cricket Ground on August 26. The file will now be subject to CPS consideration, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.         
	British tabloid News of the World had shook the cricket world with a sting operation which had suspected bookmaker Majeed claiming that he paid bribes to three cricketers for sending down no balls during the Lords Test.         
	After the Test series, the third ODI at the Oval also came under suspicion but the ICC later cleared the match of any wrongdoing. (PTI)

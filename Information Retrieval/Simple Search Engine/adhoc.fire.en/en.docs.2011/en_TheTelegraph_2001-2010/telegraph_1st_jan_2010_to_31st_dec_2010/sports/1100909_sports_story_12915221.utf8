The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No pressure at all, says Alviro
                                                                                                                       7                                      No pressure at all, says Alviro
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Of the 10 teams that have qualified for the Airtel Champions League Twenty20 (CLT20), the Bizhub Highveld Lions are probably regarded as the least likely to succeed  and Lions captain Alviro Petersen is happy with the tag of being underdogs.         
	No-one is expecting us to do anything, so theres no pressure at all, said Petersen. I quite like that  it means we can play our natural game. If we play to our potential, we could pull off some surprises. We dont have the big names like some of the other teams  in fact, on paper, we are probably the weakest team in the tournament. But cricket matches arent played on paper and we believe we can knock some of those big names over, Petersen was quoted as saying in a press release.         
	Petersen said the Lions had been training hard, trying out various combinations.         
	We have quite a few options open to us, he said. For instance, Neil McKenzie opened for us last year, but he has been batting in the middle order for Hampshire, so that is something we can play around with. Were a very young team, but we have a lot of confidence in one another.         
	The Lions launch CLT20 with the opening match against glamour side the Mumbai Indians at the Wanderers on Saturday.         
	The Mumbai Indians, who include players such as the Little Master, Sachin Tendulkar, Sri Lankan Lasith Malinga, wily spin bowler Harbhajan Singh, West Indies all-rounders Kieron Pollard and Dwayne Bravo, and South Africas own JP Duminy and Ryan McLaren, but Petersen is not over-awed.

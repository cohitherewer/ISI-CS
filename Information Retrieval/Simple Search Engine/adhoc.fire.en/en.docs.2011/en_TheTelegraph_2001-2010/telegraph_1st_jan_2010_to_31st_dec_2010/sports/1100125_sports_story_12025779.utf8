    - Juan Martin Del Potro bites the dust; Justine Henin in quarters                   Maria Kirilenko in Melbourne on Sunday                             
	Melbourne: US Open champion Juan Martin del Potros bid for back-to-back Grand Slam titles ended in a fourth-round, five-set loss to No. 14 Marin Cilic on Sunday. Two higher-ranked womens seeds, both Russian, exited with him. No. 2-ranked Dinara Safina retired while she was down 4-5, serving at 30-40 in the first set against Maria Kirilenko, whod ousted 2008 champion and fellow Russian Maria Sharapova in the first round.         
	No. 3-ranked Svetlana Kuznetsova lost 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 to Nadia Petrova, who went into the match on a stunning, 6-0, 6-1 third-round victory over US Open champion Kim Clijsters.         
	While the seeded players dropped, former No. 1 Justine Henin continued her run in her first Grand Slam tournament for two years with a 7-6 (3), 1-6, 6-3 win over fellow Belgian Yanina Wickmayer, setting her on course for a quarter final against Petrova.         
	Andy Roddick came from behind to wear down a frustrated Fernando Gonzalez of Chile 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 in an absorbing late-night battle on Sunday to reach the quarter finals.         
	The pair slugged it out for almost 3-1/2 hours at the Rod Laver Arena before the American, who has made the semi-finals of the Australian Open four times but never gone further, finally sealed victory on a Gonzalez double fault just after 1 a.m.Roddick was under pressure for most of the match, arguing with chair umpire Enric Molina several times, but regained his composure just as Gonzalez lost his cool late in the match.         
	Roddick, who belted 32 aces past Gonzalez, will play Cilic.         
	Safina, the 2009 Australian finalist who held the No. 1 ranking despite never winning a major, limped off with the recurrence of a back problem when she was facing set point against Kirilenko.         
	Del Potro, the 21-year-old Argentine was the first man since Novak Djokovic won the 2008 Australian Open to interrupt the Federer-Rafael Nadal domination of mens Grand Slam titles, and started the seasons first major with the No. 4 seeding. Defending champion Nadal and Andy Murray held off two of the tallest men and biggest servers in tennis earlier on Rod Laver Arena to set up a quarter final meeting.         
	Nadal had a 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 win over 2.08 (6-foot-10) Ivo Karlovic of Croatia, the tallest man on the tour. No. 5 Murray overcame 2.06-meter (6-foot-9) American John Isner 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-2 to reach the final eight in Australia for the first time.         
	2008 Wimbledon semi-finalist Zheng Jie became the first Chinese to reach the quarter finals at Melbourne Park with a 7-6 (6), 6-4 victory over Alona Bondarenko. She next plays Kirilenko.

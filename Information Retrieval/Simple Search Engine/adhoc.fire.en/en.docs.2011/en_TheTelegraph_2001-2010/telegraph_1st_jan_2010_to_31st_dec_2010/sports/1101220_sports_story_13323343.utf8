The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I should be fit for MCG, says Ricky
                                                                                                                       7                                      I should be fit for MCG, says Ricky
                      
	Perth: Ricky Ponting described Mitchell Johnsons spell on the second day as one of the greatest in Ashes history and has forced England to rethink their strategy for the Boxing Day Test.         
	Although they were 0/78 we felt we only needed one breakthrough, the ball was swinging and Mitchs spell was probably one of the all-time great Ashes spells, Ponting said.         
	With him coming into the game under a bit of pressure as well, it was an amazing achievement and set up this victory and the series for us. The spell has transformed him and transformed how they think about him in the English dressing room.         
	Ponting has told the selectors he has a 50:50 chance of playing at the MCG, after fracturing the little finger on his left hand while attempting to take a catch off Jonathan Trott on Saturday.         
	I have to have treatment and look after it for a few days and rest it, he said. I think I have a really good chance of playing, it is only a small fracture.

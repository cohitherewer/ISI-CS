The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IHF gets shot in the arm
                                                                                                                       7                                      IHF gets shot in the arm
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian hockey Friday found itself sliding deeper into an administrative muddle after the Delhi high court quashed the central government order derecognising the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) headed by K.P.S. Gill.         
	The court took the same view of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) order placing IHF under suspension.         
	While Justice S. Muralidhar of the Delhi high court termed the governments action illegal, Gill, who headed the IHF between 1993 and 2008, immediately launched an attack on his detractors in the IOA.         
	Hockey officials, however, feel that the latest court order could have put Indian hockey in an odd predicament in the international arena. Speaking to The Telegraph, a Hockey India (HI) official who did not wish to be named, claimed that HI had already been recognised by the International Hockey Federation (FIH).         
	FIH has already accepted IHFs derecognition and approved HI as the parent body, said the official.         
	The World Cup in Delhi was organised by HI. Under the present circumstances, the role of the FIH will be extremely important. The international federation wants HI to be the unified body for both mens and womens hockey in India. They may not recognise the IHF any more, he said.

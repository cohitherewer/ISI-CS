The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal shows hes the boss
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nadal shows hes the boss
                      
	Madrid: Rafa Nadal reasserted his dominance over Roger Federer on clay and laid down a marker for the French Open when he overwhelmed his arch rival 6-4, 7-6 in the final of the Madrid Open on Sunday.         
	Federer beat Nadal in last years final before going on to claim the French Open and Wimbledon crowns and snatching back the world No. 1 ranking from the Spaniard.         
	The eagerly-anticipated match in a packed and rowdy Magic Box arena graced by Spanish Queen Sofia was their first meeting since the 2009 title match and sets Nadal up for a run at regaining his Roland Garros crown when the grand slam starts next Sunday.         
	Nadal brought the partisan crowd to their feet when he took the first set and the noise reached ear-splitting levels as their hero fought back from 4-2 down to take the tiebreak before throwing himself face down on the clay.         
	Spaniard Nadal was first into Sundays final when he came from a set down to beat compatriot Nicolas Almagro 4-6, 6-2, 6-2 and world No. 1 Federer joined him by dispatching David Ferrer, another Spaniard, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3.         
	The last time the pair met across the net in a competitive match was in last years Madrid final.         
	Federers 6-4, 6-4 victory 12 months ago sparked off a golden spell for the Swiss as he went on to capture an emotional first title at Roland Garros before triumphing at Wimbledon for a sixth time.         
	Nadals 2009 season, which began with an epic five-set win over Federer at the Australian Open, hit the skids as injured knees prevented him from defending his Wimbledon crown and he surrendered the no. 1 ranking to his arch rival.         
	Nadal now has a 10-2 winning record on clay against Federer but with the French Open title in the hands of the Swiss, the world is waiting to see if the balance of power on the red dust will shift more towards the Spaniard.         
	On the eve of the match, a jovial Nadal, who now has an overall 14-7 winning record against Federer, had said he was not out for revenge.         
	I go out there to win every match and I forget about the previous one, said the 23-year-old, whose four-year French Open reign was ended last May.         
	I believe that if you think about revenge you dont have a cool enough head to play your normal game.         
	Its always a special motivation playing Federer and they are always very difficult matches.         
	Cries of Vamos Rafa! and Vamos Nico! rang out around Manolo Santana centre court earlier as the capacity crowd could not decide whether they wanted a massive upset win for unseeded Almagro or another victory for Nadal.

	Singapore: Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh returned a steady two-under 69 in the final round to sign off tied 16th in the Barclays Singapore Open here on Monday.         
	The Asian and European Tour co-sanctioned event went for a Monday finish after lightning and thunderstorm halted proceedings on the regulation Sunday.         
	Jeev ended his campaign with a total of seven-under 277 after striking four birdies against a couple of bogeys in the final round.         
	Shiv Kapur also brought home a 69 but finished tied 31st with a total of four-under 280.         
	Rahil Gangjee was a stroke adrift of Kapur at tied 37th after turning in a disappointing four-over 75.         
	Gaganjeet Bhullar was tied 49th in the final standings. Digvijay Singh was tied for the 64th spot after a four-over 75 in the final round took his overall score to three-over 287.         
	Australian Adam Scott lifted the trophy with a total of 17-under 267 after carding a three-under 68 in the final round. Dane Andres Hansen (68) was a distant second at 14-under 270.

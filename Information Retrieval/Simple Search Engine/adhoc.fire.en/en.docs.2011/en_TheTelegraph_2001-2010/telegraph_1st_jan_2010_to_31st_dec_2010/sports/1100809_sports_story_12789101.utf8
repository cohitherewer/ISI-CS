The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Patel wants a facelift
                                                                                                                       7                                      Patel wants a facelift
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: There seemed to be light at the end of the tunnel for the long standing problem of the Salt Lake Stadium being the only venue for national level matches within the city.         
	And the torchbearer of that hope is Praful Patel, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) president and minister of state for civil aviation. Patel, who was in the city to attend the Bengal-Punjab final of the 64th edition of the Santosh Trophy, said that he will take the initiative to talk with Bengal government about upgrading the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium.         
	There is a need for basic upgradation of the Rabindra Sarobar Stadium. It can turn out to be of great use because of its prime location at the heart of the city. I will talk with the government about increasing the lease period of the stadium and then we will chalk out development plans, Patel said.         
	He also revealed that the federation was serious about setting up national football academies. We have some proposals but nothing concrete have been decided yet. But we are on the process and I can assure that land will not be a problem for the purpose, he said.         
	He was also non-committal on plans of holding an IPL-like national league for football.

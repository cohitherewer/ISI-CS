The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I had great moments here: Moya
                                                                                                                       7                                      I had great moments here: Moya
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Two-time champion Carlos Moya of Spain is unlikely to play in the Chennai Open again. The former world No. 1, who crashed out of the doubles event on Thursday, said he was overwhelmed by the support he received from the fans here.         
	Moya, who was instrumental in bringing many top Spanish players including Rafael Nadal, David Ferrer and Fernando Verdasco to Indias only ATP event, said he was ready to do more.         
	I like to give back to the tournament that has been very special to me. I have had great moments here. You can ask anything that I can try to give back.         
	They made me feel at home since the first time I was here. Fans here have given me so much support, he said.         
	The only player to bag the singles title here twice, Moya, however, said he would continue to play the game. Hopefully, this is not my last year in the circuit. I hope to play well and can come back stronger.         
	It wasnt hard to motivate myself after the (injury) lay-off. I always loved tennis. But it has been hard in terms of recovery and mentally. I had tough moments in the last 10 months.

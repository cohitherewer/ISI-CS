            STAR RACER                          Hayes                            
	Calcutta: Alice Springs gets the first call in the six-horse field lined up for the Calcutta 1000 Guineas, the first classic of the season and the main attraction in Sundays nine-event race card. The Razeen-Allinda filly already has two monsoon seasons classics  the Fillies Trial Stakes and the Derby  under her belt and she may do the trick again. Jockey C.D. Hayes partners the filly.           
	The challenge, if any, to Alice Springs may come from trainer Arti Doctors new acquisition from western India, Amouresque, who is rated as good as Pesis charge. The Mr Mellon daughter is also very fit but what gives a thick edge to Alice Springs is her current form and also her vast improvement since the monsoon season. The local challenge will be spearheaded by Art Excellence.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

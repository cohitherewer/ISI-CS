  - Tennis greats shower accolades on Leander       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Leander Paes in Chennai, on Saturday. (PTI)                                 
	Chennai: Mahesh Bhupathi termed Leander Paes performances over the past 21 years, as amazing.         
	To play for 20 years is one thing but to outperform top players continuously like he has done is really amazing, Bhupathi said at a function to felicitate Paes on his 21st year off international tennis, here on Saturday.         
	Legendary Ramanathan Krishnan called Paes the greatest athlete and among contemporary Indias top three sportspersons.         
	Since his first appearance in the Davis Cup in 1990, he has kept his head down and worked hard to achieve all that he has achieved. India has three greats and thats Leander, Sachin Tendulkar and Viswanathan Anand, the 73-year-old said. Leander is the greatest athlete in Indian tennis and we must thank his father, Dr. Vece Paes. It is due to his efforts that we have Leander the champion.         
	Naresh Kumar, former Davis Cupper and Paes first captain, said unpredictability was the latters best asset. The opponents never knew what he was going to do next. And I saw that in Frejus when we defeated France, Kumar said.         
	Ramesh Krishnan said that Leander always relished the combat; while Shiv Prakash Misra, the current Davis Cup captain, prayed that the 37-year-old stayed fit till 2012 to win the Olympic gold with Bhupathi.         
	Meanwhile, Rohan Bopanna has made it clear that he would opt to play the year-end ATP World Tour Finals over the Asian Games if it came down to choosing between the two.         
	The 16th edition of the Asiad to be held in Guanghzou, China, from November 12-27 while the Finals, previously called the Masters Cup, are slated from November 21-28 in London. The top eight singles players and doubles teams qualify for the Finals.         
	Obviously, for me, it would be the Finals. If I qualify with Aisam(Ul-Haq Qureshi) it would be our first Finals. I would be letting him down if I didnt play. As a team we have to sit and decide, but for me it will be the Finals, Bopanna told The Telegraph.         
	Currently, the Indo-Pak duo are sixth in the ATP doubles team rankings. Paes and Lukas Dlouhy are ranked third while Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi are eighth.         
	Both Paes and Bhupathi have so far refused to comment on the topic. First, lets focus on the Commonwealth Games, was all that they have said.

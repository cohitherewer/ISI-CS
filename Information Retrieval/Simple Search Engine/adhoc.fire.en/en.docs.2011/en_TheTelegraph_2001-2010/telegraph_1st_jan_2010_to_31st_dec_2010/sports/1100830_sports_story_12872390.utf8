The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis steals thrilling win
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lewis steals thrilling win
                      
	Spa-Francorchamps: McLarens Lewis Hamilton won a chaotic and thrilling Belgian Grand Prix to seize back the Formula One championship lead from Red Bulls Mark Webber on Sunday.         
	Hamiltons victory, despite a near-miss with the barriers in the challenging conditions ranging from dry to wet, lifted him three points clear of second-placed Webber at the top of the standings with six races remaining.         
	It was a great weekend, and very tough racing, said the Briton.         
	The success, his third of the season, contrasted to team mate and reigning world champion Jenson Buttons misfortune on a sweet and sour day for the British team and their two world champions.         
	Button, running behind Hamilton in a McLaren one-two at the fast and flowing circuit, was shunted out of the race by Webbers young German teammate and title rival Sebastian Vettel on the 17th of the 44 laps.         
	Vettel was handed a drive-through penalty for causing a collision and then plunged further back through the field after tangling with Force Indias Vitantonio Liuzzi and puncturing the left rear tyre.         
	The German ended up 15th and out of the points for the third time this year.         
	Force Indias Adrian Sutil grabbed the fifth spot while Liuzzi ended 10th.         
	Webber, winner of four of the 13 races so far this season, had been on pole position but suffered a terrible start on an afternoon where the fickle Spa weather played its hand to full effect and the safety car was twice deployed.         
	Lewis deserved the win, he did a good job, the Australian said.         
	Polands Robert Kubica finished third for Renault, losing second with a pit stop error but still taking a morale-boosting result for a team who this time last year became embroiled in a major race-fixing scandal that led to a suspended permanent ban.         
	Hamilton has 182 points to Webbers 179 and Vettels 151. Button is on 147.         
	Ferraris Fernando Alonso, fifth in the standings, retired after an incident-filled afternoon. He collided with Brazilian Rubens Barrichello on the opening lap and dropped to 20th place.         
	The debris from that incident, apart from ending Barrichellos 300th race without the Williams veteran completing a lap, brought out the safety car.           (REUTERS)

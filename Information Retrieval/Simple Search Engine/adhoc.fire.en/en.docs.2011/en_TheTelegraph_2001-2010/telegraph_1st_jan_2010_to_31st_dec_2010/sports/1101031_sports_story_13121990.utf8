The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods will roar back, feels Colin 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods will roar back, feels Colin 
                      
	Hainan: Golf is entering a new competitive era with Tiger Woods set to be toppled from the No.1 spot after this weekend, European Ryder Cup winning captain Colin Montgomerie believes.         
	Either Briton Lee Westwood or German Martin Kaymer, both in Montgomeries successful Ryder Cup team in Wales, will be crowned No.1 when the new rankings are released on Monday, ending Woodss 281-week reign.         
	Kaymer, who won the U.S. PGA championship this year, needs to finish inside the top two at the Andalucia Masters to take the top spot. Westwood, at home resting an injured calf, will become world No.1 if Kaymer does not achieve the top-two finish.         
	Both Martin and Lee are deserving of the No.1 title, Montgomerie said at the Mission Hills pro-celebrity tournament in Hainan, southern China on Saturday. I would say they are No.1 and 2 in the world.         
	You cant knock Martins and Lees current form.         
	It could mean Europe has one and two, for the first time since the heady days when (Nick) Faldo, (Bernhard) Langer, (Ian) Woosnam and Seve (Ballesteros) were on top of that tree.         
	This world competition being so close is fantastic and great for golf, (especially) with Phil Mickelson close behind and other Europeans coming through to join that band.         
	Montgomerie, however, was quick to warn his European protgs that the American will roar back.It might be the end of Tigers reign for a limited spell. I dont think he will be happy at being No. 2 or 3 in the world, Montgomerie added.

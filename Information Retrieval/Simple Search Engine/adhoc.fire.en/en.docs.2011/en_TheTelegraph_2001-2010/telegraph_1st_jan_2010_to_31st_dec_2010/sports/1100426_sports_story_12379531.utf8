	Jeju Island: A disastrous back-nine marred Shiv Kapurs card and he turned in a two-over 74 in the final round to sign off tied 40th in the 54-hole Ballantines golf championship here Sunday.         
	Kapur ended his campaign with a total of one-over 217. The other Indian in fray, Gaganjeet Bhullar finished further down the leaderboard at tied 60th after a horrendous 78 in the final round left him five-over 221 overall.         
	At the top, Australias Marcus Fraser landed the biggest win of his career when he carded a final round three-under 69 for a total of 12-under 204.         
	The Australian held his nerves under pressure to win by four shots, fending off the challenge of Gareth Maybin of Northern Ireland and Brett Rumford who shares second place on 208.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Victory was Bonds target
                                                                                                                       7                                        Victory was Bonds target
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Bond                           
	Ahmedabad: Shane Bond, who unleashed a thunderbolt at 154 kmph in the recent New Zealand-Australia ODI series, is somewhat sorry that Mahendra Singh Dhoni took a hit at the Eden on Tuesday.         
	Look, I dont want to hit batsmen... Its something which happened... Its a shame that Chennai Super Kings will have to do without their captain for a while, Bond told The Telegraph.         
	Dhoni is, of course, the India captain, too. He has suffered an injury to his right arm and is definitely out of the franchises next two matches.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders rather soft spoken spearhead added: More than hitting Dhoni, I wouldve loved to take a few wickets and help our franchise win...         
	Bond, who has quit Test cricket to focus on ODIs and T20, went wicketless in his four overs. He took the field less than a day-and-a-half after touching down in Calcutta.         
	For the record, the Knights lost by 55 runs.

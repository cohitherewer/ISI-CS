	London: Morten Gamst Pedersen scored a goal in each half as Blackburn Rovers began life under their new Indian owners with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa in the Premier League on Sunday.         
	In another EPL match, Manchester City thrashed Fulham 4-1. Carlos Tevez scored a brace while Pablo Zabaleta and Yaya Toure scored one each for the winners. Fulhams Zoltan Gera grabbed a consolation goal in the 70th minute.         
	The Norway winger opened the scoring in first-half injury time with a curling free kick that sailed over Villa keeper Brad Friedel and sealed the points for Rovers by stabbing home a shot from close range in the 66th.         
	Villa, which brought new signing Robert Pires off the bench for the final 22 minutes, created more chances throughout but found Blackburn goalkeeper Paul Robinson in inspired form.         
	The win lifted the northwest club, who were bought on Friday by Indian poultry giant Venkys, above Villa, and into 11th place in the table.         
	Blackburns new owners, Indian businessmen Balaji Rao and B. Venkatesh Rao, were at Ewood Park for the match and were given a generous reception by the home crowd before kickoff.         
	Ashley Young, the England winger was at the heart of most of Villas attacking moves and brought a sprawling save out of Blackburn goalkeeper Paul Robinson with a low, angled drive in the 14th minute.         
	Robinson had earlier kept out Stewart Downings fierce shot while at the other end, Friedel was being kept busy thanks to the dangerous long throws of Pedersen. It was the wingers left foot that made the breakthrough, however, as his free kick from the right surprised Friedel, who flapped at a ball which soared over his head and into the top corner of the net.         
	The goal came somewhat against the run of play and at the start of the second half, Young first drew a diving save from Robinson before heading against the top of the crossbar seconds later.         
	Blackburn continued to look threatening on set pieces and it was from that route that the hosts doubled their lead in the 66th.         
	A second corner in quick succession ended in Phil Jones flashing a shot across goal that Pedersen stabbed home from a central position six yards out.           (AGENCIES)

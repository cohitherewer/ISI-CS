The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Loss to Sunderland clubs worst: Carlo

            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	London: Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti has labelled his sides 3-0 defeat at the hands of Sunderland as the worst in his time at the club.         
	 It was Chelseas first home defeat since last March, their heaviest loss at Stamford Bridge since a 3-0 defeat to Manchester United in 2002 and the worst against a non top-four side since 1995.         
	Chelsea, who sacked assistant Ray Wilkins in midweek, were outplayed and outfought by a Sunderland side who won comfortably with goals from Nedum Onuoha, Asamoah Gyan and Danny Welbeck.         
	The hosts were without injured captain John Terry and Alex (knee) in the centre of defence, and Sunderland exposed the failings of replacements Paulo Ferreira and Branislav Ivanovic with ease.         
	After the defeat, Ancelotti said: We have to have a meeting about this on Thursday when they come back from the international break to look at what happened.         
	I think this was the worst performance since Ive been here. The performance was poor today, but in football it can happen if youre not at your best and dont play with your best mentality.         
	All the things were wrong. We didnt play the way we wanted to, Sunderland showed fantastic spirit and played better.         
	We were not able to come back into the game. It was a bad day. We were not able to play our football for 90 minutes, just 15 minutes in the first half.         
	Terry has been carrying a recurring back problem for 12 games, but despite his absence and that of Alex and the suspended Michael Essien, Ancelotti remains confident that his squad is strong enough.         
	Terry trained yesterday but, at the end of the training session, he had pain on his nerve in his hamstring and we had the test this morning, Ancelotti added.         
	He was not able to play. I dont think he will be able to play for the national team (on Wednesday). He is out of the squad. I dont know if he has to report  we will wait to hear from them.         
	He had control of this problem. He never missed a training session, but yesterday the pain was more, so he was not able to play.         
	But I think he can play the next game. It is an injury, but he can control it. He has controlled it for 12 games. Hes doing good prevention, good treatment. Everything will be OK for him.         
	Sometimes weve had some players out in the past, some important players, and the teams played well. Today was different. We were not able to play our football.         
	I think the squad is strong enough. We maintain our position at the top of the table. Were not happy today because, above all, at home we have to play with a different mentality. I hope we come back early and in the right way.         
	Sunderland manager Steve Bruce meanwhile, was full of praise for his players for producing a result, which ranks among the best of the season.         
	Its not often you beat this lot 3-0 in their backyard, Bruce said. It wont happen very often again. We really took it to them.         
	The players have been fantastic over the last two weeks and Im very proud of the performance. People are so frightened coming here and no one wants to get humiliated, so we thought wed give it a go.         
	But you still need the players to perform, like Welbeck, at 19, who was terrific.         
	All around, they all produced a fantastic performance. I hope people talk about Sunderland rather than Chelseas poor performance. Its not a fluke.         
	Bruces side have produced an astonishing turnaround since they lost 5-1 to neighbours Newcastle a couple of weeks ago.         
	Ill never get rid of it totally, Bruce added. Its there on the CV. Youre looking to try and respond and thankfully the players have done. Theyve rolled up their sleeves and turned it round.

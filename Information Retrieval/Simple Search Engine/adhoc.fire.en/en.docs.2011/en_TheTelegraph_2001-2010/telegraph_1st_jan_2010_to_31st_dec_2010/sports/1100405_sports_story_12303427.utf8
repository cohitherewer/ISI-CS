The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights lose, but SRK   is a winner
                                                                                                                       7                                      Knights lose, but SRK   is a winner
  - MoM Jayawardene hits unbeaten 110 to lead Kings XI to stunning victory
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Eighteen sixes were fired at the Eden, on Sunday. And, perhaps, as many points made.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders principal owner, Shah Rukh Khan, himself scripted one  that while he hates losing, hes gracious enough to acknowledge a terrific performance.         
	Shah Rukh congratulated every member of the Kings XI Punjab and, despite the massive difference in height, hugged visiting coach Tom Moody.         
	His team couldnt defend 200 for three, but Shah Rukh was a clear off-the-field winner.         
	Colleague and a co-owner of the Kings XI, Preity Zinta, however, gave Calcutta a miss.         
	With the Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals having raised the T20-bar, the previous evening, the more realistic of the Knights supporters wouldnt have gone overboard at the break.         
	Just as well, for Sourav Gangulys pre-tournament belief that bowling was his teams strong point went for a toss as MoM Mahela Jayawardene (110 not out from 59 balls; 14x4, 3x6), captain Kumar Sangakkara and the franchises icon, Yuvraj Singh, pulled off a stunning eight-wicket win.         
	It was for the first time that the Knights werent able to grab the two points despite touching the 200-mark. Now, progressing in IPL III is going to get that much tougher.         
	Requiring a shade over 10 per over, the Kings XI put in such an awesome display that the target was actually overhauled with a minimum of 10 deliveries remaining!         
	Thanks to Yuvraj and Jayawardene, who helped themselves to 19 runs in the 17th over, from the otherwise stingy Murali Kartik, the runs-per-ball ratio turned in favour of the Kings XI  13 from 18.         
	What at one time was a Himalayan ask, got reduced to a cakewalk.         
	The chase was so perfectly paced that if the first six overs produced 69 (for the loss of one wicket), the next six saw almost as many  67  being added.         
	We didnt bowl well... At no stage of the match did we manage to put them under any sort of pressure, conceded Sourav, whod helped raise a decent platform for the innings to take off.         
	Sourav should have added the fielding bit. The josh wasnt there. Instead, clumsiness was on view, starting with a Manoj Tiwary misfield on, believe it or not, the first ball.         
	No wonder Shah Rukh tweeted: ...fielding aaaghh. That said it all.         
	Chris Gayle, whod been under some pressure after Brendon McCullums arrival, responded with a power-driven 88 off 42 deliveries (6x4, 8x6).         
	Four of his sixes came in one Ravi Bopara over, the most expensive in the IPLs three-year history.         
	After sweating it out in vain, Gayle had no choice but to admit that the loss was very disappointing.         
	Having conceded 33 in that over, the innings 13th, Bopara must have been most relieved with the result.         
	Many were surprised not to see McCullum in the Knights XI, but the defeat had little to do with his absence. After all, the batting line-up cant be criticised if the bowlers fail to defend 200.         
	Jayawardene, who played only because of an injury to Shaun Marsh during training, also made a point or two. That experience makes a difference and that he remains among the more classy batsmen in the subcontinent.         
	Conventional shots worked for Murali Vijay on Saturday; they worked for Jayawardene, as well.         
	Incidentally, Mahela himself suggested to Moody (with whom hed worked very closely during their years as the Sri Lanka captain and coach, respectively) that he be given the responsibility to open, with Manvinder Bisla.         
	The move clicked.         
	Sangakkaras team began and ended the match at the bottom of the table, but if the emotions seen after the victory are an indication, then the Kings XI may become a dangerous opposition.         
	Even wins in all the remaining matches could prove futile, but the Kings XI may still be party-poopers.         
	By the way, but for the heat, Jayawardenes wife Christina would have watched his superb innings. Her best friend from the schooldays in Bangalore stays in Calcutta and theyd come together in the afternoon. The heat drove them back to the hotel, Jayawardene told The Telegraph.         
	The real heat, however, was felt by the Knights.

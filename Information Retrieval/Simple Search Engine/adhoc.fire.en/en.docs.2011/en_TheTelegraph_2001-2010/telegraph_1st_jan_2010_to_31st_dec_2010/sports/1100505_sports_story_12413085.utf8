The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lippi happy not being favourites
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lippi happy not being favourites
                      
	Rome: Coach Marcello Lippi is pleased that most analysts dont expect Italy to win the World Cup again.         
	Speaking at the start of a two-day training camp on Tuesday, Lippi said his team was lucky that Brazil, England and Spain were being hailed as the pre-tournament favourites.         
	Italy are never the favourites for the World Cup and that helps, Lippi said. But look at our history. Weve won four times and lost once to Brazil on penalties. If we had won that shootout we would have five World Cups now and Brazil would have four.         
	Lippi also pointed to Englands single title, and how Spain were yet to win.         
	They say a lot of things in the rest of the world, but Italy have always been a protagonist at the World Cup and Im extremely confident that this group is going to do great as well.         
	Lippi guided Italy to the title in Germany four years ago, then departed only to come back and replace Roberto Donadoni after the Azzurris lost to Spain in the quarter finals of the 2008 European Championship.         
	Lippi has stuck with his core group from 2006, with the likes of Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Gianluca Zambrotta and Gennaro Gattuso still on the team.         
	Some people might say that it doesnt help to think about the past, but theres nothing wrong with recalling that spirit and desire we had four years ago, Lippi said, adding that he sees even more of that spirit this time.         
	Twenty-nine players have been called in for this mini camp, though none from AS Roma and Inter Milan, who meet in the Italian Cup final on Wednesday. Giuseppe Rossi of Villarreal was also absent because of a midweek Spanish league game.         
	Juventus Brazilian-born forward Amauri, who recently gained Italian citizenship, was left out in favour of the likes of Alberto Gilardino, Antonio di Natale and Vincenzo Iaquinta.         
	Im not going to provide explanations, Lippi said of his choices.         
	As for the American-born forward Rossi, Lippi said hes in my notebook. Hes among the 30 players Im following, but then added, at a certain point Im going to have to make my choices and some people are going to be left out.         
	Lippi left some room open for the possible return of AS Roma captain Francesco Totti, who retired from international play after helping Italy win in 2006.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dont blame IPL parties for T20 debacle: Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dont blame IPL parties for T20 debacle: Sachin
                  Sachin Tendulkar                     
	Pune: Contradicting Mahendra Singh Dhonis views, senior batsman Sachin Tendulkar on Friday said that IPL parties cannot not be blamed for Indias debacle in the recent World Twenty20 in the West Indies.         
	Sachin said that each and every player should be aware of their responsibilities. Parties and performance are two different things that cannot be related and every player should know his responsibility, Tendulkar told reporters after laying foundation stone of an extension of Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital here. Besides, Sachin said parties are not new in cricket.         
	Parties used to be held even in the past, he said, laying stress on observing individuals discretion in the matter. Sachin, who led Mumbai Indians to the final of IPL III, said he avoided the parties since he wanted to be fresh for the next days match.         
	I did not go for any of the IPL parties. I always wanted to be ready for the next match, he said. Tendulkar said every player should know how his body reacts and follow certain things to carry out his duties and responsibilities.         
	Arguably the greatest batsman ever, Sachin said it was important to understand your body and strike a balance between play and rest.         
	On personal front, Sachin Tendulkar considers the Test hundred he scored just a fortnight after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks as the best of his career so far.         
	It was not about the Test match but about something which happened two weeks before that. Something had happened in Mumbai. It was difficult to prepare for a Test (under those circumstances). It was gracious of England to come here, said Tendulkar, who along with wife Anjali, hosted a fund-raising dinner for the Crusade against Cancer Foundation here on Thursday evening.         
	There were all sorts of talks and then suddenly all our focus was on the match. England dominated the match for almost four days before Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir brought us back into it, he recounted.         
	Generally when we win, it is the groundsmen who run to congratulate us, but on that day the groundswomen rushed to congratulate us, he said. By no means India winning a Test match could compensate the lives lost. But for our team, we had succeeded in bringing a fraction of a smile on the faces of the people. That is why the hundred in Chennai Test match will be the best (of my career).

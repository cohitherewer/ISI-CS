            QUICK TAKES                
	Johannesburg: They can call their wives and families back home but German players have no way of reaching team mates with their fancy new cell phones , players said on Tuesday.         
	Each of the 23 players has been given a cell phone with the corresponding numbers of their team mates already entered in them  but so far they are unable to talk to each other.         
	We each got a cell phone but they dont work at all, said central defender Arne Friedrich. I can call my girlfriend in Berlin but cannot talk to other players.               
	Milan: Italy forward Vincenzo Iaquinta has called on his Juventus teammates at the World Cup to learn from a mistaken approach which led to the Turin sides poor season.         
	Weve got to change our attitude because the approach weve had this year has definitely been wrong.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Concentration was key: Das
                                                                                                                       7                                      Concentration was key: Das
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Bengals Arindam Das was visibly delighted after taking an unbeaten hundred off the Delhi attack in the opening game of the Ranji Trophy season on Monday, but said the challenging nature of the pitch at the Kotla ground made it imperative for him to concentrate hard on staying at the crease.         
	The team needed a good start and I am glad I have played a role in ensuring that we won all three sessions today (Monday), he said. I had to concentrate hard since there was the low and inconsistent bounce, which was challenging. It is not an easy wicket to play the drive on.         
	Das unbeaten 215 against Gujarat seven years ago remains his career best knock and he knows that if he resumes on Tuesday with similar focus as on the opening day, he can perhaps surpass that. We do not have any target in mind but want to keep winning sessions, so that we can pressurize the home team.         
	His partner in the 133-run opening stand, Sreevats Goswami, knew that he had a century in sight but blew it away. I am really disappointed that I did not make the most of the good start that we had got in the first session, but I am sure that I will only get better, he said, having notched up his maiden first class half-century in his third match.         
	Delhi coach Manoj Prabhakar was another disappointed man on Monday. Even if there is no help from the pitch, bowlers must not lose line and length, he said. These things cannot be taught to or impressed upon the bowlers. We gave away extra runs on the field too and it seemed like instead of 88 overs, the team had been on the field for more than 100.

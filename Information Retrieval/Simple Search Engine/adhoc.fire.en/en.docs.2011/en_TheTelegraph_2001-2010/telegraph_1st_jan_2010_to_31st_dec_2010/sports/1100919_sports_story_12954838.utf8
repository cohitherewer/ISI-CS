The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Do-or-die tie for MI
                                                                                                                       7                                      Do-or-die tie for MI
                      
	Durban: Mumbai Indians face a do-or-die situation against Royal Challengers Bangalore in the first clash between two Indian Premier League sides in the Champions League Twenty20, here on Sunday.         
	IPL runners-up side Mumbai Indians, led by Sachin Tendulkar, paid the prize of batting and bowling inconsistently as they were stunned by less fancied sides in their first two matches.         
	They spanked underdogs Guyana by 31 runs in their third match on Thursday but are still unsure about a semi-final berth as only one spot remains open from Group B after Southern Australia Redbacks have already booked their place.         
	Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Highveld Lions  who play Guyana in Sundays other match in Johannesburg  are on two points each after a win. But Mumbai Indians are in a disadvantage as they have played one more match then the other two.         
	Even if they win on Sunday, Mumbai Indians will depend on the result of matches of other sides to qualify for the semi-finals.         
	On the other hand, RCB can still make it to the semi-finals even if they lose on Sunday and beat Highveld Lions on September 21 as they have the highest net run rate of 1.340 as against plus 0.529 of South Australia Redbacks and plus 0.260 of Mumbai Indians.         
	Mumbai Indians had promised a lot with their impressive IPL season but failed to click as a unit in their first two matches and a Kieron Pollard special effort saw them win the third against Guyana.         
	Batting woes did them in the first match as their star-studded line-up failed to chase down 187 against an inexperienced Highveld Lions in a shock result in the tournament opener.

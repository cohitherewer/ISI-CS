The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan are banking on Barreto
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan are banking on Barreto
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan will try to make amends when they host Kalighat MS in a CFL Premier Division match, on Wednesday. Bagan, for the record, lost to Aryan in their last encounter.         
	Mohun Bagans performance on that day was atrocious. The defending champions are badly missing a creative midfielder and pressure is already on Jose Ramirez Barreto. With hardly any support from the midfield the Brazilian is now dropping back to get the ball.         
	Even though these are early days, Subair Murithala Alis performance hasnt been up to the mark and sooner he gets into the groove the better it is for his team.         
	It will be interesting to see whether coach Stanley Rozario goes all-out with both Chidi and Murithala in the starting line-up. If that happens, Okonyo Diamondstar will have to warm the bench.         
	Rozario, though, kept his cards close to his chest. I have not decided who will play on Wednesday. Will take a call only in the morning.

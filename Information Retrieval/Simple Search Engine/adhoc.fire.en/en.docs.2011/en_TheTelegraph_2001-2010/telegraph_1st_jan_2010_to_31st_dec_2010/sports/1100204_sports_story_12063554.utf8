            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            The Telegraph story which appeared on August 30, 2009      
	Nagpur: Gary Kirsten, whose two-year contract as coach ends next month, has been offered an extension by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	Ive been offered an extension and the process (of renewing the contract is on)... I cant say anything more at the moment, Kirsten told The Telegraph at the Pride hotel here, on Wednesday.         
	Apparently, one of the issues is the period of extension  till just the 2011 World Cup or beyond.         
	That the BCCI was set to give Kirsten an extension was reported in these very columns as early as August 30 last year.         
	Significantly, Kirsten clarified that he hadnt been approached by Cricket South Africa (CSA), his parent Board, to be Mickey Arthurs full-time successor.         
	Ive had no contact with CSA... Indeed, nobody from there has got in touch with me, Kirsten emphasised.

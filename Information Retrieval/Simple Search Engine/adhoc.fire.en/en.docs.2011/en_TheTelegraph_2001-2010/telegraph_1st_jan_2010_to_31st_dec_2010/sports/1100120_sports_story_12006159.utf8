The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bangladesh have a prayer on their lips
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bangladesh have a prayer on their lips
  - It was a good bowling effort... We stuck to the right areas, says Zaheer       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan in Chittagong on Tuesday. (AFP)                                 
	Chittagong: Having failed to put Team India on the mat, from dream-like situations, the Bangladesh players appeared to head for the prayer mat, after stumps on Day III of the first Test.         
	Unless the weather plays a big hand on the two days that remain, divine intervention may be needed to save the hosts from travelling to Dhaka, for the second and final match of the Idea Cup, 0-1 down.         
	Play on Tuesday, too, was hit by poor light. At the premature close, the visitors were on an absolutely commanding 122 for one. The runs came at a fast clip, in less than 23 overs.         
	One doesnt need to guess Indias game plan.         
	The first innings of both teams ended within 250 and, with Indias lead a paltry one, the Test will be decided by performances in innings No.2.         
	We fought back, from 98 for six... Thats a plus... It was both a good and a bad day... Early wickets tomorrow and, well, who knows how things will unfold... Of course, besides early wickets, the captain (Shakib-al Hasan) will have to return another fiver, Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons told The Telegraph at the Peninsula Hotel.         
	Promising all-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad and wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim (hes the vice-captain as well) staged the recovery, adding 108 for the seventh wicket.         
	Mushfiqur lost his head and, with it, his wicket. Otherwise, its possible that Bangladesh could well have gone ahead of India by more than a few runs.         
	Riyad, who is a Mahendra Singh Dhoni admirer (I like his batting, but dont try to copy him), finished as the top-scorer  69, with 11 boundaries. Mushfiqur contributed 44.         
	Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, making a comeback, picked up three wickets each. Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma, another comebackwallah, had two apiece.         
	Ishant had some really good overs and this outing is bound to lift his confidence significantly.         
	He has, at least, looked hungry.         
	It was a good bowling effort... We stuck to the right areas and were patient... Initially, the wicket did help the bowlers, but has got better and better for batting... Im hopeful well be able to win, Zaheer said.         
	The story may have read differently had Bangladesh struck early in the second innings. Instead, the 50 came up within nine overs and the openers, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, were together till 90.         
	Clearly, Sehwag and Gambhir seem to be collaborating in the manner of Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes.         
	Sehwag, the stand-in captain, fell for 45. Gambhir is on 47, with nightwatchman Mishra on 24 from only 21 balls.         
	Day IV, too, is scheduled to start at 8.30 am (IST). An on-time beginning would set a record of sorts.

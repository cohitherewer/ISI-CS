The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Topkapi may come good

	Bangalore: The S. Padmanabhan-trained Topkapi may be hard to beat in the 1,200m Ashwa Priya Cup, the feature event at the races here on Friday. Topkapi was a facile winner in his last outing, albeit in the lower class. However, the Placerville-Houston Hopeful son seems to have further improved and he may gallop to another victory in the hands of jockey K.P.G. Appu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB in a fix over duo
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB in a fix over duo
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The exclusion of senior players Arindam Das and Sourashish Lahiri, from Bengals 20-member one-day probables list, has created a catch-22 situation for the office-bearers of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB).         
	The officials are trying to find a way of accommodating the highest run-scorer for Bengal in Ranji Trophy (Arindam, who scored 519 runs) and the second highest wicket-taker (Sourashish, who got 18 wickets) in the squad.         
	It has been learnt that CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra, who is also the convenor of the senior selection committee, has spoken to president Jagmohan Dalmiya so that an acceptable solution can be found. As of now, the CAB brass is mulling increasing the number of probables from 20 to 25.         
	Interestingly, the Sambaran Banerjee-led selection committee did not name Arindam among the 35 probables at the start of the season. The CAB then increased the probables list to accommodate the opener. He responded by being the highest scorer for his team, with an average of more than 57, including two centuries.         
	When Dalmiya was contacted, he refused to comment. Sources close to him, however, said the president is not sure about the ideal way out of this problem. If Arindam and Sourashish are included in the squad now, the selectors would surely not feel good. In fact, a couple of them might threaten to resign protesting the interference.         
	On the other hand, if the association does not rectify the mistake, the transparency of the selection process would be questioned by big clubs such as East Bengal and Kalighat.         
	The current squad has players like Soham Ghosh of BNR. In the three first-class matches he has played so far, he has scored only 40 runs from six innings at an average of eight (highest score of 16). Some people are attributing his selection to being a relative of an influential CAB office-bearer. The selectors have said that Soham was selected for his all-round abilities (he bowls part-time off-spin).         
	Incidentally, there is no specialist off-spinner in the side (Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Soham and Arnab Nandy are all part-timers), but there are three left-arm spinners.         
	Chief selector Banerjee has often said that they are trying to give exposure to youngsters, but none of Bengals current crop of youngsters has done anything noteworthy at the junior national level. Bengal did not even qualify for knockout stages of any of the under-22, under-19, under-16 national tournaments.

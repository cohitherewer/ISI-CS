	Calcutta: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India president Sharad Pawar will take over as International Cricket Council (ICC) president on Thursday, becoming the second Indian, after Jagmohan Dalmiya, to occupy the top post.         
	The ICC annual conference week, beginning Sunday at the Raffles City Convention Centre in Singapore, will culminate with Pawar taking over as the seventh ICC president, succeeding Englishman David Morgan, who concludes his two-year term at the end of the week, the governing body said in a statement.         
	Dalmiya was the first Indian to be elected for the post, in 1997.         
	The annual conference week begins Sunday, with the Chief Executives Committee (CEC) meeting. The ICC Executive Board will discuss the nomination of former Australian Prime Minister John Howard for the ICC vice-presidents post.         
	The main agenda for the CEC meeting is the subject of the Future Tours Programme 2012-20, including possibility of having ICC Test and ODI leagues.         
	On the agenda of the CEC meeting is the subject of the Future Tours Programme 2012-20, in particular the introduction of greater context and content for international cricket which has been under consideration by a working group consisting David Collier (England and Wales), Nishantha Ranatunga (Sri Lanka), N. Srinivasan (India), James Sutherland (Australia) and David Richardson (ICC General Manager  cricket).         
	An ICC event covering the Test format as well as an ODI league are prime considerations after the ideas received strong support from the ICC Cricket Committee, the ICC statement said.         
	The ICC Executive Board will also receive recommendation from the CEC to implement the decision review system with immediate effect in all Test matches as well as in the 2011 World Cup.         
	The Executive Board will also receive updates on the design of mandatory safety and security regulations drawn up by Security Task Force, chaired by Paul Condon, following the Lahore attack last year.         
	The application by Seychelles to become an affiliate member of the ICC will also be considered by the Board. If successful, Seychelles would become the 105th member of the ICC.

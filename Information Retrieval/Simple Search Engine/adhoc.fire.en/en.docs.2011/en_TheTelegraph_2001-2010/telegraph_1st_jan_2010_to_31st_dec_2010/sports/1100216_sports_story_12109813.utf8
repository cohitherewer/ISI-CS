  - Hosts ahead by 46 runs as Sehwag, sachin feature in mammoth partnership       INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Virender Sehwag on way to his century at the Eden, on Monday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh                                 
	Calcutta: The master and his protege were at work at Eden Gardens on Monday. For 258 minutes on the second day, Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag carried the hopes of a nation until South Africa struck with three wickets in the final session to claw their way back in the second Test.         
	Nothing can, however, eclipse the mastery of Sachins 47th Test hundred and Sehwags 19th and, for now, it has certainly made India look bullish about drawing level in the Jaypee Infratech Cup. The hosts are ahead by 46 runs with five wickets remaining, and it will be left to V.V.S. Laxman and Mahendra Singh Dhoni to build on the advantage.         
	The 249-run partnership for the third wicket blunted the South African attack in a show of strength and character. For most of the day, the visitors were forced to press the panic button. It showed in their negative line of attack, especially that of Paul Harris (12 wides).         
	Having stirred a storm during the recent tour of Bangladesh with his ordinary side remark about the hosts, Sehwag reduced South Africas bowling to the same status on Monday. It wasnt just a squall that blew the visitors away but a calculated decimation of their bowling, renewing the optimism after the team was Steyn-ed in Nagpur.         
	Sehwags 165 and Sachins 106 were contrasting in nature and huge in impact. This was not about personal achievements. It was about two champion batsmen championing Indias cause in their bid to retain the No.1 ranking in Test cricket.         
	It is easy to talk of positive a game plan from a position of strength; not so when you are playing catch-up.         
	Steyn and Co. had arrived in India with specific plans and high hopes of restricting Sehwag. To their utter dismay they have found all such strategies coming to a nought in the two Tests.         
	The plan was simple for Gautam Gambhir and Sehwag as they walked out after South Africa had finished on 296  rattle the new ball attack with a vicious assault. Sehwag stepped on the accelerator after Steyn had bowled a maiden in the first over of the innings.         
	Three consecutive fours were whipped off the fast bowlers second over. Morne Morkel wasnt spared either, forcing Smith to bring on Wayne Parnell. Sehwag welcomed him with a cut over point for six.         
	His batting has always been the spectators delight and the statisticians nightmare, while being the lone constant in these days of uncertainty.         
	The onslaught continued as he reeled off square drives and thumps over the infield with consummate ease. Gambhir, too, joined the party. The Indians were off at a gallop and things looked rosy.         
	A horrible mix-up, however, brought about Gambhirs (25) downfall and Murali Vijay was done in by the reverse swing. But Sehwag remained in full flow, reaching 41 off 23 balls.         
	South Africa were left to rue a missed chance when JP Duminy dropped Sehwag on 47, at first slip off Morkel. For a while, it made Sehwag circumspect.         
	That was the only blemish until 129 when AB De Villiers fumbled with Sehwag short of his crease.         
	Those chances, however, couldnt put a stop to his flamboyance for long. Once Harris came on, the slog sweep came out of the closet. While his 50 came off 41 balls, the 100 took another 46 balls.         
	If Sehwag was all about pulverising the attack, Sachin was about focus. Compact and fluent, precise and determined, he was all control. What was most impressive was his patience and calculation.         
	Both technically and temperamentally, it was a convincing performance. His fourth century in successive Tests (fifth in the last seven) bore the mark of a man in supreme touch.         
	With no swing and seam movement, the bowlers struggled. It was only after 324 minutes of stay that Sehwag played a lazy shot and holed out to short cover.         
	Sachin departed nine balls later, Jacques Kallis holding on to the snick smartly at first slip, and Badrinath followed soon.         
	South Africa had sensed a lifeline, and it remains to be seen if they can benefit from it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer gets a free pass again
                                                                                                                       7                                      Federer gets a free pass again
                      
	Mason: After making an easy entry into the third round of Cincinnati Masters, Roger Federer sailed into the quarter finals without playing a single set of tennis. With a chance of a repeat of last weeks Toronto final with Murray, he sauntered into the last eight, after his third-round opponent Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany pulled out with a shoulder injury.         
	 As the Swiss maestro also had a bye in the first round, he will be well rested when he faces either David Ferrer or Nikolay Davydenko for a place in the semi-finals.         
	Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi remained the lone Indian in the tournament in the $24,30,000 hard court event after Leander Paes and Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy stumbled at the second round to crash out of the tournament.         
	They lost 3-6, 2-6 to Mardy Fish and Mark Knowles, the unseeded American-Bahamas pair.         
	Coming back to the singles, world No. 1 Rafael Nadal battled to defeat Frenchman Julien Benneteau 5-7, 7-6, 6-2, after struggling to find his rhythm against a confident Benneteau.         
	The former lost the first set and was then forced to save match point in the second.         
	With his French opponent struggling physically in the final set, Nadal showed his excellent fitness and cruised to victory and booked his spot in the quarter finals.         
	Andy Murray needed a final set tiebreak to beat Latvias Ernests Gulbis.         
	 won 4-6 6-3 7-6, setting up a quarter finals match with American Mardy Fish.         
	Serb Novak Djokovic dominated his first set over Argentine David Nalbandian, winning 6-1, but then looked a little short of breath as he laboured in the heat, winning the second on a tie-break.

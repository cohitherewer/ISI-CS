  -  Debutant Writam Porel hits 71; Kulkarni picks up three for 92         A STAFF REPORTER            Writam Porel at the Eden, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Woorkeri Raman paced up and down in front of the makeshift Bengal tent at the Eden Gardens on Friday. Bengal were staring down the barrel at 110 for five. Lunch was just minutes away and the Bengal coach didnt want another mishap in the first session. Debutant Writam Porel was looking well set and Laxmi Ratan Shukla had won a one-to-one battle with Ajit Agarkar.         
	Surely, Raman hadnt predicted a servile batting display from his top-rung batsmen, but he must be pleased with Porels resilience on debut against 39-time Ranji champions, Mumbai.         
	It is customary for a team to lift their game against a superior side. But Bengals outing against Mumbai has been a humdrum affair. In home conditions, they have failed to threaten the visitors with the ball and have failed to match Mumbais prowess with the bat.         
	Bengal folded up for 296 conceding three points for their 325-run first innings deficit. Worse still, they can still lose the match, if Mumbai pick up 10 wickets on Saturday.         
	Mumbai bowlers did everything that their Bengal counterparts couldnt on a typical Eden wicket. They got the ball to rear up from the good length spot, had the batsmen ducking for cover and picked up wickets without getting hassled.         
	What Bengal seamer Ranadeb Bose did in small bursts, Ajit Agarkar, Dhawal Kulkarni and Aavishkar Salvi did in an alarming regularity to trouble the batsmen. Kulkarni removed overnight batsman Rohan Banerjee (3) in the third over when the latter dished out a catch to Omkar Gurav behind stumps. The Mumbai keeper next showed superb athleticism to pouch Sreevats Goswami (20) diving full stretch to his left.         
	At 41 for 3, the hosts were depending on skipper Manoj Tiwary (14) for revival. But in a mad rush to steal a third, Tiwary was run out. Thankfully, Porel (71) used the opportunity to play a freewheeling innings. He ventured out against Ramesh Powar for a four in the latters first over. He punished anything trash, else played within himself.         
	The pitch which looked flat had come to life. Shukla (38) pulled Agarkar for two boundaries in one over. The Mumbai pacer hit back instantly with a sharp bouncer and gave the batsman a long stare in follow through. Bengal added 88 runs losing four wickets in the first session. Post lunch, Kulkarni and Powar removed Shukla and Porel respectively.         
	Mumbai started the count, but Bengal fought back through Sourasish Lahiri (62) and Shib Sagar Singh (40). The duo stood bravely trying to delay the inevitable. Mumbai opted for the new ball, but the two held together Bengals fragile lower order beautifully. Sourasish and Shib added 91 runs for the eighth wicket, Lahiri scoring a fighting half-century.         
	Dhawal Kulkarni was the pick of the Mumbai bowlers picking up three for 92 in 26 overs.

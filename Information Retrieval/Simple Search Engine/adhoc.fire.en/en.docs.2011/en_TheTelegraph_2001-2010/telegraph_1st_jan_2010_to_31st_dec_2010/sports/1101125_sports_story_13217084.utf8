                                                                                                                       7                                      Tarundeep bows in final, bags a silver
    - Squash teams settle for bronze medals                                               Tarundeep Rai, during the individual archery final, in Guangzhou, on Wednesday. (AFP)        
	Guangzhou: Tarundeep Rai had his moment of glory as he became the first Indian archer to win a medal in the mens individual event on a day, which saw six bronze medals coming Indias way.         
	Women boxers ended their campaign rather disappointingly with five-time world champion M C Mary Kom (51kg) and Kavita Goyat (75kg) settling for bronze medals after losing in the semi-finals.         
	The womens men and womens squash teams and pugilists Suranjoy Singh and Paramjeet Samota were among the bronze winners.         
	With the addition of six more medals, Indias medal haul went up to seven gold, 13 silver and 25 bronze.         
	Tarundeep turned out to be the hero in archery. In a closely fought contest, he lost to the Woojin Kim of South Korea 28-28, 27-28, 29-28, 27-28, 27-29.         
	He gave a vital lead to his opponent in the last set as he shot an eight pointer in his first attempt. And even though the Indian made amends in the next two attempts by scoring nine points each but those did not prove enough to halt the Korean.         
	Mary Kom, who has won five world titles in 46kg and 48kg category, lost 7-11 to reigning 51kg world champion Ren Cancan of China. Kavita, on the other hand, went down 1-5 to another Chinese, Jinzi Li, in her last-four stage bout.         
	Mary Kom, who turned 28 today, conceded a slender 1-3 lead to Cancan in the opening two minutes and all through the bout, she was left to chase the local favourite.         
	Her only scoring punch of the bout came in the opening round, in which the home favourite managed three.         
	In squash, the womens team slumped to a 0-2 defeat at the hands of favourites Malaysia in the semi-finals. The mens team also had to be content with the bronze after going down to arch rivals Pakistan 0-2 in the semi-final.         
	Commonwealth Games gold medallists Suranjoy Singh (51kg) and Paramjeet Samota (+91kg) had to be content with bronze after losing in the semis in contrasting fashion.         
	While Suranjoy lost 5-6 to Chinas Chang Yong in a thriller, Samota was all at sea against Zhilei Zhang before the referee stopped the contest midway through the third round and awarded the bout to the home favourite.

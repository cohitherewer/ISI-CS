            A STAFF REPORTER            Eduardo                           
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings Brazilian striker Eduardo was the lone foreigner on the pitch in their CFL Premier division match against Railway FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday.         
	And he, practically, was the difference between the two teams. He scored the solitary goal, in the 65th minute, to give Mohammedan Sporting a 1-0 victory.         
	Shabbir Alis wards, however, wasted quite a few opportunities in both halves, due to poor finishing.         
	Dipendu Biswas made a mess of an easy chance as early as the ninth minute when, latching on to an Eduardo back-heel, he shot straight at Railway FC goalkeeper Rakesh Prasad.         
	Again, in the 51st minute, Sasthi Duley was the culprit when, with only the keeper to beat, the midfielder shot at the near post even though the far post could have been a better and easier choice.         
	Having made the angle too difficult for himself, Duley shot past the custodian only to find the vertical on the way.         
	Eduardo, however, compensated for his teammates lacklustre display on the day, when his swerving free-kick from the left corner of the box went into the net after the keepers failed attempt to fist it away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Masters berths for Molinari brothers
                                                                                                                       7                                      Masters berths for Molinari brothers
                      
	Augusta: Francesco and Edoardo Molinari, the Italian brothers on Europes winning 2010 Ryder Cup team, are among 13 players, who have qualified for the Masters through the world rankings.         
	In the final 2010 rankings made available Monday because there are no tournaments the rest of the year, Francesco is ranked No. 15 and Edoardo No. 18.         
	The Masters invites players who are in the top 50 at the end of the year. The criteria is mainly for international players, who are not PGA Tour members and have fewer avenues to qualify, such as winning a tour event or getting into the FedEx Cup finale.         
	Rickie Fowler, who was on the US losing Ryder Cup team, is ranked No. 28 and among the 13 additional qualifiers after his first full year as a professional.         
	Others include Robert Karlsson of Sweden (No. 17), Charl Schwartzel of South Africa (No. 34) and Ryo Ishikawa of Japan (No. 36).         
	Players still can qualify for the Masters by getting into the top 50 a week before the tournament, or winning a PGA Tour event that offers full FedEx Cup points.         
	 The Masters will be played April 7 to 10, with Phil Mickelson the defending champion and Tiger Woods trying to end his longest drought without a Major or a green jacket.

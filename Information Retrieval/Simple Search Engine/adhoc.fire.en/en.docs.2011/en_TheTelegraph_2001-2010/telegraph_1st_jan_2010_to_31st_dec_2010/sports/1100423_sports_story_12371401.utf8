The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CSK bowled better: Gilly
                                                                                                                       7                                        CSK bowled better: Gilly
  - Final wont be a contest between Sachin and me, says Dhoni         A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni celebrates as Herschelle Gibbs takes the long walk back in Navi Mumbai, on Thursday. (PTI)                                 
	Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni credited his bowlers for their fantastic performance in the 38-run victory over the Deccan Chargers on Thursday. The skipper also said that CSK have the ability to beat any team if they play at least at 90 per cent of their potential.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni: Its a nice feeling to win. We didnt get enough runs on the board. But this was a track where you had to give respect to the bowlers. Ashwin bowled well with the new ball. Again Doug Bollinger came out and hit the right areas to make life difficult for the batsmen. It was a risk playing three spinners on this track. Had we lost the match, then questions would have been asked. Still, I feel our batting could have been better. Thanks to Anirudha, who hit a couple of sixes in the end. Its great to play in the final. But I dont think its a contest between me and Sachin Tendulkar. The only contest between us will be during the toss. After that, its a team game. They have a good team with very good domestic players, and some very good power hitters for the death overs. Their bowling is also good. So it will be a big challenge for us. We hope to make it tough for our opponents. We need to play to our potential. If we can play at 90 per cent of our potential, we can beat any side. Having said that, I would also like to add that we dont believe in playing percentage cricket.         
	Adam Gilchrist: 142 was definitely a gettable total. Our bowlers did a good job, but their bowlers were even better. The pitch, at this time of the year, is always difficult to bat on. It had bounce, and there was slow turn. Although there was good carry, at times it was difficult to get the ball away if pace was taken off. So one can expect an interesting final. All credit to Chennai for the manner in which they played. The third place play-off match will give us a chance to qualify for the Champions League. I am not quite sure whether thats the right away to go about it.         
	Doug Bollinger: It was a good wicket to bowl on. The wicket had bounce and it was all about the attitude. We felt 142 was defendable. Everything went right. I am doing well because theres a lot of competition. I am expecting a ripper of a final.

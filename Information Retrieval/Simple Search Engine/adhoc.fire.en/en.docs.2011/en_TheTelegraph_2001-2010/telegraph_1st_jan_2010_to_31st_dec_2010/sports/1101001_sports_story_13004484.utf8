            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Cuttack: Mohun Bagan set up a high-voltage final with arch-rivals East Bengal when they pipped Dempo Sports Club 6-4, via tie-breaker, in a gruelling semi-final of the 32nd Federation Cup, at the Barabati Stadium, here, on Thursday.         
	Penalty shoot-out was enforced after the teams were locked 1-1 after 120 minutes. Dempo took an early lead when Nigerian striker Ranty Martins took advantage of a defensive lapse to bulge the Bagan net with a power left-footer.         
	The match was just into the second minute when Bagan stopper Shiekh Azim mistimed a clearance. The ball went to an unmarked Ranty, who volleyed home from the top box.         
	Mohun Bagans long wait for the equaliser finally bore fruit in the 66th minute when substitute Edeh Chidis free-kick curled into the top right corner. The freekick was awarded following a foul by Joaquim Abranches.         
	In the tie-breaker, Mohun Bagan converted all the five spotkicks through Jose Ramirez Barreto, Edeh Chidi, Gauranga Dutta, Snehasish Chakroborty and Subair Murithala Ali. Ranty Martins, Beto, Godwin Franco hit the target for Dempo. Ogba Kalu sent the third penalty kick straight into the hands of substitute Bagan goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee.         
	Earlier, both the sides squandered several chances to clinch win in the regulation time. Mohun Bagans first-choice goalkeeper Shilton Paul put up an excellent performance in the match, rescuing his side time and again. In the 13th minute he saved a sure goal by punching out a Peter Carvalho shot from the left corner of the box. Paul displayed a glimpse of his reflex and anticipation by saving powerful shot from Nocolau Borges in the 22nd minute.         
	This is Mohun Bagans 18th entry into the Federation Cup final and they will lock horns in the mouth-watering all-Calcutta summit clash on October 2.

	Madrid: Real Madrid squandered a chance to climb above Barcelona into first place in La Liga when they were held to a 0-0 draw at mid-table Osasuna Sunday.         
	A win would have put Real top of the standings on goal difference after Barca dropped their first home points of the season in a 1-1 draw with Villarreal on Saturday.         
	However, a gritty performance from Osasuna at their claustrophobic Reyno de Navarra stadium and Reals lack of penetration left Manuel Pellegrinis side two points adrift of the champions on 38 with 16 matches played.

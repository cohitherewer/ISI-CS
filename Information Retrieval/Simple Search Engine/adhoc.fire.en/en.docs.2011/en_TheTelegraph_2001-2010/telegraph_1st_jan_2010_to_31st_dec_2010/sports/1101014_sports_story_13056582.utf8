  - Walker under suspension, faces at least 2-year ban       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Rani Yadav                                 
	New Delhi: Indias dream of a drug-free Games went for a toss on Wednesday when 20km road race walker Rani Yadav tested positive for a banned anabolic agent and was placed under suspension.         
	The 20-year-old from Varanasi was Indias best finisher in the womens 20km walk, in 1 hour, 42 minutes, 54 seconds, claiming fifth spot. She is the third sportsperson and the first Indian to test positive during the Delhi Games. Earlier, Nigerian athletes  womens 100m gold medallist Osayemi Oludamola and 110m hurdler Samuel Okon  tested positive for the stimulant Methylhexaneamine.         
	So far, 16 Indian athletes have tested positive this year. The dope scandal hit India hard on the eve of the Commonwealth Games when 12 sportspersons, including wrestlers, swimmers and athletes, failed the tests conducted by the National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada).         
	Rani, who was not available for comment, could be banned for, at least, two years.         
	We can now confirm that the A sample of Ms Rani Yadav, a competitor in the womens 20 kilometre road race on October 9, 2010, was found to contain 19-Norandrosterone, a prohibited Anabolic Agent under category S1 of the Wada List of Prohibited Substances and Methods, the Commonwealth Games Federation said in a statement.         
	The secretary general of the Organising Committee (OC), Lalit Bhanot, who is also the secretary of the Athletics Federation of India (AFI), described the incident as unfortunate, adding every effort was made to avoid such things.         
	Its unfortunateWe tried our level best. Not just the federations, but Nada and government authorities are very serious about this issue. We have done out of competition as well in-competition tests, he said.         
	Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) president Mike Fennell, however, highlighted the brighter side when he said three positive dope tests out of 1,300 was not a bad record.         
	Two of them were not in serious area of doping activity which is a stimulant...We would like to have a zero factor, but we also would have to live with reality, he said.         
	Meanwhile, sources in the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) revealed that Rani was a victim of an unwitting mistake. It is alleged that the Uttar Pradesh athlete never went through out-of-competition tests. As far as we know, Rani never went through the tests before the CWG, claimed one of the coaches of the Indian team. Had it been the case, we would not have suffered this embarrassment, he said.         
	Sources claimed that Rani suffered a shinbone injury earlier this year. After the injury, she went back to Varanasi and received treatment from a local doctor there. In all probability, because of the medication and injections, she tested positive for 19-Norandrosterone, the source said.

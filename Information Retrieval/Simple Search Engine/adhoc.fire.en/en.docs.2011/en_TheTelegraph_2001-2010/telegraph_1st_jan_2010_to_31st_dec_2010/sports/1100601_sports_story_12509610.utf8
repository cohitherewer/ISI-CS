	Brasilia: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wants the country to unite for the World Cup and end the debate over the squad that coach Dunga has assembled for the tournament. I want us to win the World Cup. I believe Dunga has called up the best players we have at the moment. Its not just a team of great individuals, but rather a team that works together and is motivated, he said.         
	Xavi view         
	Schruns: Barcelonas Xavi Hernandez said Monday that Spain was heading to the World Cup in a similar state of mind to the one it had when it won the 2008 European Championship. It wont be easy but we have to go with excitement, lets see if its true that Spains time has come at the World Cup, he said.         
	Ball battle         
	London: Adidas hit back Monday at criticism that the World Cup ball is difficult to control and a nightmare for goalkeepers, stressing that it was widely tested and approved long ago. The ball has been used for months. We started using it in December in a wide variety of leagues. All the response we have had has been positive, company spokesman Thomas van Schaik said.         
	Veterans in         
	London: Veteran forwards Nwankwo Kanu and Cuauhtemoc Blanco are headed for their third World Cups, 12 years after their first. Kanu made Nigerias cut and Blanco was retained in Mexicos 23 when their coaches announced their squads Monday, a day before the Fifa deadline.

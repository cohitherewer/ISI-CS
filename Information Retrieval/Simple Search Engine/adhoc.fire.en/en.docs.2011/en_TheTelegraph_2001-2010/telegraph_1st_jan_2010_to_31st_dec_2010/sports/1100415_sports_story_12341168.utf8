            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indias Saurav Ghosal began his PSA Indian Challenger campaign in style as he eased past Australian Aaron Frankcomb 11-4, 11-6, 11-5 on Wednesday. Ghosal took just 42 minutes to book a quarter final berth.         
	The event is being organised by Calcutta Racket Club in association with The Telegraph.         
	However, Ghosals real test lies on Thursday when he locks horns with top seed Adrian Grant.         
	Grant, on the other hand, had few difficulties in his 11-7, 9-11, 11-3, 11-7 win over qualifier Chris Simpson.         
	In other matches, second seed Cameron Pilley of Australia got through qualifier Nafiizwan Adnan 11-6, 7-11, 11-8, 11-6, while Malaysian Mohammed Azlan Iskandar ousted Siddhanth Suchde 11-5, 11-6, 11-5.         
	In the WISPA section, both Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal had easy rides in the first round.         
	Fourth-seed Dipika beat Englands Zephanie Curgenven 11-3, 11-2, 12-10 in just 24 minutes. Joshna defeated Australian Maggy Marshall 11-6, 9-11, 11-3, 11-6.

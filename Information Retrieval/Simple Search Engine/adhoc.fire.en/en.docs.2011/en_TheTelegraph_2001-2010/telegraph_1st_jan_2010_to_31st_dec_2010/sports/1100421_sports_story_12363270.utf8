            A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Tuesday that it was making plans to fly up to seven teams from Dubai to the West Indies for the World Twenty20 amid concerns that a volcanic ash cloud could otherwise prevent them from reaching there.         
	The ICC said the plan to be finalised Wednesday calls for Australia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, South Africa and Bangladesh to transit through Dubai on Sunday or Monday before being flown to the West Indies on a chartered flight.         
	Ireland, Zimbabwe and the West Indies are already in the Caribbean for the tournament which runs from April 30-May 16. New Zealand will fly there via the United States.         
	The ICC has made it clear that it has no plans to postpone the tournament or move it to another venue.         
	We are doing everything possible to overcome the airline logistical challenges and we are extremely grateful to our commercial partner Emirates for putting forward a chartered flight option, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement after the ICC board meeting in Dubai.         
	Lorgat said the ICC was still trying to sort out how to get England to the West Indies. Nearly half the team could travel from India after playing in the Indian Premier League, but that still requires providing alternative transport for the players and coaches who are in England.         
	The challenge is with the England players, Lorgat said. We will have to find a way of getting them out of the UK, whether we use low-level flying aircraft or helicopters or some other fashion.         
	The following are the other decisions at the ICC board meeting:         
	 The ICC agreed to set the prize money for the 2011 World Cup to be held in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka at a record $10m.         
	 The ICC announced that president David Morgan would lead a delegation in June to Zimbabwe to assess the progress the country is making in its bid to return to Test cricket within the next two years. Zimbabwe announced in January 2006 that they were temporarily withdrawing from Test cricket following a political turmoil and hasnt played that format since.         
	 Following the decision by Cricket Canada to withdraw as hosts of the 2012 U-19 World Cup earlier this month, the ICC has now invited expressions of interest from other members to host the event.         
	 The board reiterated its desire and support for Pakistan to continue to play international cricket albeit at away or neutral venues. The board noted the importance of a resumption of bilateral fixtures between Indian and Pakistan as soon as possible as scheduled in the Future Tours Programme.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer is set to play in Durban
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zaheer is set to play in Durban

	Calcutta: Spearhead Zaheer Khan is fit for the all-important second Test against South Africa, at Kingsmead in Durban, from Sunday.         
	Being 0-1 down in the three-match series, India must win or at least force a draw to keep the contest alive till the final Test, in Cape Town, from January 2.         
	Zaheer has recovered from his (hamstring) injury and, as of now, is available for selection... He should play, manager Ranjib Biswal told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	Logically, Jaydev Unadkat, who made his debut in Centurion, will have to be dropped.         
	The wicket at Kingsmead, significantly, has a decent grass cover. The mower, though, was in operation when most of Team India turned up for optional practice in the afternoon.         
	[According to an agency report, chief groundsman Wilson Ngobese has said hed like to give a wicket that is fair for everybody. He added, rather pointedly, it must not excessively help the bowlers, but if you cant bat, I cant help it.]         
	It wasnt well-earned, but the touring side arrived in Durban, which is packed with Indian originwallahs, after quite a few had a break in hotspot Sun City, near Johannesburg.         
	One is tempted to be critical, but a complete switch-off for a couple of days may actually prove beneficial.         
	Meanwhile, no decision has been taken on dropping a struggling Suresh Raina and fielding Cheteshwar Pujara instead.         
	Its not something that weve discussed, coach Gary Kirsten told the media after the nets session.         
	Strangely, Raina wasnt seen at Kingsmead. Granted it was an optional practice, but he had good reasons to be there.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer are the others who chose to have an extended rest.         
	Raina had an excellent debut (120) on a flat SSC wicket in Sri Lanka, in July, but his scores after that series have been: 86, 0; 32; 3,0; 20; 3; 1, 5.         
	Frankly, after such a horrendous run (and the manner hes been getting out), Raina doesnt deserve to be retained.         
	But, of course, stranger things have happened in Indian cricket. For now, its to be seen if Rainas time has run out.         
	Footnote: Late on Thursday, it was learnt that the baggage of some of the players, Dhoni and Raina among them, hadnt been put on the team flight from Johannesburg.

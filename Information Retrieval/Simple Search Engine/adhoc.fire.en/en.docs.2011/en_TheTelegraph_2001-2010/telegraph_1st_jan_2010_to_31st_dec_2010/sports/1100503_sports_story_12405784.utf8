	London: Kevin Pietersen will not mind walking off the pitch in the middle of a match and fly back home if popstar wife Jessica Taylor goes into labour with their first child.         
	Pietersen has made his intentions clear to the ECB that he will be on the first flight out of West Indies to attend the birth of their first child if he got a call from Jessica.         
	Delivery is due in the weekend May 15-16. Since the World T20 final is set for the second of the two days.         
	Im definitely going to be there or at least be there as quick as I can, Pietersen said.         
	The only worry is I wont get back in time. I love playing cricket and we understand it is my job, it is what I do. Ive discussed the situation with a few players and they say as long as you are making an effort and see the kid as soon as you can then, if you do miss it then it is not a massive regret.           (PTI)

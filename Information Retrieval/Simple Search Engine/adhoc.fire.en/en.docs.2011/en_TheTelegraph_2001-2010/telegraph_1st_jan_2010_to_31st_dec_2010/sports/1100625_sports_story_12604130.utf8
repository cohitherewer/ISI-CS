The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its all my fault, rues coach Lippi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Its all my fault, rues coach Lippi
                      
	Johannesburg: Italy coach Marcello Lippi took full responsibility for their humiliating World Cup group stage exit on Thursday, saying he had not trained the team well enough.         
	I take all responsibility. I havent prepared this team well enough, an ashen-faced Lippi told a news conference without even being prompted by a question. I didnt think we could win the World Cup but I though we would do better.         
	The 62-year-old, a national hero when he led the Azzurris to 2006 World Cup glory, had already announced he would step down again after the finals. He will be replaced by Cesare Prandelli. Lippi first quit straight after their triumph in Germany but returned in 2008 after Italys disappointing European Championship campaign under Roberto Donadoni.         
	However star keeper Gianluigi Buffon didnt mince words when he said that new coach will have a lot of work to do. The new coach(Prandelli) will have to start a new cycle and I hope hes got his ideas in order, because the current situation of Italian football isnt great, Bufon said         
	In a strikingly honest assessment of what went wrong, Lippi pummelled himself verbally for 15 minutes. I failed to train the team well enough, they werent ready for such an important match. For an hour and 15 minutes, for psychological reasons I think, nothing worked, he said.         
	 I dont regret coming back, I came back with great enthusiasm, he added. His stark words took some of the sting out of the Italian reporters who were waiting to savage a campaign that began with two 1-1 draws. I have no intention of getting straight back into coaching and training after this, added Lippi.Ill take some months off and we will see.         
	Weve shown shown that were not here for a holiday, Slovakia forward Erik Jendrisek said. Jendrisek added that the key for Slovakia was to be aggressive and not sit back.         
	As soon as we were too passive, the Italians were more dangerous and scored, so we decided that we had to be more aggressive again, Jendrisek said.         
	The rest of the Slovakia players refused to speak with the media in an apparent show of support for coach Vladimir Weiss following his dispute with local reporters after a 2-0 loss to Paraguay.         
	While Slovakias players heaped on top of one another to celebrate at the final whistle, the teary-eyed Azzurris walked off the field quietly.

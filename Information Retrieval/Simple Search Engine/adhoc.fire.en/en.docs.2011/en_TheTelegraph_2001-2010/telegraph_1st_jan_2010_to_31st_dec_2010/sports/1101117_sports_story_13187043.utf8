The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brendons 225 a huge plus
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brendons 225 a huge plus
            SUDIPTO GUPTA                      
	Hyderabad: The problem with failure is that it is seldom private and often public. And if it is in front a 20,000-odd crowd, it is extremely difficult to run for cover.         
	It is true that India drew the second Test, against New Zealand, in Hyderabad and the series still stands at 0-0. But when the No.8 team in the world overshadows the No.1, stamping their determination and uprooting doubts, back-to-back draws are equivalent to a defeat for the superior team.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni might argue that the pitch was a pain, but why should the top-ranked team be the slave of conditions, that too at home?         
	 For New Zealand, it was Brendon McCullums audacious double century and young Kane Williamsons defiant 69 which helped the visitors pass the Test.         
	For it to be a good morning (and day) for India, New Zealand wickets had to be on the breakfast menu, but of course minus the flab of too many runs. The fact that Zaheer Khan was ready to bowl whetted Indias appetite for victory. The prospect of having a ball with a new cherry, which was due after five overs into the day, was also mouth-watering.         
	But whoever said morning shows the day, would be proud of this Tuesday. The first-over of the day, by Sreesanth, enveloped the message for the entire day. Whether it was Sreesanths wayward line, Kane Williamsons two cracking boundaries or Zaheers awful misfielding  it all happened in the first over, which produced 13 runs. The rest of the day, till the tea-break to be precise, was simply a repeat telecast of the first over.         
	Before the first over of the day, there was hope for India. After nine overs, the Indians were looking hopeless. How? Well, Indias match-winning bowler, and perhaps the only one in the present lot, left the field in the 10th over of the day. Zaheer could only bowl two overs with the new ball before he gave up and left the field. Zaheers groin strain virtually broke Indias backbone.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, too, had left the field, in the second over of the day, hurting his right shoulder when he attempted a diving save.         
	For the optimist, who still believed that a 1-0 lead was within Indias grasp, Harbhajan Singh was the last straw of hope. He had a dry spell of 23 overs on Monday. However, in the 92nd over of the day, on Tuesday, the off-spinner did manage to produce a chance. But substitute fielder Cheteshwar Pujara dropped the catch, and the match, as Steve Waugh would have said.         
	McCullum was on 148 and the lead was 185 when an inner edge off a defensive push took the ball to Pujara at forward short-leg and he grounded it. Things could have been different had that chance been lapped.         
	Pujara spilled another chance (this time of Daniel Vettori), at silly point. Later, the other substitute fielder, Murali Vijay dropped Gareth Hopkins, at first slip, off Sreesanth. The substitutes had nothing to add to the teams cause!         
	Along with Williamson, McCullum went on to put up a match-saving 124-run fifth wicket partnership.         
	McCullums 225 (18 fours and four sixes), off 308 balls and 544 minutes at the crease, bore his usual flamboyant signature with an aura of style spread all over it. He was brave in reverse-sweeping Dhonis plans and was entertaining in scooping it out of Indias reach.         
	By the time New Zealand decided to declare at 448 for eight, it was time for tea and time to ponder over Nagpur, the venue for the third Test. The Hyderabad hopes, by then, had crossed the realms of possibility.         
	India batted out 17 overs, scoring 68 without loss, before the captains decided to pack up. The target of 327 was as far as Nagpur. Sehwag though picked up a 54-ball 54.         
	Now that Zaheer has been ruled out of the third Test, India will go to Nagpur with an empty bowl, almost.

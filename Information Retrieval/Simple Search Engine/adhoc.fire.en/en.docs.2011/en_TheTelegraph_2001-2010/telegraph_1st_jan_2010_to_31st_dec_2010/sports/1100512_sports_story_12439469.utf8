            A STAFF REPORTER            Jhunjhunwala                           
	Calcutta: It was a derby no doubt and for Mohun Bagan it was revenge well taken. Bagan, who were humbled by East Bengal in the JC Mukherjee Trophy final, beat their arch rivals by 112 runs in the semi-finals of the CAB senior division knockout tournament, at the Eden, on Tuesday.         
	To their advantage, Bagan won the flip of the coin and obviously exploited the option of batting first in scorching conditions.         
	Abhishek Jhunjhunwala led the way for the winners slamming a 105-ball 135 to help his team amass a mammoth 305 for five. The Rajasthan Royals players innings was studded with 16 hits to the fence and a six.         
	Giving Abhishek company was Wriddhiman Saha who hit a 78-ball 58.         
	A 306-run target was always a stiff one in the conditions and East Bengal never really got their foothold during the chase. Losing regular wickets, Ranadeb Boses side were bundled out for 193 in 36.3 overs.         
	Arindam Das was the top scorer for East Bengal. Mohun Bagans Sanjib Sanyal and Abhishek took three wickets each to hasten East Bengals fall.         
	Abhishek, the days hero, revealed that batting first helped his team to put up a winning total. Definitely, batting first in such conditions is an advantage. That helped us. But there were no specific plans as such We are professionals. Along with Wriddhiman, I just wanted to bat for as long as possible, said Indian Cricket League-returnee said.         
	Bagans opponent will be Kalighat who had defeated Town Club on Monday. The final will be played at the Eden on Monday.

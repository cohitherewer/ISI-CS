The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hoping for a Gayle-storm
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hoping for a Gayle-storm
  - Sourav Gangulys men need to put campaign back on track       OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: The Kolkata Knight Riders would be relying on their West Indies recruit Chris Gayle to fire on all cylinders and help them return to winning ways when they take on the Mumbai Indians at the Brabourne Stadium on Monday.         
	The hard-hitting Gayle is set to play his first match in IPL 3 against Sachin Tendulkar and Co. after sitting out in Ahmedabad against the Rajasthan Royals on Saturday due to fever.         
	His inclusion would be a big boost to a team that seemed to lack second gear as it fell 34 runs short of a modest total of 168, despite having five wickets in hand.         
	Gayle did not practice on the eve of the match, but a team source confirmed that the West Indian star would indeed be taking the field on Monday.         
	Owais Shah is the most likely foreign recruit to make way for Gayle.         
	Successive defeats, against the Chennai Super Kings and the Royals, might not be reason enough to hit the panic button, but a third one could see the familiar feeling of pessimism creeping in.         
	The Mumbai Indians, too, have their share of worry following their first loss of the season to the Royal Challengers Bangalore, also on Saturday.         
	Sachin Tendulkars team must have been forced to do some soul searching after being completely outplayed by the visitors.         
	Perhaps, they underestimated the innocuous looking Vinay Kumar who took three wickets in an over with his medium pacers.         
	Twenty20 is not all about slam-bang batting and express pace, was the message the Karnataka bowler seemed to deliver.         
	The loss against the Bangalore side notwithstanding, captain Tendulkar, his deputy Zaheer Khan and offie Harbhajan Singh skipped the practice session on Sunday.         
	The opening has been a worry for the Mumbai Indians with Sri Lankan veteran Sanath Jayasuriya failing to deliver so far. But given his reputation, it remains to be seen whether the left-hander is replaced.         
	Sanath is a seasoned cricketer and he knows what is best for him... It is a question of getting him motivated to play his role, coach Robin Singh said.         
	More important for the hosts would be the availability of Ambati Rayudu, who along with Saurabh Tiwary, has been the story of the IPL this season.         
	The ICL-returnee suffered an elbow injury while attempting a catch against the Royal Challengers Bangalore on Saturday and a call on his fitness would be taken just before the start.         
	But while all the talk in the IPL has been about the huge sixes and how the bowlers have been reduced to supporting cast at the best, one man who has gone about his job successfully without making much fuss is Murali Kartik.         
	It might be a moot point that the top-five positions in the best economy rate section have been occupied by the slow bowlers.         
	If one leaves out Adam Voges, who has played just one match so far, Kartik is third best among them, behind Anil Kumble and Yuvraj Singh.         
	The left-arm orthodox spinner has held his own among the big stars and his success with the ball will be the key to the Knights plans to check the Mumbai Indians strong middle order.

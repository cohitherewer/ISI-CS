                                                                                                                       7                                      Mary Kom brings in hope
                      
	Guangzhou: Five-time world champion M C Mary Kom (51kg) and Kavita Goyat (75kg) assured India of at least two bronze medals in womens boxing by advancing to the semi-finals with contrasting wins at the Asian Games, on Monday.         
	Kavita (75kg), however, had to put up with stiff resistance from Marina Volnova of Kazakhstan before coming out trumps 8-7.         
	Jamesboy Singh reached the finals of the mens canoe single 200 metre. He clocked 44.004 in heat 1 to finish third at the International Rowing Centre.         
	Bhupender Singh Pundir advanced to the semi-finals of the mens kayak single 1000 metre competition. The 22-year-old Indian clocked 3:57.275 in heat 2 to finish fifth and reach the last four stage. Digvijay Singh Negi clocked 41.090 to qualify for the semi-finals of mens 200m kayak single.         
	Arambam Gyanjit Singh and Haobijam Premanand Singh also combined well to reach the semi-finals in the mens kayak double 1000 metre event with timing 3:37.633 in heat 2.         
	The quartet of Bhupender, Digvijay Singh Negi, Sanjay Singh and Ajit Singh also qualified for the semi-finals of the mens kayak four 1000 metre with a timing of 3:13.691 in heat 2. Haobijam Premananda and Arambam Gyanjit Singh reached semi-finals of mens kayak double 200 metre event.         
	Ragina Kiro reached the semi-final of both womens kayak single 500 metre and 200 metre events, clocking 2:09.270 and 49.227 in their respective heats.         
	Kiro and Dung Dung Sima also reached the semi-final of the womens kayak double 500 metre semi-final, clocking 2:00.462 in the heats.         
	Spearheaded by their No. 1 player and individual bronze medallist Sourav Ghosal, India blanked Japan 3-0 to notch up their second straight preliminary league victory in mens team squash competition.         
	India faced little opposition from Japan but expect to face a tough encounter against Malaysia, on Tuesday.         
	In rugby, despite suffering heavy defeats in all three league matches, the Indian mens team qualified for the quarter finals as only nine teams are in the fray. The womens team were steamrolled by Japan 31-0 for their second straight preliminary league defeat after being thumped 50-0 by Kazakhstan.         
	Chatholi Hamza and Sandeep Singh qualified for the mens 1500 metre finals after finishing fourth in their respective heats. The formers personal best stands at 3:39.90, but his best effort this season has been 3:43.39. Sandeep also finished fourth in his heat but ended up eighth overall with a qualifying time of 3:53.88.         
	India will have to strengthen their defence and hope that drag-flicker Sandeep Singh continues with his red-hot form, when they clash with Malaysia in a tough semi-final, on Tuesday.         
	After warming up with a 7-0 victory over Hong Kong, India tore apart Bangladesh 9-0. But then they struggled to get the better of their arch-foes Pakistan and Japan in successive matches by identical 3-2 margins.

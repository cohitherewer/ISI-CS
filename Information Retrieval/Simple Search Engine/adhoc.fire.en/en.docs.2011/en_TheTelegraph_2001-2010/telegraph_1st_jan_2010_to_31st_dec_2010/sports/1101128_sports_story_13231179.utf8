The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | China are by far the best
                                                                                                                       7                                        China are by far the best
    - Hosts end with 199 gold                 Zhou Chunxiu                           
	Guangzhou: Chinas women volleyball team clinched the last gold medal at the Guangzhou Asian Games, on Saturday, as organisers bid farewell to nearly 10,000 athletes under a tight security blanket.         
	Having already smashed through their 183 gold record at the 1990 Games, the hosts were determined to end the party just as they had begun it, with a relentless march to the podium accompanied by ecstatic cheers from home fans.         
	Two weeks after Chinese Wushu fighter Yuan Xiaochao snatched the first gold of the Games, Chinas women came back from a two-set deficit to sink South Korea in the volleyball final.         
	The title brought the hosts their 199th gold medal, but delegation chiefs said there was still work to be done.         
	Although we have a relatively large amount of gold medals, only a few attained world standards and most of them lacked the competitive standard of the Olympics, deputy chef de mission Duan Shijie said.         
	The situation in the lead-up to the London Olympics is grim and we can not rest on our laurels. Security forces were also on high alert in the centre of Guangzhou, with roads closed off and scores of police gathering at residential compounds near Haixinsha island, the venue of both the opening and closing ceremonies.         
	Athletes arrived at the water-themed opening ceremony on a flotilla of boats down the Pearl River, but on Saturday they will walk into a glimmering opera house to be entertained by folk and a traditional lion dance.         
	Earlier, Zhou Chunxiu gave China gold in the womens marathon, ahead of teammate Zhu Xiaolin. The battle for medals in the mens marathon was more heated with gold medallist Ji Young-jun of South Korea and Kenya-born Mubarak Shami of Qatar sniping at each other for a large part of the race.         
	After Ji ran into Shamis heels, the hot-tempered Qatari cuffed the South Korean on his shoulder and scolded him angrily.         
	Military-ruled Myanmar saved their best for last by winning their only two gold medals on the last day in the mens and womens doubles sepaktakraw.         
	The tight victory over South Korea in the mens final proved too dramatic for team leader Nyan Htun, who fainted and was sent to hospital on a stretcher.         
	While Chinas athletes dominated, Japan lost their battle for runner-up bragging rights to South Korea, who managed 76 golds to their rivals 48 and cut into Japans traditional strongholds of judo, wrestling and swimming.         
	Organisers basked in the glow of praise from Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah who described the Games as extraordinary, despite earlier rapping officials over half-full venues and excessive security measures.         
	The OCA president also praised North and South Korean athletes, who battled tooth and nail for titles ranging from wrestling to archery amid the worst military flare-up between war-time foes in decades.

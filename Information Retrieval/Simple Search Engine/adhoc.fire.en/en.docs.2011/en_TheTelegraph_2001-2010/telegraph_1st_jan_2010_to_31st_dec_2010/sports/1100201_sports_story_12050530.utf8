The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dravid injury a big blow, admits Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dravid injury a big blow, admits Gambhir
                      
	Chennai: Injured Rahul Dravids absence from next months Test series against South Africa was a big blow for the team, but India are a confident lot after starting the year on a winning note against Bangladesh, said opener Gautam Gambhir here Sunday.         
	Rahul Dravid has been the wall of the Indian middle-order and his absence against a quality team such as South Africa will be a big blow, said Gambhir, after flagging off the Formula 1600 race in the MRF Challenge series here.         
	But we have begun 2010 well (by winning against Bangladesh). The players would want to carry the momentum against South Africa. Moreover, injuries are part and parcel of sports, and it gives other players an opportunity to prove their mettle against a tough opposition, he said.         
	Dravid has been ruled out of the two-Test series against the Proteas starting February 6 after the right-hander fractured his jaw during the just-concluded Bangladesh tour.         
	Gambhir said South Africa have a strong pace attack in Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel but the Indian duo of Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma are no less potent.         
	They have a strong bowling pair in Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel. We need to start off well to keep them at bay. Though we dont have Sreesanth, Zaheer has been bowling extremely well recently. His performance in Bangladesh speaks volumes of the form he is in.         
	Ishant Sharma has also been bowling well in Tests and we do have a good balance in bowling, said Gambhir.         
	He said India will have to make a good start in all departments of the game if they want to beat Graeme Smiths men.         
	 They (South Africa) did well when they were here the last time, but didnt win the series. They will surely carry some confidence from that tour. But we have started off the year well by winning the series against Bangladesh. We have a lot of cricket ahead and it is good to start the year on such a positive note, he said.         
	Meanwhile, South African pacer Morne Morkel said he would have to strike early to unsettle the formidable batting of the hosts.         
	We will have to use the new ball well. Indias bowlers are very good in their circumstances and the pitches are regularly fantastic to bat on. If you dont use the new ball well, youre going to wait a long time to trick the batsmen with reverse swing, Morkel said in a South African weekly.

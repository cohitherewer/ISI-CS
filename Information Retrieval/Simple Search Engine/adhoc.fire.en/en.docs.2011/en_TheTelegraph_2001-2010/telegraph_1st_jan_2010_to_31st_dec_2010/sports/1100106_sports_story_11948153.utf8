            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has asked Roger Binny to watch CAB league and knock-out matches before the selection meeting of the senior team for the East Zone leg of the Vijay Hazare Trophy which will be held in Cuttack next month.         
	Binny reached the city on Tuesday to serve the remaining part of his tenure which is till the end of Vijay Hazare Trophy.         
	We would suggest the coach to pick and choose some important matches which are played at the relatively bigger grounds. He can thus analyse the performance of the players and provide inputs to the selectors during the next meeting, joint secretary Biswarup Dey said on Tuesday.         
	Apart from senior team assignments, Binny will also be visiting the districts to scout talented U-16 and U-19 players.         
	On three weekends, Binny will be visiting the districts (venues undecided). At each venue, there will be players from six districts who will appear for trials.         
	The players selected will be then taken under the CAB wing and provided state of the art training, Dey added.

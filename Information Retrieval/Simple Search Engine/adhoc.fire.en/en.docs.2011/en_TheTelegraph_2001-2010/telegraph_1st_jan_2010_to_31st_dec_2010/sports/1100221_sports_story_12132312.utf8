  -  United suffer shock 1-3 defeat vs Everton; Arsenal win 2-0               Didier Drogba celebrates one of his goals on Saturday. (Reuters)                           
	London: Didier Drogba scored twice Saturday as Chelsea won 2-0 at Wolves to open a four-point lead in the Premier League after Manchester United had lost 1-3 at Everton.         
	Arsenal moved closer to United with a 2-0 victory over Sunderland but remain six points behind the leaders.         
	Drogba hit the target in the 40th and 67th minutes at Molineux to take his tally for the season to 25 in all competitions and lift Chelsea to 61 points. United have 57 points, two more than the Gunners.         
	Everton substitutes Dan Gosling and Jack Rodwell scored late goals as the Toffees came from behind to beat at Goodison Park.         
	After Dimitar Berbatov had given United a 16th-minute lead, Everton equalised through Diniyar Bilyaletdinov three minutes later.         
	Gosling fired the home side ahead in the 76th, and Rodwell went on a weaving run to hit the third in the 90th after having been only three minutes on the field.         
	Its a bad result for us at this time of the year, United manager Alex Ferguson said. We cant afford a result that we had today. We hope that others will drop points. We looked really tired today and we were well beaten, simple as that.         
	Everton manager David Moyes saluted his substitutes but also his entire team, missing midfielders Tim Cahill and Marouane Fellaini through injury.         
	The substitutes came in today and made an impact in the game, said Moyes, whose side are chasing a place in Europe next season after a long spell in the bottom half of the standings. We can start looking up now rather than down.         
	United had the chance to go top, at least until Chelsea played Wolves later, if they had won but instead they suffered only their second defeat to Everton in 30 Premier League matches.         
	Everton, who have moved up to eight place, have now lost only one of their last 12 league matches.         
	Wolves played some neat football in the early stages, but fell behind to a superbly crafted goal which Drogba scored after a swift one-two between Michael Ballack and Yuri Zhirkov.         
	Drogbas second followed a huge clearance from goalkeeper Petr Cech and the win delighted coach Carlo Ancelotti.         
	Im very happy, we won an important game, but we must stay quiet and calm because there are a lot of important matches coming up. I think we deserved to win, he said.         
	Niklas Bendtner gave Arsenal a 27th-minute lead at Emirates Stadium from Emmanuel Eboues cross but Arsene Wengers team had to wait until a last-minute penalty to make sure of the points. Cesc Fabregas was brought down by Fraizer Campbell and he got up to stroke home the spot kick for his 15th goal of the season.         
	West Ham Uniteds revival continued with a 3-0 victory over Hull to put the visitors in deeper trouble. Valon Behramis first goal of the season in the second minute put the Hammers on course for victory, Carlton Cole added a second in the 59th and Julien Faubert the third near the end.         
	While Gianfranco Zolas West Ham moved closer to safety, Hull  who have played two more games than the three teams below  remained a point above the relegation zone.           (AGENCIES)

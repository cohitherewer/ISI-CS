The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India aim to sparkle sans stars
                                                                                                                       7                                      India aim to sparkle sans stars
            UMANAND JAISWAL                                      Gambhir and Saha       
	Guwahati: The importance of India-New Zealand one-day International series goes beyond the result of the series. With an eye on the upcoming World Cup next year, both the teams will like to have a measure of their future and that will be almost as important as the series itself.         
	The build-up to the Airtel Cup opener, however, has been quite low key unlike Indias past outings here.         
	The reason for that being the absence of the cream of the Indian team, seniors to be precise, who have been rested ahead of a gruelling South Africa tour.         
	But that doesnt take away the importance of the tie, which will set the tone for the series. More so for India because this series will be their last chance, at home, to brush up their ODI skills ahead of the World Cup, which is to be held in the subcontinent.         
	Both the captains  Daniel Vettori and Gautam Gambhir  hoped that the fringe players would utilise the opportunity to bolster their case before the coveted meet.         
	With no dearth of hunger to perform, Guwahati, which will be hosting its 16th match, can thus expect an exciting contest.         
	Though India enjoy an edge going by the current form, they will have to work hard to outclass the visitors who are no pushovers in the limited overs format.         
	Also the fact that for the Black Caps, the urge to perform, after a humiliating 0-4 loss at the hands of Bangladesh, will be more, make them a further more dangerous proposition.         
	New Zealand have also been strengthened by the inclusion of the experienced players like Scott Styris, Daryll Tuffey, Kyle Mills and Jamie How in their ODI squad. However, concerns over the fitness of Brendon McCullum, one of the most destructive batsmen in contemporary cricket, does not augur well for the visitors.         
	According to sources, McCullum, who has a back problem, was taken for an MRI to the hospital on Saturday. If he does not play, then Martin Guptill and How, who is returning to the side after a long gap, will open the innings.         
	India have no injury worries but a lot will depend on how Gambhir, who is standing-in for regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Murali Vijay deliver at the top.         
	Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli will hold the key in the middle-order. Ashish Nehra and Sreesanth, who looked in very good rhythm at the nets, and R Vinay Kumar are likely to man the bowling department. The match will be special for Bengal wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha, who will be making his ODI debut.         
	Both teams will have to apply themselves because of the early start (8.30am). There is also a possibility that the full quota of 50 overs-per-side may not be completed as the light here starts deteriorating by 3.30pm. Sources informed that the lunch break will be curtailed to ensure a full match. The wicket, according to both captains, looks good but will take spin and slow down as the match progresses.         
	For the record, both teams have lost their last match here respectively  and both were against Australia.

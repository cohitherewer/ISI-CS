	New Delhi: Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra continued to shoot gold, notching up a second top spot in the 10m air rifle event of the 33rd InterShoot tournament in the Hague, the Netherlands.         
	The reigning world champion made a shaky start in the qualification with a series of 98s but then shot three consecutive series of perfect 100, 100, 100 followed by 98 and 99 to register a score of 595.         
	In the final, Bindra shot 103.7 to clinch the title with a total score of 698.7.         
	The silver was won by Tinu Mohaupt of Germany with a score of 697.2 (592+105.2) while the bronze medal went to Dutch Peter Hellenbrand with a score of 695.7 (593+102.7).         
	On Thursday, Bindra had shot 700.1 (596+104.1) to claim the gold in the first match of the triple competition.         
	Earlier, Bindra had equalled his Beijing Games qualification score of 596 at the RIAC Cup in Luxembourg in December 2009 and at the IWK Grand Prix in Munich last week.         
	In the womens event, Indias Suma Shirur won the gold with a score of 497.5 (395+102.5).         
	Avneet Sidhu won the silver with a score of 495.5 (393+102.5) while Pournima Zanane finished seventh with a score of 488.1 (389+99.1).           (PTI)

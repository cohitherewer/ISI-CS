	Bangalore: Man of the Match T. Suman (78 off 57 balls) played a sparkling innings while Andrew Symonds gave him the perfect support with a 24-ball 53 as the Deccan Chargers beat the Royal Challengers Bangalore by seven wickets to stay afloat for a semi-final berth in the Indian Premier League here Thursday.         
	Chasing a target of 185, Suman came up with runs when it mattered most for his team and shared an unbeaten 46-ball 91-run fourth-wicket stand with Symonds as the title holders overhauled the target comfortably with four balls to spare. Suman bejewelled his innings with six fours and three sixes while Symondss blitzkrieg included five boundaries and three huge hits over the fence.         
	Earlier Jacques Kallis (68) and Virat Kohli (58) put on a 52-ball 95-run fifth wicket partnership to power the Royal Challengers to 184 for six.         
	With this win, the Chargers took their points tally to eight from ten contests while the defeat saw the Banaglore side stagnate at ten points from as many matches.                     
	It was also the second successive defeat for Anil Kumbles side, while the Chargers returned back to winning after five consecutive loses.         
	The Chargers did not have the perfect start to their run chase as they lost their opener Mohnish Mishra in the third over with just 11 runs on the board. Skipper Adam Gilchrist (32 off 19) and Suman, however, kept the Hyderabad side in the hunt, sharing 77 runs for the second wicket that came in just 8.3 overs. But the whole scenario changed within just seven runs as the Chargers lost two crucial wickets  Gilchrist and Rohit Sharma  to find themselves in a spot of bother.         
	Gilchrists 19-ball essay was cut short by Kumble who foxed him with a googly and Robin Uthappa did the rest behind the stumps. As if that blow was not enough, five balls later Rohit (6) gave away a straight forward catch to Dale Steyn off R Vinay Kumar to compound their problems.         
	But it was not to be Bangalores day. (PTI)

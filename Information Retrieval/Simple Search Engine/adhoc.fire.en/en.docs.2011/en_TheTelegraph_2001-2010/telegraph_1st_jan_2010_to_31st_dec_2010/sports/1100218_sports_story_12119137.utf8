The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav to open in tie vs Orissa
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav to open in tie vs Orissa
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly                           
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly is all set to open with in-form Sreevats Goswami as Bengal take on Orissa in their final round-robin encounter of the Vijay Hazare Trophy (East Zone leg) at the Barabati Stadium on Thursday.         
	There will be two changes in the Bengal squad. Senior opener Subhamoy Das who has had a woeful tournament so far will make way for Manoj Tiwary.         
	That will give Sourav a chance to utilise the Powerplay overs to good effect along with Sreevats who has scored back-to-back centuries against Jharkhand and Assam.         
	Pacer Sourav Sarkar will also get his first match of the tournament as all-rounder Sayan Sekhar Mondal, who has performed well in both departments, is out with a groin strain.         
	The Bengal team will be again bolstered by Souravs presence, who joined the squad on Wednesday morning.         
	The other positive aspect is the return of Manoj, who would like to leave behind the controversies of the past week and notch up a good score.         
	The match will decide who will be the East Zone toppers.         
	Orissa are currently on top with 12 points from three matches while Bengal are placed second in the group with nine points. However, Bengal have a better net run-rate of 0.716. Orissa are on 0.579.         
	We are hopeful that we will win the match and emerge as group champions, skipper Shukla told The Telegraph from Cuttack on Wednesday.

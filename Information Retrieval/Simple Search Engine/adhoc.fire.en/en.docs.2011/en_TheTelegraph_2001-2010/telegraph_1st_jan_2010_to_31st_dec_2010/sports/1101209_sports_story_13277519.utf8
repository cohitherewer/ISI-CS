                  Tolgay Ozebe                     
	Margao: Defending champions Dempo Sports Club had to taste a defeat at the hands of East Bengal, in a second-round match of the I-League, here at the Nehru Stadium, on Wednesday.         
	Australian striker Tolgay Ozebe capitalised on a misunderstanding between defender Domnic Noronha and goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani to score the winner.         
	It was East Bengals second win on the trot, having defeated ONGC by an identical margin, in the first round.         
	Tolgay scored the goal in the 48th minute when keeper Kattimani hesitated to collect the long ball from Sushant Mathew. The Australian pounced on the loose ball and volleyed in on the run.         
	Both the teams started cautiously, East Bengal, who lost to Dempo in the Super Cup, controlled the proceeding for most of the 90 minutes and had more of the ball possession.         
	They created three clear chances in the first half. First Robin Singh failed to direct the ball on target in the 18th minute. Then in the 27th minute Uga Okpara saw his header cut off safely by Kattimani off a Mehtab Hossain free-kick.         
	Ten minutes later, the Trevor Morgan-coached side once again came close to break ing the deadlock, but the hosts were lucky as Tolgays shot from inside the box hit the cross bar and went out.         
	It was a sweet revenge for the Calcutta outfit after going down to the holders, 1-3 in the Super Cup.         
	With Clifton not in his element up front and Ranty Martins being heavily marked, Dempo were far from negating East Bengals advantage, forget achieving their goal.         
	That they managed just one worthy opportunity on either side of the break against four by East Bengal in the first half and three in the second, goes to show how the Goans lost the battle.         
	Ironically, it was East Bengal goalkeeper Sandip Nandy who was handed the Man of the Match award when Dempo goalkeeper Kattimani denied the Calcuttans on four occasions.         
	Also, with no choice at hand on the bench, chief coach Armando Colaco was forced to throw in a fifth midfielder, Mickey at the cost of pulling out Clifton. And though the seasoned campaigner gave the Dempo attack more teeth, spraying long balls from deep, a Beto or Joaquim Abranches at hand would have turned their fortunes around.         
	Sadly, that was not to be, and East Bengal managed to sneak home victors.         
	In Gurgaon, AIFF XI and ONGC played out a 1-1 draw at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium.         
	ONGC drew first of the match in the 46th minute through Baba Tunde. The AIFF juniors equalised in the 78th minute through Jeje..         
	In Kolhapur, hosts Mumbai FC registered their second consecutive victory defeating visitors Pune FC 2-0.         
	The hosts surged ahead due to a 19th minute strike by S Kuttimany. Their lead was doubled following an own goal by Ebi Sukore.

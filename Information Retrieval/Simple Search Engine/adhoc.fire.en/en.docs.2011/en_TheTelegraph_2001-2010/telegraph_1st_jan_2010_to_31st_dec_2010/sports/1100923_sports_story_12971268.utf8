                                                                                                                       7                                      Organisers face Fennell test
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: On a day when the Commonwealth Games was thrown into more chaos after a ceiling fell inside the weightlifting arena at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Mike Fennell, the Games Federation (CGF) president, announced he would arrive in the capital on Thursday to take stock of the situation.         
	Though Fennell had set a 24-hour deadline for the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee (OC) to get their act together, nothing much has been done to improve the condition of the Games Village, which according to the representatives of many participating countries is filthy.         
	According to sources, Fennell is so upset with the working style of the OC that he has requested a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	Fennell is believed to be trying to meet the Prime Minister, said a source in the OC. He is likely urge the Prime Minister to take immediate steps to save the Games.         
	Fennell had earlier given time till Wednesday to the Organising Committee to sort out issues in the residential zone of the Games Village, which he said has shocked advance parties from New Zealand, Canada, Scotland and Ireland because of its unhygienic conditions.         
	Sources in the OC, however, said that though work at the Village was at full swing, it is unlikely to meet the deadline set by the CGF president. At least 10 of the 34 blocks are not yet fully ready and the work will definitely not end by Thursday, an official said.         
	Interestingly, while most of the senior officials in the OC remained unavailable throughout Wednesday, treasurer A.K. Mattoo admitted that there were concerns over hygiene and cleanliness at the Games Village. He, however, promised to sort out all the mess within the next two days.         
	As far as Fennells deadline is concerned, it seems that the OC officials havent taken him seriously and are extending the time limit according to their own plans.         
	We are sorry for the inconvenience Perhaps instruction regarding cleanliness was not adhered to or not provided. But its a huge area and there could have been certain shortcomings. We ensure you that we will make up for any deficiency that exists within the next two days, Mattoo said.         
	Another source revealed that at one point of time there was a proposal to shift some of the teams to different hotels when they start arriving on Thursday.         
	The plan was discarded, but a few teams may still not find a place in their allotted zones. Continuous rain has also complicated our problems, said the official.         
	Some of the top athletes from the participating countries have already pulled out with the latest high profile withdrawals including that of Christine Ohuruogu, Englands 400 metres Olympic gold medallist and world triple jump champion Philips Idowu.         
	Several foreign contingents have complained about the state of the Games Village, with some describing conditions as filthy and unliveable.

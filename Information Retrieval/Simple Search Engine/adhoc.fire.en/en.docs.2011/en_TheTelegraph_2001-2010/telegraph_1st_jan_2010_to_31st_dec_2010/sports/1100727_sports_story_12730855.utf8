The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team come first, says Ferrari boss
                                                                                                                       7                                        Team come first, says Ferrari boss
                  Fernando Alonso                           
	Maranello: Ferrari president Luca Di Montezemolo has told his Formula One drivers Monday that the team always come first in the aftermath of the passing row that erupted during the German Grand Prix.         
	The Italian team was found guilty of breaking team order rules and fined $100,000 after Felipe Massa appeared to let teammate Fernando Alonso pass him to win the race on Sunday.         
	Massa led the race for 49 of 67 laps before he was passed by Alonso following Ferrari messages over the team radio.         
	Article 39.1 of the International Auto Federation 2010 sporting regulations outlaws teams giving orders during a race.         
	Ferrari says that the drivers arrived at the decision independently.         
	Im not interested in arguing, Di Montezemolo was quoted as saying.         
	I will repeat what I always tell my drivers and that is when they drive for Ferrari the team always come first.         
	Additional sanctions could be imposed by the World Motor Sport Council though Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, who appeared to back Di Montezemolos view that the sport should be team-focused.         
	All the cars have to be exactly the same, the drivers wear the same overalls, so everybody has to look like a team  a team of people that are racing, Ecclestone said.         
	I believe what people do when they are inside the team, and how they run their team is up to them ... nobody should interfere as to how they run their team.         
	But of course if they do something thats dangerous then obviously theyre going to be in trouble, otherwise get on with it.         
	Meanwhile, Force India were reprimanded at the German Formula One Grand Prix on Sunday after mixing up Vitantonio Liuzzis and Adrian Sutils tyres. (Agencies)

	Mumbai: Wasim Jaffer struck his 40th first-class century to help Mumbai reach a respectable 340 for seven on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy Super League tie, against Saurashtra, here on Monday.         
	Rohit Sharma set the BKC-MCA ground on fire with his blazing knock of 93 but it was Jaffers 138 that helped the hosts reach a commanding position at the end of the days play.         
	The hosts seemed set for a mammoth total as they were placed at 252 for two at one stage. Rohit was on his way to what had the potential of being one of the fastest first-class hundreds, but he perished as he tried to loft left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja and was caught at long-on.         
	Rohits 86-ball innings, comprised of 14 fours and two sixes, saw Mumbai rattle up 152 runs in the second session. The eight overs, from 34th to 41st, after lunch, brought 71 runs for Mumbai.         
	When you are scoring fast, you want to maintain the tempo and hit every ball. And its not that I cannot play defensively. Last year, against Railways, I scored 101 off 214 balls, Rohit said while speaking about his innings.         
	The third wicket partnership between Rohit and Jaffer was worth 147 runs and came from just 155 balls.         
	On the other hand, Jaffer refused to get carried away by his younger teammates brilliant stroke-making.         
	He not only ensured that his good work didnt go to waste, but also prolonged the middle order. The former India opener reached his century off the first ball after tea and hit 19 fours and a six.         
	In Chennai, former India medium pacer Lakshmipathy Balaji claimed four wickets to help Tamil Nadu enjoy an upper hand as the hosts skittled out Assam for 184 in their first innings.         
	Summarised scores         
	 In Chennai: Assam 184 (Parvez Aziz 36; L. Balaji 4/53). Tamil Nadu 21/0         
	 In Cuttack: Baroda 99/9 (Rakesh Solanki 44n..; Basanth Mohanty 5/24) vs Orissa         
	 In Delhi: Gujarat 234/4 (P. Parmar 28*) vs Railways.         
	 In Dharamsala: Haryana 204/4 (H. Badani 58n..) vs Himachal Pradesh.         
	 In Meerut: Punjab 279/6 (K Goel 56n..) vs Uttar Pradesh.         
	 In Mumbai: Mumbai 340/7 (S. Marathe 45, W. Jaffer 138, R. Sharma 93; Jadeja 3/100) vs Saurashtra.         
	All matches to continue

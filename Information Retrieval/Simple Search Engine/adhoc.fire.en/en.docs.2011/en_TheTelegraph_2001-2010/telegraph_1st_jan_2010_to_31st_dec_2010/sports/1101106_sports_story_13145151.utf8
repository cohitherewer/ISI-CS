	Dubai: Pakistan paced their chase perfectly to beat South Africa by 1 wicket with one ball left in the thrilling fourth one-day International on Friday, sending the series to a final on Monday.         
	In an amazing last over of hits and missed chances, Zulqarnain Haider ran for two runs to tie the score off the third-to-last delivery and barely survived a run out at the other end, then hit the winning single behind square off the next ball.         
	Pakistan impressively made 275 for nine to overhaul South Africas 274 for six off 50 overs.         
	Earlier, Captain Graeme Smith, returning from a hand injury, hit 92 and AB de Villiers 49 in a mid-innings platform of 94, then Johan Botha smashed 28 off 15 balls as South Africa plundered 48 off the last four overs.         
	Pakistans bowlers mainly struggled and had to endure several dropped catches, but Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Hafeez and Wahab Riaz took two wickets each at considerable expense.         
	Smith, who won the toss and elected to bat, immediately went after fast bowler Abdul Razzaq and Akhtar. Smith and Hashim Amla, who scored an unbeaten century in the last match, looked secure in making 30 until Amla top-edged a pull off Akhtar to Imran Farhat at square leg in the seventh over.         
	Jacques Kallis was out for 15, then Smith and de Villiers patiently handled the Pakistan attack.         
	Smith reached his 42nd one-day half century off 57 balls, and was heading toward his ninth ODI hundred until Hafeez got him lbw in the 31st over. Smith hit nine boundaries in his 105-ball knock. Hafeez also caught out de Villiers, who sliced at Akhtar one run shy of a half century.

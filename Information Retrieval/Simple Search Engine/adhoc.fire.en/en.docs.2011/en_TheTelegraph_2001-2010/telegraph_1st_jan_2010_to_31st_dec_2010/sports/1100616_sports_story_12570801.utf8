The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time for redemption
                                                                                                                       7                                        Time for redemption
    - Dhoni amp; Co. aim to begin with a bang vs Bangladesh today                 Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the nets in Dambulla, on Monday                           
	Dambulla: A rejuvenated India would aim to redeem their tarnished pride and end a 15-year-old jinx when they start their Asia Cup campaign against Bangladesh at the Rangiri Dambulla ground here Wednesday.         
	Hurting from their debacles in the World Twenty20 (West Indies) and the tri-series in Zimbabwe, Mahendra Singh Dhonis men would be desperate to win back the confidence of fans after being accused of being more loyal to their IPL teams than the country.         
	The Asia Cup title, which they last won in 1995, will be the perfect balm to calm frayed nerves and bury the ghosts of the recent past.         
	Unlike in the West Indies and Zimbabwe, India have a near full-strength team to achieve what they have set out for.         
	Except for Sachin Tendulkar, who opted to spend time with his family, and Yuvraj Singh, dropped for poor form, India more or less have the nucleus of the 2011 World Cup team here.         
	Virender Sehwags return provides the firepower to the batting which had been rudderless without substantial starts at the top of the order.         
	The Delhi marauder, who was nursing a shoulder injury, is arguably one of the most feared batsman in international cricket capable of demolishing any attack on his day.         
	Dhoni would be looking forward to fireworks from his deputy to reignite the confidence of his beleaguered legion.         
	If Sehwag can provide a blistering start in the company of Gautam Gambhir, the rest of the batting, propped up by the youthful exuberance of Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli should be capable of holding its own in the four-nation event.                     
	Dhoni would also be itching to set the record straight, especially after his leadership was questioned in the immediate aftermath of the World Twenty20. He might bat up the order, probably at four or five, depending on the start provided by the top-half.         
	If the batsmen conjure match-winning totals, the Indian bowling, which has been a subject of debate over the last six months, should be able to provide the results that the fans have longed for since the successful conquest against South Africa at home in March.         
	The new ball will be shared by Zaheer Khan, Asish Nehra and Praveen Kumar, who has been fortunate to regain his place in the side despite dismal performances in the past.         
	It augurs well that Zaheer, who was virtually on his haunches during the unsuccessful campaign in the World Twenty20 after an enervating IPL, looks rearing to go following the break.         
	All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja and Pragyan Ojha should play the supporting cast to Harbhajan Singh in the spin department.         
	Teams         
	India (from): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Praveen Kumar, Zaheer Khan, Pragyan Ojha, Asish Nehra, Ashok Dinda, Ravichandran Ashwin, Saurabh Tiwari.         
	Bangladesh (from): Shakib-al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Jahurul Islam, Junaid Siddique, Mohammed Ashraful, Mahmudullah, Mashrafe Mortaza, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel, Rubel Hossain, Shafiul islam, Suhrawadi Shuvo.         
	Match starts: 2.30pm (IST).           (PTI)

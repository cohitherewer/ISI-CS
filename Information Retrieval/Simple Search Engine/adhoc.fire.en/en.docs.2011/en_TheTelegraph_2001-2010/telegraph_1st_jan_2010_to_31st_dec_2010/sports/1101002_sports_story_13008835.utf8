The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal is tied 7th
                                                                                                                       7                                      Atwal is tied 7th
                      
	Madison: Arjun Atwal, who hit a six-under on the first day of $3.6 million Viking Classic and was sharing the lead with Bill Lunde, Ken Duke and Brett Quigley, was tied seventh after he completed five holes on Friday. Teeing off late, Atwal parred all the five holes. On the first day, he had parred the first seven holes.         
	This is Atwals first PGA Tour meet since winning the Wyndham Championship a month ago. Ive never played in conditions like this. Ive always played when its softer. But its playing perfect, its firm. Its just the way its supposed to be played, Atwal after his first day performance.         
	Brendon de Jonge was the early leader on Friday, with another six-under 72.         
	On Thursday, Atwal began steadily before closing his first-nine with back-to-back birdies on the 17th and 18th.         
	The front-nine turned out to be even better as Atwal struck five birdies against a lone bogey to round off his eighth card in the 60s in his last nine rounds. (Agencies)

  - Trevors boys dazzle in 5-0 win despite being reduced to 10 men       A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengal players break into a celebratory jig after scoring a goal during their CFL match against Mohammedan Sporting, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Monday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: A good student is always well armed for an examination  you never know when your pen fails you. Well, when East Bengals Penn went dry, on Monday, the red and gold brigade were yet to answer the majority of the questions in the first major examination of the season.         
	And its beyond doubt that Trevor Morgans team passed the test with distinction, hammering five goals past a hapless Mohammedan Sporting, in CFL Premier Division clash, on Monday. The fact that Penn Orji, the fulcrum in Morgans scheme of things, was ordered out of match in the 35th minute makes the result even more brilliant. Pleasing, in fact, in the coachs words.         
	East Bengal, the pre-match favourites, lived up to the hype when Harmajyot Singh Khabras left-footer, from the edge of the box, in the 8th minute punctured the Mohammedan Sporting net.         
	Toying with the opponent players, East Bengal were looking set for further glory when Penns needless head-butt on the referee earned him the dreaded red. And then came the surprise.         
	While logic, or rather the usual standard of the game in the country, suggested that Morgans wards would lose their organisation on the field, they displayed a brand of football, which was an apt gift for the die-hard fans, who braved the rain to sit through the match.         
	The second half portrayed an 11-minute show of contrast, which decided the fate of the match. While Syed Nayeemuddins men went into darkness with some sloppy defending and poor goalkeeping, Morgans men lit up the ground with top class opportunism.         
	Robin Singh, the young striker, was the vibrant hero of the day. He struck twice within four minutes  the first, in the 47th minute was a gift by the rival keeper Priyant Singh, who let the ball through his hands; the second, in the 51st, showcased his individual brilliance when he foxed the defence and the keeper in a 30-yard run.         
	Saumik Dey then, in the 58th minute, ran almost the whole length of the ground down the left flank, latched on to a long pass from Khabra, and then shot past keeper Priyant, who was again at fault for not covering the near post.         
	Theres no way that Mohammedan Sporting could have recovered from a 0-4 scoreline. To wipe out even the slimmest chance of a fight back, Australian Tolgay Ozebe hammered the final nail in the 75th minute with powerful grounder. Tolgay, like Robin, was impressive with his ball control and shooting abilities.         
	And rival coaches beware of Morgans shrewd brain. The secret of East Bengal absorbing the Penn-shock lay in his decision to field Jayanta Paul, the goalkeeper, as his under-19 player. That left him with 10 experienced players to deal with the crisis. They did so with flying colours.         
	While song and dance was the theme in the East Bengal dressing room, defender Zoheb Hasan was involved in a scuffle with club official Iqbal Ahmed in the Mohammedan Sporting changing room. Hasan has been left out of the clubs Federation Cup squad.         
	That says it all, really.

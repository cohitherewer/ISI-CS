                                                                                                                       7                                      Kamran was Kami for the bookie duo
            A STAFF REPORTER                                Kamran Akmal      
	Calcutta: Text messages retrieved from Mazhar Majeeds mobile phone indicate his close ties with Pakistani wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, who was nicknamed Kami by the alleged match-fixers.         
	The News of the World, which has blown the lid off the betting scam that has led to the suspension of three Pakistani players, came out with more sensational details of the modus operandi of the alleged fixers.These include messages from Majeeds mobile which are now under investigation by police.         
	The newspaper has also uncovered new photographs showing the proximity between Majeed and the Pakistan squad. The snaps were taken at an Indian restaurant in Perth on January 30, a day after Pakistan were beaten by 135 runs by the Aussies in a one-day International.         
	The controversial second Test defeat led to close scrutiny of Akmal, who dropped a series of catches.         
	A match-fixing probe into him was launched on February 26. A day later Majeed was texted from a British number. The message read: Kamran Akmal has been accused of match-fixing.         
	A month later  on March 5  another text to Majeed read: Salam bro pls be careful if you are dealing with any financial matter with Kami. I am sure you are aware he and one other player is very much into match fixing allegations.         
	One text from Azhar to Majeed on March 25 reads: Lets great f***g hold of cricket and squeeze everything we can from it.         
	In reply to the text, Majeed said: Exactly the attitude I wanted from you yesterday.         
	A blizzard of messages sent to numbers around the world  including America, India, Italy, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates hold the key to unravelling the scandal.         
	Quoting a source, the report said, Messages have been sent and received from a vast range of contacts. We are working quickly to establish whether codes were used in these text messages, who they were sent to and where they were sent.         
	Majeeds texts provide a insight into his shady world.         
	On May 10, the day Pakistan played Sri lanka in a Twenty20 match, Majeed sent messages to four unidentified numbers.         
	In a possible reference to nobbling particular deliveries, he texted: Ok how about other thing. One in the seventh over and one in the eighth.         
	Six minutes later, he sent another, saying: This will only work if u score in the first 2 overs and no wickets. Also even if we bat second innings it is same.         
	Shortly afterwards he asked: Bro also confirm the other thing in the 7th and 8th over. 1 fall in each.         
	There is no record to show whether he received replies to these messages.

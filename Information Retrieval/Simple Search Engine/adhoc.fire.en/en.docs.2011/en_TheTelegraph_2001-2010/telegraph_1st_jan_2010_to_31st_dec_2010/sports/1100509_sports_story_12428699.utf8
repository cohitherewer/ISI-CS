	Mumbai: Suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi Saturday handed all the relevant documents relating to the T20 League to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), sources close to him said.         
	The documents, both original as well as notarised copies, included all franchisee agreements, global media rights agreements, global media rights packages, all bid documents, media rights licensee agreements, eligibility letters of all bidders with details and all sponsorship agreements entered into by IPL, the sources said.         
	The documents were handed over to BCCI chief administrative officer Professor Ratnakar Shetty by Modis lawyer Mehmood M. Abdi, the sources added. All these documents were missing from the BCCI office and Shetty had been entrusted by the IPL governing council at its April 26 emergent meeting to collect them.

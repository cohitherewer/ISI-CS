The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Win, the No. 1 concern
                                                                                                                       7                                        Win, the No. 1 concern
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Mahendra Singh Dhoni takes a break from a practice session, at the VCA Stadium, in Nagpur, on Friday. Inclement weather affected practice of both teams. (PTI)                           
	Nagpur: Will the worlds top ranked side in Test cricket manage to win the series decider against the No. 8 team? Will Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. adopt a more aggressive approach? Will Team India opt for five bowlers? Will Sachin Tendulkar record his 50th century at home?         
	More than worrying about their fortunes in the lead-up to the final Test at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, in nearby Jamtha, it is the unseasonal rain in the city that has put a spanner in the home teams works. For the second day running on Friday, the Indians were bereft of a full practice session.         
	There was very little chance of having a net session on the wet practice wickets after Thursdays downpour. The Indians decided to sweat it out in the afternoon on the pitches adjacent to the main square. Sachin and Dhoni hardly had a few knocks when it started to rain again forcing them to pack up for the day.         
	The pitch and bowlers run-up are covered but puddles in the outfield have put a question mark on the 9.30am start on Saturday. The groundsmen, though, are confident that their mopping up operations with the Super Sopper will result in the Test starting on time unless the elements again. Though there is forecast of more rain on Saturday, the weather is expected to clear up by the evening.         
	Hardly the ideal preparation for a team struggling to stamp their domination in what had been billed as a mismatch of sorts. The New Zealanders have proved to be fast learners. Any other team would have been daunted by the noisy crowds, the shimmering heat and the sight of the host spinners wheeling away in responsive conditions, with fielders alert for any error around the bat. But Daniel Vettoris team have been a revelation with their application, temperament and potential in the two Tests so far.         
	Players like Kane Williamson and Tim McIntosh, not to speak of the experienced Brendon McCullum and Ross Taylor, have used their feet to attack Harbhajan Singhs wily offerings and showed the confidence needed to read his variations. While a draw will be a mighty accomplishment for the Black Caps, for India, it will put a question mark over their No. 1 status despite their earlier deeds.         
	Daniel Vettori put it down well. We are not satisfied because once we are satisfied, it will be the start of our downfall, he said. New Zealand are likely to bring in left-arm seamer Andy McKay in a bid to utilise the overcast conditions.         
	The pressure, no doubt, will be on the Indians. New Zealand will be cautious in this battle of attrition.         
	Dhoni has ruled out using five bowlers which means the attack will rely heavily on Harbhajan in the absence of Zaheer Khan. Ishant Sharma is expected to be back.         
	It will be difficult to go with an extra fast bowler... Thats out of the picture now. You might get some reverse swing but not enough to go with three seamers... It will be 2-2, Dhoni said.         
	The wicket will again come under the scanner with Harbhajan castigating the Ahmedabad and Hyderabad tracks. Dhoni found it to be a lot drier but doesnt expects it to be a turner. If the spinners get a bit of bounce it will be good. Indias known more for turning tracks but I havent seen one in the past few Tests. This wicket looks a bit dry, there is some grass I am hoping there will be spin and bounce, the Team India captain said.         
	Whatever the conditions, the focus no doubt will stay on Indias victory and Sachin. The expectations and anticipation is only bound to multiply once he walks out to the middle. The Sachin Tendulkar Fans Association have already set afoot grand plans to celebrate the milestone with huge banners, including one in the building adjacent to Hotel Pride, where the teams are staying.         
	This has been a happy hunting ground for the maestro with five of his 49 hundreds coming here. He has scored centuries on the two occasions India have played at the newly-built Jamtha Stadium, against Australia in November 2008 and versus South Africa in February this year.         
	The city is hoping he will prove to be third time lucky.

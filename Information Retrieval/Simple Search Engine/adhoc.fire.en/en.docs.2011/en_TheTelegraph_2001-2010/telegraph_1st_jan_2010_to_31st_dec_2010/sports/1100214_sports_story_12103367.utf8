                                                                                                                       7                                        Rahil in the lead with six others
  - I am confident of ending title drought, says city golfer       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Rahil Gangjee in Gurgaon, on Saturday. (AP)                                 
	Gurgaon: Rahil Gangjee raised visions of a dream triumph in the Avantha Masters on Saturday, firing an unblemished three-under 69 to share the lead with six others at the picturesque DLF Golf and Country Club.         
	Starting on his overnight position of tied eighth, the Calcutta boy played some sparkling golf to match his fancied rivals in the crowded leaderboard that also saw Fredrik Andersson Hed (66), Darren Beck (70), Richard Bland (66), Yih-shin Chan (72), Tetsuji Hiratsuka (70) and Barry Lane (71) tied for the lead on 11-under in the $2.1 million tournament.         
	Gangjee, who won his maiden Asian Tour title at the Volkswagen Masters-China in 2004, said it could be his day on Sunday.         
	I know there is pressure on me, but I am confident of ending my title drought, the 32-year old said. The pressure will always be there but Ive been in this position before and I have handled it well.         
	Gangjee birdied the third and the seventh holes Saturday to reach the turn to 34. He pared the next eight holes after the turn before closing with another birdie on the par-five 18th.         
	It was a good one as the ball landed exactly at the distance I wanted it to. The putting was difficult as the green got slower, Gangjee said. Im pretty happy because I had no bogeys again today (Saturday). I am excited that I am in the lead but I am just going to do what I have been doing for the last three days, play one shot at a time and enjoy it.         
	Among the 25 professionals and one amateur who are playing in this tournament, only five Indians have managed to make the cut.         
	Behind Gangjee was Jyoti Randhawa, in the tied 29th position. While Arjun Atwal was tied 37th, Digvijay was tied 54th and Ashok Kumar was 63rd.         
	I got eight under and let it slip on turn as I tried to raise my game, said Randhawa afterwards.         
	He started off well, striking a birdie on the third hole and though a bogey on the fifth pulled him back, he more than made up for it with an eagle on the sixth to make the turn two-under before a poor back nine marred his card.         
	The bogey par bogey run from 11th to 13th set me back, rued Randhawa. The 30-feet eagle at the sixth was the lone bright spot.         
	The course is softer but the greens are a little tough, added the star golfer.         
	Harendra Gupta, Mukesh Kumar and C. Muniyappa missed the cut by one while other big Indians to miss out included Jeev Milkha Singh, Gaurav Ghei and Anirban Lahiri, all at one-over 145.         
	In a day of missed opportunities, Japan s Tetsuji Hiratsuka, who set a course record 62 in the second round, also wasted an opportunity to head the field after a bogey at the 18th saw him sign for a 70 while the same fate befell Darren Beck after the Australian had picked up four early birdies.

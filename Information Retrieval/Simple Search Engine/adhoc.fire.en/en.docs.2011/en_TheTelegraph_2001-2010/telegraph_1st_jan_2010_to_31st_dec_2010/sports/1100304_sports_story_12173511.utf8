    - T20 is good entertainment... But you have to be careful how far you let it go           OUR CORRESPONDENT            Gary Sobers and Ajit Wadekar in Mumbai, on Wednesday. (PTI)                                 
	Mumbai: Even as the debate rages about the greatness of Sachin Tendulkar, with some rating him above Sir Donald Bradman, legendary Sir Garfield Sobers feels Sunil Gavaskar is the best.         
	The former West Indies captain, the greatest all-rounder the game has ever produced, presented his case with such clarity that one could only nod in agreement.         
	People have made runs at home but Gavaskar made a lot of runs, away in England, the West Indies and everywhere. He opened against bowlers like Andy Roberts, Colin Croft and other fast bowlers, Sobers, in the city to attend a felicitation for the 1971 Indian team, the first to win a series in the Caribbean and England, said.         
	Its only my view, because of the bowlers he played against during that period. If you think of (Brian) Lara, Viv (Sir Vivian Richards) and Sachin, it is difficult Sachin has done all that was expected of him.         
	You cannot compare present and past. The conditions were entirely different when Don Bradman and Denis Compton played. When we played, you could bowl six bouncers in an over, and the beamer as well... The field was set by the players, not by the rules.         
	There were no helmets and arm guards. And with the back foot no-ball rule, the ball was delivered from a lot closer distance... They used to bowl 72 overs in a day, causing delays. So the batsmen did not have a chance to make as many runs.         
	Those are the facts. You dont listen to me, you sit and think. I am not trying to belittle anyone, said the 73-year-old.         
	Sobers is still in awe of Gavaskar, who made 774 runs on the 1971 visit to the Caribbean, his debut series. Oh, what a batsman he was! It was one of the best performances by a visiting team and batsman, he said.         
	The events of the series seemed to be still fresh in his mind as he recalled the names of each star performer for India on that tour. I had come to India in 1966-67 with the West Indies team and we should have learnt only then that the Indian team could not be taken lightly any more, he said.         
	It was in 1948 that the West Indies visited India for the first time. It had players like Everton Weekes and easily won. I was with the team that toured in 1959 under Gerry Alexander, and we won easily too. But in 1966-67, although we won, it was tough.         
	Sobers would not rate Wadekars team as the best ever on the planet in that particular period when they beat his team, and then repeated the 1-0 scoreline in England that summer.         
	I would say they had become a force to reckon with, who could compete against the top teams, he said. They had players like Farokh Engineer, Bishan Bedi, (Erapalli) Prasanna, Gavaskar, (Gundappa) Viswanath and the captain himself. After seeing them, I said, they are going to beat England.         
	While Sobers admitted that his was a team that was in transition and did not pack the quality of fast bowlers comparable to previous or future generations, his Indian counterpart Wadekar said that enforcing the follow-on in the first Test in Kingston proved to be the psychological turning point of the series.         
	Talking about the current Indian team, which is ranked No.1 in Tests, Sobers said: Your opening batsman, Virender Sehwag, I will go to watch him play... He has captured the imagination of the people world over.         
	Sobers dismissed the notion that the T20 form could contribute to the betterment of Test cricket and, indirectly, warned of the dangers of too much money pouring into the game from the Indian Premier League.         
	Twenty20 is good entertainment. It is a game that you need, people will go and watch. But you have to be careful how far you let it go, he said.         
	The Stanford T20 was fun because of the way it was set up. The players played to win because only the winners got the cash.         
	Today its different. The amount the players gain, some deserve it, but not all. But there must be a reason for it. Since I dont know the reason, I dont want to go too far on that.         
	We must look at it (T20) as pure entertainment. It will not produce Test players. Of course, it can help in improving running between the wickets and for defensive batsmen to become attacking ones, he explained.

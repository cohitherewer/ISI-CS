                                                                                                                       7                                                                                                        
	 Calcutta: The newly-formed Kochi IPL team will, in all likelihood, be roping in former Australia captain Steve Waugh in the role of a technical expert. The claim was made by franchise chairman Harshad Mehta who was in the city on Saturday to attend a promotional.     
	We are planning to have Waugh and Ashish Kapoor as technical experts, he told mediapersons at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Saturday. The Dubai-based diamond merchant maintained that Shashi Tharoor will remain the mentor of the IPL team. He, however, declined to comment on the Sunanda Pushkars sweat equity issue.        
	 Karachi: Former coach Intikhab Alam called the Pakistan national cricket team members mentally retarded while deposing before the inquiry committee probing the disastrous tour of Australia. They do not know that they are representing the country. They dont know how to wear their clothes and how to talk in a civilised manner, was what Intikhab said, according to a Pakistan newspaper.       
	Younis appeal   
	Lahore: The appeals judge hearing the appeals of the Pakistani cricketers penalised by the board has refused to give temporary relief to Younis Khan, saying he does not have the mandate to do so. Younis had filed an appeal with Justice (retired) Irfan Qadir seeking interim relief against the indefinite ban imposed on him.  
	Squash meet  
	Chennai: Joshna Chinapppa dished out a lethargic display in the final on Saturday as Indias title aspirations ended with Hong Kongs 2-0 victory in the team event at the 15th Asian Senior Squash Championship. In the mens section, Pakistan beat defending champions Malaysia 2-0.       
	Turin: Shiv Kapur (71) and Jyoti Randhawa (74) missed the cut for the second successive week, crashing out of the BMW Italian Open after contrasting second-round cards here.       
	Jelena shocked  
	Rome: Unseeded Spaniard Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez produced a major upset when she beat world No.7 Jelena Jankovic 7-6, 7-5 in the Italian Open final on Saturday. Seventh seed Jankovic had defeated Serena and Venus Williams earlier this week.  
	Bayern crown  
	Berlin: Bayern Munich beat relegated Hertha Berlin 3-1 on Saturday to win the German championship for a record 22nd time and take the first step towards an unprecedented treble for a German team.

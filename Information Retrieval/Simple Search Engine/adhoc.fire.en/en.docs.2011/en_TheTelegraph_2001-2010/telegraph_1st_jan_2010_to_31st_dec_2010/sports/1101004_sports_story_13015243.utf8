The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Atwal at tied 31st
                                                                                                                       7                                      Atwal at tied 31st
                      
	Madison: Arjun Atwal was at tied 31st after completing 12 holes in the final round, of the Viking Classic golf tournament, on Sunday.         
	He had hit six bogeys and one birdie. He lost 25 places after ending Round III at tied sixth.         
	American Bill Haas remained in lead after completing 10 holes.         
	The other Indian in fray, Jeev Milkha Singh, was down in the leaderboard at tied 59th after completing two holes on Sunday. He had lost three places after ending tied 56th in the third round.         
	Earlier, on Saturday, Atwals overall tally stood at nine-under 207.         
	It was not the best of starts as Atwal stumbled to a bogey on the third hole but he made amends by picking up a birdie on the seventh to make the turn even-par.         
	After a subdued first nine, Atwal struck form in his backward journey and sank in four birdies  on the 10th, 11th, 15th and 18th  against just a lone bogey to round off a reasonably good day.         
	Atwal was tied for lead at six-under after the first round, on the opening day. This is the 37-year-olds first PGA meet after his spectacular win at the Wyndham Championship a month ago.

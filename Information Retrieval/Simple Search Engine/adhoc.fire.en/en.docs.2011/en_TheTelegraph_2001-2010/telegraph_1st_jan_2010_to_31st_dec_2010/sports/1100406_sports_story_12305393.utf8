	Chennai: After re-igniting semi-final hopes with the win over Rajasthan Royals, the Chennai Super Kings will have revenge on mind against table-toppers Mumbai Indians when the two sides meet in their return-leg match here Tuesday.         
	At the top of the points table with 14 points, Sachin Tendulkar amp; Co. are virtually assured of a semi-final berth, and they would be looking to consolidate their position.         
	The Super Kings, on the other hand, need to win three more ties from the remaining five league matches to have hopes of reaching the semis. Consistent batting has ensured the sides win in seven out of eight matches so far, the only loss coming against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	MIs morale is high and their confidence can be judged from the fact that they have benched Sri Lankan legend Sanath Jayasuriya, and are yet to use the talented South African Jean-Paul Duminy.                 
	The Super Kings, meanwhile, have been boosted by the arrival of Australian imports Michael Hussey and Doug Bollinger. While Hussey is yet to make his first appearance, Bollingers pace was instrumental in their win over the Royals. To use Hussey, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will have to drop either Matthew Hayden or Albie Morkel.         
	Dhonis own form, however, is a cause for concern. He has not quite lived up to the expectations. There is also a question mark over his fitness, which has only compounded Dhonis troubles.         
	Mumbai Indians have a clear edge as their top-order batsmen have been doing well. Sachin considers Chepauk as one of his favourite venues, and going by his form, fans can expect something special from him. He had led from the front in the teams first meeting with an elegant 72.

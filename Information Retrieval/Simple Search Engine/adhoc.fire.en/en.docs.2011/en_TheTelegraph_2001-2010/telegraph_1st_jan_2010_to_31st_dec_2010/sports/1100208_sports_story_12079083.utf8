The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tough draw for Italy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tough draw for Italy
                      
	Warsaw: Defending champions Spain will have the Czech Republic and Scotland among its rivals in what should be a straightforward qualifying route to the 2012 European Championship, while World Cup winners Italy got a tougher draw.         
	Lithuania and Liechtenstein completed Group I in Sundays draw, meaning Spain, the top-ranked team in the world, will not have to face any side that qualified for this years World Cup in South Africa.         
	Spain coach Vicente del Bosque, whose team was the last to be picked, said he was relatively pleased with the draw and that Spain was in a five-team group.         
	Its true that these teams did not qualify for the World Cup but we cannot be sure because there are no differences in football today. Liechtenstein appears easy, but we have to take care against the other three, he said.         
	Germany, the runners-up to Spain in 2008 and three-time champion, was placed with Turkey and neighbouring Austria in Group A.         
	The tournament will be played in four Polish cities  Warsaw, Gdanks, Poznan and Wroclaw  and four Ukrainian venues  Kiev, Kharkov, Lvov and Donetsk. Kiev will stage the final.

	Guwahati: The Indian team Sunday gave the post-match press conference a miss as stand-in skipper Gautam Gambhir left the Nehru Stadium immediately after the teams 40-run win over New Zealand, in the first of the five-match ODI series.         
	Gambhir, who is leading the team for the first time in Mahendra Singh Dhonis absence, left the stadium after the post-match presentation citing personal reasons.         
	Post-match conference is mandatory as per the International Cricket Councils protocol.         
	While losing captain Ross Taylor spoke to the media, Gambhir was conspicuous by his absence.         
	A blame game between the Assam Cricket Association (ACA) and Indian teams support staff followed.         
	Team support staff Mayank Parikh, when contacted, blamed the ACA authorities and said: We were waiting in the dressing room after the presentation got over, but the local media manager (from ACA) did not approach us.         
	ACA general secretary, Bikash Barua, however, claimed that the Indian team did not want to speak to the media. Just after the press conference, I personally contacted Gambhir who said there will be no India press conference as the team would leave soon, Barua said.         
	However, Gambhir and Virat Kohli, who bagged the Man of the Match award for his century, spoke at the post-match presentation ceremony.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Gambhir: We knew that we needed to have wickets in hand and had to bat the first 10 overs carefully. Its a great feeling to start with a win. Everyone chipped in Virat was good, Yuvraj, too, did well. Ashwin bowled well and so did the others. I am happy with our overall performance. However, I am taking one game at a time.         
	Kohli: It feels good I want to make the most of my good form. I was focussing on holding one end and let others do their bit. I am converting more singles and doubles these days. Its good to score runs and help your team post a good total on the board.

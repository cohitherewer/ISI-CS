The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Speed questions Pawars dedication
                                                                                                                       7                                      Speed questions Pawars dedication
                      
	Melbourne: If John Howard was rejected for inexperience then even Sharad Pawar does not qualify to be the International Cricket Council (ICC) president as he knows little about cricket administration, said former ICC CEO Malcolm Speed describing the snub to the ex-Australian Prime Minister a disgrace.         
	Rest assured, he (Howard) was not rejected because of his lack of experience as a cricket administrator, his strong opposition to Robert Mugabes disastrous regime in Zimbabwe or his outspoken views about Muttiah Muralidharans controversial bowling action. There is more to it than that, Speed wrote in a column for an Australian daily.         
	Speed said Pawar, who will head the ICC until 2012 starting Thursday, would not even be available full-time as he is a serving Union minister in the Indian government.         
	The man who is to be the next ICC president, Sharad Pawar, is the Minister for Agriculture in the Indian government  a serious full-time job, feeding 1.2 billion people. He is a good and fair man but he will be working part-time as ICC president and, take it from me, he knows little about cricket administration, Speed said.         
	The Australian claimed that Pawar spent little time in the ICC meetings he attended in the past.         
	Speed said Australia and New Zealand, who jointly nominated Howard, should now refuse to put up an alternate candidate as has been asked by the ICC.         
	The decision of the ICC members to reject the nomination of John Howard by the cricket Boards of Australia and New Zealand is a disgrace and an insult to both countries.         
	So where to now? Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket should refuse to put forward another nominee. Under the rotation system, it is then the turn of Pakistan and Bangladesh, Speed said.         
	To conclude, let me make a prediction. The ICC head office moved from London to Dubai in 2005. Howards rejection is a clear sign that the ICC will be based in Mumbai by 2012, he added.         
	Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) refused to blame India for Howards rejection.         
	In any business model where a company has 75 per cent of the income, its not an ideal model, CA chairman Jack Clarke said.         
	But that is not Indias fault they do that... Its a powerful bloc but its a reality of life, he added. (PTI)

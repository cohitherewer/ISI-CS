            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: With Midnight Coup expected to be a doubtful starter, trainer Arti Doctors Thundering Hooves may easily have the measure of his two rivals vying for the 1,200m Brave Dancer Cup, on Thursday. By the terms of the race, the China Visit son is sitting pretty at the weights and with jockey Christopher Alford in the saddle, the winning chances of Thundering Hooves appear to be rosy.          
	Alford may also guide Credit Swap to victory in the Supreme Choice Plate. The three-year-old badly needed his last run.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahroofs five does India in
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mahroofs five does India in
                      
	Dambulla: Sunk by Farvez Mahroofs sensational hattrick, India slumped to a morale-shattering seven-wicket defeat against defending champions Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup cricket tournament here Tuesday.         
	Mahroof (five for 42), with his hattrick in the 39th over, was the architect of Indias batting collapse as the visitors were shot out for 209 in 42.3 overs. After being comfortably placed at 189 for four in the 38th over, it was Mahroof who changed the course of the match in a span of three deliveries, dismissing Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar and Zaheer Khan for a first ball duck.         
	Kumar Sangakkara (73) and Mahela Jayawardene (53 not out) produced 104 runs for the third wicket to steer Sri Lanka to an all-win record in the league with bonus points to boot.         
	With their confidence pepped up after yet another Indian conquest, Sri Lanka, who garnered 14 points from three consecutive wins, can seek to upstage Dhonis men in the all-important final on Thursday.         
	Given the ball in the 39th over, 25-year old Mahroof trapped Jadeja right in front of the wickets off the first ball and then castled Praveen with the second. With the crowd rooting for him, Mahroof had Zaheer caught brilliantly by a diving Sangakkara to complete a hattrick. He became the third Lankan to achieve the feat.

                            Dipendu nets the Md. Sp. winner
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Dipendu Biswas goal from a penalty in the first half was all Mohammedan Sporting could manage against George Telegraph at a CFL match here, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Monday. The David Mkandawire-led side completed their quota of CFL matches and finished with 30 points with a chance to finish fourth if Chirag United, who are on 28, fail to win their last match.         
	Mohammedan Sporting played well in patches throughout this years league and at one stage ran into a series of defeats before restoring normalcy. It was Satyajit Boses probing run into George Telegraphs defence that got Mohammedan Sporting the penalty when he was wrongfully brought down inside the box.         
	The teams lone goal-scorer, on Monday, Dipendu Biswas, said: It would have been better if we could have finished third in the league table... Had we got the points against Kalighat and Aryan, it could have turned the momentum for us.

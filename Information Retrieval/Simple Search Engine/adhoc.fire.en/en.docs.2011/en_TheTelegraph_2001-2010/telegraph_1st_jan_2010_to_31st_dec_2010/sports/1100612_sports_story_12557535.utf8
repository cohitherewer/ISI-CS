	Pedigree counts, always. And so, on Saturday, in Johannesburgs Ellis Park, Argentina will be the favourites against Nigeria. Big teams like Brazil, Italy, Germany, Argentina have this special quality of changing their style according to the game. And thats why even with the chips down, these teams manage to pull through.        
	But if you think the Lionel Messis will have a stroll in the park, you are mistaken. Nigeria are no pushovers as they showed during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where they beat teams like Brazil and Argentina to win gold.        
	They may have failed to take that performance to the World Cup, but this time, since its being played in their continent, the Nwankwo Kanus would be looking to make up for past failures. And, on Saturday in front of a crowd that will be urging them on, the Super Eagles will be very determined.        
	The Nigerians are physically superior to the Argentines and so Diego Maradona will be hoping the referee protects his players. The Argentines also have this tendency of losing their cool and if a yellow card here or a red card there happens it could prove very costly in the long run.        
	There is a growing doubt about Argentinas chances at this World Cup after the not-so-impressive show in the qualifiers. I must say that their qualifying form should not be the basis to judge them. Maradona, at that time, was very new and the players were not acquainted with his ideas. But now they appear at home with Diego and that augurs well for Argentina.         
	Then, they have the best player in the world at the moment. People are saying this World Cup will be his, but I have a feeling that Messi will be heavily marked. The Nigerians will not yield an inch to this little magician and thats for sure. During the Champions League semi-final between Inter Milan and Barcelona, Messi was hardly given any room. I am sure all the 31 coaches must have watched the way Mourinho organised the defence and made notes. Im sure Super Eagles coach Lars Lagerback will definitely have a plan to thwart the Argentine.        
	A lot of people ask me what position I think Messi should play in. Should he play as centre-forward or take on a more withdrawn role?         
	I think he should play a little from behind, which allows him to have more touches on the ball. More the touches, merrier the case for Argentina.         
	Maradona might have little experience in coaching but you cant ignore his footballing brain. His love for the national shirt is unquestionable and that would further inspire his boys. Maradonas zeal to excel on the biggest stage will enable him to extract the best from his players.         
	I watched him closely at the Salt Lake Stadium during his visit to Calcutta in December 2008. Even an exhibition match excited him and, on at least three occasions, he jumped from his seat during build-ups. And when I saw him diving in the rain after victory over Uruguay, I was not surprised. The first 30 minutes will decide which way the match will go. Argentina would most definitely go for an early goal to ease the opening nerves. But if they dont, then? It will be interesting to see how they adapt and regroup.        
	Sixteen years back in the US, Maradona played his last match in the World Cup. The rivals were the Super Eagles. Now, on June 12, 2010, and against the same opponents, he sits in the dugout for his first World Cup match as a coach.         
	Destiny, what else.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Momentum is most important: Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                      Momentum is most important: Sachin
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Saturday said that he had an open mind when it came to preparing for the 2011 World Cup.         
	 Tendulkar said that there was nothing pre-determined in his decision to skip the one-day tri-series on the tour of Sri Lanka as well the one against Australia at home recently.         
	The 37-year-old said he was not concerned that he might be short of match practice in the 50-over format when the quadrennial showpiece will be held in February-April next year in the subcontinent.         
	In the same vein, he hinted that he had not yet decided about skipping the forthcoming five-match ODI series against New Zealand.         
	I have been playing cricket for a long time now. If that had not been the case then there is something to think about, the world record holder for most runs in both Tests and ODIs said.         
	I know how to adjust my game. If there is anything needed to be done for the World Cup, I will do accordingly.         
	In both the series (in Sri Lanka and against Australia), the decision was taken at the last moment. It was not pre-determined. I was carrying my coloured pads in the kit bag.         
	I know about my body and how to take care of it. To talk about the coming series is too early. Its tough to say.         
	The World Cup is the one trophy that is missing from Tendulkars over-flowing cupboard. The upcoming edition, from February 19 to April 2, will be Tendulkars sixth.         
	If 2003 saw Tendulkar standing beside the coveted trophy with moistened eyes, India having lost to Australia in the final, the next campaign in the Caribbean ended in a disaster, the team getting knocked out in the first round under the coaching of Greg Chappell.         
	Tendulkar, however, refused to talk about Indias preparation for the World Cup.         
	There is a lot of cricket to be played before that. Momentum is the most important thing, so at the moment we have to focus on the New Zealand series, he said.         
	 Asked if India, who drubbed Australia 2-0 in the Tests and won the only ODI played after inclement weather washed out the remaining two, were peaking at the right time, Tendulkar said: I believe in action, not talking. Lets keep our fingers crossed.         
	He also described the recent whitewash of Australia in the Test series as unbelievable and praised the winning knock by V.V.S. Laxman in Mohali in the opener, that India won by one wicket, as terrific.         
	It was extremely important. Against Australia, its always special. We have players, who have done terrific things against them. To win 2-0 was unbelievable... Especially winning from a tough position in the first Test. Laxman played a terrific innings. Ishant played well too, he said.         
	Tendulkar was upset when asked whether it was a case of Australias standard coming down or that of Indias going up in recent years. I dont know why when we play well people look at it the other way. The team has to be given credit, thats something the players have worked for, he said.         
	He was curt when the age-old question of his nervous 90s came up once again. If thats been the case then I wouldnt have got 95 centuries.

	Johannesburg: South Africa all-rounder Jacques Kallis had a close shave Tuesday morning when he banged his car against the gate of a house in Wynberg, a suburb in the south of Cape Town.         
	However, the all-rounder was not hurt in the accident and will be available for selection for the Boxing Day Test. He has no injuries at all and is totally fine, Mohammed Moosajee, South Africas team manager, said.         
	Kallis was on his way home post midnight when he drove his Audi R8 into the gate of the house damaging the front side of his car.         
	It was a freak, minor accident and there was nothing untoward about the manner in which it happened, Moosajee said. It was learnt from Kallis agent that he wasnt over-speeding. There is a dent on the front of the car but besides that, its fine, Moosajee said, adding: The insurance will sort all the details out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need specialist coaches: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Need specialist coaches: Dhoni
  - Rest is important for Sachin, says captain             Mahendra Singh Dhoni at a press conference in Mumbai on Friday                           
	Mumbai: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Friday said that the team is missing bowling and fielding coaches, resulting in an increased workload for chief coach Gary Kirsten.         
	Talking to the media on the eve of the teams departure for the tri-series and Test series in Bangladesh, Dhoni said that Kirsten had his plate full and the team was indeed missing bowling and fielding coaches.         
	To some extent, it does affect the team. You need specialist coaches to get the best out of the players. Gary looks after so many things. He has all those team meetings, talking to batsmen, bowlers and then working out strategies. He has a lot on his plate, Dhoni said.         
	It does help to have specialist bowling and fielding coaches. But thats the way it is and its now an administrative issue, he said.         
	Both the posts are lying vacant since the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sacked bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad and fielding coach Robin Singh in October after the team fared poorly in the Twenty20 World Cup in England and the Champions Trophy in South Africa.         
	Even though the BCCI roped in Australian Mike Young for a short stint during the recent Twenty20 and ODI series against Sri Lanka, the team is now again without a fielding coach.         
	Accepting the need to lift the teams fielding standard, Dhoni said: We dropped quite a few catches in the last series. We will try to rectify that. We will try to make the good fielders in our side the best in the world because it really helps, especially in the middle overs, with four good fielders inside the circle who can save the singles, he said.         
	Dhoni was also candid enough to admit that the bowlers were grappling with issues like bowling at death and slow over-rate, for which the India captain served a two-match ban during the ODI series against the Lankans.         
	Regarding the over-rate, we have a lot of part-timers, who are mostly spinners and they can save us time. We have (Virender) Sehwag, Yuvraj (Singh), (Suresh) Raina and Rohit Sharma as well. So if we can save time up front, it is not going to be an issue, Dhoni explained.         
	Looking ahead, Dhoni said India would play 8-9 Tests this year and this was a sufficient figure. The exact schedule has not been fixed but after everything is fixed up, we may end up playing eight or nine Tests matches which are sufficient, said Dhoni.         
	The Indian team will be without Sachin Tendulkar in the tri-series. On that Dhoni said: We will miss Sachin. You want him in the dressing room in every match. But at the same time, its important to give him rest, he said.         
	Dhoni said he himself was feeling great but would not hesitate to skip a series if he felt he needed a break. I love playing, Thats the way I have played unless I feel that if I go and play, I might get injured. That was one reason why I opted out of the Test series we played in Sri Lanka, Dhoni said. I dont think my body needs rest right now. But as the season goes ahead, I will definitely have a look at it. I dont think my fingers have fully recovered from the Kanpur Test. But apart from that its pretty good, he said.         
	He also welcomed the return of Rohit Sharma, describing the Mumbai batsman as a very talented player who needed to be given a fixed slot in the batting order.

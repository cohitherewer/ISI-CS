The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gurung is making waves
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gurung is making waves
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: After the high of training with Chelsea, albeit briefly, the idea of playing for a just-promoted Indian club might not have been really pleasing but Anil Gurung decided to grab the opportunity and he is not regretting it.         
	At first it was a bit of a dampener.         
	But every player gets only one chance and I didnt want to let this go, Gurung, the 22-year-old Lajong FC striker from Nepal, said on Wednesday.         
	Gurung joined the Northeast club only from the sixth round of the I-League and has actually played only two full games.         
	He has scored a goal each in the I-League and the Federation Cup but has already been marked as special.         
	He is very good in the air. He is really fast and thats what helped us against Dempo and Churchill Brothers, coach Stanley Rozario said of the striker.         
	The opportunity at Chelsea came in the form of appearing for trials last summer, but it did not translate into a contract for the same reason that thwarted Sunil Chetris chances with Queens Park Rangers.

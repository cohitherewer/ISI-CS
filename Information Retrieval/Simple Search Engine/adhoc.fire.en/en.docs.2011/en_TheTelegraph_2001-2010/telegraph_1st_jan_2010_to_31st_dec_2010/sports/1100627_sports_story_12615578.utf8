The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Old mate is floored by   Maradona
                                                                                                                       7                                      Old mate is floored by   Maradona
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT    
	Pretoria: For a World Cup shorn of entertainment, and as many argue, quality, Diego Maradona continues to be the biggest entertainer.         
	Not surprisingly, his press conferences are the best attended and arguably the worlds greatest footballer has by now made it a habit of pulling a rabbit out of his hat every time he meets newspersons.         
	During his first interaction at the Loftus Versfeld stadium, he had everyone stunned because of his sudden, out of the blue, criticism of Pele, while the last one at Polokwane made interesting news when he launched a vicious attack on Fifa and the referees.         
	On Saturday, there was yet another surprise in store. When the Fifa media officer was about to start the question-answer session, the Argentine coach suddenly got up from his seat and was seen jostling through journalists in the packed room to embrace his former Napoli teammate, Salvatore Bagni, who was standing behind. The security personnel were totally stunned and didnt know how to react.         
	Bagni, currently in South Africa to cover the World Cup as a journalist, was himself taken aback by Maradonas warm gesture. I never thought he would break through the barrier to greet me, said the former World Cupper from Italy.         
	I know him for years but has always failed to understand him, Bagni said at the end of the meet. He has always something to surprise you. He was a great player and a lovely teammate.         
	It took some time, and a desperate appeal for discipline from the media officer that Maradona got down to business. Apart from the match against Mexico on Sunday, the icon also spoke on the game in general.         
	Three back-to-back wins have already earned him a place among the great coaches, who did well in the World Cup but Maradona was not convinced.         
	I dont think so. Its the players who play and make the difference. The coaches can only guide. I dont think I am doing anything better than that, he said, modestly.         
	Yes, I have the advantage of being someone who has played in four World Cups. I know how it works, he pointed out.         
	Maradona, once again, was extremely protective of his squad. They are a great team, waiting to do great things. When we played badly, we were called disastrous and worst ever. Now the same boys have become demigods, they are being described great and excellent. The funny part is that those who criticised the players, never returned to apologise to them. This is one thing that upsets me. I think people should be honest in their approach, he said.

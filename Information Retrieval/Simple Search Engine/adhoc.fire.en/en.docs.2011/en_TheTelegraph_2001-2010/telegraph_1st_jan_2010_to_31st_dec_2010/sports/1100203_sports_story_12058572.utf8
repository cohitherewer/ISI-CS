	Bhopal: Olympian Aslam Sher Khan said Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi should request Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to manage the affairs of the national game what with the mess in Indian hockey showing no signs of clearing up.         
	Soon after independence, Jawaharlal Nehru made J.R.D. Tata the first president of the Indian Hockey Federation and he held that post for 10 years. Similarly, Rahul can persuade Shah Rukh to take charge of Hockey India, Sher Khan said.         
	Were the superstar to be associated with hockey, the game would get a big boost. His name would be enough to help the national game, he said.         
	The former Congress MP said hockey lost out to cricket in terms of popularity after the 1983 World Cup triumph in England. (PTI)

  - A Telegraph exclusive 
        Sunil Gavaskar reveals more about the fabulous 1985 World Championship of Cricket triumph in the concluding part of his conversation with Lokendra Pratap Sahi                                               Sunil Gavaskar      
	The West Indies, you feel, wouldve been more dangerous opponents (in the March 10, 1985, WCC final)...         
	A Yes, for the West Indies, it would have been a repeat of sorts of the 1983 World Cup final and they would have been fired up. Meeting Pakistan was a lot better.         
	What did the team do on the eve of the final?         
	Nothing much really... I think some of us went to somebodys house for a meal. By then, the players knew lots of people, so some of the others went out on their own.         
	Team meeting?         
	We had begun the practice of having the team meeting (in the dressing room) just before the warm-ups on match days... The logic being that the strategy and tactics would then probably be more effective, certainly more fresh in the players minds... The warm-ups, in those days, wouldnt be strenuous.         
	But would the playing XI also be made known just before the warm-ups?         
	It would be pretty much decided before that. We had an unchanged team for the first four matches and it was assumed that it would remain unchanged in the final as well.         
	So, it wasnt an issue of a player not having the time to prepare himself mentally...         
	No, because everybody knew who was playing and who was not... But for the fact that (Roger) Binny woke up with fever on the morning of the final, he would have played. In that case, we would have played with the same XI throughout.         
	What did you tell your players in the team meeting at the MCG?         
	That we had come all this way (not to lose)... That we had been unbeaten... That we had the experience of playing a big final... That we had won the World Cup less than two years earlier... That we had a team which was good in all departments... That kind of stuff was spoken. The team, in any case, was charged up... So, I do not think I or even (Erapalli) Prasanna, the manager, had to say anything specific.         
	Did you have an interaction with Javed Miandad, the Pakistan captain, or with senior pro Imran Khan in the lead up to the final?         
	The previous day, there had been a photo session of the two captains with the trophy and Javed, being Javed, was already saying that it (the trophy) would look very good in the office of the Pakistan Cricket Board. I had to remind him that 24 hours or so still remained for the final.         
	Miandads response?         
	(Laughs) Well, he was trying to be one-up and that was really it. Not that I was going to fall for anything from him.         
	What did the two of you tell each other at the toss?         
	The toss! The toss was the highlight... Channel 9 had started this thing of the television presenter interviewing the captains, like it is done now. For some strange reason, Ian Chappell (the presenter) was late and Javed and I were waiting with the cameraman at the centre of the pitch... While chatting, we decided to give the guys a bit of a heart attack... So, I pretended to toss the coin and Javed pretended to pick it up... We shook hands, spoke to each other and started to walk off towards the dressing room. The panic among the crew and officials was to be seen to be believed. At the same time, we could see Ian making his way from the other side... The moment he saw the toss, he started to break into a bit of a jog... So, it was that kind of a spirit (between the captains), it was very light... And, then, Ian came and asked what did you do... Almost gave me a heart attack.         
	Memories of the final...         
	The Siva (Laxman Sivaramakrishnan) delivery which got rid of Javed... Was an absolute beauty... Also, the way Kapil Dev got the opening batsmen (Mudassar Nazar, Ramiz Raja)... The bowling of Chetan Sharma as well... Everybody contributed, with Jimmy (Mohinder Amarnath), too, bowling a very good spell... Very little freedom was given to the Pakistanis. We were, in fact, in such a situation that Pakistan were nine down with about 35 minutes remaining for the interval. The last thing I wanted was for the last wicket to fall before the half-an-hour business. Because, then, we would have had to play maybe four or five overs and they would have gone flat out. I didnt want that to happen. I remember actually giving Chetan the ball and, when he started to mark his run-up, I sort of pretended to scratch my head... After he had marked his run-up, I said hang on a minute and I called, I think, (Ravi) Shastri to bowl that over. That took up two-three minutes, by which time it was well past that half-an-hour stipulation. There was no chance of us batting before the break. Unfortunately, we could not take the last wicket and Pakistan finished on 176 for nine... That was the only time in the tournament we had not dismissed the opposition.         
	Surely, before the final got underway, you wouldve settled for having to chase under 180...         
	Oh, absolutely. Anything under 200... That we dismissed Pakistan for within 180 was even better.         
	Did you inform teammates that youd be quitting as captain?         
	No...         
	Was there another team meeting, so to say, on how to go about chasing 177?         
	No.         
	So, what did you tell the players?         
	I did not say a word... (Laughing, after a pause) I noticed Imran really piling up his plate and, if you remember, he had been caught behind but was given not out... Fair enough, he did not walk, but he had a very good partnership with Javed, otherwise maybe they would have been dismissed for even less. Seeing what he had piled on his plate, I said Immy, what is happening? He probably had it in his mind that he had not walked and, so, replied but you dont expect me to walk in a final... I said no, I am not worried about that, I am worried about how you are going to bowl after this... He responded by saying I need not worry... As it turned out, Imran bowled flat out and had obviously been getting more energy for himself!         
	What was it like after the winning run had been hit?         
	It was an incredible moment. We were all in the dressing room and were jumping... Champagne had been arranged and people were spraying the bubbly on each other... There was a lot of screaming and shouting, as you would expect.         
	Your own emotions?         
	Look, the overriding feeling was that the boys had given me a fantastic gift on my last day as captain. It was, clearly, the most memorable gift I could get.         
	Do you recall anything in particular before you went for the presentation?         
	There was a bit of discussion as to who would get the Audi... Mudassar was in the running... (Krishnamachari) Srikkanth, Kapil and Shastri were in the running from our team... Most were pretty certain that Shastri would get it.         
	Did you, at least, take your teammates into confidence while walking to the podium?         
	I didnt, because the emotions were really about winning the tournament. It was only when I collected the trophy did I realise that, hey, I had decided to step down as captain.         
	Were you, even briefly, tempted to review your decision?         
	Not at all. I was convinced it was a fantastic way to go out.         
	How would you compare the 1983 celebrations, in London, with the one in 1985...         
	It was definitely bigger in 1983... Do not forget it was the World Cup and fans had travelled from all over to see us. Of course, the WCC was huge as well, but...         
	What did you all do after the presentation?         
	(Laughs) We decided to take a ride on the Audi... Shastri had never driven a car with automatic gears and, on getting behind the wheel, did not know how to get the Audi moving! I had some experience, having been provided with an automatic transmission car by Somerset and, so, I helped out Shastri... I advised him not to press the accelerator too hard otherwise one of our guys would get run over.         
	Once back in the dressing room, what happened?         
	Again, a lot of champagne was sprayed and people were screaming their guts out. I was probably the last to leave the dressing room and, as you know, the (Hilton) hotel is across the MCG.         
	How did teammates react to your decision?         
	All came and shook hands with me at the ground itself... The exercise, I think, got repeated in the dressing room.         
	Did anybody request you to reconsider?         
	No.         
	Twenty-five years down the line, what do you think that win signified?         
	Restored self-belief... Because, after the 1983 World Cup, we had lost to the West Indies in all the one-day matches... We had been beaten by England... The WCC victory made us believe that we could win anywhere.         
	The last one: On getting back to your hotel room, did you reflect on your innings as the India captain?         
	I was very tired, it was very late... It was well past midnight... All I wanted to do was to get into my pyjamas and go to sleep!         
	 Concluded

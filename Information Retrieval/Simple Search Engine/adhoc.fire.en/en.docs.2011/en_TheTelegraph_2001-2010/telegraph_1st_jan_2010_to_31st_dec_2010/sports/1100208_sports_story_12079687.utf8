The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Amla lesson for India 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Amla lesson for India 
            SUDIPTO GUPTA            Hashim Amla on way to his unbeaten 253 in Nagpur, on Sunday                           
	Nagpur: If February 7, 2010 could be as fruitful for bowlers as was November 7, 2008! The venue was the same and that, too, was the second day of a Test  the last one in the series against Australia.         
	After the Indians had dominated the first day, a then unknown entity by the name of Jason Krejza snared five wickets in 26 balls to halt the march of the hosts.         
	Alas! History, on Sunday, was in no mood to repeat itself as South Africa sent India on the leather hunt, before declaring at 558 for six on the second day of the first Test for the Jaypee Infratech Cup, in neighbouring Jamtha.         
	At close, Mahendra Singh Dhonis men were 25 without loss after four overs. Gautam Gambhir (12 not out) and Virender Sehwag (9 not out) were at the wicket. But the stage, quite clearly, is set for the bowlers, at least the tweakers, to make the batsmen dance to their tune.         
	Unfortunately, from Indias point of view, a soft-spoken South African tuned his innings to such perfection that Mahendra Singh Dhoni amp; Co., by the end of the day, appeared clueless.         
	Hashim Amla, resuming at his overnight score of 115, remained unbeaten on 253, his first double century. Studded with 22 boundaries, his 675-minute stay at the wicket ensured Graeme Smith a good nights sleep, and robbed Dhoni of that.         
	After his overnight partner, Jacques Kallis, was dismissed for 173, it was imperative for the visitors that Amla held fort. He did.         
	However, had Murali Vijay held on to a sitter at forward short-leg when Amla was on 149, things could have been different. Also, in the very next delivery, an attempted glance kissed the edge of the bat and Dhoni failed to glove a difficult chance down the leg side.         
	On a track that offered considerable turn, along with occasional bounce, the Indian spinners were disappointing. Amit Mishra (0/140), however, was unlucky to miss the edge on a number of occasions in spite of doing everything right. Harbhajan Singh (2/166), by his standards, was as bland as a delicious dish without salt.         
	The umpires, too, denied the Indians a few leg before appeals, which looked good.         
	The day started with expectations  while for Dhoni and Co. wickets were the most sought after commodity, the Proteas, most certainly, were praying for the longevity of Kallis and Amla at the crease. Neither side could complement their hopes with appropriate action.         
	India managed just one wicket in the pre-lunch session as Kallis walked back to the pavilion lasting 61 balls on the day. His rich list of 34 Test centuries from 229 innings could have been wealthier had there been a double hundred beside his name.         
	With Sundays miss, the South African all-rounder is now second to Mike Atherton in the list of most innings played without scoring a double century. The former England captain heads the list, having played 235 innings.         
	Kallis, having survived a strong leg before appeal off Mishra, succumbed to one from Harbhajan that spun sharply. The bounce surprised him as the bat-pad catch was pouched by Vijay at forward short-leg. His 419-minute stay comprised 15 boundaries and two sixes.         
	Kalliss fall saw AB de Villiers walk in. The talented right-hander played the accelerators role, notching up 53 runs in 88 balls.         
	The Indian middle-order must have taken note of the resilience by the visitors middle-order. That might be of help.

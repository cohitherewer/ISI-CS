The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Best win was in Sharjah: Sangakkara
                                                                                                                       7                                        Best win was in Sharjah: Sangakkara
  - Victory boosted team, says SL captain             Mahendra Singh Dhoni, in Dambulla, on Monday                           
	Dambulla: Sri Lanka might have handed India their biggest ODI defeat, in terms of balls to spare, on Sunday, but captain Kumar Sangakkara feels that Lankas best victory against the Indians came way back in the year 2000, in Sharjah.         
	In the Coca Cola Champions Trophy in October, 2000, India, chasing Sri Lankas 300-run target, were bowled out for a meagre 54 to register their lowest ODI score and Sangakkara said it was the most memorable win for his team against the Indians.         
	The best win against India, I guess, was in Sharjah, very early in my career. We got 299 and India were 54 all out. So that was a great win and that was a great side, the left-handed batsman said after Sri Lanka defeated India by eight wickets, with 209 balls to spare, in a tri-series tie on Sunday.         
	The eight-wicket defeat was Indias biggest in terms of balls to spare, surpassing the loss to Australia, in Sydney, in 1981, in which the Aussies romped home with 174 balls to spare.         
	However, Sangakkara said Sundays win was a huge confidence booster for his side.         
	Some of our greats have retired and so such a win is great for our confidence. It showed that we still can do things like this. But the key is to win matches consistently, Sangakkara said.         
	Asked about the opponents he will prefer in the final, the captain said: We have no preference on whom to play in the finals. If you start talking about the preferences, I think mentally again we are trying to align ourselves one way.

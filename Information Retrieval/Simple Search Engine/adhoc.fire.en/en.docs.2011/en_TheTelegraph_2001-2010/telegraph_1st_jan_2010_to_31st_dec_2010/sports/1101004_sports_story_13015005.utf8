	Calcutta: Though the city is gripped by the spirit of the upcoming festive season, passengers walking out of the Calcutta airport on Sunday evening were stunned by a different kind of celebration altogether. It seemed like carnival time for East Bengal supporters, who had gathered in hundreds, to welcome their stars.         
	Having claimed their second consecutive and seventh Federation Cup title by defeating arch rivals Mohun Bagan, the Red and Gold brigade got a heros welcome when they arrived from Cuttack on Sunday.         
	From vuvuzelas to fireworks, foot-tapping songs to ceaseless flag waving, the airport premises turned into a cauldron of fanatic East Bengal supporters. The frenzy increased every passing minute, and with the players gradually trooping out of the airport one-by one, the cacophony reached a deafening crescendo.         
	The players looked an elated bunch, but such was the level of celebration that most of them preferred to disappear before being mobbed.         
	Newly appointed East Bengal coach, Trevor Morgan, seemed speechless at the wild jubilation that engulfed him. Morgan, who took over the reigns in July, was quick to realise the love for the sport the city has, when he said: I wasnt really prepared for such a reception. It shows how important it is to be consistent in winning such big tournaments. I am overwhelmed.         
	The Federation Cup was the first major assignment for the former Hull City assistant coach, and he came out with flying colours. It was colours indeed, as red and gold vermilion was sprayed all over, Morgan, too, being smeared with it.         
	East Bengal reached the Fed Cup final undefeated and pulled off a stunning win in a high-voltage final on Saturday.         
	The defending champions have been in good form, with the likes of Penn Orji and Tolgay Ozebe proving talismanic. Morgan knows the importance of winning, and, while a CFL Premier Division clash against Mohun Bagan awaits his men on October 9, the Englishman signed off saying: I am happy with my teams performance. I am not unduly worried about any other team.

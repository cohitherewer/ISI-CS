The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC to look into DRS row
                                                                                                                       7                                      ICC to look into DRS row
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will look into the controversial application of the Decision Review System (DRS) in the fourth Test between South Africa and England at the Wanderers and will ensure a full and comprehensive investigation is carried out.         
	England complained after television umpire Daryl Harper did not overturn a not out decision against South Africa skipper Graeme Smith Friday.         
	Smith had appeared to edge a ball to the wicketkeeper but was not given out by the umpire  a decision upheld after a referral.         
	England claimed that Harper had not had the volume turned up on his replay monitor, so missing what they claimed was an audible nick.         
	We have received a letter of complaint from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and we will launch a formal investigation into the exact circumstances surrounding the application of the Decision Review System after completion of the Johannesburg Test match, said ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat in a statement on Saturday.         
	There is a large amount of controversy, speculation and potentially unfair criticism circulating at present so it is important to establish the exact facts before reaching any final conclusions, Lorgat added.         
	Earlier Saturday, Match Referee Roshan Mahanama defended Harper.         
	Mahanama denied telling England coach Andy Flower that Harper had failed to adjust the volume of an audio feed from the stump microphone.         
	If the audio level had been increased above its optimum level, distortion on the audio feed would have occurred and the feed might not have given a clear indication of the true sound, Mahanama said.         
	It should be kept in mind that the TV umpires sometimes receive feeds which are at a different level to what others are receiving for the simple fact that various broadcasters at times use different technologies while televising a match and the Johannesburg Test is a case in point, he added.

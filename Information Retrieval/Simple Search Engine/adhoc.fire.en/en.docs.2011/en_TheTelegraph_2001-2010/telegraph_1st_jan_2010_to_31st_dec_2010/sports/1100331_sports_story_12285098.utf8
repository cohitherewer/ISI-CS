The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mumbai Indians win a thriller
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mumbai Indians win a thriller
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Mumbai Indians faced a test of their character for the first time this season and came out in flying colours with a thrilling four-wicket win over the Kings XI Punjab at the Brabourne Stadium on Tuesday.         
	Lasith Malingas fiery spell (four for 22) helped the Mumbai Indians reduce Kings XI Punjab to 163 but the early dismissal of Sachin Tendulkar seemed to put the pressure on the hosts middle-order.         
	But the depth in the home teams batting came to the fore at the right time. If it was Saurabh Tiwary (31 off 23) who provided the necessary firepower, R. Sathish (17 not out) kept his nerves in the closing stages to take them home with three balls to spare.         
	Of course, Shikhar Dhawan gave the early momentum with an entertaining 50, but the Delhi lads inexperience saw him gift his wicket away at the crucial juncture and give a foot in the door for Mahela Jayawardenes men.         
	Unfortunately for Jayawardene, his side lacked a strike bowler. Brett Lee was far below his best, both in terms of form and fitness, and his 2.4 overs cost 24 runs. Also, the teams misfields in the closing overs cost them dear.         
	The result meant Tendulkars team strengthened their position at the top with 12 points and the Mohali franchise remained at the bottom following their sixth loss from seven matches.         
	The foundation for Mumbai Indians win was laid by the bowler with a slingshot action.         
	Malinga first deceived Manvinder Bisla with a slower one. Then he returned to snuff out any chance of fight back the visitors might have nurtured by picking three wickets in four balls.         
	He consumed Irfan Pathan with his variation of pace before unleashing an express delivery that broke through the defence of Shaun Marsh.         
	On a hattrick when he resumed the 18th over, Malinga very nearly had it once Vikramjeet Goel was beaten by a quicker one that missed the off-stump by a whisker. But the Sri Lankan had his man the very next ball with another searing yorker that clattered the middle and off stumps.         
	The only phase of the Kings XI Punjab innings when there seemed to be some impetus in the batting was when Marsh (57) and Jayawardene (20) were at the crease.         
	But their partnership was cut short when it was just blossoming. The duo had put together 49 runs when the Sri Lankan batsman was run out. Dhawan was in imperious form from the outset. Tendulkar (11) fell cheaply, holing out to long on while trying to take on Chawla.         
	The Mumbai Indians captain, however, overtook Jacques Kallis to become the highest scorer in the tournament and wrest the Orange Cap. While Sachin has 314 runs in seven matches, the Royal Challengers Bangalore all-rounder has 310 from six games.         
	Kieron Pollard was in good touch, punching Vikramjeet Malik through point and lofting Chawla over long off. Then the West Indian played an ambitious shot to Pathan and Bopara took a well-judged catch at the long-on boundary.         
	Dhawans dismissal brought the spring back on the visitors heels. With 31 needed from 18 balls, Tiwary attempted a pull off Srivastava and the edge somehow sailed over the straight boundary. Bopara conceded 13 in the next over but consumed Tiwary off his last ball, leaving six needed from as many balls.         
	After Harbhajan took a single off Lees first ball, Sathish picked two twos to tie the scores. The Australian then delivered a wide to send the crowd into raptures.

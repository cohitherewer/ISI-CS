The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | KP: England will profit from IPL
                                                                                                                       7                                        KP: England will profit from IPL
  - Batsman to share Indian experience in Twenty20 with national teammates       Nick Hoult            Kevin Pietersen                                 
	These are strange times for Kevin Pietersen. Normally a place in the first team is guaranteed for the worlds most expensive cricketer, but Pietersen finds himself in the unusual position of being an Ordinary Joe in the Indian Premier League as his team, Bangalore, use him as a squad player.         
	Perhaps the greatest sign of the levels now expected in the IPL arrived when Pietersens reward for a Man of the Match performance against Kings XI Punjab, when he scored 66, was being dropped for the next match. Forget the $1.5million contract. KP has to fight for his place.         
	I was surprised and it is frustrating sitting here and watching, he said on Tuesday. But they have got a lot of talent and missing out is the nature of the beast. When you get out here the thing is to take your chance. As far as English cricket is concerned the good thing is that myself, Colly [Paul Collingwood] and Morgan are out here and can take the knowledge of playing in the IPL back to the England dressing room.         
	And there is the crux of the matter as far as KP is concerned. The IPL is employing only eight English cricketers and the two bowlers, Dimitri Mascarenhas and Graham Napier, have managed just one appearance between them. There has been little home success for ITVs audience to cheer (except Pietersen, who scored a match-winning 62 against the Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday).         
	It is very disappointing for us that bowlers are not here, Pietersen said.         
	I spoke to Colly last week when we played Delhi and we agreed it would help for our bowlers to be out here learning about the game. The difficulty in England is that when the IPL came around it was all about money, money, money, but it has actually gone on to be a world-class tournament and we have missed the boat. The guys should put their names in the hat and find a way into this set-up because they can only get better by playing out here.         
	The problem is, English players do not attract buyers because they are available only for a short period. Graeme Swann, the world No. 2 in the Test rankings, did not attract one bid at the last IPL auction.         
	The more you play the better you become, so for us all to be available for the full six weeks of the IPL, like most of the other countries, would be really good, Pietersen added.         
	Englands World Twenty20 campaign begins on May 3 against West Indies and five members of their squad are honing their skills in the games shortest format during the IPL. Sadly, not one has stamped his mark on the tournament and only Michael Lumb appears to be a regular for his team, especially after hitting 83 off 43 balls for the Rajasthan Royals against Punjab last week.         
	Collingwood has also shown that English players may have learned a hard edge, smashing seven sixes in an innings of 75 against Pietersens side, but Owais Shah, Ravi Bopara and Morgan have failed to hold on to first-team places while Napier has been a net bowler for Mumbai.         
	Lumb will open the batting for England in the Caribbean next month alongside Craig Kieswetter, with Pietersen set to continue at No. 3, his favoured position in Twenty20 cricket. I am not surprised he [Lumb] has done well, Pietersen said. He has excelled at getting good starts. The difference is, he now finishes the job.         
	The IPL has been good fun and there has definitely been a learning curve over the last few weeks and, yes, I will be sharing that knowledge with the England dressing room when I get back.         
	So there it is. If England win the World Twenty20, the seeds of success were sown from the IPL sidelines.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

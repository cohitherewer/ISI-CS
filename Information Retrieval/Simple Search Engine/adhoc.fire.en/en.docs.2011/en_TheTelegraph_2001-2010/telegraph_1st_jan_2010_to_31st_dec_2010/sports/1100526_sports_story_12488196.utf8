The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modi wants independent probe panel
                                                                                                                       7                                      Modi wants independent probe panel
                      
	New Delhi: Suspended IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi Tuesday asked BCCI president Shashank Manohar and secretary N. Srinivasan to stay away from the decision-making process and let an independent panel decide his fate.         
	Explaining the reasons for his request, Modi said: (The requests) are not motivated by any personal grudge but with the sole intention that whatever is the outcome of the present proceedings, the process leading to such decision should be fair and proper, thereby rendering the same unimpeachable.         
	Facing charges of financial irregularities that include allegations of bid-rigging and proxy investment, Modi explained why he wanted Manohar to stay out of the decision-making process.         
	... I am constrained to prefer the present application for your kind consideration that you may consider recusing yourself from participating any further in the proceedings relating to complaint and show cause notice as your participation in the proceedings would tantamount to being a judge, witness and a potential co-notice in these very proceedings, Modi said.         
	He went on to say that he had refused to accept Rendezvous Sports Worlds bid for Kochi franchise since it came late and claimed that Manohar decided to cancel the first bid process after the incident.         
	I declined to accept the same, saying it was beyond time. You, however, asked me to accept the bid...You seemed to be under extreme pressure to ensure that the late bid be included in the bidding process.         
	Calling Srinivasan instrumental in sponsoring complaints against him, Modi said he would like to cross-examine him in the enquiry. Modi said Srinivasan would have an axe to grind against him for various reasons.         
	Modi alleged Srinivasan had handpicked umpires from Chennai to oversee CSK matches. This constituted a clear attempt at umpire fixing/match-fixing. Upon my coming to know of this I objected to the same and removed them in the interest of the League, Modi said.

            A STAFF REPORTER            Saurabh Tiwary                           
	Calcutta: No Bengal player has managed to find a berth in the Rest of India squad that will take on Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai in the Irani Trophy, in Jaipur, from October 1.         
	The squad for the two-Test series also has no representation from Bengal.         
	The squad, led by Yuvraj Singh, includes Jharkhands Saurabh Tiwary.         
	In fact, Tiwary is the only representative from East Zone to feature in the side.         
	Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda have all been considered for A tours in the recent past, but their performances have been unable to enthuse the national selectors.         
	Theres no doubt that the upcoming Ranji Trophy season will be a big challenge for the youngsters.

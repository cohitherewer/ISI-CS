            A STAFF REPORTER            Harmeet Kahlon at the Tollygunge Club on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mukesh Kumar and Harmeet Kahlon turned in identical scores of five-under 65 to be the joint leaders after the first round of the Aircel-PGTI Players Championship presented by Tollygunge Club.         
	Manav Jaini of the Delhi Golf Club had a hole-in-one in his effort of 67 that currently places him at tied third along with M Dharma, Amardip Sinh Malik, Vinod Kumar, Pradeep Kumar and Kolkatas Raju Ali Mollah.         
	Harmeet Kahlon, found himself at the top of the leaderboard thanks to his magnificent chipping and putting. He chipped to within a few feet for comfortable birdie putts on the 10th and 13th. Kahlon then sank monstrous putts from 30 feet, 36 feet and 18 feet for birdies on the 16th, second and third respectively.         
	A chip to within six inches earned him another birdie on the seventh. The 39-year-old closed with a bogey on the ninth.         
	Kahlon said: I excelled at my short game today. I chipped and putted really well. In fact, I sank two birdie putts that were over 30 feet. One needs to hit it close and straight on this course and must take advantage of the par five holes. I made birdies on all the three par five holes today.         
	Mukesh Kumar, like Kahlon, also fired six birdies and a lone bogey in his round one effort. Mukesh used the pitching wedge and lob wedge to great effect as he rarely left himself a long putt. He also holed a tough 15 feet birdie putt on the seventh.         
	Mukesh said: I read the greens to perfection today. The emphasis was on good placing rather than attacking the pins.         
	Local player Feroz Ali Mollah, Digvijay Singh and Randhir Singh Ghotra are tied ninth at two under 68.

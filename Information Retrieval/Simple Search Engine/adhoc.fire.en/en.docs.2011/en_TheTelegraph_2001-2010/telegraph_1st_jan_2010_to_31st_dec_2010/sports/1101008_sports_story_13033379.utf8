	City giants East Bengal have organised a clash between Bayern Munich All Stars XI and East Bengal All Stars XI in Calcutta for the J.C. Guha Centenary Trophy, on November 17.       
	For erstwhile German greats like Gerd Mueller, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Lothar Matthaeus, Giovane Elber, who are expected to be a part of the Bayern squad, this would be the first match on Indian soil.      
	Both Mueller and Rummenigge, however, have visited India accompanying the Bayern juniors squad and for the academy in Burdwan, about a year and a half ago.      
	Both teams will have some of the greatest names playing for them, East Bengal assistant secretary Shantiranjan Dasgupta said.      
	He further added, The purpose of the match is completely charitable. The proceeds generated shall be donated for the benefit of street children.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Juhi just wants a gift from Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The mood behind the Kolkata Knight Riders mission in the third edition of the Indian Premier League, which unleashes on March 12, was well described by coach Dav Whatmore a few days back  This is a very serious season for us.         
	Co-owner Juhi Chawla, on Friday, added an extra flavour of expectations to that mood as she revealed that she would want only one gift from the man-in-charge of the Knights, Sourav Ganguly  the champions trophy.         
	Speaking at a promotional marking the tie-up between the KKR and McDowells No. 1, the Bollywood star said: I would want just one thing from Dada Just one gift We want to be the champions this time!         
	Reflecting on the sorry performance of the Knights last year, where they finished at the bottom, Juhi said: Last year I couldnt make it to South Africa except for one match. But I saw them on the television And I cried. We lost there and lost badly.         
	She also hinted at the off-the-field controversies which plagued the team in the last edition as one of the possible reasons for their failure.         
	It is a team game and we are like a family. If there are differences within the family, how can you go out and give your best? If you are not happy, how can you make others happy? she questioned.         
	She also spoke of changes, within and around the team, and was optimistic that it would do the trick for the beleaguered Knights.         
	There are, at times, some minor changes required for the overall well-being of the team. Its nothing more than a case of a round peg in a square hole or vice versa. Those little adjustments help in fine tuning the side, she said.         
	Juhi further added: Like we felt that the colour (black) of the KKR jersey was not right and so we changed it this time. At the same time, we dont think that there is any complain about our theme song and everyone likes it So, we are not changing it.         
	Before signing off (quite literally as she signed a good luck campaign for the KKR), Juhi, however, didnt forget to mention that the team would also require some help from lady luck to achieve their goal.         
	Last time, may be we were unlucky in some close situations. This time we have some very capable persons who are looking after the team. So, with some luck and support I hope that we will surely do well this year.         
	Time will say if lady luck pays heed to the prayers of this lady.

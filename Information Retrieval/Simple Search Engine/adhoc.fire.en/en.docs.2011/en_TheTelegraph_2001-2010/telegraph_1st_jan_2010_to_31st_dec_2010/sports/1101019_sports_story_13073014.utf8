	London: Real Madrid and AC Milan, the two most successful clubs in the history of the European Cup, will go head to head at the Santiago Bernabeu in this weeks showcase match of the Champions League on Tuesday.         
	In the standout match of the competition so far, nine-time winner Madrid look to maintain their perfect record in group G on Tuesday and pull five points clear of Milan, who have lifted the trophy seven times and have a better recent record in Europe than their opponent.         
	 Both teams boast some of the most entertaining players in the sport and Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas acknowledges the eyes of the world will be trained on one of footballs glitziest matches. (Its) a classic, one of those games every player wants to play and every fan wants to see, the Spain captain said.         
	Madrid havent gone further than the last 16 in six seasons but look in ideal shape to end that barren run under new coach Jose Mourinho, who led Inter Milan to Champions League success last year. The Spanish giants have beaten Ajax and Auxerre in their opening two matches and are in fine form domestically, a 4-1 win at Malaga putting them provisionally top of the Spanish league before.         
	In Cristiano Ronaldo, Madrid have Spains leading scorer with six goals and a player who can lead the club back to their previous heights in Europe. The Portugal forward scored twice against Malaga and set up both of Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuains goals in a scintillating performance that followed reports in the Spanish press that Ronaldo had been concerned about his early-season form.         
	I never said I was anxious to score, Ronaldo said. I have simply tried to work, so that things go well for the team and I knew it was a matter of time before my goals came.         
	Milan are also in good form, a 3-1 win at home to Genoa courtesy of a brace from Alexandre Pato and a late strike by Robinho putting the team second in the Serie A table. Massimo Allegris side have picked up four points in the Champions League from two matches.         
	Brazil center back Thiago Silva should be available despite sustaining a calf injury against Genoa. Full back Sergio Ramos should return from injury for Madrid. The groups other match sees four-time tournament winner Ajax host Auxerre.         
	Chelsea return to the ground for the first time since losing to Manchester United on penalties in the 2008 Champions League final.         
	The top two teams in group H, Arsenal and Shakhtar Donetsk, clash at the Emirates stadium, group B leader Lyon are at home to Benfica and Bayern Munich look to make it three wins from three in group E when they host Cluj.         
	Eduardo scored twice for Arsenal in last seasons Champions League but the Croatia striker was moved on to the Ukrainian champion to make way for Marouane Chamakh after three years in north London.         
	Even before the draw was made, I dreamed of playing against Arsenal and playing in front of the fans again at the Emirates, Eduardo said.         
	 But the striker doesnt expect to be the key figure in a meeting between teams that have won their two opening group matches. Whoever wins the battle in the center of the field will win the game, Eduardo said. We believe that Shakhtar with our enormous home support can defeat them, while in London the task will be much harder.         
	And Arsenal could have the edge in that central battle. Jack Wilshere is suspended for three Premier League matches after a red card in Saturdays 21 Premier League win over Birmingham but is free to play the Ukrainian side at the Emirates Stadium.         
	FK Partizan entertain SC Braga in the groups other game, with both clubs chasing their first points. Braga are one of six newcomers to the Uefa Champions League proper.

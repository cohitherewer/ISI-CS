  - Subratas men aim for full points against Air India       A STAFF REPORTER            Chirag Uniteds Chika Wali (left) and Junior Elijah, at the Central Park, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Chirag United will like to get back to winning ways when they take on Air India, in a third round I-League match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, here, on Saturday.         
	Chirag lost to Salgaocar 3-4 in their last match but, on Saturday, they would like to take advantage of the fact that they are playing at home. The teams expected to make one change  K. Asif coming in place of Lalkamal Bhowmick.         
	However, Chirags main problem have been their defence. Our defence has not been performing. They are making silly mistakes and that led to the four goals we conceded against Salgaocar.         
	But, I am not tinkering with the back four at this moment. I am sure they will perform well against Air India. They just need a little bit of confidence, coach Subrata Bhattacharya said after a practice session, on Friday.         
	Upfront, Chirag hope the combination of Junior Elijah and Joshimar will deliver the goods with Denson Devadas chipping in from the midfield.         
	Denson has been a revelation this season and his exploits played a key role in Chirags Durand Cup success.         
	We are playing well. We got a winning start and then, against Salgaocar, poor refereeing did us in. We should get full points against Air India, Denson said on Friday.         
	Air India, on the other hand, have more reasons to worry for not having registered a win yet. Further agonising is the fact that they were unable to prevail over lowly-placed Viva Kerala at home.         
	According to coach Yousuf Ansari, Injuries to four of our key players dented our prospects. Besides, we have registered only one foreigner so far in Yousuf Ibrahim. We are up against a side that have overturned the a team like East Bengal earlier this season.         
	Air India in fact roped in Eduardo Chachon at the start of the season but the Brazilian defender got injured and hasnt yet made a comeback.         
	Ansari is banking heavily on former India international Manjit Singh upfront.         
	We are in the process of rebuilding the team. And we will have Nepal striker Anil Gurung from the next round, the former India goalkeeper claimed.         
	The kick-off is at 1.45 p.m.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spin future worries Laxman 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Spin future worries Laxman 
                      
	New Delhi: Senior Team India pro VVS Laxman is worried with Indias dwindling spin resource and doesnt see a quality tweaker in the horizon.         
	Laxman said apart from those who have already made their India debut, the spin cupboard is bare in domestic cricket, which is a worry for the team.         
	The Indian cricket team is struggling to find some quality spinners, apart from the guys who are playing.         
	You will find that there is no bench strength as far as spinners are concerned. So definitely the quality of domestic cricket has come down in terms of the bowling department, Laxman told a website.         
	I am really not happy with the bowlers I am seeing. I think the quality of bowlers, especially the spinners, will definitely be a worrying factor for the Indian team, he said.         
	In contrast, he felt there was no such worry with the batting. He tipped Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma for a bright future ahead and also saw promise in Ambati Rayadu.         
	I think Rohit and Raina are very good. Ambati Rayadu from Hyderabad has got very good potential, he said.         
	Its good that he has come back now, after playing in the ICL. Its just a matter of time; if he plays to his potential then he will make it to the higher grade. Rahul Dravid keeps mentioning about some players from Bangalore who are very talented. So it is a good future for India, as far as batting is concerned, Laxman said.         
	Despite the growing popularity of Twenty20, Laxman said Test cricket was still a sought-after format, even among young cricketers.         
	Test cricket is still a very important form of cricket for all cricketers.         
	Even though Tests are becoming fewer, all cricketers, even the present generation, want to play more Tests. Everyone knows Test cricket remains the real test of a players character, skill and temperament.         
	Irrespective of how many runs they get in Twenty20 or one-day cricket, everyone feels that only when they do well in Tests will they have a stature in the game. Everyone knows that their ultimate reputation is in Test cricket, he said.         
	Rather than Tests, he felt, one-day cricket might concede some ground to Twenty20.         
	I think one-day cricket will be under threat, because people want to watch good quality of cricket. Over five days they will watch some quality players playing against each other, so definitely Test cricket will stay.         
	But one-day cricket will be under pressure, especially after the advent of Twenty20, he added.           (PTI)

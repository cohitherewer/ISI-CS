The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Real to go all out vs Lyon
                                                                                                                       7                                      Real to go all out vs Lyon
                      
	Madrid: Real Madrids high-price squad will be trying to avoid their sixth straight early exit from the Champions League when they face Lyon on Wednesday in the second leg of the first knockout round.         
	Madrid, which spent more than euro250 million on new players in the offseason, have high expectations for this season with the final to be played at their home stadium.         
	Lyon beat Madrid 1-0 in the first leg and need only a draw to advance and join Juventus, Arsenal, Bayern Munich, AS Roma and Liverpool as teams to have knocked Madrid out of the competition following the group stage.         
	Real Madrid, with all of the signings it has made this year and knowing that the final is being played in the Bernabeu, has to give 100 percent for the game, Madrid playmaker Jose Maria Guti Gutierrez said. It would be a disaster if we were knocked out by a rival like Lyon, who are good but not among Europes great clubs.         
	Madrids poor performance at Stade Gerland has been forgotten following a morale-boosting 3-2 league win over Sevilla on Saturday, where the Spanish powerhouse rallied from a two-goal deficit.         
	Im sure the team is going to advance, Madrid winger Cristiano Ronaldo said. Were going to do everything we can from the first to the last minute.         
	Of Madrids new signings, Ronaldo and Kaka are sure to start, while coach Manuel Pellegrini is likely to go with striker Gonzalo Higuain over Karim Benzema, who is just returning from a groin injury. Xabi Alonso is suspended, as is fellow midfielder Marcelo. Guti returns after missing the first leg, as does midfielder Rafael Van der Vaart, who scored the injury-time winner against Sevilla.         
	Madrid have won all but one of their 17 home games this season  a 2-3 loss to AC Milan in the group stage.         
	Lyon, third in France, will be without Brazilian midfielder Michel Bastos but remain hopeful that striker Lisandro Lopez (foot) and Aly Cissokho (ankle) will be ready.

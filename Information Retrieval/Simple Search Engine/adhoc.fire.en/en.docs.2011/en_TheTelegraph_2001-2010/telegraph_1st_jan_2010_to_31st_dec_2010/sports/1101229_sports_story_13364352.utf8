  - Jacques Kallis is the key man for both sides              LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Durban: Its advantage India, as the India Year comes to a close, at Kingsmead.         
	Requiring 303 to seal the three-match series, South Africa were 111 for three when play was called off on Tuesday.         
	As two days remain, time isnt a factor in the second Test. The wicket is also playing rather well. In fact, the easterly wind has helped flatten the track. But, from South Africas perspective, big wickets have gone.         
	Now, its more about holding nerve and the key man, for both teams, is Jacques Kallis. The hosts definitely want him to be there for as long as possible; Indias priority is to quickly see his back.         
	That chance came and went in a split second when Kallis hadnt even opened his account. It would have been a different story had Cheteshwar Pujara not dropped him, off Harbhajan Singh. South Africa had then been on a precarious 86 for three.         
	Of course were confident of bowling out South Africa... The boys are pumped up, manager Ranjib Biswal insisted. Down 0-1, its clearly a great opportunity.         
	Paul Harris, the left-arm spinner, felt that while captain Graeme Smiths departure was a big moment, their confidence hadnt taken a beating. This partnership (Kallis and AB de Villiers) is crucial... 99 per cent of the time weve come out on top in crunch situations...         
	South Africa did chase 300-plus here, against Australia, eight years ago, but that bit of history isnt useful beyond a point.         
	The third day was nowhere as dramatic as Day II, with half the number of wickets (nine) falling, but it was fiercely contested. It had the intensity one expects when the top teams are fighting to concede as little as possible.         
	Dale Steyn was fast and furious, but powered by another V.V.S. Laxman classic (96 in 281 minutes, 171 balls, 12x4), Indias second innings stretched to 228.         
	If Laxman and Pujara had halted South Africas push, late on Monday, Laxman and Zaheer Khan (struck on the helmet by Steyn) put on 70 for the eighth wicket, a partnership which may eventually make the difference.         
	No mug with the bat, Zaheer got past 1,000 runs in Tests during his innings of 27.         
	Zaheer was more aggressive than I was! As Ive said, our tail does take pride in its batting, Laxman remarked.         
	Perfectly understandably, he conceded to being disappointed on missing a hundred by just four runs. Its disappointing, yes, because Id never got one in South Africa...         
	Laxman again had a back problem, but shutting out pain is never an issue for him. If anything, he proved to be a massive pain for South Africa and earned high praise from Graeme Pollock, one of the legends of world cricket.         
	Typically, Laxman was himself modest. Doing well for the team is the only motivation for me... We wanted to post a decent total, so that the bowlers would have a good target...         
	If Laxman showed character, for the umpteenth time, Smith was found wanting. He got into a spat with Sreesanth and soon got out, making one believe that he came off a poor second in that showdown.         
	Should the visitors win, Smith will have much explaining to do. Even if the provocation came from Sreesanth, seen by many as the enfant terrible of Indian cricket, Smith had no business escalating it.         
	Obviously, he forgot that South Africas battle is with India, not Sreesanth, and his dismissal (63 for one) hurt the teams momentum. Had Kallis not been dropped, it wouldve been 80-20 in Indias favour.         
	I expect Harbhajan to play a big role... Hes been exploiting the bounce well, is what Pollock told The Telegraph.         
	Incidentally, 2010 has been the India Year in South Africa, commemorating 150 years of the Indians arrival in this country.         
	An Indian win, that too in Durban, would be an emotional happening for so many in South Africa as well.         
	Footnote: There was a downpour around 8.30 pm local time, but its to be seen whether any damage is caused.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cant keep Modi out forever: Bindra
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cant keep Modi out forever: Bindra
                      
	Chandigarh: The former chairman and commissioner of IPL Lalit Modi has yet again found support from former BCCI and current Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) president I. S. Bindra.         
	I have never believed that anyone can be marginalised for ever. Everyone is bound to make a comeback, Bindra told reporters Thursday.         
	Bindra cited Jagmohan Dalmiyas example, who was once the biggest enemy of the Board and was cleared off all charges during the AGM in Mumbai Wednesday.         
	My friend Mr Dalmiya is back. So you cant say that you can keep someone out forever, he said.         
	Bindra and BCCI treasurer M. P. Pandove, who is also the secretary of the PCA, clarified that despite BCCI removing Modi from all important posts, he will remain PCAs vice-president.         
	The BCCI is investigating all charges against Modi. As far as PCA is concerned, he remains one of our vice-presidents, Pandove said.         
	Meanwhile, Bindra played down the issue of former India captain Sunil Gavaskar not being retained in the IPL governing council.         
	Sunil is not a part of the board. As a PCA president, I am a part of the board. Sunil has freedom of expression and accordingly he has said that he is surprised, Bindra said.         
	The PCA will felicitate ICC president Sharad Pawar on Sunday.           (PTI)

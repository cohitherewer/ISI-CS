                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiwarys tell different tales
  - While Saurabh prospers for Mumbai, Manoj struggles for the Knights
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: They share a common surname, but thats about the only similarity between them.         
	Saurabh and Manoj Tiwary play for different teams, have contrasting batting styles, and their performance graphs  personal and their teams  in IPL III has gone in opposite directions.         
	Everybody knows we have made mistakes. Hopefully, we will rectify that quickly, Manoj Tiwary told The Telegraph a day after the Kolkata Knight Riders seven-wicket loss to the Mumbai Indians.         
	Tiwary said he was aware that the runs needed to flow, from his bat as well as that of his teammates.         
	We need to score big runs. We need to put more than 160 on the board. Thats a minimum in Indian conditions. And we need to have a good strike-rate as well. Momentum is very important in this format, the 24-year-old said on Tuesday.         
	The Bengal batsman found himself left out in the cold against the Mumbai side after the experiment to send him as opener flopped. His scores in four outings read 0, 50, 8 and 11.         
	Obviously, nobody wants to be dropped. But whatever the team decides, I have to take it as a professional , he said.         
	His namesake in the Mumbai Indians team, on the other hand, has been making waves. It feels good. IPL is a good platform, everybody takes notice when you do well here, Saurabh, four years younger to the Bengal player, said.         
	That oft-mentioned aspect of the IPL, youngsters gaining from rubbing shoulders with international stars, is very much visible in the Jharkhand lads game.         
	The Indian captain, too, played in the Plate group. If you perform, you will be noticed, the player nicknamed Bhim said about his performances in the Ranji Trophy going unnoticed.         
	Despite hailing from the same state as Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Tiwary so far has had few opportunities to interact with the Team India skipper. But that has been more than made up for by the chance to share the dressing room with none other than the worlds leading run-getter.         
	Sachin (Tendulkar) never criticises. He generally talks about the game and batting. Even in the last match (against KKR), he just told me that in that situation I shouldnt have given away my wicket, Tiwary said.         
	Despite his successTiwary has not forgotten the significance of Test cricket. Its the player who does well in all the formats that succeeds. Test cricket has not lost its craze amongst us (youngsters). We still want to play and do well in Tests, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Charl Langeveldt and Ajit Agarkar, both recuperating from injuries, went through an optional practice session under the guidance of Andrew Leipus and Vijay Dahiya.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bat or ball, Sehwag in the thick of it all at the Oval
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bat or ball, Sehwag in the thick of it all at the Oval
    - Chance for India to force the issue and level series             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Virender Sehwag                                 
	Colombo: First with the bat and, then, with the ball.         
	The Virender Sehwag show at the P. Sara Oval continued for the second day running, Thursday, giving Team India a reasonable chance of winning the final Test and squaring the three-match series.         
	It was, in many ways, an excellent day for the visitors, even though Sachin Tendulkar fell in the first over and Sehwag didnt script a big hundred.         
	He does, usually.         
	The pluses, indeed, were many: V.V.S. Laxman and Suresh Raina starred in a 105-run partnership for the fifth-wicket, with both getting 50s; Abhimanyu Mithun and Amit Mishra got 40s; then Sehwag jolted the hosts with quick blows.         
	Mithun had a 41 in the only innings involving India at the SSC. He followed that up with 46, packed with correct strokes. The 20-year-old has the potential to emerge an all-rounder and, if hes consistent, then the balance of the XI would change dramatically.         
	For the second time in as many innings, India did better than Sri Lanka. A lead of 11 may seem insignificant, but by reaching 436, some 53 minutes before the scheduled close on Day III, India threw the Test wide open.         
	At stumps, delayed yet again, Sri Lanka were 45 for two, in urgent need of major repairs. Both Tharanga Paranavitana and Tillekaratne Dilshan fell to smart catches off Sehwag.         
	We need to bat well for one day, tomorrow (Friday)... If we do, the cards will be with us, the Sri Lanka captain, Kumar Sangakkara, told The Telegraph at the Taj Samudra.         
	Being 1-0 ahead in the Micromax Cup, Sri Lanka can afford to play for a draw, but the wicket is expected to aid the spinners even more. Turn, bounce... Its all there.         
	Look, how we go about the last two days will really be dictated by how we bat in our second innings, Sangakkara, fastest to 8,000 Test runs (a feat he wasnt aware of till informed by this Reporter), pointed out.         
	Dilshan was of the opinion that chasing even 250 on the last day, Saturday, would be difficult. Grinning, he added: But you never know if Sehwags at the wicket... He makes such a difference.         
	Sehwag himself said: Ive been very lucky to score a hundred (his 21st) and take two wickets... Hopefully, we will do well tomorrow also and win this Test...         
	He continued: Weve been following the process, bowling in good areas and getting help from the wicket... If we get Mahela (Jayawardene) and Sanga out early, then we will be in the game...         
	In a different context, talking of the challenges when faced with teasing bowling and fields which may frustrate, Sehwag quipped: I dont play boring cricket!         
	Of course not, Viru.         
	It wasnt long ago that former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi, known to shock and awe, called Sehwag our best off-spinner. In this series, at least, hes been proved right.         
	However, it was many hours after getting out for 109 (194 minutes, 105 deliveries, 19x4), trying to clear the cover region, that Sehwag had to get into the act with the ball.         
	Sachin had been the first to go, chasing one from Malinga miles from his off-stump. Actually, it was a shocker. Sehwag followed soon enough, but Laxman and Raina, representing different generations, held firm.         
	It made for rather compelling viewing.         
	Raina had been under pressure to justify the faith shown in him by captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten and he did his future no harm (62 in 113 minutes, 111 deliveries, 10x4).         
	As with Sachin and Sehwag, Laxman and Raina departed in quick succession. Mithun and Mishra (who got a life very early), though, collaborated 64 for the eighth-wicket, leaving Sangakkara flustered.         
	Not much later, Sri Lankas 425 got overhauled. A bigger lead could have been forced, but for two poor decisions from Rod Tucker.         
	Mishra, incidentally, was put down by Angelo Mathews. On Day II, hed dropped Sehwag...         
	Sri Lanka had a disappointing finish to the day, but a yummy cake awaited the Sangakkaras at the hotel.         
	The occasion? The captain joining the 8,000-club; Malinga taking his 100th wicket (Sachin, no less); Ajantha Mendis becoming the quickest, from Sri Lanka, to 50 victims.         
	Malinga had been generous with the bouncers and the failure to pick him early led to Dhoni and a couple of the tailenders being hit.         
	Pitching the ball short, the slinger explained, had been part of his strategy. He finished with three for 119, a wicket less than Suraj Randiv.         
	Footnote: Barring Ravichandran Ashwin and Saurabh Tiwary, whore travelling from Australia, the other ODI specialists have arrived for the tri-series.

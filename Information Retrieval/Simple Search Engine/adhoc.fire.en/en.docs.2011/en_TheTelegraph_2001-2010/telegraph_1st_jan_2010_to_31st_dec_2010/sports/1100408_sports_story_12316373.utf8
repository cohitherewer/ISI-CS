The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nehra remains in dugout
                                                                                                                       7                                        Nehra remains in dugout
  - National selectors don't have an update on the left-arm seamer's fitness       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ashish Nehra                                 
	Calcutta: Ashish Nehras case seems to be getting curious by the day. The Delhi DareDevils have played 10 matches in IPL III, but the left-arm quick is yet to make an appearance.         
	Please ask the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and not us, pleaded one of the senior national selectors, when asked by The Telegraph whether he or his colleagues had an update on Nehra.         
	Nehra, it may be recalled, was picked for the soon-to-begin World T20 after the selectors were informed by the BCCI that hed recovered from an injury, which has never been adequately explained.         
	Apparently, Nehra hurt himself in the ribs during a pre-IPL camp in Mohali.         
	Given the key role Nehra is expected to play, in the West Indies, theres reason enough for concern. Its baffling, of course, that Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co. are in the dark.         
	No BCCI official was available for a comment till late on Wednesday, but its interesting to note that the parent body hadnt been amused when Nehra and DareDevils captain Gautam Gambhir went off to Sri Lanka, at the franchises expense, for ayurvedic treatment.         
	Gambhir is back in action, but the Nehra issue remains rather clouded. Its strange, after all, that the Pradeep Sangwans are getting preferred while Nehras in the dugout.         
	Hopefully, the picture will become clear sooner rather than later.

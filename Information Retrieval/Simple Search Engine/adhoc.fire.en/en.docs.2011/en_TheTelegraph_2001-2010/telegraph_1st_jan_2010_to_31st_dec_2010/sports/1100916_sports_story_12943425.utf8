The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Decision draws divided opinion
                                                                                                                       7                                        Decision draws divided opinion
            A STAFF REPORTER            Laxmi Ratan Shukla                           
	Calcutta: Theres no stopping the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) in its endeavour to bring the glitter back in Bengal cricket.         
	After the praise-worthy move of roping in the high-profile Dav Whatmore for the development of junior cricket, the CAB, on Tuesday, decided to do away with draws (as a result) in local league matches. But unlike the first one, the second decision has evoked mixed reactions from the cricket fraternity.         
	For players like Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Ranadeb Bose, the move will propel Bengal cricket in the right direction.         
	Having results in matches always enhances the standard of game. The competition that comes into the fray when you can either win or lose a match, drives the players to give in that extra bit. I personally think that this is a praiseworthy move, said Shukla.         
	Ranadeb echoed Shukla and supported the move. This is an excellent decision In fact, I think that such a decision should have been taken 10 years back. Players will be more motivated to give their best when they know that they are playing for a win, he said.         
	Asked about the criticism of the decision in some quarters, the most successful Bengal bowler in the last few seasons said: I certainly dont agree with those who feel that its a negative approach. Earlier, a lot of the smaller clubs used to play for draws.         
	However, there are people who begs to differ. Saradindu Pal, an official of the Kumartuli Club, said: It is a very one-sided decision and will only help the bigger clubs.         
	Another CAB official, on condition of anonymity, went a step further. If the basic idea behind the decision is to check match-fixing, then it is absurd, the official said.         
	But Chitrak Mitra, a former CAB joint secretary and an official of the Bhowanipore Club, gave a thumbs up to the move. Theres nothing to be surprised with the move. In the past too there used to be no draws It was only introduced some 20 years back         
	Only time will decide the winner and loser of this debate. But no draws please!

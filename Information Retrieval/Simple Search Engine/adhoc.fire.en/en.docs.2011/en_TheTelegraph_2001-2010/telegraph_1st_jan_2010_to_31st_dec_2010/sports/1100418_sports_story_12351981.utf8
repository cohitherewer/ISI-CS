The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina makes exit
                                                                                                                       7                                        Saina makes exit
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Saina Nehwal                           
	New Delhi: It was a disappointing Saturday for the home crowd at the Siri Fort Sports Complex, here, as Saina Nehwal crashed to qualifier Li Xuerui in the semi-final of the Yonex Sunrise Badminton Asia Championships.         
	Pitted against the rookie Chinese, top seed Saina was expected to have a smooth passage to the final but the Indian star committed too many unforced errors to lose 17-21, 11-21.         
	She (Li) played much better than me. It was not my day, admitted Saina after the match. I was not there today. She employed the right tactics and she was faster than me. Her drops also came close to the net and my returns were very poor, said Saina after the demoralising defeat.         
	Li, on the other hand, should be credited for pulling off the stunning win against her fancied rival. Almost a non-entity till the start of the Championships, Lis victory was yet another confirmation of Chinese domination in the world of badminton.         
	Four of the eight semi-final places in the mens and womens singles in the ongoing meet went to Chinese players and three of them are relatively newcomers to the international arena. Both the Chinese girls in the final came through the qualifiers as they did not have enough ranking points and still proved good enough to beat the best players in the tournament.         
	Lis opponent in the final will be Liu Xin, who got the better of second seed Zhou Mi of Hong Kong 23-21, 21-17 earlier in the day.         
	Playing against Saina, the Chinese girl showed no sign of nerve and held the lead throughout the encounter except for a brief period in the first game.         
	Saina was able to offer some resistance till the midway through the first game when the score was 15-all. Once Saina took a 16-15 lead, Li came up with an array of attacking shots to leave her Indian rival stranded.         
	In the mens semi-finals, second seed Lin Dan overcame Boonsak Ponsana of Thailand 22-20, 21-10 to set up an all-Chinese final against Wang Zhengming, who beat Japans Kenichi Tago 21-14, 19-21.

	Bridgetown: South Africa rode on cameos from AB de Villiers (47) and Albie Morkel (40) to post a competitive 170 for four against New Zealand in a group E Super Eight stage match of the World Twenty20 here Thursday.         
	De Villiers played a sensible 39-ball unbeaten innings while Albie Morkel bulldozed the South African attack to all parts of the ground to pile up 72 runs off just 38 balls for the fourth wicket.         
	Albie Morkel hit as many as five sixes  three of Southees in the 19th over  during his 18-ball stay, while de Villiers decorated his innings with a boundary and two lofty hits over the fence. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahela sets up Lanka victory

	Georgetown: Mahela Jayawardene struck a scintillating century as Sri Lanka thumped Zimbabwe by 14 runs via the Duckworth-Lewis method in a rain-marred Group B match to brighten their Super Eight prospects in the World Twenty20 match here Monday.         
	Beaten by New Zealand in their previous outing, a win was imperative for the Lankans who rode on Jayawardenes masterly 64-ball 100  fourth century in the short history of Twenty20 Internationals  to post 173 for seven.         
	Zimbabwes chase ran into a rain-interruption after the first over from Ajantha Mendis. Play did resume after 66 minutes with the minnows chasing a revised victory target of 104 runs from 11 overs, but another weather-disruption greeted them four overs later when they were 29 for one.         
	The Duckworth-Lewis method was invoked and Zimbabwe were found 14 runs behind their opponents.         
	Zimbabwe have little time to recover as they return here Tuesday to face New Zealand.         
	Earlier, the Lankan innings turned out to be a one man show with only three batsmen reaching double digit figures and Thissara Pereras 23 being the second highest score.         
	The defeat against New Zealand had pushed the Lankans to the brink of disaster and there was no way they could underestimate giant-killer Zimbabwe who have humbled Australia and Pakistan in warm-up matches.         
	Jayawardenes demeanour, however, betrayed no signs of any trouble whatsoever as the right-hander took the rival attack by the scruff of its neck once Kumar Sangakkara won the toss and decided to bat.         
	It was such a graceful knock that it stood out amid the violence that this format usually brings in batsmen. Perhaps its his economy of movement and the languid flow of his bat that catches the eye. It was assumed that the ball would stop on the batsmen, and that timing would be difficult to find. It appeared so when the likes of Kumar Sangakkara and the rest batted. Not when Jayawardene took strike.         
	There was a delicious six hit on the up over extra cover. He was walking down the track to the medium pace of Elton Chigumbura but kept his head still and balance perfect. Chigumbura shortened his length to try and upset the balance but Jayawardene wafted his wand through the line and the ball soared over the extra-cover boundary.         
	Jayawardene flowed right from the start, collecting three boundaries in the first over from Chris Mpofu: A cut, a gorgeous on-the-up six over long off and a whiplash on-drive.         
	He repeatedly drove the seamers through the off side and there was even a deft upper cut to a slow bouncer from Chigumbura, but he treated the spinners with more respect. He looked for opportunities to unfurl his cuts and sweeps against the slow men and rotated the strike with wristy nudges. In between, he slog-swept and pulled Price for boundaries, slog swept Graeme Cremer for a six, late cut and swatted Greg Lamb to the boundary.         
	Chigumbura prolonged Tillekaratne Dilshans (2) bad patch but as if to avenge it, Jayawardene hit Chigumbura for two fours and a six in his next over .         
	Jayawardene, however, kept going at the other end and brought up his century in 63 balls before Price finally removed him in the penultimate over.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina wins crown
                                                                                                                       7                                        Saina wins crown
          
	Chennai: Top seed Saina Nehwal rallied from behind to beat Mew Choo Wong of Malaysia 20-22, 21-14, 21-12 and clinched the womens singles title in the Yonex-Sunrise India Grand Prix badminton tournament here Sunday.         
	After dropping the keenly contested first game, Saina held the temperament and clawed her way back into the contest by pocketing the second game.         
	Another Indian seventh seed RMV Gurusaidutt failed to cross the final hurdle and went down 13-21, 18-21 to unseeded Indonesian Yunus Alamsyah in the mens singles summit clash. Later, top seeded mixed doubles pair of V Diju and Jwala Gutta won the title by beating Singaporean combo Chayut Triachart and Lei Yao 23-21, 20-22, 21-7.         
	I am happy to win at home, and yes, its a good preparation for the next two Super Series events (in Singapore and Indonesia), said Saina. (PTI)

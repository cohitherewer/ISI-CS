            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Chelseas Brazilian defender Alex has revealed he wants to finish his career at Stamford Bridge. The centre-half joined Chelsea on the eve of the 2007 Barclays Premier League season after three years playing in Holland at PSV Eindhoven.         
	The Brazil international signed a new deal last season to extend his stay for a further four years and now says he wants to remain at the club for life.         
	To be here is a good feeling, its very important for me and Im very happy, said Alex. In my career I never expected this, that one day I would come to play in England for a big team like Chelsea and complete 100 games.         
	Im very happy and hope to stay here for a long, long time and play 200 or 300 games. I have been here longer than PSV, it feels like home and I hope I can stay here for the rest of my career.

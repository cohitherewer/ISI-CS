The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Replacing Ntini is a challenge: Langeveldt
                                                                                                                       7                                      Replacing Ntini is a challenge: Langeveldt
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Come next month, the Kolkata Knight Riders fans can expect South African pacer Charl Langeveldt to open the bowling at the Eden Gardens.         
	However, the 35-year-old pacer is concentrating on his immediate goal, which is to contribute to his teams cause in the upcoming three-match ODI series against India, and to prove himself as the correct replacement for Makhaya Ntini.         
	Is he aware about the expectations and responsibilities? I dont see replacing Makhaya as a challenge. International cricket is all about taking up challenges. If you want to survive in international cricket, you got to accept challenges, Langeveldt said, after the practice session at the JU (Salt Lake) ground on Wednesday afternoon.         
	Langeveldt, who has played in 63 ODIs (87 wickets), feels working with Dav Whatmore and the legendary Wasim Akram in KKR, will be a learning experience for him. Last time, we (KKR) didnt have too many good players. This year, we would be definitely doing well, he said.

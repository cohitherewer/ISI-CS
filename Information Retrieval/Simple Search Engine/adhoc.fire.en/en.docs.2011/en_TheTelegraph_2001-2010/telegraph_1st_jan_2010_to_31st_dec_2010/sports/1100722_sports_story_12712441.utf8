The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maradona to stay: Report
                                                                                                                       7                                      Maradona to stay: Report
                      
	Buenos Aires: Diego Maradona will reportedly remain as coach of Argentinas national team, a decision he is expected to announce next week after meeting with Argentine Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona. A state-run Argentine news agency quoted Grondona as saying the meeting would be held on Monday.         
	News reports suggest that Maradona talked with Grondona yesterday and had agreed to a four-year deal that will keep him in charge until the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.         
	However, an AFA spokesman declined to confirm to the media that Maradona would continue in the job.         
	Maradona has not talked publicly about his plans since Argentina were knocked out in the World Cup quarter finals by Germany two weeks ago. He was reported to be travelling on Tuesday to Venezuela to conduct football clinics.

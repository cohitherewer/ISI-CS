	Yeongam: Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso has given South Koreas new Formula One circuit a positive review, saying he expects a spectacular race.         
	Alonso wrote on his Ferrari blog on Wednesday he expects no big surprises at the first South Korean Grand Prix, which offers a very interesting circuit that should be fun to drive, especially the last sector.         
	Alonso says the circuit reminds him of those in Bahrain, Turkey and Abu Dhabi  which were also designed by Hermann Tilke  with several overtaking spots on offer.         
	Alonso is currently tied for second with Sebastian Vettel in F1s championship standings, 14 points adrift of leader Mark Webber with three races  and 75 points  left.         
	However, teammate Felipe Massa insists he will help Alonso, his rival, to the F1 world title.         
	Last week Alonso had called on Massa to come to his aid over the final three races of the season.         
	 Massa, though, has not been around in the last two races after the Brazilian started at the back of the grid in Singapore last month due to a gearbox issue in qualifying, before suffering a collision at the first corner in the Japanese Grand Prix nine days ago.         
	It had been mooted Massa was far from interested in playing second fiddle to Alonso after being told to give up his win in Germany, so effectively becoming the No. 2 driver.         
	Assessing the final three races, Massa said: They are very important for me on a personal level to fight back after the disappointing outcome of the last two races in Japan and Singapore. More importantly, I will be trying to bring home a significant number of points to help the Scuderia in its fight for both championships.         
	First, we need to qualify well on Saturday and after that, in the race, I want to be in the middle of the battle for the drivers championship.         
	I want to be fighting with those five drivers who are chasing the title, which is the best thing I can do to help Ferraris and Fernandos aspirations as we head for the end of the championships.         
	Korea will be the last of a trio of Far Eastern races and I would like to arrive back in Sao Paolo for my home race with a good result in my pocket, he added.

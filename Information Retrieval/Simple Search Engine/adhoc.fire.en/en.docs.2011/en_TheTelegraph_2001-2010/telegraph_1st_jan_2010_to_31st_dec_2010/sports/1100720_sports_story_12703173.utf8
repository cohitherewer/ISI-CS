The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Malik set to play 2nd Test

	Karachi/Leeds: Former captain Shoaib Malik is set to replace Shahid Afridi in the Pakistan playing XI for the second Test against Australia at Headingley, which is also likely to see the return of off-spinner Saeed Ajmal.         
	Sources said Pakistan would make two changes to the team that lost to Australia by 150 runs in the first Test at Lords.         
	Malik will replace Afridi who has announced retirement from Test cricket, while Ajmal is likely to come in place of Danish Kaneria.         
	Malik has apparently convinced the team management that he can still contribute to the side after being axed from the first Test squad following his lack of seriousness in practice sessions.         
	We know that he (Malik) did not play any cricket in between Lords and Headingley, so his form has got nothing to do with his selection. We have achieved what we wanted to and since he has scored a half-century in the last Test he has played, he would be there in the team, media reports quoting sources said.         
	Pakistan suffered a humiliating defeat against Australia in the opening Test last week and Maliks inclusion will bolster the batting as he is the senior most players in absence of Mohammed Yousuf and Younus Khan.         
	Meanwhile, Australias preparations for the second and final Test at Headingley suffered a setback when Marcus North missed Mondays training session at Yorkshires headquarters.         
	North, the bowling hero of Australias 150-run series opening win at Lords last week, where the occasional off-spinner took a Test best six for 55, was ruled out of practice because of stomach illness.         
	Seamer Ben Hilfenhaus also did not bowl during Mondays session after suffering a shoulder injury sustained falling awkwardly in the field at Lords.         
	But with two days to go until Wednesdays start, Australia remain confident of naming an unchanged side.         
	If replacements are needed, the uncapped duo of batsman Usman Khawaja and seamer Peter George are both in the tour squad.         
	North has already missed one Test through illness, against South Africa in Cape Town last year, when a stomach bug allowed leg-spinner Bryce McGain to make his debut.         
	Australia have added Clint McKay, who remained in England after the recent one-day series to play Twenty20 cricket for Yorkshire, to their Test squad as cover for Hilfenhaus.         
	But Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris is still working with Hilfenhaus and Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke told reporters at Headingley: I dont think he bowled today, hes still seeing the physio but hes certainly improving.         
	Fingers crossed, hopefully hell be right come Day I of the Test . Hes had a few niggles over the last couple of years of his career. Hell be disappointed if he misses the Test match but hes in good hands with Alex, he knows whats going on and has spent a lot of time with Hilfy over the last year or so. I think hell get him on the park.         
	If he misses out it gives someone else an opportunity. Australia have already seen two players make their debut on this tour already, with both wicketkeeper Tim Paine and leg-spinner Steven Smith playing their first Test at Lords.

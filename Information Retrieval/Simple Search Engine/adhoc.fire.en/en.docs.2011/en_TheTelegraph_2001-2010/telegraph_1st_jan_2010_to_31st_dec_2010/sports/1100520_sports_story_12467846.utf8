The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Legends all praise   for Rory
                                                                                                                       7                                        Legends all praise   for Rory
                  Rory McIlroy                           
	Virginia Water: Former greats Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Seve Ballesteros have all written to Rory McIlroy to congratulate the youngster on his spectacular U.S. PGA Tour victory this month.         
	The Northern Irishman celebrated his 21st birthday two days early by blitzing his way to a closing 10-under 62 to finish four shots clear of world No. 2 Phil Mickelson at the Quail Hollow Championship in North Carolina. There have been a lot of congratulations and a lot of letters which I really appreciate, McIlroy told reporters on the eve of the PGA Championship.         
	I got two pieces of mail last Thursday, one from Jack Nicklaus and one from Arnold Palmer and it made me realise how special that win was.         
	McIlroy had shared lunch with Nicklaus earlier in the year and the 18-time Major winner told the talented youngster simply to bide his time for his first U.S. title.         
	(In his letter) he said, I told you to be patient but that was just outrageous, added the world No. 9.         
	Not a lot of people get to spend time with Jack Nicklaus or Arnold Palmer. Its great and I really appreciate they take an interest in my career.         
	McIlroy said he was equally pleased to receive a well done message from five-time Major winner Ballesteros.         
	I got a really nice letter from Seve. He said, Its great what you have done especially to win over in America so early. He also talked a bit about the Ryder Cup (in October) and about the European Tour and how proud he was of all the young players coming through, added McIlroy. It was a very touching letter.         
	The Northern Irishman is now excited to be back playing in Britain for the first time in seven months.         
	I havent played in the UK since the Alfred Dunhill event in October, said McIlroy. Its great to be playing over in America but its always nice to get back over to Europe and come back to familiar surroundings.

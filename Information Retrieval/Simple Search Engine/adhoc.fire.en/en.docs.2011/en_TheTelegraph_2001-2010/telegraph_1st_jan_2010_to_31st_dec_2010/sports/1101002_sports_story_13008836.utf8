                                                                                                                       7                                      Bindra to be flag bearer
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra will have the honour of being the flag bearer for India during the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games, on October 3.         
	President Pratibha Patil, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Prince Charles will be the guests of honour during the opening ceremony.         
	Bindra will be our flag bearer. India will participate in all the 17 disciplines and have the biggest contingent, comprising 379 male and 240 female athletes, the chef de mission of the Indian contingent, Bhubneshwar Kalita, said in a statement, on Friday.         
	India would be participating in all 17 events at the Games. We are hoping to do well and finish second in the medal tally. We are hoping to make most of the home advantage and the support of our home crowd, he added.         
	Kalita, however, created confusion over who would all carry the Queens baton on the last stretch of the relay into the stadium, when he mentioned Bindras name along with Vijender Singh, Sushil Kumar, Saina Nehwal, Samresh Jung, Akhil Kumar and M.C. Mary Kom, as the probable candidates. When asked how Bindra could be both baton and flag bearer, Kalita said he announced the ace shooters name by mistake. We will announce the name of the baton bearer on Saturday, he clarified.         
	Being the host nation, we have certain advantages and disadvantages related to the participation in the Games. But we are participating in all the events, Kalita reiterated.         
	Vijender Singh, who was also present in the function, said: We are fully-prepared and hopeful of bagging at least 10 golds in boxing.         
	The Indian flag was hoisted at the Games Village at a colourful ceremony on Friday afternoon, with schoolchildren singing songs and performing traditional dances and to enthral the gathering. Though many Indian athletes in the Village attended the function, most shooters and badminton players stayed away as they were training.

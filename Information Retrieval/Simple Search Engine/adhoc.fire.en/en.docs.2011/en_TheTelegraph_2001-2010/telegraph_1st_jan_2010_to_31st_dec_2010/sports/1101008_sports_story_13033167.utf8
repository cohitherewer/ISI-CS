The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Water clear, claims OC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Water clear, claims OC
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Organising Committee (OC) of the Commonwealth Games has refuted claims that the water of the S.P. Mukherjee swimming pool had been contaminated by pigeon droppings. Its all rubbish. There is nothing wrong with the water. We had a test done and everything is fine. The water is not contaminated, OC chairman Suresh Kalmadi said Thursday.         
	Kalmadi was reacting to a report in the British media that around 50 swimmers (from Australia and England) had been taken ill due to the contamination of the water in the pool.         
	The British media had reported that conditions at the swimming pool have been worsened by a sewage blockage that prevents the toilets from flushing.         
	Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell was asked if the swimming competition might be cancelled or moved if tests showed the pools were unsafe. I would not like to speculate about this immediately, Fennell told a news conference. If there is something unsafe, you cannot swim in that water. It is a matter we have to deal with a great deal of urgency.         
	However, Kamlesh Nanavati, the competition director, said: I am in charge of the swimming pool for the last one year. I am telling you everything is fine. What does Fennell know about the pool water?         
	The Australian and England team officials did say that some of the swimmers were hit by Delhi belly but added that nothing was serious and the whole event had been blown out of proportion.         
	While the South Africans laughed it off, the Canadian camp disclosed that there were a few stomach ailments. Canadian swimmer Brent Hayden, who powered his way to the 100m freestyle gold, put things in perspective. I am feeling a lot better today, he said. But it must be all down to the fact that India is not a place that we are used to. Maybe its something to do with our immune system.         
	These reactions were diametrically opposite to what the British media had reported. England swimming team leader John Atkinson was quoted as saying that 20 per cent of the swimmers have been affected by illness, although estimates were later revised to about 40 of the 66-strong team. Australian swim team spokesman Lachlan Searle said that about a half a dozen swimmers had been affected by stomach problems.         
	The Indian swimming team and officials were surprised. This is absolute nonsense. The water cannot be contaminated, said Virdhawal Khade.         
	Aussie Eamon Sullivans coach Grant Stoelwinder is also suffering from the problem, leading to the assumption that contaminated water cant be the root of the problems.

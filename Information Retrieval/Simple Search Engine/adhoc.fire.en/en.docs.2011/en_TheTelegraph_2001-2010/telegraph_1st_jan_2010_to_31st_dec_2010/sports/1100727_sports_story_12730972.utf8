            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The first phase of tickets available online for next years World Cup match between India and England at Eden Gardens (February 27, 2011) has received good response. According to a representative of KyaZoonga  official ticketing partner of ICC  all tickets of various denominations have been sold out.         
	We cant reveal the amount of tickets that were up for sale online during the first phase. But the tickets for the India match have been sold out. We will soon be releasing tickets of denomination of Rs 1200 and 1500, during the second phase of online sales.         
	After one has booked his/her ticket, it will either be sent by courier or can be collected personally from the stadium counter. We will be starting to courier the tickets only in January, the representative said on Monday.         
	Tickets can be booked at www.icc.cwc2011.kyazoonga.com. The company also plans to launch various ticket packages for the Indian supporters as well as fans from overseas.         
	As per the BCCI directive, a minimum of five per cent tickets will be up for online sales. Since the Edens capacity will be reduced to 70,000 after renovation, it is unlikely that more than 4,000 tickets will be available online.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injury-hit EB have a battle at hand 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Injury-hit EB have a battle at hand 
            A STAFF REPORTER                                      Abel Hammond,Nilendra Dewan        
	Calcutta: On paper, East Bengal outweigh Mohammedan Sporting in terms of the names on their roll and for having won a coveted trophy  the Federation Cup  this season as well.         
	But cut back to reality and the denouement is that there is not much of a difference between the two teams on the eve of their CFL Premier division clash, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Saturday.         
	The league table would also echo a similar tune as Mohammedan Sporting and East Bengal are placed third and fourth with 20 and 18 points respectively.         
	In their respective last ties, while Shabbir Alis side did well to hold table-toppers Mohun Bagan, Phillippe de Ridders wards failed to get past the Calcutta Customs, playing a 1-1 draw.         
	Well, nothing much has changed since.         
	The red and gold brigade have consistently been patchy this season with crests and troughs following each other closely. De Ridder has been saddled with injury problems which has further been complicated because of the lack of able replacements.         
	For the match on Saturday, Sanju Pradhan, Saumik Dey and Harmanjyot Singh Khabra make up the injury list.         
	In the absence of Sanju and Khabra, the half-line is likely to be comprised B Beikhokhei, Alvito DCunha, Mehtab Hossain and Mumtaz Akhtar.         
	Poibang Poshna, Uga Okpara, Nirmal Chetri and Saikat Saha Roy would be the likely choice at the defence.         
	The silver lining for East Bengal, however, would be the return of Ghanaian Abel Hammond upfront. He will have the nippy Budiram Tudu for company.         
	Mohammedan Sporting can breathe easy on the injury front though. The only concern is keyman and Brazilian playmaker Eduardo who is down with a stomach bug.         
	Were not too sure about Eduardos availability and will take a call tomorrow (Saturday) morning, was how Shabbir put it when queried about his most valuable player. Nilendra Dewan, who scored the goal against Bagan in their last match, and old war-horse Dipendu Biswas are the other options upfront for Shabbir.         
	Lucky Imran, Sovan Chakraborty, Babin Biswas and captain Jyothi Kumar will be the midfield managers for Mohammedan Sporting.         
	A comparative study of both the teams suggests that while Shabbirs wards falter near the opposition goal-mouth (scoring just 13 in 9 matches), De Ridders brigade have often been guilty of being porous in their own penalty box (conceding 7 from 9 matches).         
	Whoever does the repairing job better stands a brighter chance on Saturday.

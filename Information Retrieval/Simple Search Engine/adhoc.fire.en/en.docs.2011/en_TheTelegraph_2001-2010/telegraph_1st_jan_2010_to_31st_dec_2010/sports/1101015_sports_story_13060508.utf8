The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Verma needs to explain
                                                                                                                       7                                      Verma needs to explain
                      
	New Delhi: A gold medal calls for compliments from all quarters. And if one is the president of a national sports association, its reason for greater joy. But Badminton Association of India (BAI) president V.K. Verma seems to be from a different planet.         
	Shuttler Jwala Gutta slammed the BAI chief for ignoring her and Ashwini Ponnappa after the Indian duo clinched the gold medal in the womens double event, on Thursday.         
	Soon after the Indian pair stunned the top-seeded Singaporean team of Sari Shanti Mulia and Yao Lei 21-16 21-19 in the final, Jwala told newspersons that in spite of being present at the venue, Verma didnt even bother to congratulate the champions.         
	One thing for which I am not happy was that our federation chief did not even congratulate us after our win. Our president, who was present at the stadium and watched the entire match, did not come to congratulate us, Jwala said.         
	I am not really happy with the way our association is working. I would like to change a lot of things in the coming years, added Jwala.         
	We are doing really well on the international circuit We have got support from the government, but Im not sure how much help we have got from the association, Jwala said.         
	Jwala also believed that that her Games success will silence those critics who had been showering her with negatives.         
	This medal will silence my critics This is my answer to them, she said.         
	For Jwala, this win will very special as this came after weeks and months of mental pressure.         
	Jwala, it may be recalled, was recently linked to former India cricket captain and Congress MP Mohammed Azharuddin.         
	Incidentally, Azhar wanted to challenge Verma for BAIs presidency but backed out later.           (AGENCIES)

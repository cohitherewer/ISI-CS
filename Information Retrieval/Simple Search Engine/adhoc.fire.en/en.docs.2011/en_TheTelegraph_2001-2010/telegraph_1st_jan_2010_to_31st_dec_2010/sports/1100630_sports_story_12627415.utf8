The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injury to Gyan worries Ghana
                                                                                                                       7                                      Injury to Gyan worries Ghana
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                  Asamoah Gyan		      
	Injuries and suspension threaten to derail Ghanas World Cup campaign as they prepare for their World Cup quarter final match against Uruguay at Soccer City on Friday.         
	Ghanas star striker Asamoah Gyan joined the injury list when he picked up a knock at training.         
	My ankle is a bit swollen but I do not think it is too serious.         
	I will be ready for Uruguay, Gyan said.         
	Gyan from French club Rennes played a key role as Ghana became only the third African country after Cameroon and Senegal to reach the last-eight stage of the competition.         
	He scored the late winner against Serbia from a penalty, equalised against Australia from another spot kick and unleashed an extra-time thunderbolt that floored United States in the second round last weekend.         
	The only other Ghana scorer at the World Cup, midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, is also fighting to be fit.         
	Boateng aggavated a hamstring problem during the USA game and his situation is worrying Serb coach Milovan Rajevac who is also without the suspended defender Jonathan Mensah and influential midfielder Andre Ayew.         
	We are trying our best to get the injured players ready in time, was the most optimistic line Rajevac could manage with defenders Samuel Inkoom and John Mensah also on the treatment table.         
	Sunderland defender Mensah has struggled with a back problem for some time but is expected to start and could be partnered by Isaac Vorsah with Jonathan Mensah ruled out after two cautions.         
	Ayew, one of two sons of three-time African Footballer of the Year Abedi Pele in the squad, has been an ever-present in South Africa before a second yellow card ruled him out.         
	Among those who could replace Ayew is Sulley Muntari who has clashed regularly with arch disciplinarian Rajevac since he succeeded Frenchman Claude le Roy two years ago.         
	Dressing room criticism of the coach after a group draw with Australia almost led to him being kicked out of the squad and officials have admitted he is on a final warning.         
	Muntari refused to play in a friendly against Angola last November, leading to his exclusion from the African Nations Cup two months later in which severely depleted Ghana finished runners-up behind Egypt.

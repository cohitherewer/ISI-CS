            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: By the look of it, Mohun Bagan are still short of being a team full of confidence to win the I-League. Despite their 2-0 win over Mumbai FC, on Thursday, the green and maroon brigade took time to come to grips with a pacy Mumbai outfit.         
	Subhas Bhowmick has somewhat succeeded in getting the team back into winning ways, but to make winning a habit, theres a lot that the team needs to work on felt the Bagan technical director. The city giants had suffered set backs at the start of the I-League and Bhowmick said it will take time to make up for the early deficit.         
	We started badly in the I-league. And at this point, we are beggars. So, we need the points no matter how it comes. Playing good and not getting points will not serve our purpose. The three points today will, at least, boost the confidence of the team, Bhowmick said.         
	Mumbai FC refused to lose possession in the mid-field and often pushed the hosts on the back foot. Bhowmick saw enough talent in the visiting squad. They (Mumbai FC) can beat any team. They are a very young side and are extremely fit. The players are tall and strong. They didnt allow us an inch of space as you could see. They were strong in aerial tussles, he said.         
	After Thursdays win, Bhowmick showed the urgency to gather more points as he felt early wins will boost the team in the later stages. The more the points we gather now the better for us. These early points will matter a lot in the end. Had we not lost two games and had two points we would be on 10 points now, he said.

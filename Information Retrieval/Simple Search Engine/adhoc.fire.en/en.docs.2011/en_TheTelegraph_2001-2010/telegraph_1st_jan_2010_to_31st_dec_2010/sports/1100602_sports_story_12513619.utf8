The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lankans have it easy
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lankans have it easy
                      
	Bulawayo: Sri Lanka got back to winning ways when they defeated hosts Zimbabwe by nine wickets in a round-robin league match of the Micromax Cup tri-series One Day Championship, here on Tuesday.         
	In a match which was reduced to a 27-overs-a-side affair after a delayed start due to rain, Zimbabwe could manage only 118 in 24.5 overs.         
	In reply, Lankans led by stand-in-captain Tillekaratne Dilshan (60 no, 45 balls, 7x4, 1x6) reached the target in 15.2 overs losing Upul Tharanga (40)s wicket. The Lankan opening duo added 86 runs in 10.5 overs.         
	Earlier after deciding to field, Lankan bowlers put up a much improved show from their seven-wicket defeat against India, the other day.         
	Save opener Hamilton Masakadza (62, 69 balls, 4x4, 1x6), only two other batsmen  Greg Lamb (10) and Charles Coventry (11) reached double figures. The others literally caved in as Dilhara Fernando (two for 26), Ajantha Mendis (two for 21), Jeevan Mendis (two for 12) kept the batsmen under check.         
	The pick of the bowlers was however tall off-spinner Suraj Randiv who grabbed three for 23. Randiv bowled with nagging accuracy and got the ball to turn sharply away from the out-of-sorts Zimbabwe batsmen.         
	Opener Hamilton Masakadza was the topscorer for Zimbabwe with 62 from 69 balls, batting in the gloom as wickets fell cheaply at the other end.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Low-key affair on the cards
                                                                                                                       7                                      Low-key affair on the cards
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The IPL governing council meeting here on Monday is most likely to be its last in its present form as its expected to be restructured by the BCCI during the annual general meeting on September 29.         
	Mondays meeting, for all purposes, is a formality and the lone agenda for discussion would be the approval of the accounts related to the third edition of the T20 league held earlier this year.         
	It should be a low-key affair, with two members of the Council, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri, away on commentary duty at the Champions League T20 in South Africa.         
	However, the duo could be available via video conference, and accordingly, the meeting is likely to be held in the afternoon or evening.         
	That would also enable Chirayu Amin, the interim IPL chairman, and Arun Jaitley, a governing council member, to be present as they are the part of the disciplinary committee that is hearing the case against Lalit Modi.         
	The committee is expected to wrap up its proceedings  after three successive sittings beginning Sunday  by Tuesday, a day before the AGM.         
	The BCCI has proposed some radical measures that could see the IPL governing council being reduced in its size and the chairmans tenure shortened from five years to just one.         
	The IPL was constituted as a sub-committee of the BCCI but was given some special powers in 2007-08. That, of course, was when Modi was the face of the Board.         
	Much water has flowed under the bridge since then and the BCCI seems to be keen to clip the Councils as well as the chairmans wings.

                                                                                                                       7                                        All eyes are on in-form Bhullar
    - The 22-year-old excited about returning to Gurgaon course, his happy hunting ground           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Gaganjeet Bhullar                                 
	Gurgaon: Fresh from his sensational triumph in Bangkok, Gaganjeet Bhullar will be the cynosure when the inaugural $.2.1 million Avantha Masters starts at the DLF Golf and Country Club on Thursday.         
	The event, sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours with the Professional Golf Tour of India, has attracted some big names like European Ryder Cup stars Darren Clarke and David Howell, beside a slew of Asian players, that includes the cream of Indian golf, like Jeev Milkha Singh, Jyoti Randhawa, Shiv Kapur, SSP Chowrasia, Arjun Atwal, C Muniyappa and Gaurav Ghei.         
	Yet, the partisan crowd at the Arnold Palmer designed course would eagerly be looking forward to have a glimpse of the 22-year-old Bhullar, especially after his remarkable showings in the Asian Tour International in Bangkok. Perhaps going through the form of his life, Bhullar has been playing incredible golf since he qualified for the British Open last year.         
	Bhullar, too, is excited about returning to the DLF course, considered to be his happy hunting ground. Winning at Bangkok was a great experience, he said. I am sure my confidence will go a long way in doing well here.         
	I am simply looking forward to play in the Avantha Masters, its a big event. I love the Gurgaon course, I have won there twice. Playing in front of the home crowd always gives me a great sense of achievement, Bhullar said.         
	Among the other Indians, while Jeev Milkha Singh remains the star attraction, eight-time Asian tour winner Jyoti Randhawa, who has not been in the best of form recently, will have to pull up his socks.         
	Likewise, Atwal would also hope to end his title drought and put behind the shoulder injury that blighted his career in recent times. Among others, Muniyappa won his maiden Asian Tour title here last year and is eager to have another shot at glory.         
	The field also includes many European Tour players. While at No. 59, Jeev is the leading player here, Shane Lowry is the next highest ranked player.         
	The Irishman has put together several good performances in recent months, including a fourth place in Qatar last week and a third placing behind Edoardo Molinari and Robert Karlsson in Japan last year.

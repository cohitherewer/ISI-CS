The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delighted to sign the deal 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Delighted to sign the deal 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	London: Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has agreed to a new 41.6 million five-year contract to stay at Old Trafford until at least June 2015.         
	The club confirmed the news on Friday afternoon, ending a dramatic week, which included Rooney insisting United no longer matched his ambitions.         
	Yet after a staggering 24-hour period, and demonstration by irate supporters at Rooneys house in Prestbury on Thursday night, Rooney is now set to stay at Old Trafford.         
	[According to The Times, Rooney became the highest paid English footballer in history by signing a 1,80,000 a week deal which will reach  200,000 a week by the end of the contract in 2015. The highest paid player in the Premier League is Yaya Toure, the Ivory Coast midfielder, who earns about  210,000 a week at Manchester City.]         
	The agreement follows intensive discussions between United and the players representatives.         
	Alex Ferguson said: Its been a difficult week, but the intensity of the coverage is what we expect at Manchester United. I said to the boy that the door is always open and Im delighted Wayne has agreed to stay.         
	It barely seemed credible that such a position could be arrived at so quickly.         
	But the conciliatory nature of a holding statement from United on Thursday night suggested rapprochement was in the offing.         
	And, after consultation with the owners, who allayed his fears about the future direction of United, Rooney agreed to extend his contract, which will now expire in 2015.         
	Ferguson added: Im pleased he has accepted the challenge to guide younger players and establish himself as one of Uniteds great players. It shows character and belief in what we stand for.         
	Im sure everyone involved with the club will now get behind Wayne and show him the support he needs to produce the performances we know he is capable of.         
	Rooney recognises damage has been done, possibly inside the dressing room and certainly with the fans who have regarded him as one of their own since he first arrived from Everton in 2004. He also understands the need to improve his form, which has suffered so badly since he sustained an ankle injury against Bayern Munich in March, the last time he scored a goal for his club in open play.         
	I am delighted to sign another deal at United, he said.         
	In the last couple of days, I have talked to the manager and the owners and they have convinced me this is where I belong. I said on Wednesday the manager is a genius and it is his belief and support that have convinced me to stay.         
	In agreeing to a five-year contract with United, Rooney abruptly ended the fevered speculation about his future and left the clubs manager Alex Ferguson smiling like a Cheshire cat.         
	It was all a far cry from Fergusons forlorn Tuesday news conference when in a five-minute monologue he revealed his shock that Rooney no longer wanted to play for the club.         
	Only those in the corridors of power at Old Trafford know what transpired in the following days but Rooneys announcement on Friday that he wanted to stay, having on Wednesday disparaged the club, was astonishing.         
	Others may call it cynical.         
	The fact that Rooney has agreed to stay on at Old Trafford until 2015 should be taken with a large pinch of salt. It will take more than his signature on a piece of paper to repair the damage done by the past week.         
	The impression that all is not well in the relationship between Ferguson and Rooney remains. When there is a battle of wills at Old Trafford there is normally only one winner and Ferguson, who Rooney described as a genius this week, has emerged from the maelstrom of the past few days stronger than ever.

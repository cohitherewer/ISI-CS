                                                                                                                       7                                      Former stars critical of players action
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indias domination in world hockey is a thing of the past. But what is more embarrassing is the fact that the game in country has only plummeted to new depths.         
	The payment dispute between the players and Hockey India, the games administrators in the country, may have been resolved after a marathon meeting on Saturday, but the players boycott of the World Cup preparatory camp in Pune has certainly left the Olympians from the city disappointed.               
	Following are excerpts (alphabetically)               
	Bir Bahadur Chetri: This type of things shouldnt happen with a national team After all, its not a club side. The players are right in their demands, but boycotting the camp is no solution. It just portrays a sorry picture of the game in the country.         
	Vece Paes: The officials are too busy in their agendas to take care of the game. Such a thing shakes up the whole hierarchy and is certainly a not good advertisement for the sport. As it is, were not going through a rosy patch, now we have moved further backwards. Hockey India should get their priorities right and sort out their problems. The players, on their part, could have dealt the issue behind closed doors.         
	Gurbux Singh: It was disappointing that such an incident happened just before the World Cup. Its sad but Indian hockey is going through its worst phase. The way things are being handled, its becoming detrimental for the players as well as the officials. I cant remember a similar crisis ever arising in Indian hockey. Players do require their payments and the officials should have taken care of that. But the players should also have realised that country comes first. Too many controversies, and that too just ahead of the World Cup, are just spoiling the game.

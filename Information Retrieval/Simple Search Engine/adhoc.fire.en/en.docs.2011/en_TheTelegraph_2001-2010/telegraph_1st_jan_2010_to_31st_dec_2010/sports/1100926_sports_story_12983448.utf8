The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir slams   flat track
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gambhir slams   flat track
                            
	Chandigarh: Board Presidents XI captain Gautam Gambhir Saturday defended his unimpressive bowlers and blamed a flat track for their lacklustre show on the opening day of the warm-up match against Australia here.         
	Bowlers did a good job. There wasnt much in the wicket. Our bowlers were up against a quality side and they had to bowl on a flat track. Still, they did a decent job, Gambhir told at the media conference.         
	All the Indian bowlers proved quite expensive as Australia piled up a huge 319 for one on the first day, with the openers  Shane Watson (115) and Simon Katich (104 retired hurt)  producing a 232-run opening partnership.         
	Gambhir also defended pacer Sreesanth, who failed to impress, giving away 41 runs in his 13 overs without any success, saying fast bowlers take time to rediscover the rhythm after an injury lay-off.         
	He (Sreesanth) is coming back after an injury. You have got to give him some time. He tried his best, Gambhir said.         
	Gambhir also said that quality bowlers such as Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharmas ability to move the ball would be crucial in the upcoming Test series.         
	Zaheer is going to be a big threat (for the Aussies), Gambhir said. (PTI)

  - Sreesanth is set to miss second Test
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Laxman                           
	Calcutta/Dhaka: The Indian team management will take a final decision Saturday, on the availability of VVS Laxman for the second Test against Bangladesh, starting here on Sunday.         
	Friday proved quite a dramatic day for Team India. The team management, apparently on a request from Laxman, took back its decision to send him home during the day.         
	Laxman, who injured his left hand during the closing stages of Day IV of the Chittagong Test, was expected to recover only after five days. But it seems he requested the team management to review his fitness on Saturday, the eve of the second and final Test. He has received around ten micro stitches on the webbing of his left hand.         
	We have decided to wait till tomorrow in his case, manager Arshad Ayub said.         
	Even if he misses the Dhaka Test because of the injury, it is confirmed that he will recover in time for the home series against South Africa next month.         
	Though it is not official, it is more or less certain that Sreesanth wont be able to play the second Test. Details of the MRI done on him on Friday were not available, but sources indicated that the hamstring problem isnt going to disappear in a hurry.         
	That being so, it is highly unlikely that Sreesanth will figure in the starting XI. The pacer suffered a strain while bowling in the second innings in Chittagong. He left the field, unable to complete the over.         
	Friday was a day off for Team India. Sachin Tendulkar and Harbhajan Singh visited the house of Mumbai Indians teammate Mohammed Ashraful. Then, in the evening, the entire team was hosted by the Indian High Commissioner.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who missed the first Test because of back spasms and had a recurrence of the problem on Wednesday, is better.         
	As for off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, he has recovered from a painful stiff neck that saw him miss the opening Test.

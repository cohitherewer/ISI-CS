The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Everton hold United

  - Chelsea, Arsenal register convincing victories       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Evertons Mikel Arteta (left) celebrates with Tim Cahill after scoring the equaliser against Manchester United, during their English Premier League match, at Goodison Park, on Saturday. (AP)                                 
	Alex Ferguson may have tried to spare Wayne Rooney his torment by granting him a leave of absence from Goodison Park, but, in the space of two injury-time minutes, he may simply have served to deepen it. The personal just got professional.         
	This was a game always likely to be dominated by Rooney, whether present or not. Around 200 fans gathered on Goodison Road to welcome Manchester Uniteds team bus. The songs were prepared. So, too, the inflatable doll, a special gift for the prodigal son.         
	Ferguson, though, had other ideas. Humanitarian concerns do not come naturally to Ferguson. The clearest evidence that the decision to exclude Rooney was a late one came in Uniteds unusually timid start.         
	Everton, despite their traditional slow start, are not the sort of side to pass up such an opportunity. They swarmed forward, Steven Pienaar and Mikel Arteta passing and moving, Tim Cahill and Marouane Fellaini bumping and bustling. Fergusons side  most notably Merseyside favourite Gary Neville and Jonny Evans  creaked ominously.         
	It took a full-length fingertip save from Edwin van der Sar to keep out one Arteta free kick. Evans was required to block another shot from the Spaniard. Pienaar and Leon Osman went close. United were on the ropes.         
	That, though, is when they come out fighting. John Shea hit the post, Paul Scholes, his shot clipping Cahills arm on the way through, drew a splendid save from Tim Howard. The American denied Ryan Giggs, too, at close range.         
	The signs were there. Everton failed to heed them. After Pienaar gave David Moyess side the lead, sweeping home after Van Der Sar denied Arteta and John Heitinga fed the South African the rebound, the hosts slowly but surely allowed their guests to seize control.         
	United equalised just before the break and took the lead immediately after it. First, a goal brimming with vision, control. Scholes, taking a quick free kick, picked out Giggs in the centre circle.         
	The Welshman turned, spraying the ball to Nani on the right flank. One touch, a cross skimmed to the edge of the six-yard box and a delicate but definite conversion from Darren Fletcher.         
	Uniteds second, from Nemanja Vidic, was rather more rudimentary. Everton failed to clear their lines from a corner, the ball was worked out to Nani and the Serb, rising unmarked four yards out, headed his cross home.         
	There was no way back for Everton. Dimitar Berbatov must have assumed he had sealed victory, his languid, composed finish beating Howard, after Sylvain Distin misjudged the flight of a raking Scholes pass, but there might have been more  Nani, most conspicuously, could have scored twice.         
	How United would pay. First, Cahill headed home what seemed a consolation, beating Vidic to Leighton Bainess cross. Then, a moment later, Baines crossed, Fellaini nodded down and Arteta rifled home. Rooneys absence was suddenly conspicuous.         
	Ferguson, who also saw his team concede a last-minute equaliser at Fulham last month, said: Football can do that to you. From a completely comfortable position weve thrown it away.         
	Defending champions Chelsea had Michael Essien scoring twice to inspire the Blues to their fourth Premier League win in four matches. The champions strolled to a 3-1 victory at West Ham United, leaving their London rivals rooted to the foot of the table with no points.         
	Arsenal took full advantage of a red card for Bolton Wanderers defender Gary Cahill with a 4-1 home triumph. Moussa Dembeles second goal of the game, in the last minute, gave Fulham a 2-1 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers that was soured by a broken leg for England striker Bobby Zamora.         
	Blackpool continued an impressive start to their first top-flight season in 39 years with a 2-0 victory at Newcastle United.         
	Manchester City struggled again, held 1-1 at home by Blackburn Rovers. Tottenham Hotspurs Luka Modric joined the clubs growing injury list despite scoring in a 1-1 draw at West Bromwich Albion.

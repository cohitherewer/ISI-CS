The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gayle wants consistency 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gayle wants consistency 
                      
	Port of Spain: With the Super Eight stage of the World Twenty20 starting on Thursday, West Indies captain Chris Gayle has called on his players to be more consistent in every aspects of the game from here on.         
	Gayle was of the view that the West Indian bowlers need to pull up their socks after the hosts conceded a sizable 191 against England in the group stages.         
	We have got to be more consistent in the bowling department. Having conceded 191 runs against England, I think we just lacked some penetration and good line and length, but hopefully we can get it correct by the next round, he said.         
	West Indies beat minnows Ireland by a comfortable 70 runs in their first match and then luckily got the better of England by eight wickets via Duckworth-Lewis method in their rain-affected second and final group encounter.         
	West Indies might have faltered in the first two editions of the Twenty20 World Cup but Gayle said, this time the tournament brought along with an opportunity for the Caribbeans to break their title jinx.         
	I think we have a good chance of making the Caribbean people proud, and we should go from strength to strength, Gayle said. (PTI)

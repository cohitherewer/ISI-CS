The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A narrow escape for EB
                                                                                                                       7                                      A narrow escape for EB
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The prelude to the Friday derby has been interesting. The build-up to the big game has seen stars tumble, before somehow climbing out of the pit to affirm their claim for the CFL title.         
	If Mohun Bagan wriggled out a victory via late goals on Monday, it was East Bengals turn on Tuesday as they huffed and puffed to a 3-2 victory over Southern Samity.         
	Ekene Ikenwa used his head for the wrong reasons. Ekenes needless head-butt on Samity defender Rahul Bhattacharya earned him a red card in the 50th minute. The club, meanwhile, have decided to release Ekene after December 1.         
	East Bengal, however, were the first to find the net, in the 41st minute, when Budiram Tudu capitalised on a defensive lapse to slot it home.         
	But the apparently lifeless match, sprung into action when madness and brilliance overlapped each other in a 10-minute period.         
	It began with Edmilson chipping away to glory to restore parity for Samity.         
	That was followed by Ekenes brainless act.         
	And to make it worse for East Bengal, Marcos took a stunner of a free-kick five minutes later to make it 2-1 for Samity.         
	However, Mehtab Hossain equalised with an equally brilliant free-kick in the 73rd minute.         
	Penn Orji nodded in the winner in the last minute of added time to the turn the tables on Samity.         
	Teams         
	East Bengal: Sandip Nandy, Ravinder Singh, Sunil Kumar, Gurwinder Singh, Saikat Saha Roy, Sanju Pradhan, Mehtab Hossain, B. Beikhokhei (Penn Orji, 57), Robin Singh, Budiram Tudu, Ekene Ikenwa.         
	Southern Samity: Pronoy Roy, Rajib Ahmed, Rahul Bhattacharya, Gurpreet Singh, Madhav Das, Mriganka Sharma, Marcos Pereira, Pradip Nag (Deepak Sharma, 56), Francis Xavier, Edmilson, Jamir Ali Mondal (Tuishim Mashangva, 86)         
	Referee: Rathin Mukherjee         
	MoM: Mehtab Hossain

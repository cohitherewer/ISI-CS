The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team ban   will be   harsh: Taylor 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Team ban   will be   harsh: Taylor 
                                  
	Melbourne/London: Controversies seem to be a never-ending chapter of Pakistan cricket. As the cricket world was rocked with allegations of spot-fixing against some of the Pakistan players, reactions, ranging from sympathy to hatred, continue to pour in from former captains and coaches.               
	Heres what some of them had to say, on Wednesday (alphabetically):               
	Ray Jennings (Former South Africa coach): Fingers have been pointed for some years now at Pakistani players. If its found that these players are guilty, a good example should be made of them and they should get prison sentences. Even lifelong bans would not be good enough for me. All that such players do is to cause great damage to cricket. There is nothing that irritates me more than when the game is threatened by such allegation. There must be something brewing.         
	Imran Khan (Former Pakistan captain): I think the ICC is going to take its own decision. But in my opinion, the message should go that crime does not pay. For spot-fixing, rather than imposing a life ban, they should be fined heavily. It really should set an example and the fine should be huge. Why should Pakistan cricket be banned?         
	Mark Taylor (Former Australia captain): I dont agree with that (suspending Pakistan) I think its too harsh a penalty for one nation. If they have one person, two people or three people involved in match-fixing or fixing certain deliveries, why penalise the whole nation? No, Im not for that. Youre always going to ask those questions. If you throw them out, when they come back youre still going to ask those questions. I think all you can do is penalise the individuals and embark on an education process and hopefully stop people from doing this sort of thing.

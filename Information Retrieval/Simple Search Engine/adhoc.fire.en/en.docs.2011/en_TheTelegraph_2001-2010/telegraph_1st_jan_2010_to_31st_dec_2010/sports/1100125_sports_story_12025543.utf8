	London: Arsenal were ousted from the FA Cup by Stoke on Sunday with a 3-1 loss giving Sol Campbell an unhappy return to the team after four years.         
	Just 70 seconds into Campbells second Arsenal debut, Rory Delaps first trademark long throw-in flew over the 35-year-old defender and Ricardo Fuller headed powerfully past Lukasz Fabianski.         
	The visitors levelled just before the break through Denilsons deflected strike, but Fuller headed in from Delap again in the 78th and Dean Whitehead sealed Stokes fourth-round win.         
	We got our rewards today (Sunday), Whitehead said. We do not fear anybody, we are playing really well and look forward to the next round.         
	With Liverpool and Manchester United already eliminated in the third round, Chelsea are the only member of the Premier League traditional Big Four remaining in the worlds oldest knockout competition.         
	Campbell was one of nine changes Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger made from the side that beat Bolton in midweek to remain firmly in the league title race.         
	The former England international hadnt appeared for Arsenal since the 2006 Champions League final when he scored in the 2-1 loss to Barcelona. But he has been brought back by Wenger on a sixth-month deal. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players get more time
                                                                                                                       7                                        Players get more time
  - ICC accepts Pak trios request       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Aamer, Asif and Butt                            
	Calcutta: The Sharad Pawar-headed International Cricket Council (ICC) has acceded to a request from Pakistans tainted trio  Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif, Mohammed Aamer  for more time to give a detailed reply to the chargesheet which accompanied their provisional suspension by the world body.         
	Its to be seen whether the route being taken actually helps, for most would see this as a move to buy time, nothing more.         
	Butt, Asif and Aamer are at the centre of a spot-fixing scandal, which came to light after a News of the World sting operation.         
	Yes, I can confirm that the ICC has given additional time... I wont specify the number of days as its not our intention to start a media frenzy all over again, PCB legal adviser Tafazzul Rizvi told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Lahore on Wednesday evening, he added: The players need more time to give a detailed reply... All three made the same request.         
	Butt, Asif and Aamer were provisionally suspended on September 2, days after the stunning expose. Theyve been charged under the ICCs Anti-Corruption Code for Players and Player Support Personnel.         
	While Rizvi didnt wish to comment on an ongoing investigation, one learns that Scotland Yard has still not come up with its preliminary report.         
	Earlier, the agency had indicated to the PCB that its initial findings may well be made known by last Friday.         
	The trio, meanwhile, is in Lahore. Butt and the other two have been advised to stay away from public places and have no interaction with the media.         
	With things being in the hush-hush mode, only a select few in the PCB were aware that the players would be meeting chairman Ijaz Butt, at the Gaddafi, on Tuesday.         
	By the time the media landed up at the PCBs HQ, the trio had left!         
	Footnote: Rizvi has rubbished talk that Aamer is likely to turn an approver and testify against teammates. Its news to us... Theres absolutely no basis to make such a suggestion, he maintained.

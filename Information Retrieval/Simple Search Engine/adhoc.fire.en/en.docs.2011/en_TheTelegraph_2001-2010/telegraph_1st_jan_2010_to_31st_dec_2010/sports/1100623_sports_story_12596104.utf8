The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cahill return boosts Socceroos
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cahill return boosts Socceroos
                      
	Nelspruit: The return of two suspended players and the absence of two others could prove to be a deciding factor in Wednesdays World Cup Group D clash between Australia and Serbia.         
	Australia welcome back arguably their best player in Tim Cahill, who missed last weeks 1-1 draw with Ghana after being sent off in the 4-0 defeat by Germany in their opening match.         
	Cahill is expected to tuck in just behind striker Brett Holman in a game they must win. If the Australians realise they need more firepower, coach Pim Verbeek might also be tempted to throw Josh Kennedy into the attack.         
	Likely teams         
	Serbia (4-4-2): 1-Vladimir Stojkovic, 6-Branislav Ivanovic, 5-Nemanja Vidic, 13-Aleksandar Lukovic, 3-Aleksandar Kolarov, 17-Milos Krasic, 10-Dejan Stankovic, 22-Zdravko Kuzmanovic, 14-Milan Jovanovic, 15-Nikola Zigic, 8-Danko Lazovic         
	Australia (4-4-2): 1-Mark Schwarzer, 2-Lucas Neill, 6-Michael Beauchamp, 11-Scott Chipperfield, 8-Luke Wilkshire, 23-Mark Bresciano, 5-Jason Culina, 14-Brett Holman, 7-Brett Emerton, 16-Carl Valeri, 4-Tim Cahill         
	Referee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay) (agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Villa eyes monumental show

            JAYDEEP BASU            David Villa in Johannesburg, on Monday. (AFP)                           
	Johannesburg: When David Villa declared, in the lead up to the tournament, that he had both the World Cup and the Golden Boot in his sights, it raised a lot of eyebrows.         
	The pocket-sized assassin has 40 international goals in 60 appearances for Spain and is just four short of Spanish legend Raul Gonzalezs record of 44. But World Cup, as they say, is a different ball game altogether and the Spaniards had to learn that the hard way in the humbling at the hands of Switzerland in their first group league match.         
	But on Monday night, Villas double strike restored his teams dented pride as La Furia Roja roared back into contention with a blistering exhibition of attacking football, as briefly reported in Tuesdays Late City edition. They beat Honduras 2-0 at the Ellis Park here, which had broken out in a raucous riot of colour as nearly 50,000 spectators turned up to watch the European champions.         
	Villa, despite missing a spot kick in the match, looked happy when he turned up to collect his Man of the Match award.         
	It was a satisfactory performance from the team. I, too, got my goals yes, it is a big relief for the moment, he said.         
	But the former Valencia striker said the win over Honduras was already a thing of the past. Most victories are like that we still need to beat Chile, but there is a long way to go before we can even think of being world champions, both in terms of time and matches, he said.         
	Villas spectacular show has immediately earned him the status of a superstar at the World Cup but the performance was not without blemish. There were squandered opportunities apart from that missed penalty. That extra goal would have been of immense help going into Fridays match against group leaders Chile.         
	Spain have three points while Chile have six. It is possible Group H will end up in a three-way tie between Chile, Spain and Switzerland when it would all come down to goal difference.         
	Villa, who completed a $56 million move to Barcelona from Valencia recently, said he was out to make up for missing his countrys Euro 2008 triumph.         
	After scoring four goals to help his country reach the final, Villa missed Spains historic 1-0 win over Germany due to an injury.         
	This (World Cup) is a huge tournament for Spain and for me personally, said Villa.         
	We want to build on the success of winning the European championship and go all the way in the World Cup We want to show we are the best team around, said the man who scored 129 La Liga goals in six seasons for Valencia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eusebios warning for the Ronaldos
                                                                                                                       7                                      Eusebios warning for the Ronaldos
                      
	Magaliesburg: Eusebio doesnt think North Korea have the same element of surprise in South Africa that they brought to the 1966 World Cup, when they beat Italy and then led his Portugal team 3-0 before losing their quarter final match.         
	Portugal and North Korea meet in Group G on Monday for their first World Cup meeting since that game 44 years ago, when Eusebio scored four goals to lead the Portugal from 0-3 down to a 5-3 win.         
	We were taken completely by surprise, Eusebio said on Saturday.         
	Eusebio, now a football ambassador with the Portuguese Football Federation, and 1966 teammate Antonio Simoes are in South Africa with the Portugal squad.         
	The pair have attended some training sessions and Eusebio thinks the Portuguese players need to show the same self-belief and resilience in Cape Town as the 66 team did in England.         
	I remember very clearly what Simoes said when we were 0-3 down. He kept saying, as long as we dont go four goals down, were still in with a chance, Eusebio said. And he was right.         
	The North Koreans scored a late goal in a 1-2 loss to five-time champions Brazil last Tuesday in their first match at the World Cup since 66.         
	Portugal opened their fifth World Cup with a 0-0 draw against Ivory Coast.         
	The Portuguese players must be 100 percent committed to overcome North Korea, who have already proven against Brazil that they are not a weak team, Eusebio said. We have to be very determined, very quick moving the ball around, solid in defense and, of course, the players need to find the inspiration to show on the pitch the talent they possess.         
	North Korea are billed as a mystery team in South Africa. Only three of their squad play overseas and the team have made few international appearances outside of qualifying matches in recent years.         
	That has given opponents little chance to study their strengths and weaknesses, but the 68-year-old Eusebio says it was even worse in his day.           (AGENCIES)

	Doha: Roger Federer overcame Ernests Gulbis strong serve to reach the Qatar Open semi-finals Thursday with a 6-2, 4-6,6-4 victory.         
	Federer broke twice to take the first set with ease, but then hit two shots long in the 10th game of the second to let the Latvian level the match.         
	The players traded breaks to make it 3-3 in the third, before Federer capitalised on Gulbis errors in the 10th game to seal the win.         
	The 90th-ranked Gulbis finished with 13 aces  seven of them in the second set  and did enough to impress the Swiss No. 1 in their first meeting.         
	I know that Gulbis is the player with the most potential right now, Federer said. Unfortunately, he doesnt have the ranking he deserves. I took him very seriously. I wasnt surprised by how he played.         
	Earlier, Rafael Nadal reached the semis Belgian opponent Steve Darcis retired with a back problem while trailing 6-1, 2-0.         
	Nadal, a two-time quarter finalist in Doha, will next meet Viktor Troicki of Serbia, who beat Lukasz Kubot of Poland 4-6, 6-4, 7-6(1).           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kochi likely to face the heat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kochi likely to face the heat
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Time is running out for the Kochi Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise. With its owners unable to sort out their differences and incorporate a legal entity to run the team, the franchise is in danger of being disqualified.         
	In a hurriedly convened meeting here on Sunday, the IPL governing council is expected to come up with some tough decisions regarding the Kochi franchise. Stern action could also be taken against the Rajasthan Royals and the Kings XI Punjab.         
	It (revoking the franchise rights) is the prerogative of the BCCI. We cannot comment on that, said Satyajitsinh Gaikwad, chief executive officer of the consortium that won the bid for Kochi.         
	We still have time, Gaikwad said when asked if any headway had been made with regard to getting the franchise registered as a company as required under the Franchise Agreement.         
	With speculation rife that the Videocon Group has been alerted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India to be on stand-by should Rendezvous bid be disqualified, both the owners and the IPL governing council members remained tight-lipped.

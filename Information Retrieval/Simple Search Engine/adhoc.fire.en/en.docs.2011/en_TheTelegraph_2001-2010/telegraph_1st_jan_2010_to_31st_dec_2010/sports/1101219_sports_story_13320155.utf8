The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Innings loss for Bengal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Innings loss for Bengal
  - Manoj Tiwary-led side fails to make quarters; Yadav takes five       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  
	New Delhi: The Bengal lower-order caved in rather tamely to suffer a humiliating innings defeat against the Railways on the fourth day of their Ranji clash here on Saturday.         
	Needing another 40 runs to make Railways bat again, Bengal, overnight 105 for six, were skittled out for 134 in less than 40 minutes into the morning session. Arindam Das couldnt bat owing to his elbow injury and veteran medium pacer Jaiprakash Yadav polished off the Bengal tail to return with an impressive second innings figure of 5 for 20 in 14.2 overs. With the win, Railways qualified for the knockout stage and will take on Baroda in the quarterfinals.         
	Bengals last four batsmen -- Sourasish Lahiri, Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda and Iresh Saxena  failed to open their accounts. Only Laxmi Ratan Shukla displayed grit and determination to remain unbeaten on 58 with eight hits to the fence in his 110-ball resistance. Saturdays defeat ended Bengals journey in this years Ranji Trophy without a single victory in their league engagements.         
	Bengals final-day nemesis, Yadav, made good use of the morning dew to extract movement off the track. At 35, he is still a force to reckon with in domestic circuit. Yadav picked up his first wicket of the day when Ranadeb Bose edged one to wicketkeeper Mahesh Rawat in a half-hearted prod. Dinda and Saxena also perished in similar fashion with Rawat making no mistake behind the stumps.         
	Yadav was elated with his tidy job against the tail-enders and believed this performance would boost him in the knockout stage. I finished with a match figure of seven for 61 and considering the fact that I was not in my best in a few matches this season, this success came as a huge morale booster, Yadav said.         
	Railways skipper Sanjay Bangar also praised Yadav. JP did a fine job in the morning and was able to bring the curtain down on the match quickly. I knew he would be the best person to exploit the conditions. He had been the backbone of the Railways team for a long time and even after so many years of cricket, JP always performs consistently, Bangar said.         
	Unfortunately for Bengal, there was no consistent performer in the match. Debutant Gitimoy Basu did a good job with the bat in the first innings, but flopped in the second. The visitors had pinned their hopes on Sourav Ganguly and skipper Manoj Tiwary. Though the Bengal skipper got a start in the visitors first essay, neither of the two senior batsmen could live up to their expectations in the second.         
	Tiwary admitted his team needs a lot of hard work. We learned a lot from this match. Weve to go back and rectify a few things. Good that we have some youngsters. I am sure they will improve, Tiwary said.         
	The Bengal skipper blamed lack of application and dearth of individual brilliance as main reasons for the defeat. Though I am happy with the teams overall performance this season, we were lacked in our individual skills ... perhaps, we should have applied ourselves more than what we actually did, he said.

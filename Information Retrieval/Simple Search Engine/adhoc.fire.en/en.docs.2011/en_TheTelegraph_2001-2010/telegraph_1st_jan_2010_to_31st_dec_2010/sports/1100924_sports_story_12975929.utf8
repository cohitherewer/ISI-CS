The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shoaib caught on camera!
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shoaib caught on camera!
                      
	London: There seems to be no respite for the Pakistan team here as fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has landed the scandal-hit side in the middle of a ball-tampering controversy.         
	Akhtar was caught on camera tampering with the ball during their fifth one-day International against England at the Rose Bowl stadium in Southampton, which Pakistan lost by a massive 121 runs.         
	In the last game of their acrimonious tour of England at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday, apparently fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar could be seen running his left thumb along the balls seam before dropping the ball on the ground and standing on it with his spiked right boot, a British tabloid reported.         
	The pictures were taken in the 41st over of Englands innings as Shoaib prepared to bowl to Paul Collingwood, it said.         
	No stranger to controversy, Akhtar was filmed by television cameras flicking at the ball with his thumb during an ODI here against England four years ago.         
	The 35-year-old was let off at that time. His behaviour also came under the scanner when he was accused of tampering with the ball during a Test match in Zimbabwe in late 2002 and was subsequently warned.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England in command
                                                                                                                       7                                        England in command

	Chittagong: Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann shared five wickets to put England in complete command on the second day of the first Test against Bangladesh on Saturday.         
	At the close, Bangladesh, replying to Englands 599 for six declared, were struggling at 154 for five with only opener Tamin Iqbal standing firm.         
	Tamim was unbeaten on 81 after Paul Collingwood had collected his 10th Test century to lift England to a huge first- innings total.         
	Facing an uphill task to avoid the follow-on, Bangladesh suffered an early setback when fast bowler Broad dismissed opener Imrul Kayes (4) and Junaid Siddique (7) with short-pitched deliveries before Swann continued his remarkable record of capturing a wicket in his opening over.         
	Swann had Aftab Ahmed (1) caught by Ian Bell at leg-slip to give the off-spinner a wicket with his fifth ball after the tea break and reduce Bangladesh to 51 for three.         
	Tamim then shared a 94-run partnership with Mahmudullah (51) to repair the damage before Swann struck again.         
	Mahmudullah, who had raced to his fifty off 54 balls with seven cleanly struck boundaries and a six, attempted a sweep shot but managed only to glove the ball to Collingwood at slip.

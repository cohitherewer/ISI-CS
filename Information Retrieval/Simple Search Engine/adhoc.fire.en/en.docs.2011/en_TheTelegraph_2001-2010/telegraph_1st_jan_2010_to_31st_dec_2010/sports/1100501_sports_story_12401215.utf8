	Sofia: World champion Viswanathan Anand tossed the solid Slav Defence to Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the fifth game and thus split the point in 44 moves in the World Chess Championship match, here on Friday.         
	Anand leads 3-2 in the 12-game series. The sixth game with Anand having white will be played on Saturday.         
	Like the third game, which ended in a draw with Anand and Topalov repeating the moves, the fifth, too, followed a similar course.         
	Game V started on expected lines as Topalov stuck to the Queen-Pawn Opening and Anand replied with Slav Defence. The first 14 moves were from the third game and Topalov stayed with his 15th move. Yet again, it was Anand, who deviated from the beaten path by pushing his King Rook pawn on move 15 and curiously there was a power failure in the playing hall as soon as the new move was played.         
	Electricity came back after 30 minutes and in came the president of Bulgarian Georgi Parvanov. The power problem was common in the area and the organsiers were alerted that it could recur.         
	Anands seconds Heine Nielsen and former world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov had evidently done the home preparation for the pawn move. While the move was hailed as something new, theoreticians expected that pawn to become weak later on. Topalov seemed to have got slightly better out of the opening when he posted his knight in the King-bishop file on move 18.         
	The Queens had already left the board early and by move 23, Anand had managed to reduce whites edge to the bare minimum. With the rooks and bishops for white against rooks, bishop and knight for black, the game was down to a technical battle where white had to rely on the bishop pair to improve his chances. However, there was very little chance that Anand would lose his way in this position. Topalov had lost his edge to correct defence and probably after move 24, the game was as good as a draw.         
	But not for Topalov. He stretched his position by trying too much on the Kingside even while accepting weaknesses in the black squares after exchanging the black bishop. However, he did not try too hard and put up his defence to come out unscathed.         
	If it was 46 moves in Game 3, two moves fewer in Games 5.         
	At the post-match press conference, Anand said that it took him some time to equalise the position. The g4 move was very important in achieving this, the world champion analysed.

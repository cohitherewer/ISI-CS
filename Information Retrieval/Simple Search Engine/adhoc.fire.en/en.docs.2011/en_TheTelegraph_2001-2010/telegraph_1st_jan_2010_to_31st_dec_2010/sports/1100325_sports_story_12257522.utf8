The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney can win Cup for England, says Kaiser
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooney can win Cup for England, says Kaiser
                      
	Tel Aviv: Wayne Rooneys brilliant form this season could lead England all the way to victory in the World Cup final in July, Franz Beckenbauer said on Wednesday.         
	Beckenbauer, who won the World Cup with West Germany as both a player and coach, said that although Rooney was universally recognised as a brilliant player before this season, he had taken his game to new heights.         
	He is doing an absolutely fantastic job for Manchester United and I must tell you that we at Bayern will fear him when we play United in the Champions League quarter-finals, Beckenbauer said.         
	But at the same time, he is a brilliant player who is playing better than ever. It is not easy to score 33 goals for your club in England, or anywhere else, and if he continues scoring like that and playing like that he can win the World Cup for England, said Beckenbauer, who is attending the annual Uefa Congress in his role as a Fifa executive committee member.         
	I think they go to South Africa among the favourites along with Spain, Brazil, Argentina, because, of course, Argentina have Lionel Messi who along with Rooney is the best player in the world right now.         
	They are different players because Messi is so fast and imaginative while Rooney is so strong, but Wayne has made the biggest improvement to his game. He has changed the way he plays and, at 24, has added a maturity to his game.         
	Playing as the front man, he makes it so hard for defenders to mark him and he is able to use the crosses from both wings so well. I have never seen him play better and I have been watching him for a long time now.         
	Beckenbauer said Rooney would be a major factor for Bayern in the Champions League quarter final.         
	We have a very difficult and busy League and Cup programme going into that tie, he said.         
	Of course we would like to knock them out for revenge for losing the 1999 final but it is going to be tough, and, of course, United have Rooney. Anything is possible but first we have to stop Wayne and no-one has been able to do that very often this season.         
	Bayern host United in the first leg next Tuesday, with the return leg on April 7.         
	Meanwhile, another German great, Jurgen Klinsmann has tipped Rooney to emulate Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by claiming the European Footballer of the Year award if he can maintain his incredible season at United.         
	Rooney is battling to overcome a knee injury in time for face Bolton at the Reebok on Saturday. But the England striker is expected to be fit in time to face Klinsmanns former club Bayern in the Champions League quarter final first-leg at the Allianz Arena next Tuesday.         
	Klinsmann, now living in Los Angeles, admits he has been hugely impressed by Rooney this season. And he believes that United forward is now a genuine contender to become the fourth Old Trafford star to be crowned European Footballer of the Year after Ronaldo, George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law.         
	Klinsmann told the Uefa website: So far, Wayne is playing a tremendous season. Hes really hungry for goals, and he wants trophies now. He looks calm; he looks confident. So, if he continues like that, he might get a shot at the European Player of the Year award.

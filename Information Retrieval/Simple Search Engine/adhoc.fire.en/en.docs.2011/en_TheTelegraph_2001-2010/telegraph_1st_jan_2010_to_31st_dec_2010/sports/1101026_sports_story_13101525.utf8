	Austin: Marion Jones wishes she could go back and change certain things in my past, though she is also is really proud of the person she has become.         
	Jones says in her book, coming out Tuesday, that shes sorry she lied to federal investigators about steroid use, for which she served six months in prison in 2008. Says Jones: I really wish I wouldnt have lied. Thats my regret.         
	Her book, On the Right Track, contains a harrowing depiction of Jones prison stay, particularly one-and-a-half months in solitary confinement. She calls that probably the worst part of my life.         
	Jones says: There were moments while I was there, where you just feel like you cannot go on. (agneices)

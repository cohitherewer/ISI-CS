The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Isaac wants IPL window 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Isaac wants IPL window 
                      
	Melbourne: Alan Isaac, Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket (NZC)s new joint nominee for the International Cricket Council (ICC) vice-presidents post, has called for a window to accommodate the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the international calendar so that the pressure on the Future Tours Programme can be managed better.         
	Isaac, who replaced former Australia Prime Minister John Howard as the two boards joint candidate for the post, said it was important to acknowledge the IPLs influence on the international calendar.         
	The Future Tours Programme has to allow the IPL, because unless it is accommodated, we will end up with more challenges, Isaac told an Australian daily.         
	There will be more pressure put around the scheduling of ICC events (such as World Cups and the Champions Trophy), and those ICC events are critical to members because of the revenue generated.         
	It (IPL) has to be worked into the Future Tours Programme because there is a demand and an interest. The players seem to like it, and there is more money coming into the game, he added.         
	Isaacs nomination would have to be ratified by the ICCs executive committee before he takes over. Once appointed, Isaac said he would look to improve the ICCs image.         
	I think one of the most important things is that we work to enhance the reputation of the ICC, Isaac said.         
	The media are quite critical of it, sometimes justifiably, and lots of decisions it makes get criticised. Each member around the table has got its own issues and agendas, I understand that. It is about leading everyone in a common direction, Isaac added.         
	The NZC chairman, unlike Howard, has the support of India and said he has never had any problem working with Indian officials.         
	There is no doubt (India) are powerful, that is a matter of fact. When the ICC sells its commercial rights a lot of that comes from India, that is the commercial reality and we have got to recognise that.

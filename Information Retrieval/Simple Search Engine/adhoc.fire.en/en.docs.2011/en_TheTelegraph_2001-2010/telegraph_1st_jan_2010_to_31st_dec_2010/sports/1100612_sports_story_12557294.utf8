The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lampard keen to make amends 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lampard keen to make amends 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Frank Lampard has vowed to make his last World Cup one to remember for England and believes the vast experience in the squad could be a crucial factor in their bid for success.         
	The Chelsea midfielder, who will be 32 later this month, concedes this will almost certainly be his last appearance on footballs biggest stage.         
	He is determined to make up for the disappointment of 2006 in Germany when, by his own admission, he failed to fire on all cylinders before England lost in the quarter finals to Portugal.         
	But Lampard admits there is a confidence because of the knowledge in the squad acquired in past tournaments  via the likes of himself, Steven Gerrard and John Terry.         
	He said: The confidence in ourselves is quite similar to four years ago when there was the same kind of build-up pre-Germany.         
	But, by the same token, we know how difficult a competition this is. People can fancy our chances and were very settled in our minds but we have to go out and perform.         
	Lampard admitted: That last World Cup wasnt great for me personally, and wasnt fantastic for the team.         
	We got knocked out in the quarter finals yet again. You dont get that many World Cups in your career and this could possibly be my last, in fact probably my last.         
	I want to look back and say I was part of a team that was successful and have been personally successful as well.         
	If it is the last one I play, well put everything in there to make sure its as good as it can be.         
	Lampard is aware of the importance of England making a winning start when they take on the USA in Rustenburg on Saturday.         
	He said: I think theyll be very organised. It will be a very big game for them. Therell be a certain rivalry considering the players they have who play in the Premier League.

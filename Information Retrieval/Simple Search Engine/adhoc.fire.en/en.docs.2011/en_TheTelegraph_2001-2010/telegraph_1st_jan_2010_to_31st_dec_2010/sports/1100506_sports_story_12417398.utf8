The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo a point from title
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dempo a point from title
                        
	Margao: Dempo were virtually crowned as I-League champions after they scored a resounding 2-0 win over Air India in the 24th round match at the Nehru Stadium, here on Wednesday.         
	In a match they dominated completely, Dempo scored through Joaquim Abranches (63rd) and Ranty Martins (67th).         
	The win takes Dempo to 50 points from 24 matches, 12 points clear of second placed Mahindra United. The only team that can challenge them now is third placed Churchill Brothers (35 points in 21 matches), who now have an inferior goal difference of nine goals against Dempo.         
	Churchill require to win all their remaining five matches with a better margin hoping that Dempo lose both their matches. And the form Armando Colacos men are in, right now, that looks very unlikely.         
	Meanwhile, the visitors, who remain on 25 points from 24 matches and are in danger of being relegated along with their other teams, now require to win both their matches.         
	Earlier, Air India adopted a cautious approach, packed more men in the defence and relied on counter moves to attack the rival goal.         
	Coach Yusuf Ansaris strategy worked in the first half as they kept the scoresheet blank, frustrating Dempo who almost camped in their half but failed to breach the defence.         
	Beto tried a long ranger, which sailed inches over the bar.         
	The trend continued in the second half and Dempo had to wait till the 63rd minute to find the net.         
	Ranty Martins, who got the ball at the top of the box, got the better of two rival defenders and essayed a firm shot which goalkeeper Arnab Das Sharma managed to block, only to find Abranches darting in to head in.         
	Four minutes later, the Air India citadel fell again as Dempo earned a penalty after defender Khelemba Meitei tripped Abranches, who was about to take a shot at the goal from behind.         
	Martins converted the penalty, sending the ball past Das Sharma.         
	Martins nearly swelled the lead few minutes later but his shot was saved by Das Sharma. Minutes later, Anthony Pereira was unlucky when his header hit the cross bar.         
	Dempo exerted more pressure and breached the defence frequently but were frustrated by the Air India goalkeeper who denied Valeriano and substitute Peter Carvalho from scoring.    (PTI)

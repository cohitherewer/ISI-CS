            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly during a practice session, in Chennai, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Surprises and shocks have been an integral part of Team Bengal in their Ranji Trophy campaign this season. While at times they have generated euphoria, on other occasions they have been as vicious as a sharp bouncer.         
	Otherwise how would you explain Bengal garnering points from tough away ties while goofing things up at their own den? Or think of the viral fever, which knocked out almost half of Bengals first XI before their last match         
	And the mother of all surprises came on Monday when Sourav Ganguly decided to come out of his retirement (from first-class cricket) and pad up for Bengals crucial Group A tie against Tamil Nadu, in Chennai, beginning Wednesday. Lying fifth in the points table, the Manoj Tiwary-led side couldnt have asked for a better dose of confidence-booster on the eve of the match.         
	Though officially it has been said that a final call on the final XI will be taken on Wednesday morning, team sources indicated that Sayan Sekhar Mondal may have to make way for the former India captain. Rookie wicket-keeper Geetemoy Basu is set to make his debut in the absence of Wriddhiman Saha (national duty) and Sreevats Goswami (fever). Pacer Ashok Dinda will be making a comeback after missing the last match, against Gujarat, with fever. Sourav Sarkar, in all probability, will have to sit out.         
	The pitch at the Gurunanak College Ground comes with the promise of runs. It will interesting to find out who opens the innings with Arindam Das in the absence of his regular partner Sreevats.         
	Bengal will also hope that coach Woorkeri Raman, who had been in charge of Tamil Nadu until last season, would play a key role in revealing the loopholes of the opposition.         
	Theres no special feeling coming back to Chennai Rather its a challenge because I know a lot about them (Tamil Nadu). But theres no point talking about the opponents We have a strong batting line-up and the inclusion of Sourav adds to our strength. But the players will have to give their best to earn the first innings lead, said Raman.         
	The flip of the coin might decide who encashes the advantage of the conditions. Given the rich form that the Tamil Nadu batsmen are in, Tiwary would hope dearly that he wins the toss. The likes of Abhinav Mukund, K.B. Arun Karthik and S. Badrinath have been accumulating runs in centuries and if the hosts win the toss, chances are they will be successful in piling up a mountain of runs on a favourable pitch.         
	Our batting will receive a huge boost with the presence of Sourav Also I can get his tips regarding the captaincy. And if we can bowl the way we did in the last match, theres no reason why we shouldnt do well, said Tiwary.         
	Without off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and opener Murali Vijay, Tamil Nadus main worry would be their bowling that has not clicked so far .         
	While forecasts threaten of possible rain interruptions, lets hope that Bengal, riding the inspiration of Souravs presence, clear some of the clouds hovering over their chances of making it to the knockout round.

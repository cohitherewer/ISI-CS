                                                                                                                       7                                        Modi wants retired SC judge 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Lalit Modi                           
	New Delhi: The much-hyped disciplinary committee meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to decide the fate of suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi remained inconclusive on Tuesday.         
	This was after the committee members and Modis counsel had argued for over three hours at the Taj Palace Hotel. Expectedly, Modi did not attend the meeting.         
	Modi has been demanding the recusal of two of its members, Chirayu Amin and Arun Jaitley. On Tuesday, Modis counsel pressed for the inclusion of a retired Supreme Court judge.         
	At the end of the day, Mahmood Abdi, who represented Modi at the meeting, said: Recusal is the core issue and it remained inconclusive. Our next meeting to resolve the issue will be held on August 1, he said.         
	Jyotiraditya Scindia, the third member on the panel along with the two others, were present at the meeting. BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan and chief administrator officer Ratnakar Shetty were present as observers. Abdi said he had strong objections against Srinivasan and Shetty attending the meeting.         
	The BCCI in a press release said that Modi had moved an application on July 23 seeking production of certain documents regarding different board meetings to which the BCCI has objected.         
	Mr Modi has also sought a copy of the amended agreement between BCCI and Sony-MSM. His counsel argued that this agreement was relevant for the purposes of his preparation of his defence in the main case as also the application for recusal filed by him.         
	The BCCI has agreed to provide a copy of this agreement to the counsel for Modi on the condition that this document and its contents shall be used only for the purposes of this enquiry and the proceedings arising out of this enquiry and for no other purposes.         
	The reason for this secrecy is that the agreement signed by Sony-MSM contains a confidentiality clause and a limited waiver has been given to the BCCI to limit the use of this document for Mr. Modi only for the purposes of this enquiry, the BCCI said in a release.         
	The BCCI has requested the counsel of Mr. Modi to file an undertaking that this document will not be used for any other purpose but only for the purpose of this enquiry. The counsel for Mr. Modi, Mr. Venkatesh Dhond has agreed to this condition.         
	At the commencement of hearing, it was pointed to both BCCIs and Modis counsels that several statements have been appearing in the media regarding proceedings of this enquiry. It was also decided that the committee would only speak through its orders and statements, the release added.

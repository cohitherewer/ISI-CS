The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We want a little more fairness, says Shilpa
                                                                                                                       7                                      We want a little more fairness, says Shilpa
                      
	Mumbai: Rajasthan Royals co-owner Shilpa Shetty Thursday said that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) should have treated them with little more fairness before taking the decision to terminate the franchise and made it clear that they are ready to face any inquiry in this regard.         
	A distressed Shilpa, who owns the Royals along with husband Raj Kundra, questioned the BCCIs move and said they would be more than happy to know if there was any mistake on their part.         
	We dont want to hurl stones and have not done something wrong. Even if we have done something wrong, I think, as a franchise, we need to be treated with a little more fairness, Shilpa said.         
	In any business if you have defaulted, you have to pay for that and compensate. Just throwing us is not a solution. If we have irked (anyone), we are willing to face the consequences. But you cant just cancel us out, Shilpa said.         
	Royals, along with the Kings XI Punjab, was expelled from the Indian Premier League (IPL) last Sunday for alleged violations of rules, with seven years of their 10-year contract still to go.

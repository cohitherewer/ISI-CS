The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bishan Bedi: Hope Kumble achieves what I couldnt...
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bishan Bedi: Hope Kumble achieves what I couldnt...
    - More and more players should get into administration           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Bishan Singh Bedi                                 
	Calcutta: Three decades after he failed to bring about a real change in the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), Bishan Singh Bedi is delighted that Anil Kumble has decided to contest the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) elections.         
	While Kumble will fight for the presidents post, Jawagal Srinath has his eyes on the secretarys chair. Rahul Dravid, who is still playing international cricket, and Venkatesh Prasad, too, are going to feature in the November 21 elections in Bangalore.         
	Oh, Im so glad... Ive already messaged Kumble that I hope hell achieve what I and some of the others couldnt, decades ago... Ive also said that he and his team must remain clean and above board in all matters... Theyve got to be role models as administrators, too, Bedi told The Telegraph, on Saturday.         
	An outspoken former India captain, he added: I have a lot of time for Kumble, Sri, Dravid and Prasad... Theyve all been great kids and Im confident that theyll actually be able to make a difference... Theyve got character... Id say more and more players should get into administration...         
	In fact, it wont be a bad idea for an Indian Sports Service on the lines of the IFS, the IAS and the IPS... The administrators would then, at least, come through a system and there could be a special provision for former players.         
	Bedi, incidentally, was the cricket manager (effectively the coach) when Kumble made his Test debut, at Old Trafford, in 1990.         
	After 12 years, Brijesh Patel, himself a former India player, has decided not to seek re-election as the KSCA secretary. The president, Srikanta Datta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, is expected to run for a second term.         
	Right now, everything points to a Kumble versus the Mysore royal fight.                   Anil Kumble      
	Wadiyar took the top post in 2007, defeating the iconic Gundappa Viswanath. He would, therefore, be fancying his chance this time as well.         
	Bedi is, of course, confident that Kumble cant be stopped. With Brijesh publicly endorsing Kumble and his team, I dont see anybody else winning... For me, its a given that Kumble will be the next KSCA president.         
	It was around 1977 that Bedi, then still captaining India, initiated the move to oust the Mehras from the DDCA. The Mehras were shown the door, eventually, but the proxy-culture remains.         
	The experience left me frustrated... The DDCA is all about coming to power through proxy votes... (Union minister) Kamal Nath didnt do away with proxies and (BJP leader) Arun Jaitley is, sadly, tolerating that very culture. The proxy business is disgusting, Bedi pointed out.         
	He added: Its because I find the DDCA environment so putting off that I dont watch the matches at the Kotla... It was after many years that I went to, I think, an IPL game on an invitation from (president) Jaitley...         
	I went not because I really wanted to, but because I wanted to do a Sir Don Bradman... He once told me  I dont watch the Packer matches because I want to, but because I want to know whats happening around me... I didnt enjoy the outing, though... Too much noise pollution... There was plenty of pollution in the air as well.         
	Trust Bedi, the unconventional traditionalist, now 64, to be fussy.         
	Footnote: Asked what if some in the Board didnt take to a Kumble win well, Bedi replied: But why not? If somebody wants to do good, then he ought to be encouraged.

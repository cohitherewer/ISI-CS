The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gabon shock Cameroon 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gabon shock Cameroon 
                  Action in the Cameroon vs Gabon match on Wednesday                     
	Lubango: Daniel Cousin scored to give Gabon a 1-0 win over Cameroon on Wednesday as a fourth World Cup qualifying team failed to win at the African Nations Cup.         
	Cousin, a striker for Hull in the Premier League, had a simple finish in the 17th minute after veteran Cameroon center back Rigobert Song made a defensive error.         
	World Cup qualifiers Cameroon, Algeria and Nigeria have all lost matches at the African Cup, while Ivory Coast have drawn.         
	The match pitted French coaches Paul le Guen of Cameroon and Gabons Alain Giresse, with the Indomitable Lions dominating early on as Achille Emanas elusive run ended with goalkeeper Didier Ovono turning his shot on to a post in the eighth minute.         
	Arsenal midfielder Alex Song almost gave Cameroon the lead a minute later, but failed to connect with Geremis far-post cross.         
	It was largely against the run of the play when Cousin broke the deadlock, taking advantage of Rigobert Songs poor defending and connecting with Roguy Meyes through ball to beat goalkeeper Carlos Kameni with a shot into the bottom left corner.         
	Rigobert Song is making a record eighth appearance at the African Cup. Alain Gouamene of Ivory Coast and Egypt striker Hossam Hassan have each made seven.         
	Cameroon almost levelled when Achille Webo hit a powerful low shot that forced Ovono to make another save in the 20th.         
	Emana then provided a well-timed through ball for Webo inside the box, but Ovono again used his legs to again save in the 32nd.

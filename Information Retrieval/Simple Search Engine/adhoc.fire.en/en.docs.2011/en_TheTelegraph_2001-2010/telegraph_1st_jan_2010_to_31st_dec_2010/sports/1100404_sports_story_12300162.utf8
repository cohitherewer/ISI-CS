	Chennai: Opener Murali Vijay cracked a blistering 46-ball century as the Chennai Super Kings kept their semi-final hopes alive by beating the Rajasthan Royals by 23 runs in a high-scoring match here Saturday.         
	Opting to bat first, the Super Kings rode Vijays stunning knock of 127 to set an almost unachievable target of 246 before the Royals, the highest score in the history of the tournament.         
	Vijays innings was adorned with 11 sixes and eight fours, while Albie Morkel also made a breezy 34-ball 62.         
	The hosts then restricted Rajasthan to 223 for five as opener Naman Ojhas unbeaten 55-ball 94 and Shane Watsons 60 off 25 balls went in vain.                   
	Chasing the stiff 247-run target, the Royals were off to a flying start with Michael Lumb (37 off 26) and Naman Ojha producing a 69-run opening partnership. The Englishman was removed by Morkel in the eighth over. Lumb struck four six fours and a six during his innings.                     
	Yusuf Pathan, the Royals biggest hope, however, failed to show his pyrotechnics and returned cheaply when Morkel picked up his second wicket off the last ball of the same over.         
	Watson, who hit five fours and as many sixes, then paired up with Ojha in the middle and the duo added 97 runs for third wicket.         
	The partnership came to an end just when their team was cruising to the target, thanks to Doug Bollinger, who bowled out Watson in the 16th over.         
	From thereon, the Royals run rate continued to dip and they kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Faiz Fazal (4) and Abhishek Jhunjhunwala (7) failed to deliver.         
	For the hosts, Bollinger and Morkel took two wickets apiece, giving away 15 and 56 runs respectively.         
	Earlier, the Royals bowlers literally scurried for cover as Vijay came out all guns blazing.         
	It was a scintillating display by Vijay, who came out to open the innings with Matthew Hayden. Although Hayden failed to convert the good start, and fell for a 21-ball 34, Vijay went on and on.         
	Hayden was dismissed by Shrikant Wagh when he hit a half volley to extra cover, giving a simple catch to Watson, playing his first match for the Royals this season.         
	Next man in, Suresh Raina, also departed after a 13-run cameo that came off seven balls. Raina hit a couple of fours before becoming Shane Warnes only victim of the match.

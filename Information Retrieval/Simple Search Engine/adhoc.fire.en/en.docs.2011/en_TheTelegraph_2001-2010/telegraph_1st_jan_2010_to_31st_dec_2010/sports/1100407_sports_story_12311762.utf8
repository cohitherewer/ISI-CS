The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Selecting IPL team tougher: Whatmore
                                                                                                                       7                                      Selecting IPL team tougher: Whatmore
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Dav Whatmore, the Kolkata Knight Riders coach, admitted at a media conference that picking a team for the IPL was far tougher than selecting a national team.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On Brendon McCullums chances on Wednesday         
	McCullums name will be heavily considered when we sit to select the final XI. The kind of player he is, he should always be considered.         
	The key problem areas         
	We should be able to do well in all the departments of the game in one match. It shouldnt be that if we bat well, we slip up in the bowling and fielding departments. To be able to consistently produce results, we need to perform in all departments in a particular match.         
	If it is difficult to bounce back after losing a match despite scoring 200         
	It is not often that you lose after scoring 200. But thats how the game goes. The morale is still pretty high. The main thing is to get out of that emotion and focus on the job at hand. We need to come back hard and play better. Do the right things at the right time.         
	On Pujara being preferred to all-rounders like Laxmi Ratan Shukla or Vignesh         
	Shukla is a fine player He is training hard and is available for selection. So is Vignesh who is also training very well and patiently waiting for his opportunity. Let me tell you that selecting an IPL team is much tougher than selecting a national team.         
	Will Ishant Sharma be picked ahead of Jaydev Unadkat?         
	Ishant is definitely available for selection and so is Ashok Dinda. We are not in a position to divulge the playing XI now.         
	On the Delhi DareDevils         
	On paper, Delhi are quite a destructive side. But thats how it is. On a given day, any team can make 200 plus. You cant really predict in this format. What something appears may not really be the case. But Delhi will definitely play freely as they have one foot on the semi-final ladder. Its a lot different when you are able to play freely.         
	Any specific strategy for David Warner         
	Obviously, we have discussed strategy at length about how to tackle Warner and a few other important players in their line-up.

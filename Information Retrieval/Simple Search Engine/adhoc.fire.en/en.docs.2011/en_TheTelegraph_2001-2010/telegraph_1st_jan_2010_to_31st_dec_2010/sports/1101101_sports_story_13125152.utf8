	New Delhi: It is a bit of a travesty that on the eve of the high-profile Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match between Delhi and Bengal at the Kotla, the focus of all and sundry was largely on the pitch.         
	Of course, there is some wonderful talent stacked up on either squad  be it Bengals Manoj Tiwary, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Wriddhiman Saha and Ranadeb Bose or be it Delhis Virat Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan, Rajat Bhatia and Pradeep Sangwan, to name a few. Yet, on Sunday, the cricket fraternity inevitably paid more than usual attention to the track.         
	Given that the International Cricket Council (ICC) imposed a 12-month ban on the Kotla after a one-day International featuring Sri Lanka was be abandoned on December 27 last due to a dangerous pitch, it was hard for anyone to pretend that the strip being readied for the Ranji game would not be the focal point.         
	The Kotla groundstaff is confident that the pitch will behave better and that the teams would enjoy squaring up against one another in their opening first-class game of the season. With Delhis attack revolving around the seamers, it is likely that the green tinge will remain in place and raise the hopes of the bowlers.         
	With the two rollers parked a fair distance away from the pitch on the eve of the game, it is clear that the home side was loading the tilting the scales towards its trio of Sangwan, Bhatia and Sumit Narwal. But Bengals seasoned Ranadeb Bose and the lively Ashoke Dinda, supported by Laxmi Ratan Shukla can pose challenges to the home batsmen.         
	Bengal won just one game last season and finished low in the group table but a new dynamism is evident  and not just because the team has a new captain in Tiwary and former India opener WV Raman has returned as coach. The vibrancy stems from the belief that the team has the wherewithal to challenge strong sides in the group like Delhi, Mumbai, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.         
	Our team recognises the league group as challenging and as a huge opportunity to get noticed with consistent performances against such teams, Raman told The Telegraph.         
	We will be without four players who are on India duty but we have the team to deliver the goods, Delhi coach Manoj Prabhakar said.         
	Teams         
	Bengal (likely): Arindam Das, Sreevats Goswami, Anustup Majumder, Manoj Tiwary (captain), Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Wriddhiman Saha, Ranadeb Bose, Ashoke Dinda, Sourashish Lahiri, Iresh Saxena/ Shami Ahmed.         
	Delhi (from): Mayank Tehlan, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Aditya Jain, Mithun Manhas (captain), Rajat Bhatia, Gaurav Chhabra, Chetan Sharma, Punit Bisht (wicket-keeper), Sumit Narwal, Pradeep Sangwan, Parwinder Awana, Pawan Suyal, Chetanya Nanda and Vikas Mishra.

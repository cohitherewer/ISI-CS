            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Was light-flyweight boxer Amandeep Singh too tired to give his best, when he went down to Paddy Barnes of Northern Ireland in the semi-finals, on Monday?         
	If the sources in the Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) are to be believed, the random dope test conducted on him, on Sunday left him too drained to offer his best in the crucial bout.         
	According to a senior IBF official, the trouble started when the officials of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) medical commission, who are conducting random dope tests on the athletes, as per the directives of the World Anti Doping Agency (Wada), approached the Indian pugilist for sample.         
	Amandeep had to drink a lot of water for the dope test, and it definitely increased his weight. Then, he had to go through a three-hour strenuous workout to lose that weight, and it left him tired, said the official. The episode definitely had an impact on his performance.         
	Sources said that the IBF officials pleaded with the CGF medical team to exempt the 49kg Indian boxer from the dope test at least for a day, but couldnt press for it as the rules of the international boxing body (AIBA) are silent on the subject.

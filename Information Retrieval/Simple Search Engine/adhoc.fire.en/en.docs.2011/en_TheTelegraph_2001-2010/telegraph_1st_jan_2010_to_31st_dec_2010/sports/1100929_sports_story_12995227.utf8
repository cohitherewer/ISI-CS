The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney out for up to 3 weeks
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooney out for up to 3 weeks
                      
	Valencia: Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney will be out of action for up to three weeks, his manager Alex Ferguson said on Tuesday.         
	Rooney injured the ankle in the 2-2 Premier League draw at Bolton Wanderers on Sunday and will miss Wednesdays Champions League Group C clash at Valencia and the Premier League match at Sunderland on Saturday.         
	Two to three weeks maybe it depends, Ferguson told a news conference at Valencias Mestalla stadium when asked how long Rooney would be out.         
	Hes a strong lad and hes done quite well in recovering from injury in the past, he added.         
	England international Rooney had a disappointing World Cup in South Africa and has yet to rediscover his best club form following widely-publicised allegations about his private life.         
	Asked how the latest injury setback was affecting the players state of mind, Ferguson said: Nobody likes to be injured. I think hed rather be out here playing with us but hes not. Theres nothing you can do about it.         
	Ferguson omitted Rooney from the United squad to face Everton at Goodison Park 17 days ago, claiming that he did not want to subject the player to the terrible abuse he might suffer at the hands of the supporters of his former club, and there is a view that he could benefit from some more time off.         
	Rooney is also likely to miss Englands Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro on Oct. 12.         
	United midfielder Paul Scholes has a calf injury and Ferguson said he should return to action in around 10 days.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Day, Johnson share lead
                                                                                                                       7                                        Day, Johnson share lead
          
	Norton: Australias Jason Day and American Zach Johnson shot eight-under 63s to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the $7.5 million Deutsche Bank Championship on Friday. But Tiger Woods faces an uphill battle to stay in the tournament.         
	The world No.1 recovered from a dreadful start to shoot a one-over 72 and finish ahead of only five players in the 99-man field at Boston TPC, the second instalment in the lucrative FedEx Cup playoff series.         
	Woods, currently ranked 65th in the FedEx Cup standings, needs to finish in the top 70 after the Deutsche Bank Championship to advance to the third round of the series at next weeks BMW Championship at Cog Hill outside of Chicago.         
	I just didnt have it today, he told reporters. I wasnt really doing what I was supposed to be doing swing-wise and wasnt releasing the putter blade. It was a bad day all around.         
	After crashing to four-over after six holes, Woods salvaged his round amid intermittent afternoon drizzle coming from the outer bands of hurricane Earl, but conditions were by no means difficult with just a light breeze wafting across the course.         
	Woods has yet to win this season but had appeared to have found some form after finishing 12th at the Barclays meet.         
	Day and Johnson enjoyed playing together in dry morning conditions and notched a combined 23-under with Ryan Palmer in their threesome. Johnson and Day lead a clutch of golfers on 64, including Palmer, Rory McIlroy and Geoff Ogilvy.

	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is waiting for advice from the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the Indian teams travel to the West Indies for World T20 on the scheduled date of April 27 in the wake of shut down of airspace in Europe due to volcanic ash from Iceland.         
	Ratnakar Shetty, the Boards chief administrative officer, said that the BCCI is awaiting a word from the ICC as Indian players are to go to the Windies via London.         
	ICC makes the travel plans for the tournament. The team is scheduled to travel to London enroute to the West Indies. But with the flights all over Europe being affected, we are awaiting word from ICC. They will intimate us in a day or two, said Shetty.

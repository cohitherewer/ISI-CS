The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians shock Australia 4-3
                                                                                                                       7                                        Indians shock Australia 4-3
                  Khandker scored a brace                     
	Ipoh: India dazzled with a near-perfect performance to stun world champions Australia 4-3 in a pulsating round-robin match of the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here Monday.         
	Tushar Khandker (19th and 32nd minutes), captain Rajpal Singh (21st) and Shivendra Singh (61st) scored for India while Trent Milton (38th), Christopher Ciriello (40th) and Mark Paterson (70th) were on target for the Australians.         
	With this win, India are the only undefeated side in the tournament topping the seven team table with ten points from three wins and one draw, while Australia have six points from three outings.         
	Defending champions India, who led 3-0 at half time, recorded their first win against Australia since 2003. Both the sides though came to the tournament without some key players.         
	India outplayed Australia in the first half with an intelligent gameplan to contain their rivals and silence their attacks.         
	Their ball rotation and short passes were exemplary as the attacking midfielders supported the forwards to mesmerise the Australian defence.         
	India did not allow the Australian forwards to attack from the centre as Rajpal, Mandeep Antil and Shivendra denied the space.         
	That forced the Aussies to run down the flanks, which the Indian deep defence and wing halfs anticipated with perfection.         
	India play hosts Malaysia on Wednesday. They play their last round-robin match against Egypt on May 15.           (PTI)

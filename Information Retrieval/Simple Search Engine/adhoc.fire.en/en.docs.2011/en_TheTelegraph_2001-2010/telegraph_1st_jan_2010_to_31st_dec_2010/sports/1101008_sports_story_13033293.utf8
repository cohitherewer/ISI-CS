  - Saikat, Tolgay on target in 2-0 victory       A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Tolgay Ozebe and Saikat Saha Roy celebrate after the teams second goal against Calcutta Port Trust at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Two second-half goals from Saikat Saha Roy and Tolgay Ozebe helped East Bengal (EB) continue their six-match winning streak as they beat Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) in their CFL Premier Division clash at the Salk Lake Stadium here, on Thursday.         
	The Federation Cup champions, who began rather sluggishly and looked off-colour in the first half, bounced back with two strikes that had class written all over it.         
	Roy broke the deadlock in the 57th minute, when his intended cross sailed over CPT goalkeeper Sukdeb Ghosh to find the net.         
	The East Bengal winger latched on to a pass and floated one in from nearly 35 yards. Ghosh, who stepped out in anticipation of a cross inside the area, was beaten by the flight of the ball that dipped in leaving him stranded.         
	Though Roys goal might look fortuitous, Ozbey set himself up for a sharp finish in the 67th minute.         
	The East Bengal striker shaped to go outside, then inside and then slotted a powerful right-footer past a hapless Ghosh. The Aussie recruit played fluidly and changed flanks to orchestrate the attacks.         
	With Sanju Pradhan, Ozbey often troubled the CPT defence in the first half, but lacked precision. Minutes into the first half, he made a solo attempt to penetrate the CPT defence, but rounded off his arduous run with a poor right-footer into the keepers hands.         
	The striker was lucky to get off with a yellow card when he tried to punch CPTs Dipak Singh after the latter fouled him in the 17th minute.         
	As Ozbey shaped to go inside picking a long through ball, Singhs sliding tackle brought him down. Both Singh and Ozbey were let off with a yellow.         
	East Bengal suffered a few nervous moments, the most threatening being a gutsy save by keeper Abhra Mondal in the eighth minute. Efemena Charles would have drawn first blood for CPT had not the EB keeper lunged forward to deny him a shot.         
	Despite the win, the red and gold brigade looked weak in defence, and coach Trevor Morgan agreed saying: We made two bad errors. Fortunately, Abhra made a fantastic save quite early in the game and that was the turning point.         
	Though Morgan felt Roys goal was more of an intended cross, he hailed Ozbeys effort. He wasnt having a very good game. But thats what he can do. He can score goals out of no situation, Morgan said.         
	In another match, Mohammedan Sporting beat WB Police 2-0. Musibau scored both the goals.

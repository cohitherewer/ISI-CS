The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batra: HI will keep running the show 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Batra: HI will keep running the show 
                      
	New Delhi: Hockey India (HI) will continue to run the game in the country despite Indian Hockey Federations revival by the Delhi High Court, HI secretary Narinder Batra said on Saturday.         
	The Delhi High Court on Friday set aside the government and Indian Olympic Associations orders of de-recognising and disaffiliation of KPS Gill-led IHF in 2008 after its secretary K Jothikumaran was caught on camera in a sting operation accepting bribe to select a player.         
	Batra said HI will continue to govern the sport in the country as it enjoys the support of both the international hockey federation (FIH) and the Asian Hockey Federation (AHF).         
	The High Court order does not affect us because both FIH and AHF recognise us and not IHF, Batra said, ruling out a change in administration of the game. IHF is a society and any society is welcome to exist in India but at the end of the day to run a sport in the country you need the international federations recognition, which Hockey India has, he said.         
	Batra claimed IHF ceased to exist in 2000 when the administration was taken over by Indian Hockey Confederation (IHC), a merged unit of mens and womens federations, as desired by FIH.         
	Batra also ruled out possibilities of going to the Supreme Court against Fridays verdict, saying, We (HI) have nothing to do with it. (PTI)

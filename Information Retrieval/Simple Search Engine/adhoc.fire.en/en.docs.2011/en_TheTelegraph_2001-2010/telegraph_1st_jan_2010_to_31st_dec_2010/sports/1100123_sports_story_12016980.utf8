            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is set to add two more teams in the I-League from the next season to make it a 16-club competition. Both the teams, according to sources, would be given direct entry.         
	Though the new teams have not been finalised, federation sources said that two public sector units (PSU)  ONGC and HAL  may be the two lucky clubs to get direct entry in the I-League.         
	A final decision would be taken in the AIFF executive committee meeting in the capital on January 29, sources said. Though ONGC and HAL are frontrunners to fill the two slots, both the teams will have to fulfill the AFC professional league criteria before they could be accommodated in the I-League.         
	One of the agenda for the January 29 meeting is: To add two new teams to the I-League next year by direct selection. These teams should not be from either West Bengal, Goa or Maharashtra. The teams should preferably be from Delhi and Bangalore.         
	The AIFF, sources said, are keen to have a team each from Delhi and Bangalore to be included in the I-League. While HAL are Bangalore based, ONGC may be asked to shift their base from Mumbai to Delhi to suit the federations needs.         
	The arrangement, however, would not hamper the current promotion and demotion process in the I-League. While two teams will be demoted this season, the two toppers in the Second Division will play the premier league next season.         
	Asked, an AIFF official said the addition of two teams directly in the I-League cannot be challenged as per the rules. The I-League is an invitational tournament and a separate entity. It cannot be influenced by the performance of the teams in any other tournament or in their respective local leagues, the official said.

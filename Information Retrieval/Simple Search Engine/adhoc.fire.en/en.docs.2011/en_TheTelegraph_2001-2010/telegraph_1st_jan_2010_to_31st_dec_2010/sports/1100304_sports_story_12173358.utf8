	London: Egypts presence in the top 10 of Fifas world rankings proved short-lived as the African Nations Cup winners dropped from 10th to 17th in the latest edition on Wednesday.

	With few games played over the last month there is little change at the top where Spain, Brazil, the Netherlands and Italy remain the top four.

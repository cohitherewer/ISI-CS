            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	Mumbai: The BCCI on Friday achieved a first success in its effort to clear the IPL mess after MSM Satellite, who hold the media rights to the Indian Premier League (IPL), agreed to divert to the Boards coffers the facilitation fee of Rs 425 crore that was to be paid to World Sports Group-Mauritius.         
	The IPL governing council, which met here on Friday to discuss the several charges of irregularity against suspended IPL chairman Lalit Modi, approved a fresh deal with MSM under which the controversial payout to WSG-Mauritius would become part of the rights fee.         
	They (MSM) have agreed to pay Rs. 300 crore as part of the Rights fee to BCCI. MSM Satellite (Singapore) are taking steps to recover the Rs 125 crore already paid to WSG Mauritius and, on recovery, will pay the same to BCCI, the BCCI said in a release..         
	In a separate statement, MSM said it had filed a suit for recovery of monies already paid to WSG and for suitable declarations in the high court of Bombay and that it categorically denied any impropriety in making the initial payments to WSG.         
	Meanwhile, the governing council upheld the several charges of irregularities against Modi and decided to place the matter in front of the BCCI general body at a Special General Meeting here on July 3.         
	The various problems that the IPL has gone through were put forward and decisions were taken. We found out that some major irregularities had been committed by the past chairman (Modi) and discussed what has to be done and how to proceed, Farooq Abdullah, president of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association and a member of the governing council, told reporters.         
	The agenda of the (SGM) was prepared today and all these (issues) were discussed, he said.         
	But the SGM will not deliver the final verdict on Modi. It will first deal with the more immediate task of reconstituting the disciplinary committee, to which the matter has already been referred.         
	Earlier, the committee was composed of Board president Shashank Manohar, vice-president and interim IPL chairman Chirayu Amin and BJP leader and Delhi and Districts Cricket Association head Arun Jaitley. But Manohar recused himself following Modis demand for a fair hearing.         
	Abdullah, who had taken a different view when the controversy broke in March following Modis tweet questioning Shashi Tharoors interest in the Kochi franchise, said more irregularities in IPL dealings were set to be exposed.         
	Did we discuss him (Modi) in the meeting? How can he not be discussed? We were briefed about the wrongs done by him, Abdullah said.         
	People will come to know much more as to what has transpired in various things, how various franchises were added and how irregularities were done, he said.

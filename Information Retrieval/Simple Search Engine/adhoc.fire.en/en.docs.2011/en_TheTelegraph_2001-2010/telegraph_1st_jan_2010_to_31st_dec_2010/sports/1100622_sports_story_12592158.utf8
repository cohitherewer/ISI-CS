The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Has ZC struck a deal with ICC?
                                                                                                                       7                                      Has ZC struck a deal with ICC?
  - Pakistan set to vote with India on Howard issue       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: The pro-John Howard lobby in the International Cricket Council (ICC) is convinced that Zimbabwe will break ranks and end its opposition to the former Australia Prime Ministers nomination as the next vice-president of the world body.         
	Sharad Pawars successor in the No.2 position will also succeed him as the ICC president, in 2012.         
	Pawars elevation is just days away.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Howards backers are confident that Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) chairman Peter Chingoka has been won over by outgoing ICC president David Morgan.         
	Chingoka has been assured of Zimbabwes return to Test cricket, possibly in May next year, with a home series against Bangladesh In return, ZC is to back off from opposing Howard, is how one source put it.         
	Zimbabwes last Test (against India, incidentally) was in September 2005, the series which saw the infamous spat between Sourav Ganguly and Greg Chappell.         
	Nobody from ZC was available for a comment, till late on Monday, but the head of one of the boards against Howards nomination said it was unlikely that Chingoka would go along with a minority group.         
	Look, ZC cant disregard the sentiments of India, South Africa, the West Indies, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh In fact, theres reason to believe that Pakistan, too, will sit on the same side as India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, the gentleman maintained.         
	Apparently, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt is opposed to a politician, who hasnt held any office in his own board, hijacking crickets No.1 position.         
	Pawars case is, of course, very different as hes been associated with the Board of Control for Cricket in India for a decade.         
	Butt, one learns, will go along with the consensus reached (within Asia) before the ICCs annual conference, in Singapore, from June 27-July 1.         
	The regions Big Four are expected to meet before the annual conference gets underway.         
	Butt, by the way, is the outgoing head of the Asian Cricket Council and its Bangladeshs turn next to have their man at the top.         
	Howard is Australia-New Zealands nominee and, had things gone according to schedule, the ICCs Executive Board would have approved his nomination in April itself.         
	Nobody went on record, but till the Zimbabwe development, Howard wasnt exactly assured even of Englands support.         
	England isnt a big player, though. Indeed, to make it, Howard has to have Indias endorsement.         
	Major decisions require the approval of seven of the 10 Test-playing nations, all of whom have seats on the Executive Board.

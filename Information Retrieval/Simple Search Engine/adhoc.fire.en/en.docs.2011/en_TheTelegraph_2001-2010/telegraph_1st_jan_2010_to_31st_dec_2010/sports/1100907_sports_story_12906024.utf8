The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hooper keeping fingers crossed
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hooper keeping fingers crossed
                      
	New Delhi: After two missed deadlines, the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has started receiving safety certificates for the Games venues and its CEO Mike Hooper says he is just trusting that the government agencies are providing authentic certificates.         
	Hooper has so far got certificates for the Games village, the training facility there, Yamuna Sports Complex and the Siri Fort Sports Complex of all the 17 venues.         
	There is a difference though with regard to names to the documents as what Hooper has got are called occupancy certificate not building certificates that were expected.         
	They call them the occupancy certificates apparently. Im sure theyre not going to lie to me. I assume thats what is required.         
	Its just a language thing. Do you call them building certificates or occupancy certificates? I dont know the clarification because theyve only just come over the weekend, Hooper said.         
	Hooper hoped he would soon get the remaining certificates and believed they will be legitimate. It would probably be more odd if they just rocked up all on the same day, at the same time. Theyre coming through as theyre being completed.         
	Im sure they will come. But the sooner they do, the sooner we can allay peoples fears. I still remain confident they will come, he said.         
	The government agencies had failed to meet the deadline of August 18 and the revised date of August 31 to provide the safety certificates to the CGF.         
	The construction delay and recent prolonged monsoon rains played havoc with the deadlines.         
	Earlier, Indias Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) created a stir when it cited suspected sub-standard building practises at various Games venues. CVC inspected 15 venues and found fabricated case material and said regulatory approvals had been forged.         
	Meanwhile, Commonwealth Games organising committee Monday handed over copies of the completion certificates from all competition and non-competition venues, including the Games Village, to Hooper.         
	We got copies of the completion certificates given by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to the venue owners today and, as promised, handed them over to Mr. Hooper, OC chairman Suresh Kalmadi said.

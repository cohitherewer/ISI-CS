                                                                                                                       7                                        Imran blames lack   of organisation 
                  Imran Khan                           
	Karachi: Pakistans World Cup winning captain Imran Khan has reiterated his concerns regarding the lack of organisation in Pakistan cricket, blaming it for the umpteen controversies. The former captain expressed disappointment over allegations of spot-fixing involving Pakistani players.         
	The teams morale has been badly hit and I think unless we change our entire cricket structure nothing will change. We have to change things from the root, Imran said.         
	Imran said it was disheartening to know that the ICC is investigating the national teams third one-dayer against England for suspected match-fixing.         
	Pakistan cricket cannot survive like this in present structure where there is no accountability of the management, he said.         
	Meanwhile, the legal advisor of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Tafazzul Rizvi Saturday made it clear that the latest allegations against the team would not change the stance of the board on the issue. These latest allegations we think are baseless. We will back our players till the allegations against them are proven completely, Rizvi said.         
	These new allegations dont weaken our stance on the allegations, nor does it mean we will change our stance. We are co-operating with Scotland Yard and ICC ACSU in every possible manner at this stage. But we are also looking at other options. he said.         
	Rizvi informed that the PCB is still waiting to get some information from the Scotland Yard on the initial evidence it has passed on to the Crown Prosecutors Office in London on Friday.         
	It has also emerged that alleged bookie Mazhar Majeeds links with the Pakistan team seem to run quite deep as his elder brother Azhar had also acted as an agent for many former and current cricketers of the country.         
	Azhar was once an agent for many leading players among them Shahid Afridi, Mohammed Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq and Saqlain Mushtaq.         
	Well-placed sources said the Majeed brothers namely were introduced to the Pakistan team by former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq.         
	Azhar has also been investigated by Scotland Yard but they didnt charge him on any count , one source said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wait and watch is Tiwarys mantra
                                                                                                                       7                                        Wait and watch is Tiwarys mantra
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Saurabh Tiwary during a training session, in Visakhapatnam, on Tuesday                           
	Visakhapatnam: Saurabh Tiwarys wait for his India debut could end on Wednesday at the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy Stadium here. The 20-year-old from Jharkhand is, however, keeping his fingers crossed.         
	In early June, Tiwary was touring England with India A when the national selectors first picked him for the Asia Cup in Dambulla. Next, he got selected for the tri-series in Sri Lanka. The two tours, however, didnt fetch him a place in the side.         
	The southpaw, though, doesnt have any qualms about having to sit out for such a long period. Getting to share the dressing room with Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been an experience in itself Getting to see them from close How they prepare themselves before going out to bat Tiwary told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	He shot into national limelight after the IPL III and has never looked back since. And sharing the Mumbai Indians dressing room with Sachin Tendulkar has been a dream come true, he said.         
	Getting to see Sachin Sir... The experience has been great. Hes so down to earth. He helped me with the pull shot and it has paid rich dividends In South Africa, during the Champions League last month, that adjustment helped me on the fast and bouncy tracks.         
	IPL has given me everything. What I am today is all because of IPL. It has helped mature my cricket, he explained.         
	What has he learnt most from the days spent with the Indian team? The nuances of international cricket Coach Gary Kirsten and other members of the support staff have been of great help. Kirsten has helped me with my cover drive Hes always there to help you.         
	Ive also learnt a lot about the mental aspect How to adjust to the various conditions To stay focused, Tiwary said.         
	Did he ever feel frustrated at having to sit out for so long? Can anyone ever feel so in the company of such greats? Representing ones country, be it on or off the field, is always a great motivation, he said.

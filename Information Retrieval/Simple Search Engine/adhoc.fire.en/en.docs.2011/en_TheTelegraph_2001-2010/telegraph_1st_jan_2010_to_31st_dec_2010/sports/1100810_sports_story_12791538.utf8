                                                                                                                       7                                        A test of bench strength: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT            The three captains  Ross Taylor of New Zealand, Indias Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka  with the tri-series trophy, in Dambulla, on Monday. (AFP) Preview, stats: Page 14                           
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni refused to count the lack of experience in his side as a drawback and insisted that it helps having youngsters in the team.         
	Speaking at a media conference on the eve of their first match of the tri-series, against New Zealand, Dhoni also said that missing the seniors also provides them with a chance to check their bench strength ahead of the 2011 World Cup.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the tri-series         
	For the last few years, if you see, we have been playing each other quite consistently which means we know each other quite well when it comes to the strengths and weaknesses. Its always good to play against Sri Lanka because on most occasions it is controversy-free. Thats really good. Having played the Asia Cup just a couple of months back, its more like the same two teams with New Zealand coming in. New Zealand have been a very good one-day side. With the kind of talent they have, they have been a very competitive team. I think it will be an exciting tournament.         
	The build-up to the World Cup         
	We are playing all the good teams. Definitely, they all also get some good practice playing in the sub-continent. However, you can call it a blessing in disguise that we have lost quite a few players in the last few series because of injuries That gives us a chance to look at the newcomers and check our bench strength. We just hope that we will play with our best 15 members when it comes to the World Cup But till then, we are getting some time to have a look at our bench strength.         
	Whether some players should be given rest with the World Cup in mind         
	Its very difficult to have a cut-off period. Whichever series we are playing, we are expected to win them and do well. So it gets very difficult to give the players some rest. But at the same time, what we have done is if we find that some player is having some kind of a niggle or problem which can really convert into a major injury, we give them some rest. Like We are just trying to balance it out in a way that we dont have injuries in the build-up to the World Cup.         
	The ideal way to deal with injuries         
	When I get a feeling that if I go and play this series, I may get injured, I try to take some time off, which I did during our last tour to Sri Lanka. I didnt play the Test series. Its very important to see exactly how your body is feeling. You have to assess which is the better option and, more often than not, taking rest is a better option than getting injured.         
	If the hectic schedule is a problem         
	In most of the Tests (against Sri Lanka), we fielded for 120-130 overs. We might have won the last Test but at the end of the day, you are quite tired. As far as the gap between the matches is concerned, that is mainly because of the reserve day. We will take some time off Taking some time off is very important Switching on and switching off.         
	His back problem         
	There is still a bit of pain but I dont think that will stop me from playing games.         
	If everyone is available for Tuesdays match         
	Ishant (Sharma) is not available for tomorrow (Tuesday) He has an ankle problem.         
	On how does it feel leading a young side         
	All of a sudden I find myself alongside Viru (Virender Sehwag), Yuvraj (Singh) and Ashish Nehra as one of the seniors in the team I dont think its much difficult, you just have to put in a bit more effort as compared to the Tests, where we have a lot of experienced players. But its always good to have fresh legs in the side who can field really well, give more than 100 per cent whenever needed. It will be exciting and, hopefully, good too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Day II is a washout
                                                                                                                       7                                      Day II is a washout

	Calcutta/Galle: Unrelenting rain played spoilsport as the second day of the first Test between India and Sri Lanka was called off without a single ball being bowled here Monday.         
	Sri Lanka remained on their overnight score of 256 for two and the washout has now greatly diminished the prospects of a result in Muttiah Muralidharans swansong Test.         
	The outfield was already wet due to overnight showers and things only got worse due to more rain this morning.         
	The brief appearance made by the sun in the afternoon, which prompted the ground staff to take off the covers, turned out to be a false dawn as it started pouring soon after, leaving the match officials with no choice but to call off the days proceedings at about 1500 hrs (local time).         
	It is monsoon season in Sri Lanka right now and the weathermen have predicted overcast conditions for all five days of the match. Chances of play starting on time on the third day also appear bleak.         
	This is perhaps the only ground in the world that is covered in its entirety when it rains. Heavy truck tyres keep those covers from getting blown away in the strong wind. All that, however, was not enough to ensure the resumption of play because of the relentless rain.         
	The break though has come as a blessing in disguise for the Indians and have got them out of a sticky situation.         
	A depleted pace attack had forced the team management to include Harbhajan Singh in the side despite the off-spinner not being hundred per cent fit.         
	On Monday, Harbhajan was learnt to have recovered significantly and felt much better. The fever was no longer there, though the weakness remained.         
	Team India coach Gary Kirsten revealed at a media conference on Sunday that the star off-spinner was chosen for the first Test despite not being fully fit.         
	We had to play Harbhajan today (Sunday) though he is still recovering from flu. He is not in full fitness yet but you know we need him in the team. If he had not played we would have been really inexperienced. He is a gutsy cricketer. He said he wanted to play, Kirsten said after the opening days play.         
	The seasoned spinner had also missed the only warm-up game before the Test match.         
	The opening Test has risen in profile as veteran Sri Lankan off-spinner Muralidharan is set to bid adieu to his 18-year-old career at the end of it but rains gods are threatening to play spoilsport.         
	The Lankans have dominated whatever little play has been possible so far. Captain Kumar Sangakkara and Tharanga Paranavitana struck centuries on the opening day as Sri Lanka laid the foundation for a mammoth first innings against a lacklustre India.         
	Sangakkara (103) notched up his 22nd century while Paranavitana (110 batting) scored his maiden ton, exposing Indias bowling frailties to pile up 256 for two on a rain-truncated first day.         
	Electing to bat, the Sri Lankan batsmen capitalised on easy batting conditions at the Galle International Stadium to take control of the match.         
	It has been a miserable outing so far for the Indians with a depleted bowling attack struggling to make any impact on the Sri Lankan batsmen who scored at a brisk pace under overcast conditions.         
	India removed Sangakkara early in the final session, when he holed out to Sachin Tendulkar off part-timer Virender Sehwag. Tillekaratne Dilshan (25) was the only other Sri Lankan batsman to lose his wicket when he was dismissed by Abhimanyu Mithun.         
	Sangaakkaras 103 came from 145 balls with the help of 12 fours and it was his fourth century against India. He also went past West Indian Gordon Greenidge and Englishman Colin Cowdrey to become the 23rd most prolific batsman.         
	The Indian attack was at the receiving end of a solid Sri Lankan batting display and went wicketless in the whole of the extended second session.         
	We need to be patient with Ishant Sharma, Kirsten said. He hasnt had much game time in the last three months. In his last Test in Calcutta, he made a crucial contribution, got two vital wickets against South Africa.         
	We need to be patient with guys who we know have the potential and talent to go forward. We must be careful not to judge him on one practice game and one day here. Lets give him a bit of a run and see how he goes. He lost a bit of confidence towards the end of the last season and that takes some time to come back.

  - MoM Butler bowls a superb last over; Defeat puts Pakistan on the brink of ouster

	Bridgetown: New Zealand Sunday pushed defending champions Pakistan to the brink of ouster from the World Twenty20 after scoring a pulsating one-run win in their crucial Super Eight match here Saturday.         
	Chasing 134 to win, Pakistan required 11 runs from the last over but paceman Ian Butler bowled two dot balls and took a wicket off the last ball to emerge hero for the Black Caps.         
	Salman Butt (67) hit boundaries in the second and fourth balls of the 20th over and left Abdur Rehman to score two runs from the final ball after snatching a single from the penultimate ball.         
	Rehman swung at the last delivery only to agonisingly watch Martin Guptill come under the ball at square leg. The Black Caps were all over Butler who helped them snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.         
	This is for the first time that New Zealand have beaten Pakistan in a T20 International match.         
	Despite being restricted to a below-par 133 for seven, New Zealand fought tooth and nail and kept themselves in contention of qualifying for the semis.         
	Like New Zealand, Pakistan also recovered from a jittery start, they were 58 for five at one stage, to take the match to the wire. But when it mattered most, they floundered.         
	Having suffered their second successive defeat in the Super Eight, Pakistan are almost out of the tournament and need a miracle of sort to make the last-four stage.         
	They need to beat South Africa by a big margin on Monday and pray that England inflict a big defeat on New Zealand the same day.         
	Man of the Match Butler had figures of 4-1-19-3, a performance he will relish for the rest of his life.         
	Even as wickets fell in a heap around him, Butt batted with gumption and poise to remain unconquered with a 54-ball 67. He was involved in 53-run association for the sixth-wicket with Abdul Razzaq who made 29.         
	Earlier, left arm spinner Rehman and Mohammed Sami had struck crucial blows to tie down New Zealand.         
	Invited to bat, the Black Cpas found a batting hero in their skipper Daniel Vettori, who made a fighting 34-ball 38. Vettori was shared a crucial 40-run partnership with Scott Styris (21).         
	Sami, who replaced Mohammed Asif in the eleven, drew first blood, removing Jesse Ryder in the fourth over the innings.         
	If runs had been bleeding when the fast bowlers were in operation, it dried up when Afridi introduced Rehman (3-0-19-2) and Hafeez (3-0-11-0) into the attack.         
	The spin duo barely conceded 30 runs in six overs between them.         
	The spinners had the New Zealanders in a bind, even bottling up the adventurous Brendon McCullum, who eventually perished to a slog-sweep off Rehman which was gobbled up by Sami at long-leg.         
	Moments before McCullum (33) perished, Guptill, who scratched around for 10 deliveries, had holed out to Umar Akmal off Rehman. And when Ross Taylor fell in the 10th over, it was trouble for New Zealand.         
	The Black Caps wilted as the scoring rate dipped and the pressure mounted in the death overs. Styris, who was castled by Afridi, and Hokins, who holed out to Rehman in the deep off Afridi, fell in quick succession.         
	But in the end, New Zealand walked away with the honours.           (PTI)

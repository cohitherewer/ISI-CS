            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The fixing scandal that has rocked Pakistan cricket hasnt gone unnoticed by their volleyball team. In the city to participate in the 3rd Asian Senior Mens Volleyball Championship, Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas said that it was not something good for the sport.         
	Its not something great In fact, we were worried about the spot-fixing scandal that hit our cricket. But since the incident is under probe, we hope that everything come out clean. But if anything is amiss, the guilty should be punished, said Zaheer.         
	Reminded of Pakistans 23-run victory over England, in an ODI on Friday, Zaheer said that the victory will definitely help them motivate themselves before their match against India, on Sunday.         
	It was nice to see the team register a win after a string of poor performances. They have been going through a torrid time. We will surely take motivation from that, after losing our first two matches, and come back stronger against India tomorrow, Zaheer claimed.         
	But what if they find that the match which Pakistan won was also under the scanner?         
	A smiling Zaheer replied: quot;The way our captain Shahid Afridi was dismissed (run out for 34) one might be tempted to think something was wrong. But jokes apart, it was a fantastic victory by the team. We are proud of them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ win first ODI
                                                                                                                       7                                      NZ win first ODI
                      
	Napier: Scott Styris went from probable 12th man to match-winner, guiding New Zealand to a two-wicket victory in a tense chase of 276 here Wednesday.         
	Styris began the day outside New Zealands starting XI but was called in late due to Daniel Vettoris stiff neck, according to Cricinfo.         
	Styris sealed the win with a six over long-off off the second ball of the last over from Doug Bollinger, finishing unbeaten on 49 from 34 deliveries. He roared as the ball sailed over the boundary.         
	The man was pumped up after he and Mitchell Johnson appeared to clash in the 46th over, in which Styris slogged two boundaries.         
	He and Shane Bond had combined for a 35-run stand that meant Jacob Oram did not have to bat after suffering a potentially serious injury to his left knee while fielding.         
	Although it was Styris who saw the chase home from No. 7, it was stand-in captain Taylor who had put New Zealand in a winning position with his 70 from 71 deliveries.         
	Daryl Tuffey bowled well, James Franklin stepped up as a bowler in Orams absence, Peter Ingram gave them a good start to the chase and Styris did the rest.         
	Meanwhile, Johnson and Styris have been fined for their verbal exchange and physical contact, according to an ICC release.         
	While the Australian has been fined 60 per cent of his match fee, the New Zealander will have to pay 15 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali, Bedi in slanging match
                                                                                                                       7                                      Murali, Bedi in slanging match
            OUR BUREAU                      
	Muttiah Muralidharan has lashed out at long-time critic Bishan Singh Bedi, calling him an ordinary bowler.         
	The former India captain, who took 266 wickets in 67 Tests, has repeatedly questioned the legality of Muralis action over the years, even likening it to a javelin throwers. Bedi has time and again called the Sri Lankan a chucker and urged the ICC to ban the offies doosra since he felt it was illegal.         
	He (Bedi) did not have any variation, Murali, who retired from Test cricket last week after taking 800 wickets, said. He just bowled left-arm spin and the pitch did the variation for him. That is what he bowled.         
	Asked for his reaction to Muralis barb, Bedi stuck to his long-held view that the record holder for Test wickets was a chucker. Bedi said: I dont want to react. Dont want to comment... I dont want to say anything to be honest. You know my views. I dont want to stoop to his level. I dont call Murali a chucker. He is a chucker.         
	Murali also said Bedi was not in the league of Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, Srinivas Venkataraghavan or Erapalli Prasanna.         
	Bedi, I dont think he even comes to a contest on that. I saw some (of his) bowling of his playing days. In modern era, if he plays he will get hammered every ball that is what will happen. So no comparison, Murali said.         
	Prasanna was a good bowler. I have seen his bowling. Venkataraghavan was good. But Bedi does not come under (the same category).         
	The world record holder advised the former India captain to refrain from whipping up controversy. He (Bedi) is also a controversial person. He has lot of controversies everywhere in the world. And he should think about himself first rather than talking about other people, Murali said.         
	Murali said Anil Kumble was the best spinner India has produced, adding that it is the records that speak for themselves.         
	You forget the best spinner is Anil Kumble. Not Bedi or Venkataraghavan or anyone else... I think the best-ever spinner produced (in India) is Kumble. No doubt about it and nobody can doubt it. Statistics-wise and on the basis of other things, he is far ahead than other guys, he said.         
	In August 2007, Muralidharan had demanded millions of dollars from Bedi in damages after the latters derogatory comments about the off-spinners action.         
	In Colombo, Muralis manager Kushil Gunasekera told The Telegraph that the damages bit was not pursued because Bedi got back to Murali saying he had nothing against him but was opposed to the ICCs bringing changes in the law.         
	Prasanna, incidentally, weighed in on this latest exchange between Bedi and Murali and was speaking for his former India teammate when he said the Lankans attack was totally uncalled for.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Well done buddy: Warnie
                                                                                                                       7                                      Well done buddy: Warnie
                      
	Galle: Muttiah Muralidharan signed off from the longest version of the game as its highest wicket-taker on Thursday. The off-spinner received handsome praise from his contemporaries and the games greats.               
	Here is what some them had to say (alphabetially)                 
	Wasim Akram: Murali is something phenomenal. I dont think anyone will even come close to taking 800 wickets... I have never seen a bowler like him before and dont think I will ever see another in the future.         
	Kapil Dev: Murali is a genius... His achievements are incomparable. He faced many hurdles in his life but overcame all like a champion... People should emulate his determination and perseverance.         
	Anil Kumble: It is one of the greatest achievements in cricket Murali has achieved something what nobody would have thought possible.         
	Erapalli Prasanna: He has performed on all types of wickets and terrorised batsmen across the world Murali has left a void in world cricket which will be hard to fill.         
	Graeme Smith: Murali 800 Test wickets!!! Brilliant. Great Test career and a really good man. Glad I dont need to face him in Test cricket again.         
	Kris Srikkanth: I think it is amazing what he has achieved. I have no words to praise him. All I can say is hats off.         
	Jawagal Srinath: The record will stay forever. He will probably remain the top wicket-taker in the world.         
	Shane Warne: Well done buddy, awesome. I dont think anyone will get there, so well done to Murali for getting his 800. I admired him from a distance and when we played against each other we always tried to outdo each other.           (AGENCIES)

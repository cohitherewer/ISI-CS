	New Delhi: When the entire world was busy criticising the preparations for the Delhi Commonwealth Games (CWG), Sir Vivian Richards never doubted Indias ability to deliver a world class event.         
	The West Indian cricket legend, who is currently in the capital to encourage athletes from his home nation, Antigua and Barbuda, in CWG, said he was always confident about a successful Games in Delhi.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Wednesday, Richards said: Such things have always happened in India I have been experiencing it from my cricketing days.         
	I have always seen that you leave everything till the last moment, but it would be done in the end Knowing India and its love of sports, and seeing the opening ceremony, the message was clear that India will put on a good show, said the legendary batsman.         
	I was happy that despite the criticism India could put up such an opening ceremony. India should be proud and I was proud myself. They proved a lot of folks wrong, he said.                 
	Richards, who had visited India several times with the West Indies team during cricket tours, said he tries to keep a track of top Indian sportspersons.         
	I know about (Abhinav) Bindra He won a gold medal in Olympics In fact, I am a sports fanatic and I dont look at the business section of the paper. What I look at is the sports section.         
	Richards said he is also a fan of Indian golfer Arjun Atwal. I have met him at some point But dont really remember where. I was rooting for him when he was in the lead (PGA tour), knowing he was from India. I had a soft corner for him At one point, you had a great hockey team. India versus Pakistan used to be a war in hockey, Richards said.         
	Asked about the events he would attend during the Games, Richards said he wanted to watch the track and field events. Well A bit of shot put and discus.         
	I always pretended in school that I was good at that (athletics). It makes you look good. I was also a shot-putter in school. But I dont think I was made for sprinting. Thats why I appreciate seeing the sprinters at their very best, Richards added.

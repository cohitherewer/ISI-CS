The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru countered everything: Arthur
                                                                                                                       7                                      Viru countered everything: Arthur
                      
	Johannesburg: Virender Sehwag gave the visiting South African team a very tough time during the first Test in Chennai in 2008, former coach Mickey Arthur recalled in his book, released here on Monday.         
	Every single thing we tried, he countered, Arthur wrote in his book Taking the Mickey. He had an answer for everything. When we changed our tactics, he changed his; he was always one step ahead of us.         
	Arthur added that despite witnessing every delivery that Sehwag faced, he still found it difficult to believe some parts of his innings: He scored 319 off 304 deliveries. Some of the 50 came off 25 or 30 balls, and I think his third century came from 84!         
	Arthur went on to describe how Sehwag outwitted his strategy at every turn: I was wracking my brains for a solution to the puzzle, but by the time Id thought of something else to try, (Sehwag) would have scored another 70. I thought we might see the world record. The way he was going, he had the time to score 500!         
	But Sehwags good run was set to end the next morning: Overnight I tried to come up with yet another plan. I thought he might be vulnerable to the short-of-a-length delivery early on  not the bouncer, but the back-of-a-length, chest-high delivery.         
	Perhaps it was a complete fluke, but Makhaya (Ntini) caught him early, trapped on the crease early next morning, and he never got onto the front foot again for the rest of the innings, which didnt last much longer before he knicked one. Whether it was a chink in his armour or not, it worked for us. He certainly didnt score any more triple hundreds against us, anyway.         
	A match at the historic Eden Gardens made Arthur realise the transition he has gone through in his life from being a provincial coach to the head of the South Africa national cricket team.         
	My first experience of Eden Gardens was when the enormity of the change in my life hit me: 80,000 people in a cauldron of frenetic, heaving activity. It was a long, long way from the De Beers Diamond Oval and Buffalo Park (regional grounds in South Africa), Arthur wrote.         
	The magnitude of the job hit me hard, but in a very pleasant way. I was daunted, but not intimidated. I knew I could cope, but more than that, I believed I could thrive, Arthur wrote commenting on the Proteas tour of India in November 2005.         
	There had already been matches in Hyderabad, Bangalore and an abandoned game at Chennai before Eden Gardens left Arthur in awe. India was an eye-opener, a complete contrast and contradiction in so many ways. I said to myself several times during that tour that I loved India with all my heart and hated it with a passion.         
	When we were at the cricket ground it was wonderful  the vibe, the colour, the noise, everything within the stands. Away from the cricket grounds, I really didnt enjoy it much at all that first time. I was never concerned about myself  it didnt matter if I got sick or couldnt sleep. But I became stressed when the players battled to prepare properly, because that jeopardised their performances and therefore the fortunes of the team, the coach wrote.         
	Arthur, however, conceded that he had to change his views in later years because of the better facilities available in the major cities. (PTI)

	Calcutta: Bengal wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha was named in the cricket committee of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) on Tuesday.         
	At its first working committee meeting after the AGM, the CAB decided on the composition of the other sub-committees. Also, the cricket development committee, which was formed last year, has been retained.         
	While Srinjoy Bose will head the IPL committee, Gautam Dasgupta will be in charge of the infrastructure development committee. The marketing committee, which has been formed with the 2011 World Cup in mind, will have Kumar Shankar Bagchi as chairman.         
	All these committees will have more members in due course once we discuss the matter with the affiliated units of the CAB, said president Jagmohan Dalmiya.         
	Sourav Ganguly has been retained as the chairman of the cricket development committee. Also, Surajit Naskar and V. Kumar were named the assistant secretaries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chanu accuses IWF of keeping her in the dark
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chanu accuses IWF of keeping her in the dark
                      
	New Delhi: Facing a life ban after failing a second dope test, weightlifter Sanamacha Chanu Thursday accused the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF) of keeping her in dark about the banned substance methylhexaneamine, which she said she cannot even spell properly.         
	The 31-year-old Chanu, who failed a dope test conducted by the National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) last month, sid she was never informed by the federation that methylhexaneamine was a banned drug.         
	I exactly dont know about this substance and was never told by the federation that this is a banned substance. They never informed me about this. Even all the athletes who have been tested positive in recent times on this substance, they were unaware about methylhexaneamine, Chanu told reporters here.         
	I am waiting for my B sample result. After that I will decide what to do next, said Chanu, a former Asian champion and 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games champion.         
	Chanu, who competes in 53 kg event, was tested positive during the trials for the Delhi Commonwealth Games here last month, her second offence after being caught at 2004 Athens Olympics.         
	If her B sample also turns out to be positive, she may be banned for life.         
	Chanu said the federation didnt tell her that she has tested positive and she came to know about the result only through the media.         
	I had 5-6 tests earlier, which all came out negative. On July 28, I had a test in Patiala, which also came out negative. Then during the CWG selection trials, they found me positive for this substance which I cant spell properly.         
	I was not aware of all this. One day, I got a call from a media friend that I have been tested positive and wont be able to participate in the Games.         
	It came as a shocker to me. The federation didnt send me the letter regarding this. They kept it with them, she said.           (PTI)

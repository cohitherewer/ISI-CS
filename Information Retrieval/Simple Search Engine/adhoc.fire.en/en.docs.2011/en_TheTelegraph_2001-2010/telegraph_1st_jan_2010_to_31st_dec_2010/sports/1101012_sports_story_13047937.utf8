            A CORRESPONDENT            Murali Vijay                           
	Bangalore: Mitchell Johnson enjoys the challenge of playing in tough Indian conditions. The Australian speedster, who has picked up three wickets so far in the Bangalore Test, lauded the Indian batsmen for a remarkable fightback.         
	Speaking at a media conference on Monday, Johnson said only patience and hard work can turn the tide in their favour.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The wicket         
	I guess the wicket was a little flat. We tried a little too hard in the first two sessions and didnt work. Then as the day progressed, their (Indian) batsmen played really well. We stuck to our plans We tried some short stuff But on a couple of occasions, maybe, we didnt execute our plans properly That worked in their favour. Overall, though the first hour (of the day) was pretty hard, at the end of the day we managed to get a few wickets. We are still ahead on the runs and we need to be a little patient tomorrow (Tuesday).         
	The challenge of bowling in tough conditions         
	Its hard to bowl on this type of wickets. And if you have someone who has scored more than 14,000 runs batting, it is tougher. But as I had said before this tour, I like the challenge of bowling on this kind of wickets. We were not lucky enough today.         
	Plans for Tuesday         
	We will definitely be pushing for a victory as hard as we can. The wicket has stayed low and the sun hasnt really come out and broken the wicket as much as we have liked. But there are two more days of play and it might just break a little more.         
	On debutant Peter Georges show         
	He was pretty nervous during his first spell. I think he took a breath after his first spell for his country. He was trying to get a smile on his face. It was difficult A big crowd and a big occasion. Then you have to bowl against some one like Sachin. He did a really good job.         
	Whether they were surprised with Murali Vijays performance         
	I dont know if it surprised us We tried a few things against him, but he played extremely well and was very patient It was a good hundred.         
	If there are any special plans for Sachin         
	Not really Maybe occasionally we give him a stare, bowl a short ball or tell him to hurry. But honestly, he doesnt take too much time Hes in his own little world When someone gets 180-190, theres not much to tell about him.

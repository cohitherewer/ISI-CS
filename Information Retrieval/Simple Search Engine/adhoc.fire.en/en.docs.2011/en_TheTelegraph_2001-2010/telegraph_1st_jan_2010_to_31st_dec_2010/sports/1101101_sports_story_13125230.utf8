  - NZ coach Greatbatch planning a balanced bowling attack with spinners             Daniel Vettori in Ahmedabad, on Sunday                           
	Ahmedabad: After their disastrous outing in the one-day International series against Bangladesh, the tour of India provides New Zealand cricket team with an opportunity to start afresh, said captain Daniel Vettori.         
	This is an important tour for us. India are playing incredible cricket and have such an experienced side, Vettori said.         
	We have quiet a few young players with 2-3 years of experience in first class cricket. We are looking for a good performance by the young players and looking forward to this tour as an opportunity to come back, Vettori said.         
	Expressing disappointment over the Bangladesh series, which New Zealand lost 0-4, coach Mark Greatbatch said the team did not play the way they should have. The coach, however, said that his team was excited to be in India and he was looking forward to the young players to hit form and find their rhythm.         
	Greatbatch said that since the wickets here are quiet different from that in New Zealand, they have been planning a balanced bowling attack including some spinners.         
	Greatbatch had blasted the New Zealand players a couple of days ago as he said that some players in the team arent as good as they think they are.         
	I think some (players) arent good enough They think theyre better than they are and the third thing I think is the mind.         
	Weve got to get our mind right and sometimes that requires patience It requires being aggressive. It needs sorting out the cricket smarts and weighing up the situation that youre playing in, and weve got some work to do in all those areas, he had said.         
	The New Zealand players, who arrived here on Saturday, had an exhaustive morning practice session at the Motera.           (AGENCIES)

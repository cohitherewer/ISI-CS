The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Copenhagen first Danes in the last 16
                                                                                                                       7                                      Copenhagen first Danes in the last 16
                      
	London: FC Copenhagen celebrated clinching a place in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday but holders Inter Milan will wait for this months draw in trepidation as a meeting with Barcelona became a possibility.         
	While Copenhagen were delighted they will continue to mix with the continents big guns after their 3-1 win over Panathinaikos secured runners-up spot in Group D, Inter slumped 3-0 at Werder Bremen  a result that means the Italian club finished runners-up behind Tottenham Hotspur in Group A.         
	Martin Vingaards strike, a Jesper Gronkjaer penalty and an own goal by Djibril Cisse did the trick for Copenhagen as they snatched one of four remaining places in the knockout stages still available as the group phase concludes this week.         
	The other three will be decided on Wednesday.         
	Copenhagen, the first Danish club to reach the last 16 in the competitions present format, finished behind Barcelona who ended Russian side Rubin Kazans hopes of squeezing through with a 2-0 win at the Nou Camp despite fielding a second-string side.         
	Andreu Fontas and Victor Vazquez were on target for the Catalans, who would probably relish being handed an early chance to gain revenge over Inter for their defeat in last years final when the draw is made at Uefa headquarters in two weeks.         
	Manchester Uniteds defence was finally breached after some eight hours of group-stage football when they conceded their first goal in this seasons competition at home to Valencia in what was effectively a shootout for first place in Group C.         
	Uniteds hopes of becoming the first club to go through the group stage without conceding ended in the 32nd minute when Pablo Hernandez fired Valencia in front. Anderson earned United a 1-1 draw and the point they required to top the group.         
	Manager Rafael Benitez can expect to come under pressure after Inter finished their group matches in something of a rut in northern Germany  they have now lost seven times in all competitions this season, as many defeats as they suffered in the whole of the last campaign under Jose Mourinho.         
	Sebastian Proedl, Marko Arnautovic and Claudio Pizarro all scored for already-eliminated Bremen who also struck the woodwork twice against listless opponents.         
	This was a match where we had already qualified. For me it is different. The important game was the last one with Twente, Benitez said.         
	Tottenham will enter the next phase of the tournament buoyant after banging in 18 goals in their six games having qualified for the first time.         
	The London clubs latest goal burst came in a 3-3 draw at Dutch club Twente Enschede with Jermain Defoe scoring twice.         
	Twente, who go into the Europa League after coming third, suffered a terrible start when an air-kick by 40-year-old keeper Sander Boschker on his Champions League debut gifted the visitors a 12th minute lead.         
	Nacer Chadlis superb free kick completed the scoring to give Twente a deserved point.         
	It was important we finished top of the group and I couldnt have asked for any more, Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said. This is just the way we play, we cant sit back.         
	Schalke will enter the last 16 draw as Group B winners after beating Benfica 2-1 in Lisbon.         
	Olympique Lyon were runners-up in the section after drawing 2-2 at home to Israels Hapoel Tel Aviv  a result that meant Benfica will play in the Europa League.           (REUTERS)

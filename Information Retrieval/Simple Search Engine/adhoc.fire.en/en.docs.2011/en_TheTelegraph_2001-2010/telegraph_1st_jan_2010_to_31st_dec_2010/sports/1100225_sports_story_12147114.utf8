The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United nail Hammers
                                                                                                                       7                                        United nail Hammers
            RORY SMITH            Wayne Rooney                           
	Wayne Rooney produced another match-winning performance for Manchester United as he took his tally for the season to 27 by bagging a double against West Ham in the clubs 3-0 Premiership win at Old Trafford.         
	Substitute Michael Owen added the third in the 80th minute, two minutes after replacing goal machine Rooney who executed both headers with real power from crosses by Antonio Valencia after 38 and 55 minutes.         
	United are second with 60 points from 28 matches, one behind leaders Chelsea who have a game in hand.         
	The only blemish for United was revealed when manager Alex Ferguson said afterwards that defender Rio Ferdinand, who missed the game with a twinge in his back, was also out of Sundays League Cup final against Aston Villa at Wembley.         
	But Owens late effort was a mere footnote compared to Rooneys contribution. This was precisely the sort of game which made Ronaldo such an invaluable asset.         
	Ronaldo made a difference. Now, in his absence, so does Rooney. He separates United, the would-be champions, from the ordinary.         
	The difference this season, though, is that he is now their brain, as well as their brawn. He sets the tempo, he dictates the play, right from the kick-off.         
	It was his delicate through ball which seemed to hand the impressive Antonio Valencia. The Ecuadorian, ever more comfortable in his surrounds, produced an immaculate first touch, but scuffed his shot.         
	The escape seemed to encourage West Ham. Gianfranco Zolas side, mired in the relegation zone for much of the season but boosted into the heady heights of 13th after consecutive wins going into this game, had arrived at the Theatre of Dreams brimming with confidence. The Italians team selection  two strikers and the offensively-minded Alessandro Diamanti  belying his intention to attack.         
	The visitors were unfortunate not to find their ambition rewarded. Just moments after Rooney, raiding from deep on the left hand side, had been denied a mesmerising goal by James Tomkins, Valon Behrami, set through by the otherwise anodyne Guillermo Franco, fired across Fosters goal.         
	 Enter Rooney.         
	First, a bullet of a header from little more than six yards after Berbatov and Valencia crafted the best move of the game. Then, before the break, a quite brilliant flick, swivel and shot which left Green stranded, but landed on the roof of the net.         
	After it, with the second attack of the half  Park Ji-Sung had, rather unfortunately, cracked a shot against the bar with the first  a simple header from a Valencia cross, three yards out. Game over.         
	Then Owen grabbed the third after an inspired through ball from Paul Scholes.

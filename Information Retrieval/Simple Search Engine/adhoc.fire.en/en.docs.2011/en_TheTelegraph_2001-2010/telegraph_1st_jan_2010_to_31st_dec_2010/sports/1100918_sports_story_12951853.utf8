The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A Victorian test for CSK
                                                                                                                       7                                      A Victorian test for CSK
                      
	Port Elizabeth: The Chennai Super kings, on a roll after two consecutive wins, face their toughest test yet in the Champions League T20 when they take on Australian side Victoria Bushrangers in their third Group A match here, on Saturday.         
	In the other game of the day, New Zealands Central Districts will lock horns against unbeaten South African side Warriors, at the same venue.         
	The Super Kings have been on a roll so far in the tournament with big wins over Central Districts and Wayamba Elevens, but repeating the dominating performance against David Husseys Victoria would not be all that easy for Mahendra Singh Dhonis men.         
	Batting is the Chennai sides strength and this was evident in the way they attacked Wayambas bowling to pile up 200 runs in their previous match.         
	Murali Vijay, Matthew Hayden and Suresh Raina were in destructive form against Wayamba and would be looking to continue from where they left.         
	The explosive Albie Morkel and Dhoni are also capable of changing the complexion of the game in case the Super Kings top-order have a bad day in office.         
	Morkel, in fact, comes in handy with the ball as well as he proved that by picking up three wickets against Wayamba in their previous match.         
	Spin has been the Super Kings strength in the bowling department with Sri Lankan wizard Muttiah Muralidharan and Indian off-spinner R. Ashwin delivering the goods for the team.

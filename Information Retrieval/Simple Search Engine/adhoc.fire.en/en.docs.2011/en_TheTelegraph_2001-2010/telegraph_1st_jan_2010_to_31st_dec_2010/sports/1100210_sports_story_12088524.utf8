The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina, a Greg protege, gets call-up for Eden
                                                                                                                       7                                      Raina, a Greg protege, gets call-up for Eden
    - Wriddhiman saha only one from the XI to be axed after innings defeat           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI    
	Calcutta: Its to be seen if the Team India cricketers learn from mistakes committed in the first Test, but the national selectors, at least, have certainly learnt quickly.         
	So, Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Co. have not only picked a batsman who can keep, but an extra middle-order batsman, too, for the second (and final) Test against South Africa.         
	The Eden is to host that Test from Sunday.         
	After the innings defeat in Jamtha, the janata may have expected drastic changes, but just one player from the XI there  Wriddhiman Saha  is out.         
	Essentially a wicket-keeper who can bat, Saha was made to play as a batsman and paid the price for not making the most of the unexpected opportunity.         
	To be fair to Saha, though, he had only 35 minutes to mentally prepare for his debut and, as luck would have it, had to take guard in the midst of an awesome spell from Dale Steyn.         
	Saha cut a sorry figure, out shouldering arms, but his backers may argue that Murali Vijay in the same innings and Gautam Gambhir, in the next, perished the same way.         
	The 25-year-old did hold out for two-and-a-half hours, on Tuesday, but the 36 wasnt enough. One way of looking at it is that he was at the wrong place at the wrong time.         
	Of course, the other argument is that anybody with big ambitions must have it in him to actually deliver on the biggest stage.         
	Instead of Saha, the selectors have chosen the in-form Dinesh Karthik, who got a hundred in each innings of the just-ended Duleep final.         
	Karthik, frankly, is a batsman who can keep. Absolutely nobody sees him as the hottest with the big gloves, but its another recall.         
	Apparently, there was some discussion over Saha, but the selectors were somewhat desperate for a good batsman. The XV, incidentally, was picked via a series of tele-conferences involving the quintet.         
	There was no closed door meeting.         
	Centrals Narendra Hirwani is the only selector to have watched all four days of the first Test. Raja Venkat (East) was there for three days; Souths Srikkanth for just two.         
	The most interesting selection has been that of Greg Chappell protege Suresh Raina. Hes the additional middle-order batsman and has taken the place of rookie quick Abhimanyu Mithun.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Raina, thus far an ODI and T20 specialist, edged out Virat Kohli. The selectors are of the opinion that his attitude is better and more suited for Test cricket.         
	Kohli is gifted, but doesnt seem to work that hard... Raina, on the other hand, does... Srikkanth and his colleagues (Yashpal Sharma, Hirwani, Surendra Bhave, Venkat) are extremely happy with his attitude, one of the sources pointed out.         
	Raina, 23, is known to be close to captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. The call-up, however, has nothing to do with any special relationship. Significantly, hes a left-hander.         
	The one other change is Sreesanth making a comeback, with Sudeep Tyagi being shown the door. Without getting an opportunity at the very highest level, that is.         
	Strangely, Sreesanth got chosen even before a fitness-proving match at any level.         
	Hed developed a hamstring problem during the Chittagong Test last month and will only be seen in action on Wednesday  during the Kerala-Tamil Nadu zonal one-dayer for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.         
	V.V.S.Laxman features in the XV, as he has (finally) recovered from the injury to his left hand. Hed been in the squad for the first Test, but didnt play as he wasnt fit.         
	Laxmans cover, Rohit Sharma, also got injured. That was just minutes before the toss, last Saturday, and it was his injury which put Saha in the firing line.         
	THE XV FOR THE EDEN TEST         
	Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Murali Vijay; Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S.Laxman, Subramaniam Badrinath, Suresh Raina; Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Dinesh Karthik; Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra, Pragyan Ojha; Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma.

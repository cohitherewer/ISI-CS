	Calcutta: Suraj Alis giant-killing run continued in the Goodricke East India Amateur Match Play Championship when he defeated Samaresh Sardar, at the RCGC, here on Friday.         
	Suraj, who got the better of stalwarts like Sanjeev Mehra, Udayan Mane and Imamul Haque during the week played flawless golf on Friday.         
	Starting with a par, Suraj parred the second as well to be level with Samaresh. He double bogied the third and missed a birdie to go 2-down.         
	However, he won the fifth with a par, halved the sixth with a par and halved the seventh with a bogey. He then parred the eighth hole to equal the score.         
	A par on the ninth and 10th earned him two holes. And then halved the 11th with a bogey to go 2-up. He won the 13th with a birdie but lost the 14th with a bogey. Suraj birdied the 15th and that helped him to go 3-up. Suraj and Samaresh halved the 16th with a par each and that was enough for Suraj to win 3-2.         
	Suraj will meet Karan Vasudeva in the final, who got past local favourite Rohan Shroff.         
	For Karan it was comparatively an easier match. Karan won first (birdie), second (par), ninth (par), 10th (par), 12th (birdie). He halved rest of the holes except the sixth, which went to Rohan.         
	In the Ladies East India Championship, Gowri Monga of Delhi Golf Club played a superb par round of 72 to win the championship with a total score of 11 over par 227 (78-77-72).

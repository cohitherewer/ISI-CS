	Kansas City: Manchester Uniteds pre-season preparations descended into a physical battle during a tempestuous clash and surprising 1-2 defeat against Kansas City Wizards on Sunday night.         
	Manchester United, who had Ryan Giggs and Darron Gibson booked against the Wizards  reduced to ten men following the first-half dismissal of Jimmy Conrad  were subjected to a series of overzealous challenges in the Arrowhead Stadium.         
	Sunil Chetri made a low-key 21-minute appearance in the second half for the Wizards.         
	Chetri, who is yet to make his Major League Soccer debut, came in for Teal Bunbury in the 69th minute and had a couple of shots which however did not trouble Manchester United goalkeeper Benjamin Amos at the newly remodelled Arrowhead Stadium.         
	Chetri was the second Indian footballer  after Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia  to play against United.

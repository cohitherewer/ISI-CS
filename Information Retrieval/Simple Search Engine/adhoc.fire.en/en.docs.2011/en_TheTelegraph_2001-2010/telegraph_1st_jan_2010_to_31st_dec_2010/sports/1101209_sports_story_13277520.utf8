The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cash-strapped AIFF gets a boost
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cash-strapped AIFF gets a boost
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Reeling under severe financial crisis for the past few months, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) finally heaved a sigh of relief when it managed to rope in its new marketing and broadcasting partners.         
	According to sources, the 15-year contract with IMG-Reliance India Limited (IMG-RIL) will formally be signed on Thursday before the annual general meeting of the federation.         
	 As per the contract, the AIFF will annually be paid Rs. 31 crore for the first five years by the marketing partners with subsequent increases in the last 10 years which may be up to a total of Rs 750 crore.         
	Before signing the deal, the AIFF is also likely to part ways with its previous marketing partners, Zee Sports in an amicable manner.         
	Zee had been AIFFs partners for the past five years but was reportedly irregular with payments throughout the 2010.         
	The new agreement would come as a huge boost, said an AIFF official. We would now be able to take up several projects which were pending because of financial crunch.         
	The biggest hit is the I-League, which, for the first time in its history, is currently being played without a sponsor and television coverage.         
	The AIFF officials claimed that though a few sponsors and private television channels showed their interest in I-League, the absence of marketing partners stopped the federation to enter into a deal with any of them.         
	So empty was the coffer that the national body struggled to pay the prize money for the last seasons I-League and couldnt even gather enough funds to pay the local organising committees to organise the league matches.

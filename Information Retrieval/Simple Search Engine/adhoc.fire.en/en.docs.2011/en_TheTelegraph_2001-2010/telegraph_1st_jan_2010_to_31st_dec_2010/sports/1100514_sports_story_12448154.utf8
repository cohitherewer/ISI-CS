                                                                                                                       7                                      Malik eyes series vs England 
                      
	Lahore: Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik who has been banned for a year by the PCB, wants to play for the national team on the tour of England in June-July when his wife, Indian tennis star Sania Mirza will be busy in the Wimbledon championships.         
	It would make me proud, if this situation happened because it is rare for a husband and wife to be representing their countries at the same time in international sports in different sports, Malik said.         
	Malik also made it clear that he had no issue with Sania continuing to represent India in tennis. Why not? She is an Indian and India has given her everything. Just like I am a Pakistani and owe everything to my country.         
	She has married a Pakistani does not mean her nationality will change automatically. I hope she does well for India at Wimbledon and I also hope to be playing for Pakistan in England at the same time, he said.         
	If both of us do well in our respective sports for our countries nothing could be better, he added. Malik was banned for 12 months and fined Rs 2 million by the PCB along with six other players in March.

	Bangalore: Jacques Kallis and Robin Uthappa hammered blistering half-centuries to pull off a stunning chase as the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) thumped the Kings XI Punjab by eight wickets in a high-scoring humdinger of the Indian Premier League here Tuesday.         
	Batting first, the Kings XI Punjab put on an intimidating 203 for three on the board. Chasing the daunting target, the Bangalore side reached the goal with seven balls to spare on a day when over 400 runs were scored in 39 overs.         
	Kallis was unbeaten after a stellar 55-ball 89 and his effort was good enough for the Man of the Match award. His match-winning innings comprised of eight hits to the fence and five towering sixes.         
	Uthappas 21-ball blitzkrieg of 51 was studded with four fours and as many sixes, while Manish Pandey chipped in with a 26-ball 38.         
	If Pandey and Kallis had set the platform with a 74-run partnership at the start, it was Uthappa who provided the nuclear power in the mid-innings to fashion the RCBs magnificent chase.         
	The stocky batsman took 25 off Sreesanths third over to unsettle the Punjab side.         
	Though Uthappa perished in the 14th over at 143, Kallis and Virat Kohli (16 not out) ensured the RCB reached the target without any hiccups.         
	Earlier, the Kings XI Punjab rode on the 129-run opening stand between Manvinder Bisla (75 off 51 balls) and Ravi Bopara (77 off 50 balls) to reach a commanding total which, however, proved inadequate in the end.         
	Little-known Bisla had captured the imagination of the buffs with a ruthless exhibition of attacking stroke-play. The ball was meant to be smashed and he did that with glee. He cared little for reputation as he treated Dale Steyn and Anil Kumble with casual disdain, carting them into the stands with effortless ease.         
	The Punjab opener struck seven boundaries and four sixes before he hit Kallis into the hands off Eoin Morgan at mid-wicket. But by then he had put the Kings XI firmly in the saddle, a position from where Mahela Jayawardene (13-ball 26) plundered the lacklustre RCB attack at will.         
	Bopara, who wisely played the anchors role to a nicety when Bisla was going hammer and tongs, broke loose as the overs whittled down to notch his second successive half century of the championship.         
	The English-imports innings was embellished with nine boundaries and two sixes.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian batsmen flop, again
                                                                                                                       7                                        Indian batsmen flop, again
                  Zaheer Khan picked up three for 36                     
	Durban: Off spinner Harbhajan Singh and pace spearhead Zaheer Khan plotted a dramatic South African collapse to give India a vital 74-run lead in a topsy-turvy second Test which seemed headed for a nail-biting finish here Monday.         
	After being dismissed for 205 in the first innings, the Indians turned the game on its head by bundling out the hosts for a paltry 131 in 37.2 overs with Harbhajan Singh (4/10) and Zaheer (3/36) being the chief wreckers.         
	The Indians found themselves in a mess in the second innings as they were struggling at 92 for four at close on an eventful second day which saw as many as 18 wickets fall. Virender Sehwag (32), Rahul Dravid (2) and Sachin Tendulkar (6) are among the batsmen dismissed.         
	V.V.S. Laxman and Cheteshwar Pujara were batting on 23 and 10, respectively, with the visitors having taken an overall lead of 166 runs with six second innings wickets intact in the must-win game.         
	It turned out to be a bizarre day at the Kingsmead as fortunes fluctuated till the very end. With wickets tumbling like nine pins, Indias first innings lead of 74 could play a big role. With three full days left in the match, a result is certain.         
	Earlier, Dale Steyn (6/50) and Morne Morkel (2/68) took two wickets each in the morning as India, after resuming at the overnight score of 183 for six, lost their remaining wickets for the addition of only 22 runs to the total in 10 overs.         
	Overnight batsmen Dhoni and Harbhajan struggled to counter the pace of Steyn and Morkel, who made batting extremely difficult for the Indians by generating considerable bounce from the wicket.         
	Captain Dhoni and Harbhajan survived only the first four overs before Steyn ended the spinners uncomfortable stay in the middle.         
	Harbhajan, who survived a chance in the second over of the day when Jacques Kallis dropped him at first slip off Morkels bowling, looked extremely uneasy during his short stay at the wicket.         
	Desperate to go for big runs, Harbhajan slashed hard but a thick edge flew to AB De Villiers who grabbed it by diving to his right to send him back for 21.         
	In the very next over, Morkel sent back new batsman Zaheer for a duck when he gave a simple catch to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher.         
	With India reeling at 193 for eight, Dhoni adopted an aggressive approach and hit Steyn for a consecutive four and a six to ease the pressure to some extent and take Indias score past the 200 mark.         
	But his aggression was shortlived as Steyn in his very next over got rid of the Indian captain on 35, caught at deep point by Alviro Petersen. Morkel then took little time to end Indias innings, scalping last man Sreesanth.         
	South Africa started positively but soon lost captain Graeme Smith (9) as he fell victim to Zaheer, Dhoni taking a smart catch.         
	Petersen and Hashim Amla hit a flurry of strokes but Zaheer, the lone Indian bowler maintaining a good line and length, once again came to the teams rescue dismissing Petersen.         
	Luck favoured the Indians as Kallis was tragically run out at the non strikers end.         
	It turned out to be a stunning post-lunch session with the South Africans losing six wickets for just 57 runs.           (AGENCIES)

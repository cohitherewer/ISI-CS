The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Windies gunning for the mighty Aussies
                                                                                                                       7                                        Windies gunning for the mighty Aussies
                  Kemar Roach will need to be at his best                     
	Gros Islet: With their campaign back on track after the win over India, an inspired West Indies face an uphill task of upsetting Australia by a big margin in the final Super Eight match to seal their semi-final berth in the World Twenty20 here Tuesday.         
	West Indies had a disastrous start to their Super Eight campaign when they were thrashed by 57 runs by Sri Lanka but the hosts bounced back in style beating India by 14 runs on Sunday to bag two points.         
	But that is just half the job done as they will have to win against Australia and hope that India beat Sri Lanka in the first match of the day on Tuesday to clear their way for the semis.         
	However, if Sri Lanka beat India and West Indies lose to Australia then it will come down to the net-run rate to decide the second team and this is a position where Chris Gayles men would not want to see themselves in.         
	Luckily for the West Indies, Gayle has struck form at the right time when he decimated India with a 66-ball 98 and Shivnarine Chanderpaul also looked in good touch. But the rest of the batting line-up would be a worry for West Indies as none of the players could make a mark during their last two matches.         
	Keiron Pollard, the costliest buy in IPL III, has failed to live up to his expectations and all-rounders Darren Sammy and Dwayne Bravo have been mediocre too. Besides batting, West Indies bowling has also been a inconsistent as they were ripped apart by England in the league matches before being butchered by Sri Lanka in their first Super Eight Group F match.         
	Kemar Roach has been the most successful bowler for them and Bravo has also been among the wickets, but their all-rounders have been duds so far and, overall, the Windies bowling has been expensive and error-prone.

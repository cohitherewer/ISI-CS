                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Workforce canters to Derby win 
            
	Epsom: Workforce, ridden by Ryan Moore and trained by Sir Michael Stoute, cantered home with the Investec Derby, in a record time of 2mins 31.33secs, at the Epsom Downs on Saturday. The 6-1 shot gave Moore his first Derby success and was a fifth win in the race for Stoute.          
	Moore had his horse settled in sixth behind the runaway leader, At First Sight, till a furlong from home before coming with a lightning run to leave his 11 rivals standing. At First Sight managed to hold on to the second berth ahead of the two strongly wagered runners  Rewilding and Jan Vermeer.

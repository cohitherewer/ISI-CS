The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC bans Pak trio under anti-corruption code
                                                                                                                       7                                        ICC bans Pak trio under anti-corruption code
    - Will do everything possible to keep such conduct out of the game: Lorgat             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif arrive at the Pakistan high commission, in London, on Thursday                                 
	London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has charged the three Pakistan cricketers under its anti-corruption code.         
	The ICC said that Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer have been notified of the charges, which were unspecified but relate to alleged irregular behaviour during the fourth Test against England last week.         
	The players have been provisionally barred from all forms of the game.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said: We will not tolerate corruption in cricket  simple as that. We must be decisive with such matters and if proven, these offences carry serious penalties up to a life ban.         
	The ICC will do everything possible to keep such conduct out of the game and we will stop at nothing to protect the sports integrity. While we believe the problem is not widespread, we must always be vigilant.         
	It is important, however, that we do not pre-judge the guilt of these three players. That is for the independent tribunal alone to decide.         
	The three Pakistani cricketers at the centre of spot-fixing allegations would be questioned by police on Friday after their pull out citing mental fatigue, from the squad to face England, ensured that the Twenty20 and one-day series will begin as scheduled on Sunday.         
	Butt and bowlers Asif and Aamer will be interviewed under caution by detectives from Scotland Yard.         
	The trio protested their innocence for the first time since the scandal broke, but are being viewed as suspects in the alleged conspiracy. They are not expected to be arrested however, and have agreed to attend the interviews voluntarily.         
	Officers from Pakistans Federal Investigation Agency also visited Aamers family home in the Punjab province on Thursday.         
	Fridays police action comes after the players were forced to pull out from the squad in the face of concerted pressure from the England and Wales Cricket Board and the ICC.         
	The official line from the Pakistan camp, announced by Pakistans high commissioner to London Wajid Shamsul Hasan, was that they had pulled out because the mental fatigue of the last week meant they are not in the right frame of mind to play.         
	In fact their withdrawal was only secured after a round of intense negotiations on Wednesday between the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman and the ECB and ICC.         
	Both the ECB and the ICC have insisted that the players could not feature in the one-dayers if the series was to have any credibility, and they believed that had the support of the PCB following two days of talks in London.         
	On Wednesday evening, however, Butt had suggested that as the players had not been charged with any offence they would be available for selection this weekend.         
	While his comments may have been directed at his domestic audience, they sparked an angry response from ECB chairman Giles Clarke, who has staked a considerable amount of personal time and credibility on helping the rehabilitation of Pakistan cricket this summer.         
	Pakistan have been unable to host international cricket since a terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team last year, and Clarke helped facilitate the neutral series against Australia played in England earlier this summer. He also chairs the ICCs Pakistan Task Group.         
	Clarke is understood to have made it clear to Butt that the trios participation would not be countenanced, a view endorsed by ICC chief executive Lorgat, who flew into London on Wednesday and joined Clarke in negotiations with the PCB.         
	Eventually their view prevailed and the Pakistan camp agreed to withdraw the players. To save face and offer the players an elegant exit, however, it was framed as a personal choice. One source described suggestions that the players had chosen to step down as complete nonsense.         
	The players withdrawal was announced by Hasan following a two-hour meeting with them on Thursday.         
	The players said they are entirely innocent in the whole episode and shall defend their innocence as such, he said. They maintain that on account of the mental fatigue which has deeply affected them, they are not in the right frame of mind to play the remaining matches. Therefore, they have requested the PCB not to consider them for the remaining matches until their names are cleared.

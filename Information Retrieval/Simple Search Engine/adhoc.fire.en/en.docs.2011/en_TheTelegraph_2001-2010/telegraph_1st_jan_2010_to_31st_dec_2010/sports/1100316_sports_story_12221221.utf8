The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Knights have been impressive:   Gavaskar
                                                                                                                       7                                      The Knights have been impressive:   Gavaskar
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Legendary Sunil Gavaskar feels that Kolkata Knight Riders have made a great start in the third edition of Indian Premier League but there is still a long way to go.         
	KKR have been very impressive during the first two matches. They have really played well.         
	But there are 12 more matches to go and they need to be consistent, Gavaskar said after the inauguration of the ITF Futures Meet at the Pailan World School Residential Tennis Academy on Monday.         
	The former Indian captain lavished praise on Rajasthan Royals Yusuf Pathan who hit a blistering 37-ball 100 against Mumbai Indians on Saturday.         
	It was a brilliant knock from Yusuf, he said.         
	When asked that whether he agreed with Gary Sobers opinion he was a better batsman than Sachin Tendulkar, he gave a different perspective.         
	It is unfair to compare players from two different generations. I played in a different era.         
	So when you are comparing me with someone, he should be from my time. Similarly, Sachin belongs to a different era. He should be compared with players of his generation, he explained.         
	When asked about his favourite tennis player, Gavaskar said: quot;Rod Laver. My all-time favourite. quot;

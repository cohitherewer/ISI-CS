The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our bowlers are unique: Kumar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Our bowlers are unique: Kumar
  - Its a privilege to be ranked the No. 1 batsman, says Lanka captain       A CORRESPONDENT            Kumar Sangakkara during a practice session, in Colombo, on Monday. (AP)                                 
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara said on the eve of the third and final Test, against India, that his team is not worried with slip in the International Cricket Council Test rankings and their sole objective is to win the series.         
	Speaking at a media conference, on Monday, he also said that it was impossible to replace someone of the stature of Muttiah Muralidharan and they were not even trying to do so.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On being the No. 1 batsman         
	Its a privilege to be ranked the No. 1 batsman. I have been there once before and its nice to get back on the top. The challenge is not about getting there, but staying there.         
	If the team is disappointed with the rankings         
	The motivation is still there to win the Test series thats the fact that we are concentrating on. We didnt know about the rankings when the series started. There has been a call for a revamp of the system where actually one understands what the rankings are all about. Even the ICC is pretty much convinced that they need a more relevant, more pertinent ranking system than the one there is now.         
	Plans about the third Test         
	There are five days to go before anything is decided upon . We just want to try and win the Test match starting Tuesday. Our focus in on doing that and playing good cricket over the five days, putting enough pressure on the Indians and getting 20 wickets of theirs, which is not easy to do on any pitch. Well think about that and then talk about rankings.         
	The team         
	We named 17 for Tuesday The final selection will be the one which will be debated on and decided upon this evening. Tharanga Paranavitana is also fine after he got hit on his unprotected left hand while being at the non strikers end.         
	Lankan bowling attack         
	The bowlers we have are quite different, quite unique in their own way. Every time you have a different attack, you got to rethink your strategy. All bowlers should realise that the key to bowling well on any wicket is line and length and how quickly you adjust those two things, depending on the wicket and the batsman. Shorter balls should be used effectively as a surprise.         
	On Lasith Malinga         
	Malinga is back and strong He had a good bowling session today (Monday). We will wait for an update this evening as we are having a selection meeting We will then select the team for Tuesday.         
	If he would pick Malinga         
	Its a pretty tough call. Ultimately, its a feel thing where as long as the player is feeling fine and strong, not just physically but more importantly mentally, and if he feesl that he is supported by the squad, the selectors and the administration. Their commitment and their focus also improves when they know that they are backed 100 per cent to give their best on the field. That goes for any player, not just Malinga. Once they know that the right atmosphere and the right environment is there to concentrate on their cricket without any fear of repercussions, or even if there is an injury that they will be properly looked after having been injured playing for their country, the mental confidence imporves a huge deal. Its very important for fast bowlers, especially on the subcontinent tracks, that they are made to understand that what they are doing is important for their teams and their countries and that they are going to be backed 100 per cent no matter what happens out there.         
	The P. Sara Oval wicket         
	Its a pretty good wicket but it depends on how you play Looks can be deceptive, especially in Sri Lanka. Lets play on it and see how it goes As long as the sides keep playing the way they did over the past two Tests, I think there will be a result.         
	The SSC track in the last Test         
	Once you see a wicket like that, the attitude you take into it is very important. When we were fielding, our attitude was to develop as many chances as possible We did manage to do that but unfortunately, we wasted a few of those. There were a few close shouts as well. We were pretty happy with the way we created chances. It depends on how each country approaches it and how it seems to them at that particular time.         
	On the Sri Lankan selectors         
	Its a privilege working with this panel of selectors They are very experienced and they also have the right mindset about Sri Lankan cricket and its cricketers. Every player should be treated in the same way.         
	The decision review system         
	We analysed the leg before shouts and they looked pretty dead. But we might have lost a few of those with the review system. But having said all of that, I am a great fan of the review system and I think it should be implemented as soon as possible in all Test matches.         
	Too many players getting injured these days         
	I dont know whether all the countries have proper schemes to look after players who are injured or who may have finished their careers because of an injury. It needs to be done to make sure that their life after that injury and after cricket is taken care of Insurance schemes, pension schemes and things like that are very important. Those kind of fears are very realistic in the modern day and cricketers life spans are getting shorter with the amount of cricket being played the different formats.         
	If it is possible to replace Muralidharan         
	It will take some time to fill the shoes of Murali. If you say you are looking for the next Murali, it is not fair on the other bowlers. There will never be another Murali. We should not try to compare any bowler with Murali If you do that, its a slur on him as well as the bowler. We must try to get the maximum out of the present lot. No one is going to get anywhere close to Muralis record. We are not trying to replace Murali, but to get bowlers capable of bowling sides out.

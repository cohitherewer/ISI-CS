	Melbourne: Sania Mirza crashed out of the Australian Open singles after suffering a straight-set defeat in the first round at the hands of 26th seed Aravane Rezai of France here Tuesday.         
	The unseeded Indian lost 4-6, 2-6 in one hour and nine minutes to the world No.27, at Melbourne Park.         
	Now, Sania would look to do well in the doubles where she has been seeded 10th along with her Spanish partner Virginia Ruano Pascual.         
	Somdev Dev Varman and Prakash Amritraj have been given a wild card entry in doubles. They will be up against Americans James Cerretani and Travis Rettenmaier Wednesday. (PTI)

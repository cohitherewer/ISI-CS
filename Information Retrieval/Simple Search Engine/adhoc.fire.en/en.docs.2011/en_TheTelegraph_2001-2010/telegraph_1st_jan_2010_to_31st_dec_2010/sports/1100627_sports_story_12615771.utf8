	Bridgetown: Off-spinner Johan Botha claimed 3/37 as South Africa reduced West Indies to 159/5 at tea on the opening day of the third Test on Saturday.         
	Botha grabbed three quick wickets after lunch at Kensington Oval with the home team slumping to 105-5.         
	Dwayne Bravo and Denesh Ramdin shared an unbroken stand of 54 to lift the hosts. Bravo struck two fours and a six in an unbeaten 36 while fellow Trinidadian Ramdin hit three fours in 22 not out off 61 deliveries.         
	Pace pair Dale Steyn (1-29) and Morne Morkel (1-48) struck first after West Indies won the toss and chose to bat.         
	Dale Richards was leg before to Morkel for a duck while captain Chris Gayle dragged on from Steyn to leave his team on 21-2.         
	Left-handers Shivnarine Chanderpaul (22) and Narsingh Deonarine (46) put on 55 for the third wicket before Botha took over after the break.         
	Chanderpaul, who hit one six off 63 balls, edged a drive and Jacques Kallis grabbed a brilliant left-handed catch just off the ground.         
	Brendan Nash (2) soon followed, finally adjudged leg before wicket. Umpire Simon Taufel was forced to overturn his original not out decision after South Africa asked for a review.         
	Deonarine fell four short of his 50 when he tried a pull shot and was bowled by Botha. He hit seven fours off 106 balls.           (AGENCIES)

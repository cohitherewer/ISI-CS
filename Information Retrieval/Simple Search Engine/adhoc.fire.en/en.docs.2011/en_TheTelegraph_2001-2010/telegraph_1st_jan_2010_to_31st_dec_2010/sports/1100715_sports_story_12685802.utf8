	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders coach Dav Whatmore feels that young left-arm pacer Jaidev Unadkat, is destined for bigger things in the coming days.         
	Jaidev is a very talented youngster. He is very sincere and hardworking, which makes his case even more strong. I am very impressed with his performance for India A during the recently concluded England tour. He is a quick learner. The fact that he is a KKR player makes me even more happy. It also augurs well for our team, Whatmore, who was in the city to attend a promotional event organised by the TTIS, said. Unadkat is currently in Sri Lanka with the Indian team as net bowler.         
	The KKR coach is also happy that Wriddhiman Saha, who also is in Sri Lanka with the senior side, has been doing well. He didnt forget to mention Ashok Dindas name.         
	Both Wriddhiman and Dinda have shown a lot of heart. They need to keep up the good work and maintain consistency, the coach said.         
	Whatmore, however didnt air his views on the player retention policy during the next edition of Indian Premier League. I am hearing a lot of things but it wouldnt be fair to comment until we get concrete information about player retention policy. At this point of time, we will be focussing on players who wouldnt be put up for auction. We would like to select players who would be given three-year contracts.         
	Talking about India missing the experience of pace spearhead Zaheer Khan against Sri Lanka, Whatmore said: It is unfortunate that India will miss the services of someone like Zaheer.         
	Earlier, Whatmore expressed his disappointment at Cheteshwar Pujara being ignored for Sri Lanka Test series. Pujara, who captained India A during their tour of England and Scotland emerged as the top scorer in both first-class as well as one-day matches.

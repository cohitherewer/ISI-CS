	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt will be grilled by the special task force of the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday in a teleconference, a PCB source said Tuesday.         
	Sources said that the teleconference was due to be held on Saturday basically to discuss the measures taken by the PCB to improve its governance and implement recommendations of the ICC made to the PCB at the last executive board meeting held early this month in Dubai.         
	Butt will be asked about the steps taken by the PCB to enforce the recommendations made by the ICC board which is not willing to give much leeway to the chairman, a source said.         
	He said that at the last ICC board meeting, Butt had been clearly told that either he needed to put his house in order or face possible sanctions. (PTI)

	New Delhi: A week after the Commonwealth Games organising committee paid $325,000 to bail out the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF), seasoned lifter and former Asian champion Sanamacha Chanu failed the dope test conducted by the National Anti Doping Agency (Nada).         
	According to IWF sources, the 53kg lifter, who was caught for a similar offence during the Athens Olympics in 2004, tested positive for banned substance methylhexaneamine. As per the regulations of the international weightlifting body, Chanu is expected to face life ban if her B sample also turns out to be positive and she fails to clear her name before the Nada hearing panel.         
	The 31-year-old lifter, however, was not a part of the Commonwealth Games team though she appeared for the trials. All our 15 team members have passed the tests, claimed the IWF secretary Sahadev Yadav. Last year, the IWF was fined $500,000 by the international body after eight Indian weightlifters failed dope tests. While six were caught by World Anti Doping Agency (Wada), two were banned by Nada.         
	The Indian body could not raise more than $125,000 and was on the verge of getting banned from participating in the Commonwealth Games when the Ministry of Sports came to its rescue and asked the organising committee to pay the rest of the penalty.         
	Interestingly, Chanu was tested four times this year and was given a clean chit on the first three occasions. After successfully going through the dope tests in February, March and July, she failed to clear the hurdle on August 4 tests thus becoming the 12th athlete to be caught in the Nada net. All 12 have tested positive for banned substance methylhexaneamine.

            ROYAL BAFOKENG                                
	The Royal Bafokeng Sports Palace is named after the Bafokeng people who live in the area. In 1999, the Bafokeng won a legal battle, which entitled them to 20 per cent on the platinum which is mined on their historical land. Hence, they have shares in platinum mining in the area. Upon completion, the stadium will seat 44, 530. The South African national team played a World Cup qualifying game against Burkina Faso in 2001, and won 2-1. It has been host to many Premier Soccer League games despite Rustenburg not having its own team. The stadium is only a 25 minute drive from Sun City and 30 minutes from Pilansberg. It is 12 kilometres from the Rustenburg city centre.

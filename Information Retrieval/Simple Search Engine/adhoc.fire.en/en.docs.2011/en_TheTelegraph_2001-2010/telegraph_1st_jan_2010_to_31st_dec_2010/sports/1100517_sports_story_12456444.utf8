The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Webber on his mark, Schumi penalised
                                                                                                                       7                                        Webber on his mark, Schumi penalised
                  Mark Webber celebrates his victory on Sunday                     
	Monaco: Mark Webber swept to victory in the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday in a Red Bull one-two that catapulted the Australian to the top of the Formula One leaderboard.         
	The first Australian winner in the Mediterranean principality since triple world champion Jack Brabham in 1959, Webber led from pole to finish for his second victory in a row and fourth of his career.         
	Absolutely incredible, for sure this is the greatest day of my life today, Webber said.         
	The last Australian to lead the world championship was Alan Jones in 1981.         
	Michael Schumacher was stripped of sixth place for illegally overtaking Ferraris Fernando Alonso on the last corner of the race.         
	The decision by stewards, announced some two and a half hours after the race ended, to impose a 20-second penalty dropped Schumacher out of the points to 12th place and moved Alonso up into sixth instead.         
	The Spaniard is now third overall in the championship, three adrift of Red Bulls Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel.         
	The stewards, who included Schumachers old rival and 1996 world champion Damon Hill, ruled that the seven-time champion had breached the rules in passing Alonso moments after the safety car had pulled off.         
	They decided to impose a drive through penalty, translated into a time penalty due to the offence happening at the end of the race.         
	The incident happened barely 50 metres from Rascasse, the corner where Schumacher caused uproar on his last appearance at Monaco in 2006 when, as a Ferrari driver, he blocked the track at the end of qualifying to deny Alonso pole. Alonso started that race from pole position after the stewards punished Schumacher by sending him to the back of the grid.         
	Ironically, Alonso started Sundays race from the back of the grid after crashing his Ferrari in Saturdays final free practice.         
	In a race punctuated by crashes and four safety car periods, including the last three laps, Germanys Sebastian Vettel anchored Red Bulls second one-two in six races with Polands Robert Kubica third for Renault.         
	Vettel crossed the line just 0.4 seconds behind the triumphant Webber, with the field queuing up behind the safety car to the final corner as the Red Bull mechanics leant over the pitwall to clap them home.         
	World champion Jenson Button, who won in Monaco last year and had led the standings before the showcase race of the season, retired on the third lap with smoke coming out of his McLarens engine.         
	Webber took over at the top with 78 points, the same number as Vettel who has just one win this year, with Ferraris Fernando Alonso third with 73 after roaring from last to seventh in the race.         
	Button, who has also won twice this year, slipped to fourth place with 70 points.         
	Ferraris Felipe Massa finished fourth with Britains Lewis Hamilton fifth for McLaren after questioning his teams advice to save the brakes.         
	Germanys Adrian Sutil was eighth for Force India with Italian teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi ninth.           (REUTERS)

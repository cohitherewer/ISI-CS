The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nirupama to team up with Sania 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nirupama to team up with Sania 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: After Sania Mirza, who? Indias national selectors have to find quick solutions to some uncomfortable questions as they get ready to pick the womens tennis squad for the Commonwealth Games on Friday.         
	If the governments guideline on eligibility criteria ruled out two of the best players  Sunitha Rao and Shikha Uberoi  the lack of bench strength has been exposed by the fact that the selectors have been forced to call up veteran Nirupama Vaidyanathan-Sanjeev out of retirement.         
	Mirza might have slipped to 153 in world rankings, but she still is 240 places ahead of the next best player  Poojashree. The aim is to get a medal and we are trying to put the best team on the court, Enrico Piperno, captain of the Indian team, told The Telegraph from Pune where the players are undergoing a selection camp since last Thursday.         
	We have called up Niru (Nirupama) mainly with the idea of pairing her with Sania (Mirza) in the doubles. If she is good enough, then why not? But its unfortunate that no youngster has stepped up (to fill the void) after we lost Sunitha and Shikha.         
	Until 2003, Nirupama was Indias No.1 player and the first to reach the main draw of a Grand Slam, at the Australian Open in 1999. The 33-year-old, now a mother of a four-year-old daughter, runs her own academy in California, USA. She has been making a staggered return to the courts, winning the first round of a $50,000 ITF tournament in Pune last year and trying to qualify for a few events this year.         
	Tara Iyer is another player who has received the national call out of the blue. The 22-year-old is clearly the best of the young crop but her career has been hampered by a knee injury.         
	The focus, however, would be on Indias No. 1 player herself. The 23-year-old suffered a new low when she lost in the second round of a $25000 ITF event in the UK last month. But, more than her form, it is her fitness that would be a concern.         
	We hope Sania stays injury-free, because if she is injured after the team is announced, we might not be able to make a replacement, Piperno said.         
	Ironically, tennis has been included in the CWG programme for the first time.

	London: Pakistan transformed the third Test against England at the Oval on Friday in a spectacular passage of bowling immediately after tea on the third day of the third Test.         
	Six England second innings wickets fell for 26 runs as they collapsed from the comparative comfort of 194 for three at tea to 221 for nine when bad light stopped play.         
	England, who are 2-0 ahead in the four-match series, hold an overall lead of 146 with one wicket in hand.         
	After Alastair Cook had ended a batting slump stretching back to the start of the season with 110, including 16 boundaries, England appeared in no trouble on a good pitch against some lacklustre bowling.         
	Cook made a fast start after coming into the match with 106 runs from eight innings.         
	He scored two boundaries in succession through the slips off Mohammed Asif and carved Wahab Riaz for another four through the vacant fourth slip position.         
	Cook continued to go for his shots, contributing 87 in a second wicket partnership of 116 with Jonathan Trott before he was out after more than doubling his previous Test aggregate of 106 runs from eight innings this season.         
	His hundred came up in bizarre circumstances when Asif, who looked out of sorts all day, gathered the ball on the bounce and threw it over wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal for four overthrows.         
	Englands rot started in the first over after tea when Kevin Pietersen was clean bowled through the gap by off-spinner Saeed Ajmal for 23.           (REUTERS)

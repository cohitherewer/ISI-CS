The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Played natural game: Rahane
                                                                                                                       7                                      Played natural game: Rahane
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A century is uplifting when it is scored against tough challenge and not when it comes against incompetence. Ajinkya Rahane, who scored his 15th first class hundred on Wednesday, was not exactly elated, but had a nonchalant look on his face.         
	The Mumbai top-order batsman made full use of the early reprieve and made Bengal pay for it. I was playing my natural game. Thank God, they dropped me on 12. I took full advantage of it and scored my hundred, Rahane said at the close of the first days play on Wednesday.         
	Rahane had missed Mumbais first match against Saurashtra due to injury and was determined to make it count against Bengal. I was disappointed to miss the first match. I wanted to make up for that. That made me more focused, he said.         
	The Bengal pacers lacked penetration and barring Ashok Dinda, none of the other seamers got a chance against the Mumbai batsman. The Eden Gardens wicket had a slight tinge of grass on it, but there was no perceptible movement off the deck.         
	Thanks to some toothless bowling, Rahane made his maiden first class outing at the Eden Gardens memorable. I have played an U-19 match at the Eden before. But this was my first first-class match here, he said.         
	The Mumbai Indians opener said he considers Sachin Tendulkar his role model and has picked a lot from him. He (Sachin Tendulkar) might not be with the team always, but is a huge influence on the squad. I have improved following a lot of tips from him, Rahane said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Harmonica fancied 
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Harmonica fancied 
            HONKY DORY                        
	Harmonica is strongly fancied to lift the 1,600m Topmost Trophy, the main attraction at the Mumbai races on Saturday. The Gaswar-Titanium daughter seems to be coming right after her doleful performance in the Calcutta Oaks and she is unlikely to miss this time over her favourite trip. Imran Chisty partners the Sanjay Kolse-trained four-year-old filly. Misschevious Trot may follow Harmonica home.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | More teams will be good, says Warne
                                                                                                                       7                                        More teams will be good, says Warne
                  Shane Warne                     
	Jaipur: Australian spin legend Shane Warne Monday welcomed the Indian Premier League (IPL)s decision to add two new franchises for the 2011 edition of the lucrative Twenty20 event and said the move will bring more sheen to the bestselling brand of cricket.         
	I think, the IPL is the bestselling brand of cricket. Every cricketer now dreams of playing for his country and also in the IPL. The decision will give more opportunity to them, said Warne, who is here to lead the Rajasthan Royals in third edition of IPL commencing March 12.         
	The IPL has attracted more people towards the sport. Those who retired recently were attracted too. I feel it has become the best competition of cricket, Warne added.         
	Warne, speaking about his teams performance in the last IPL, admitted that the side failed to put up consistent show but vowed to make amends this time.         
	Yes, we were not consistent last year. We will address that problem and would do better since we are back on the home turf, Warne said.         
	The Rajasthan team, which won the inaugural edition of the IPL, finished an unimpressive sixth last year.         
	We have a strong group of players and a few of them are capable of surprising everyone in IPL III. At top of the order there is South Africa captain Graeme Smith, who is like a rock, he said.         
	Experience of Damien Martyn and Shane Watson, youngsters like Michael Lumb and Adam Voges have made us a formidable side. We have some very good talented Indian players too, Warne said.         
	Yusuf Pathan had failed to impress last year in the rainbow nation, but Warne has no doubt that he will capitalise on the home advantage this time.         
	He was not that consistent in South Africa but he is a match winner. Not many of the batsmen can hit the first ball they face for a six. He had grabbed few Man of the Match awards in the first edition of the IPL. He has the capability to change the course of any match, said Warne.         
	Im going to entrust the responsibility to my teammates. I am sure they will be ready to grab the opportunity willingly.         
	In our team, all players are equal and that is our strength. I make them believe that we can win from any situation. That is why we won most of our last-ball finishes, he added.         
	On his own form, Warne said: I have turned few balls during the practice matches. I hope I would soon be in perfect rhythm.         
	Warne also said that he was happy to be part of many fabulous victories of Australia, including the World Cup. I played under two great captains Mark Taylor and Allan Border. I was also a part of the many fine victories, like World Cup and many others.         
	Warne also said it was his love for both India and Australia that inspired him to contribute in easing off the tension between the two nations in the wake of attacks on Indians Down Under.         
	The Australian leg-spinner, on the request of Victoria premier, recently mingled with Indian community at a picnic and hoped the initiative would bring desired results.         
	I hail from Victoria in Australia and have had the cricketing relations with India for more than 20 years. I love all the three -- Victoria, Australia and India. That is why I have tried to visit the Indian community in Victoria and had assured them, said Warne.

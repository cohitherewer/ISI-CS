The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldinho will be an asset, says Pele
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ronaldinho will be an asset, says Pele
                      
	Sao Paulo: Ronaldinhos experience could have a calming effect on Brazils youthful World Cup side if coach Dunga recalled the 30-year-old to the squad, Pele said on Tuesday.         
	Pele said in an interview that he would pick Ronaldinho, who has played at two finals, helping Brazil win their fifth title in 2002.         
	The 69-year-old also said Lionel Messi needed a well-organised Argentina side in which to exhibit his brilliant Barcelona form, while England and Spain would be dangerous opponents at the June 11-July 11 tournament in South Africa.         
	Pele praised Dungas record but was concerned about a possible lack of World Cup experience among the players expected to be picked for the squad.         
	I think Brazil are on the right track but we have to be careful because the majority of the players have never played at a World Cup before, so there will be a lot of pressure and we must see how those players handle it, Pele said.         
	If Ronaldinho keeps playing as he is now ... I believe he would be a good component because he could help when the younger players feel the pressure.         
	Ronaldinho, who last played for Brazil last April, has been in good form for AC Milan this year but despite speculation about a return to the national team he appears out of Dungas plans.         
	Brazil and fellow favourites Spain could expect tough opposition from the likes of Argentina, despite their poor qualifying campaign.         
	Pele identified Messi, Portugals Cristiano Ronaldo and Robinho of Brazil as players with the potential to light up the World Cup.           (REUTERS)

	London: English Premier League matches, including the much-anticipated one between Chelsea and Manchester United, have had to be called off due to bad weather. Heavy snowfall across Britain has affected sporting programme, with football, rugby and racing being postponed.         
	Other EPL matches that have been called off include Wigan Athletic and Aston Villa, Liverpool and Fulham, Arsenal and Stoke City, Newcastle United and Birmingham City, as well Blackpools game with Tottenham Hotspur.         
	Sundays game at Stamford Bridge has been postponed following consultation with the police and the local authority, said a spokesman from Chelsea after the weekends highest-profile match was postponed.         
	There has been heavy snow in London, on Saturday.         
	Earlier in the day a statement from Wigan described the surrounding conditions at DW Stadium as treacherous and attributing the postponement to freak weather conditions in the town overnight.         
	The decision was made on the advice of Superintendent Stuart Ellison of Greater Manchester Police, on safety grounds, read an official club statement.         
	Despite the clubs best efforts using todays (Saturdays) game on by bringing in snow ploughs and gritters, the 10 inches of snow that fell overnight, and is still falling at the time of going to press, has made the surrounding area extremely hazardous for supporters travelling to the game.         
	Public transport isnt running, there are motorway closures and the general condition of the surrounding routes is treacherous.         
	The DW Stadium playing surface, ironically, is fine, with the undersoil heating doing its job, and the stadium is also okay.         
	With temperatures in the North West set to plunge further in to late afternoon, Liverpools match was also called off with the safety of supporters in mind.         
	Club officials met with the police this morning to assess the prevailing weather conditions, said a Liverpool spokesman.         
	The safety of all fans attending the game is paramount and although the Anfield pitch is playable, the conditions around the stadium and further afield for people travelling to the match are such that the decision was taken, following police advice on safety grounds, to postpone the game.         
	All existing tickets will remain valid for the re-arranged fixture and supporters will be advised of the new date as soon as possible.         
	Shortly after Arsenal called their game off with Stoke. Further to a huge deluge of snow in north London starting over Emirates Stadium at 11.38am, the match referee Lee Mason made the decision at 12.07pm to postpone todays (Saturdays) match, said a club spokesman.         
	Approximately three inches of snow fell over this half hour period and there continues to be heavy snowfall with no apparent let-up.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Mumbai: Former Australian wicket-keeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist, on Tuesday, expressed awe at Sachin Tendulkars durability and believed that the elusive Test triple century might keep the batting maestro hungry for a few more years.         
	Tendulkars hunger is amazing. He has continued to play and play at the highest level. The quality of a champion is longevity and he has done it for 21 years in a cricket crazy nation, Gilchrist said on Tuesday.         
	He has shown the ability to evolve and change his game through the years. Who knows whats left for him to achieve? Chasing that elusive 300 may keep him going for a few more years, he said.

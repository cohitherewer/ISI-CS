The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rosberg is faster than Schumi 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Rosberg is faster than Schumi 
          
	Manama: Nico Rosberg kept race-rusty teammate Michael Schumacher behind him on Friday to put Mercedes on top of the timesheets in practice for the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.         
	The younger of the two Germans was quicker than the returning seven-time champion in both sessions, filling eighth place and then the top slot while the 41-year-old moved up from 10th to third in the afternoon.         
	While practice times are often misleading with drivers trying out different set-ups and running with varying fuel loads, all eyes were on Schumachers pace after an absence of three seasons.         
	The car felt much better in the second session although I am still a little rusty on one-lap runs and need to get back into the routine, Schumacher said.         
	Rosberg lapped the newly extended Sakhir circuit in a best time of one minute 55.409 seconds, nearly half a second quicker than Schumacher.         
	McLarens Lewis Hamilton was second, faster than teammate and reigning champion Jenson Button who had been ahead in the morning. Mercedes-engined cars filled the top four slots.         
	Spains double world champion Fernando Alonso limbered up for his Ferrari race debut with the second best time in the first session and the ninth after lunch.           (REUTERS)

	Wenger rsquo;s appeal  for privacy   London: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has appealed for privacy after a British newspaper carried a frontpage story alleging he had an affair with a French singer.

The paper alleged the two have had a two-year relationship.   
	 Licensing issue   New Delhi: Mohun Bagan and East Bengal could still play in the 2011-12 I-League, even if they fail to meet the December 31 deadline for fulfilling AFC rsquo;s club licensing guidelines, informed sources in the AIFF. The two clubs will, however, be out of contention for AFC Champions League berth if they fail to fulfill the said norms.

	 Warne advice  Melbourne: Australia rsquo;s woeful one-day run is no indicator of their Test form, says Shane Warne who has warned England against taking Ricky Ponting rsquo;s men lightly. ldquo;The attitude among my English friends has a bit more sarcasm, more lip, more arrogance, but they should just calm down, rdquo; Warne said.   
	 WAGs allowed   Melbourne: Australian cricketers rsquo; wives and girlfriends (WAGs) have been allowed to join their partners for the Ashes series this summer, a decision that starkly contrasts with England rsquo;s policy of banning WAGs for the first six weeks of the tour.

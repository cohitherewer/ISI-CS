	Guangzhou: Indian boxers and tennis players brought smiles on the face of fans as they assured India of at least four medals in the ongoing Asian Games, Saturday.         
	World No. 1 Vijender Singh (75kg) and Asian champion Suranjoy Singh (52kg) assured India of two boxing medals by advancing to their respective semi-finals with contrasting victories.         
	While Vijender out-slugged Koreas Deokjin Cho 13-2, Suranjoy pulled off a hard-fought 4-2 triumph over Uzbekistans Shahriyor Isakov.         
	Vijender and Suranjoys triumphs took the total number of Indian boxers in the semi-finals to four  the other two being Dinesh Kumar (81kg) and Paramjeet Samota (+91kg).         
	Vijender, an Olympic and World Championship bronze-medallist, who won a bronze in the previous Asian Games in Doha, will now face Mohammed Sattapour of Iran in the semis.         
	Suranjoy, who has won an astonishing seven gold medals at the international level since April 2009, will now be up against Chinas Chang Yong in the last-four stage.         
	Earlier in the day, Amandeep Singh blanked Pakistans Muhammad Waseem to make it to the light flyweight 49kg quarterfinals. The Commonwealth Games bronze medallist will face Filipino Iii Victorio Saludar in the last-eight stage.         
	In tennis, Sania Mirza shocked second-seeded Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand to enter the semis while Somdev Dev Varman capped an all-win day assuring India of at least two more bronze medals.         
	Unseeded Sania, a silver medallist at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, scored an upset 6-2, 6-3 win over Tanasugarn. The 166th ranked Indian, a silver medallist in Doha, relied on her power-packed strokes to beat the Thai, who once figured in top-20 and now stands at No. 58 in the world.         
	She will next face third seed and world No. 69 Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan.         
	Somdev, who had earlier won a bronze in the mens team event, assured himself of another bronze in the doubles by reaching the semis with partner Sanam Singh. They beat the Chinese pair of Yan Bai and Zhang Ze 6-2, 6-4 in the quarter finals at the Aoti Tennis Centre.         
	Somdev and Karan Rastogi also inched towards the medal round in the mens singles event by progressing to the quarter finals.         
	Second seed Somdev won at the expense of just two games as he beat Uzbekistans 16th seed Vaja Uzakov 6-1, 6-1 in the third round. Rastogi, coming back to international tennis after an injury lay-off, did not have much trouble in thrashing Taipeis 10th seed Ti Chen 6-0, 6-4.         
	However, though the Indian men notched up their first win of the handball competition with a 56-22 victory over Mongolia, it was not enough for them to advance to the knock-out round. India won 20-8, 36-14 in their last preliminary round in their Group A match to collect two points to finish fifth in the six-team Group A.         
	Indian men spikers notched up their second consecutive win with a 3-0 thrashing of Qatar in their final round league match while the women spikers continued to flounder and were outplayed 0-3 by Japan in the volleyball championships. India, who had lost to Korea (0-3) and won against the Maldives by the same margin, will take on Kazakhstan and Chinese Taipei in their remaining two league matches.         
	The taekwondo competition ended on a dismal note as Sunil Kumar and Kamineni Srilakshmi crashed out of their respective events.           (AGENCIES)

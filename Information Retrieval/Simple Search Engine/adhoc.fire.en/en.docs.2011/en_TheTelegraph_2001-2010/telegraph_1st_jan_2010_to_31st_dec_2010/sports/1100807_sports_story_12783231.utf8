                                                                                                                       7                                      IHF gains what HI lost
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Union ministry of sports dropped a bombshell on Friday when it decided to grant recognition to the K.P.S. Gill-led Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) as the sole national federation for the sport in India.         
	The move comes as yet another blow to Hockey India (HI), which was derecognised by the ministry on Thursday on charges of non-compliance with government guidelines.         
	The ministry said the decision was taken in light of the Delhi high court judgement of May 21, 2010, which had been accepted by HI and also the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).         
	In a letter to FIH president Leandro Negre, the ministry said: The HI is no more the recognised national sports federation (NSF) for the management, control and promotion of hockey in the country and is also not authorised to select and field the national team in international competitions.         
	However, this latest move can land Indian hockey in deeper trouble as the FIH has already declared HI as Indias national federation and said it had nothing to do with IHF.

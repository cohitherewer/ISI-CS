The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Strauss banks on bowlers
                                                                                                                       7                                      Strauss banks on bowlers
                      
	Sydney: Australia will be massively motivated to regain the Ashes when the five-match series starts next month, according to England captain Andrew Strauss.         
	The former world No. 1 side have dropped to fifth in the rankings, one place below England, after suffering a 0-2 series defeat in India this month.         
	To expect Australia to be any less competitive than they have been in every series out here, would be a bad way of playing things, Strauss told reporters at the Perth airport, on Saturday.         
	We expect them to be very strong, very determined and clearly massively motivated to win back the Ashes and we are going to have to be good enough to overcome it.         
	Key to Englands chances of keeping the Ashes  and improving on their 0-5 drubbing in Australia, in 2007  will be their bowling unit.         
	One of the things I have liked about our bowling unit is they have kind of complemented each other quite well (recently), said the 33-year-old Strauss, who was also the skipper when England won the Ashes on home soil last year.         
	When it is turning, obviously Graeme Swann has been a great threat When it is swinging, Jimmy Anderson has been outstanding over the last 12 months And obviously on wickets which are a bit bouncy, Steven Finn and Stuart Broad have done a good job.         
	Off-spinner Swann is ranked the worlds second best bowler while Anderson is also in the top 10, along with Australias Mitchell Johnson and Doug Bollinger.         
	I think it is that balance, to be able to adapt to different circumstances and situations in a game, that is more crucial than having one or two players having a great series, added opening batsman Strauss.

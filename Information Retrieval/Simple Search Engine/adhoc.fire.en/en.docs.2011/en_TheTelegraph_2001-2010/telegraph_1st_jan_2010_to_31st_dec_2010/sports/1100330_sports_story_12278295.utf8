  - The Board has not given me a chance to defend myself             Mohammed Yousuf in Karachi, on Monday. (AFP)                           
	Karachi: Mohammed Yousuf, former captain and one of Pakistans most prolific middle-order batsmen, Monday announced his retirement from international cricket, blaming the countrys cricket establishment for forcing him to take this decision.         
	I have decided to retire from international cricket now, given the conditions I have faced in recent times, Yousuf told a press conference.         
	Thirty-five-year-old Yousuf was the captain on Pakistans recent tours to New Zealand and Australia where the team lost heavily after which the Pakistan Cricket Board set up an inquiry committee to probe into the poor performances.         
	The committee recommended indefinite bans on Yousuf and his predecessor Younis Khan, charging them with infighting and bringing the team morale down. The Board sent me a letter stating that I have been a disruptive influence on the team in Australia. So I feel that it is better that I retire, he said.         
	Yousuf, who refused to take any questions at the press conference, said that he would continue to play domestic cricket and in foreign leagues as he didnt want to lose contact with the game.         
	The Board has not given me a chance to defend myself and I have just been charged with something that has disheartened me, said the top-order batsman.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Waqar Younis has asked Yousuf to reconsider his decision of quitting international cricket and said the former captain still has plenty to offer to the country. (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Trio set to miss match
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	London: The meeting of Pakistans tainted trio of Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and High Commission officials here has been put back, reports said on Wednesday.         
	The reports claimed the trio will now miss Pakistans practice match against Somerset starting Thursday as that will clash with their meeting with the PCB and High Commission officials at the High Commission here.         
	The trio of Test captain Salman Butt, and bowlers Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif had been due to meet PCB chairman Ijaz Butt and the countrys High Commissioner in London on Wednesday. But it has emerged that the talks have been put back and, now, clash with the teams next fixture, which gets under way Thursday, a report said.         
	Legal advisers will also be present at the meeting, which is expected to result in them taking no further part in the tour, which includes two Twenty20 Internationals and a series of one-day matches, it said.         
	However, as Butt made his exit from the team hotel in Taunton, he was asked if he would be coming back. He replied: Why not?         
	It is not known why the meeting has been put back but the players are set to be interrogated by Scotland Yard for the second time Wednesday.         
	The report also said that the three tainted players will be questioned by International Cricket Council (ICC) once the investigation by Scotland Yard is over.         
	ECB and ICC had lobbied the PCB to omit the players from the warm-up match, as well as the Twenty20 and one-day Internationals that follow. It is understood that their wish will be granted, guaranteeing the ICC some breathing space before deciding on its next move. With the police set to re-interview the three players, investigators from the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit will move quickly to follow suit, the report added.         
	In a related development, Pakistan teams official kit supplier, BoomBoom, has severed its ties with tainted pacer Mohammed Aamer and said they are reviewing their sponsorship deal with the entire team in the wake of the spot-fixing scandal.         
	The company also had an individual tie-up with Aamer.         
	We cannot allow our brand to be associated with any whiff of corruption or suspicion of foul play. While the suspension of our commercial involvement with Mohammed Aamer is not a step we take lightly, we nevertheless feel that it is the right thing to do while a judicial process unfolds and innocence or guilt is established, said Ali Ehsan, managing director of the company.         
	We are also reviewing our position as official kit supplier to the Pakistan Cricket Board, he added.         
	Meanwhile, reports added that the ICC had conveyed its apprehension to the PCB about the alleged nexus between some Pakistani players and suspected bookmakers even before the British tabloid came out with the spot-fixing scandal on August 28.         
	Well placed sources in the PCB said that the ICC officials had a confidential discussion with PCB chairman Butt last month in which they conveyed their apprehensions about the possible links between players and bookies.         
	The ICC passed on the information and some Text messages to Butt which indicated that Pakistani players had been in touch with Mazhar Majeed even during the World Twenty20 over spot-fixing issues, a source said.         
	In a separate development, while Victorias Minister for Gaming, Tony Robinson has asked the states gambling regulator to consider banning bets on all cricket matches involving Pakistan in the wake of the recent spot-fixing scandal, New Zealands state betting agency will accept wagers on cricket matches during Pakistans December tour.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A tricky day awaits India
                                                                                                                       7                                      A tricky day awaits India
            SUDIPTO GUPTA                                  McCullum        
	Hyderabad: The pain is mightier than the sword  the malapropism allows an easier analysis of Indias fortunes at the end of the fourth days play. Zaheer Khans abdominal strain might turn out to be Indias pain, should the hosts fail to force a victory in the second Test, against New Zealand.         
	It could well be a tricky final days play.         
	If why is the question, why not is the answer. The Indian spearhead was out of the ground for 136 minutes and when he returned after the tea break, well, the break was too long for him to roll his arms on the fourth day. The bowler was reduced to a fielder and instead of providing India a peek at victory, he was busy chasing the ball.         
	One may argue that New Zealands score at stumps, on Monday --- 237 for four (with a lead of 115 runs)  reflects a chance for the hosts to press for victory early on Tuesday. True. But the old ball has a grenade-like presence in Zaheers hands, and, imagine how much of an advantage it would have been for India had the Black Caps scorecard read 237 for six.         
	At the close, Brendon McCullum was unbeaten on 124, his third century in five Tests this year, and giving him company was the young Kane Williamson batting on 12.         
	With Gareth Hopkins and Daniel Vettori being the only ones left in the New Zealand ranks who can be expected to provide some resistance, India can still go to Nagpur, for the third Test, with a 1-0 lead.         
	But reputations, in this series, have been the biggest irony. Where bowlers lead the batting charts and the No.8 often pales the No.1, expecting the improbable would be wiser. Plus, the Hyderabad pitch is still behaving like a batsmans den, having already produced three centuries.         
	And Harbhajans form with the ball seems to be lost in the dazzle of his bat. He bowled 23 wicketless overs on Monday  precisely another reason why India felt the pain of Zaheers strain.         
	New Zealand, however, once again bettered their reputation when their openers flourished after India had finished their first innings at 472. McCullum, along with McIntosh (49), put up a stroke-filled 125-run first wicket stand, the first century opening partnership for New Zealand since June 2004.         
	While McCullum dazzled with 11 boundaries and three sixes on the day, McIntosh restrained from risks, but made sure that runs kept trickling. McIntosh was unfortunate to fall one short of his half century when the umpire adjudged him caught bad-pad off Pragyan Ojha, though replays failed to show any bat contact.         
	Martin Guptill (18), Taylor and Jesse Ryder (20) returned to the hut cheaply making things difficult for their team.         
	The comparison of contrasting mental approaches of Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar and Harbhajan, in anticipation of their respective centuries in this match, provides an intriguing study. While for Sehwag, it doesnt really matter whether he is on 6 or 96 or 196 or 296, as he is always in his unique ballistic mode, the other two scripted a tale of role reversals.         
	If you can be a little lenient, one may assume that Sachins eagerness to get his 50th Test century is comparable to Harbhajans hunger for his second Test century, that too, back-to-back ones. Individually, both are cherished milestones. But while the maestro, expected to master the pressure, caved in when at a distance of 87 runs, the upstart oozed patience and confidence in spite of being nearer to the three-figure orbit.         
	Starting the day at 85 and with a No.11 batsman for company, Harbhajan advertised his mental agility and batting ability to become the first player to score back-to-back Test hundreds from the No. 8 position.         
	When he finally achieved the distinction, off 105 balls, Harbhajans euphoria was similar to that of a child with a new gadget in his hand. The adrenaline kick was so high that his run of ecstasy almost took him to the doorsteps of the dressing room, where everyone was on their feet, armed with applause in their hands.         
	Watch out for the morning session on Tuesday to find out more about pain and pleasure.

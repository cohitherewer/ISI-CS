The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Break clause in contract 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Break clause in contract 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH             Wayne Rooney                           
	Wayne Rooney is understood to have a clause in his new contract allowing him to leave Manchester United         
	A source close to his representatives has said that he believes the striker can leave for as little as 30million if certain targets are not met on a year-by-year basis. Manchester United have denied that such a clause exists.         
	This paper has learned that Rooneys camp were always seeking to have a release strategy inserted in the contract.         
	According to another source close to the negotiating team, Rooneys representatives took legal advice on how to build a clause that would allow the player to leave Old Trafford if the Glazers were to renege on their promise to invest in the team.         
	Rooneys deal is thought to be worth in the region of 160,000 per week in basic salary but could top 200,000 once incentives are worked in. All parties in the deal are prevented from speaking publicly about the details of the deal by a confidentiality agreement.         
	Break clauses are inserted as standard in contracts in Spanish football, and are generally related to the total wages the player will earn throughout his contract. The insertion of a break clause gives the player the freedom to move if his valuation is met, but it also protects the club against players who try to force cut-price deals.         
	Rooney signed the contract on Friday to cap a remarkable week in which he issued a public statement implicitly criticising his United teammates just hours before his sides Champions League game against Bursaspor.         
	Rooney, who turned 25 on Sunday, has apologised to the fans and to his teammates for the hurt he caused last week.         
	He had broken off talks on a new contract on Aug 14 and, after another unsuccessful meeting, claimed on Oct 14 that, despite what Alex Ferguson had claimed, he did not have an ankle injury.         
	This act of public dissent was followed by news of the contract situation leaking into the public domain.         
	After a week of claim and counter-claim which appeared to make Rooneys future at Old Trafford untenable, Stretford agreed to meet with chief executive David Gill and Ferguson, a meeting in which the Rooney camp decided to take up Uniteds improved offer, even if it fell short of what Manchester City would have been able to pay.

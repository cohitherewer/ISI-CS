            KUSHAN SARKAR                            
	Ahmedabad: It would have been incredible had Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his young guns been able to chase down a target as big as 366 without Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag at the top of the order. It didnt happen and the second-string Indian team went down to South Africa by 90 runs in the last match of the Micromax Mobile Cup.         
	The Indians thus maintained their awful record in ODIs at this venue, having now lost four matches on trot.         
	There is no substitute to experience, goes the saying. Dhoni learnt it the hard way at the Sardar Patel Stadium, in Motera, on Saturday. Its not that the Murali Vijays, the Rohit Sharmas and the Virat Kohlis dont have it in them. But when it comes to handling tough situations, one cant still look beyond a Tendulkar or a Sehwag. Chasing 366 was definitely a tall order, but there were no special efforts, only mediocrity.         
	Even during the 95-run third-wicket stand between Virat Kohli (57) and Rohit Sharma (48), India did not look good enough to win the match. There was no conviction in their batting. It was a day when someone needed to hit good deliveries for boundaries. But a Rohit or a Yusuf Pathan (5) could not even get the bad balls away.         
	Rohit hit a full toss straight to deep mid-wicket off Johan Bothas bowling, while Pathan couldnt clear the long-on boundary off a length ball from Lonwabo Tsotsobe. Captain Dhoni was done in by a fantastic one-handed catch by Mark Boucher, off Dale Steyn. Kohlis faint edge went to the keeper.         
	By the 30th over, the match was as good as over. Suresh Raina (49), Ravindra Jadeja (36) and Abhimanyu Mithun (24) had a few lusty blows, but it was too late. India were all out for 275 in 44.3 overs.         
	Earlier in the day, AB De Villiers and his skipper Jacques Kallis bludgeoned the Indian bowlers, adding 173 runs in only 103 deliveries as South Africa posted 365 for two in 50 overs, opting to bat first on a placid wicket.         
	While De Villiers (102 no, 59 balls, 11x4, 3x6) completed his second century on the trot, off only 58 deliveries, Kallis (104 no, 94 balls, 5x4, 3x6) reached the three-figure mark in 92 deliveries.         
	The South African top order, which has failed to deliver during at crucial junctures in the ODI series, finally came good with all the big names notching up significant scores. Their cause was also helped by a below-par effort from the Indian bowlers. The Indian team managements decision to test their bench strength backfired badly. The pace trio of Sreesanth, Sudeep Tyagi and debutant Abhimanyu Mithun failed to bowl a disciplined line. Their figures will definitely make Dhoni think whether he has enough ammunition in his arsenal to experiment like this.         
	South Africas opening duo of Loots Bosman (68, 46 balls, 7x4, 4x6) and Hashim Amla (87, 103 balls, 8x4) made full use of the fielding restrictions during the Powerplay overs. The openers added 113 for the opening wicket.         
	The inexperience of Tyagi, playing his fourth ODI, and debutant Mithun, showed. Both were guilty of not bowling in one channel. Mithun, who bowls with an open-chested action angling his deliveries into the right hander, drifted a few down the leg side, getting punished. Tyagi either gave width outside off or bowled too short.         
	Sreesanth never got into any kind of rhythm, and was hit all over the park. What was started by Bosman and Amla was continued till the end by Kallis and De Villiers.         
	De Villiers was declared Man of the Match while Sachin Tendulkar, who was named Man of the Series, got a gleaming Volvo.

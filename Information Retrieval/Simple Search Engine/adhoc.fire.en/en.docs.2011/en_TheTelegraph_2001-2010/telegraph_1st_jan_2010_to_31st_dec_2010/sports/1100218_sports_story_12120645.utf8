The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods likely to return   in March
                                                                                                                       7                                        Woods likely to return   in March
                  Tiger Woods                           
	Beleaguered world No. 1 golfer Tiger Woods has reportedly gone from his Florida home to the bungalow he owns in the same gated community, for a meeting with officials of the Tavistock Cup to discuss plans for a comeback         
	A celebrity website has reported that Tiger  escorted by security to the bungalow - attended the closed-door meeting.         
	It has been previously reported that Woods had planned to play at Tavistock, a PGA event between the golf pros at Isleworth and the nearby Lake Nona. The two-day event is scheduled to start on March 22.         
	It is being speculated that after Tavistock, Woods would to go to Augusta, for the Masters.         
	On the home front though troubles are still following Tiger. Wife Elin Nordegren, apparently, has refused to move back in with him. Tiger wants her to move back home with him but so far she has said no, one source told a celebrity website. Shes not ready and she just doesnt trust him.         
	Meanwhile, with Tiger still in the woods, the golfing world is realising that the fairways are missing his star power too badly.         
	The Match Play Championship, which began Wednesday in Tucson, was speculated to be Woods comeback vehicle. But Woods decided to stay in Florida, trying desperately to build bridges with Elin. His peers are expecting him back sooner rather than later, but deep down, they know it wont be like that.         
	Last year, the entire sports world tuned in to the Match Play because it was where Woods made his comeback from reconstructive knee surgery. It promptly tuned out after Woods lost in the second round to South African Tim Clark.         
	The 2009 European Rookie of the Year Chris Wood of England is someone who desperately wants Woods to return as early as possible.         
	Had Woods decided to end his exile in Tucson, he would have played Wood in the first round. Id have liked to play Tiger, said Wood, whose first round opponent is world No. 4 Lee Westwood.         
	I think it would have been a bit intimidating and I would have been apprehensive the first couple of holes, but once into it Im sure I would have stepped up to it.         
	It would have been one of the best chances to beat him in his first round back. But I knew it was going to be either the world No. 1 or the European No. 1, so either way a hard match, he said.

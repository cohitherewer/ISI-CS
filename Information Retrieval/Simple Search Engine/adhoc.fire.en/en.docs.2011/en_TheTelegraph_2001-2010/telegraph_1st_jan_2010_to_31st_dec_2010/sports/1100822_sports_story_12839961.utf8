	London: Pakistan overcame a late batting collapse to beat England by four wickets in the third Test on Saturday and cut the hosts lead to 2-1 in the four-match series.         
	Set 148 to win after Mohammed Aamer claimed career-best figures of five for 52 to help dismiss England for 222, Pakistan reached 148 for six at the Oval.         
	Aamer finished four not out in 25 balls and Umar Akmal was 16 in 36 after nervously surviving a late England assault.         
	The winning runs came when Akmal glanced off-psinner Graeme Swann to fine leg. It followed the loss of four wickets for 29 runs.         
	Captain Salman Butt had earlier led from the front with 48 from 64 balls. Swann claimed 3-50.         
	This win shows the character of this young team after we were 2-0 down and with everybody writing us off, Butt said.         
	Chasing low totals in the fourth innings there is always a lot of pressure, but I thought we only made one mistake with the run out  there was no need for that. The presence of Mohammed Yousuf has made a big difference.         
	Victory for Pakistan ended Englands six-Test winning streak and keeps the series alive ahead of the Lords test from Thursday.         
	The hosts won at Trent Bridge and Edgbaston, both of which also ended on the fourth day.         
	Aamer became the youngest player at 18 years, 129 days to take five wickets in a Test innings in England. His previous best Test figures were five for 79 against Australia at Melbourne in December 2009.

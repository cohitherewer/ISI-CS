  - OWNERS DIDN'T ADD TO PRESSURE, SAYS DELIGHTED CHENNAI SUPER KINGS CAPTAIN       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni with the Fairplay trophy in Navi Mumbai, on Sunday. (PTI)                                 
	Mumbai: It was well past 3 am, on Monday, when the Chennai Super Kings bus came to a stop in the porch of The ITC Grand Central.         
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was among the last to get off, but he got the maximum cheers, from a pretty decent gathering of supporters.         
	Most were staying at the hotel itself, yet some had come over from parts of the city to join in the celebrations after defeating the Mumbai Indians, in Navi Mumbai.         
	There was a rush to be photographed with Dhoni, who is also the Team India captain, and then was the uncorking of bubbly and the cutting of a chocolate cake.         
	Incidentally, among those present was one of the owners, Narayanswamy Srinivasan, who is the Boards secretary, as well.         
	Please do come for the after-match party, at Dublin, reminded one of the hotels managers. Pat came Dhonis reply: I will, of course... Its our first IPL win, after all... Hamesha kahan aisi jeet hoti hai...         
	Dhoni, for the record, is a World T20-winning captain.                     
	Briefly speaking to The Telegraph, Dhoni said: Its very pleasing and hugely satisfying... I had somewhat limited resources... I mean, I didnt have a Yuvraj Singh and a Yusuf Pathan and...         
	But, yes, the players raised their game and contributed big... Wed been in a tough position, trying to qualify for the semi-final, but the owners (under the India Cements banner) didnt add to the pressure... That helped.         
	Dhoni added: Srini (Srinivasan) Sir kept our morale up... Hed been confident that wed make it... Even if you cant, dont give it away easily is what he told me and the team.         
	As for the top moment in IPL III, Dhoni quipped: Quite a few... It was, by then, time for him to get off on The ITC One floor.

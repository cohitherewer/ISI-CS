The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imran slams NA panel
                                                                                                                       7                                      Imran slams NA panel
                      
	Karachi: Former captain Imran Khan has slammed the Pakistan National Assemblys standing committee on sports, describing them as a bunch of stupid people.         
	Imran Thursday told reporters in Lahore that he was appalled by how the committee was interfering in sports, particularly cricket, and causing unnecessary problems.         
	Its a joke really because nowhere in the world does a parliamentary committee get involved in sports or cricket. These committees are not supposed to look into things they know little about, the 1992 World Cup-winning captain said.         
	Imran said the committee and its chairman were wasting public money by holding hearings and issuing summons to officials and players of the cricket board and other sports federations.         
	Already they have caused so much anguish to Younis Khan because he took a break from cricket, he said. (PTI)

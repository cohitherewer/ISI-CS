	Pretoria: Spain midfielder Xavi Hernandez says Argentina forward Lionel Messi has shown hes the worlds best player at this years World Cup.         
	Xavi says his Barcelona teammates play has been spectacular, with Messi participating in every goal and making the difference.         
	Spain coach Vicente del Bosque says Messi, who turned 23 on Thursday, is the leader of a potent Argentina team, who won their group with a perfect record to set up a match against Mexico in the round of 16.         
	Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa also believes Messi is the worlds best.         
	Meanwhile, Mexico midfielder Gerardo Torrado says his team needs to emphasise intelligence over passion to overcome Argentina.         
	Torrado called Messi the best or one of the best in the world but cautioned that he alone is not Argentina.         
	Torrado says we have to be intelligent and not go loco, work together to able to cancel this individual skill.         
	While Argentina are the favourites to win, Torrado said Thursday we are very focused and I think it will be an even game. ... we have to believe that we can win.         
	Argentina knocked out Mexico 2-1 in extra time in the round of 16 at the 2006 World Cup, and Mexican defender Rafael Marquez said he is out for revenge. He is one of eight Mexico players from the 2006 World Cup who lost to Argentina 1-2.

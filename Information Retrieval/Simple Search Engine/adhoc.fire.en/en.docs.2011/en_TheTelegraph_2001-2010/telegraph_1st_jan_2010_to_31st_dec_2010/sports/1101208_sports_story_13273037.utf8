The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Must-win tie for Bengal
                                                                                                                       7                                        Must-win tie for Bengal
  - Shukla, Sreevats, Porel set to make a comeback vs Saurashtra       A STAFF REPORTER            Manoj Tiwary                                 
	Calcutta: Team Bengal, so far, have dealt with not only the on-field opposition but also the virtual challenges of viral fevers and frustrating rain interruptions in their Ranji Trophy campaign.         
	With two more matches left to garner some much-needed points, the Manoj Tiwary-led side would dearly hope that they get to put their best foot forward when they face Saurashtra, in Rajkot, on Wednesday.         
	Bengal are currently placed at the fifth spot with nine points from five matches.         
	After bouts of viral fever had robbed Bengal of quite a few of their first team players in their earlier matches, rain ruined the teams last outing, against Tamil Nadu.         
	Captain Tiwarys words, on the eve of the Saurashtra match, echoed the disappointment of falling prey to the weather in the last tie. Its obviously not within our control To be honest we are not thinking about the past. But its true that we were playing well against Tamil Nadu, and if the full match was played, anything could have happened, he said.         
	Tiwary, in fact, referred to the Tamil Nadu match to explain why he is optimistic against Saurashtra. Our bowlers are in good form We were on top against Tamil Nadu and reduced them to 132 for four If we can perform against the class of Tamil Nadu batsman, theres no reason why we shouldnt do well against Saurashtra, he said.         
	That in turn highlights the fact that Bengal, at least on paper, have a superior line-up in comparison to that of Saurashtra, who are struggling with just four points from five matches.         
	Saurashtra have been hit hard with the absence of key players  Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja and Jaydev Unadkat  all of whom are on Team India duty in some form or the other. With the wicket promising to have something for the bowlers, as admitted by Tiwary, the Bengal bowlers, led by the experienced pace duo of Ranadeb Bose and Ashok Dinda, should get the better of the opposition batsmen.         
	For Bengal, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sreevats Goswami and Writam Porel are set to make a comeback after missing out the last match. Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who came out of retirement to play the Tamil Nadu match, will not be available against Saurashtra.         
	However, Tiwary declined to reveal his bowling line-up. We will take a call tomorrow Look theres bounce in the wicket and that will help both the pacers as well as the spinners. So lets see, he said.         
	Relegation-threatened Saurashtra have taken a tough stand and dropped experienced players like Rakesh Dhruve and Sandip Maniar from the 15-member squad.         
	The teams batting will rest on Sitanshu Kotak, Sagar Jogiyani, Pratik Mehta and Jaydev Shah. Jayesh Odedara and Balkrishna Jadeja will operate the new ball and will be supported by spinner Kamlesh Makwana.         
	Bengal, so far, have excelled in their away ties. That is one record that the Woorkeri Raman-coached side would like to continue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Conditions in which you score matter the most: Sir Garfield
                                                                                                                       7                                        Conditions in which you score matter the most: Sir Garfield
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A knight TO REMEMBER: 35 YEARS OF THE LEGENDS KNIGHTHOOD             Sir Garfield Sobers                                 
	Bridgetown: Great batsmen never play forward, they play back... Survivors are the ones who play forward, was a stand-out comment from Sir Garfield Garry Sobers, during a star-spangled evening to mark the 35th anniversary of his Knighthood.         
	Held at The Garfield Sobers Gymnasium, the function got over after 1 am (Sunday), but few had left during those five memorable hours. There was an hours delay, but nobody seemed to mind.         
	It was, possibly, a once in a lifetime evening. Definitely a Knight To Remember as it was promoted. It was put together, with loads of class, by Sobers Holdings Inc.         
	Sir Garrys second son, Daniel, is the companys CEO and he has ambitious plans to keep his 73-year-old fathers legacy alive. In fact, within a year, there will be a signature-clothing line.         
	At the end of the function, as invitees and those whod bought tickets, prepared to leave, Sir Garry told The Telegraph: Yes, in a way I do feel emotional... A bit, really... Im glad you all enjoyed the evening...         
	Besides cricketing legends, present were ministers of the Barbados government, senators and even Dwight Yorke, the footballer who has worn the Trinidad and Tobago and Manchester United colours.         
	Incidentally, there was an auction as well, with the proceeds going to the Sobers Foundation. A section of the underprivileged stand to benefit.               
	The following are excerpts from what the speakers said (in batting order)         
	REV. WESLEY HALL: Im talking about the greatest cricketer in the world... He hit six sixes in an over in a three-day (County) game, what odds on his doing so in a T20 match? Hes the only living national hero of Barbados... He doesnt have a trace of ego in his bones... Hes an alien in a way because we still havent been able to understand his greatness as a cricketer... As a captain, Sir Garfield took us to the mountain top and there was a time when he was the worlds most successful... Beating England, Australia and India, the top teams... A master of knowledge, skill and desire... Indeed, he was. Sir Garfield, let us try to be young as we grow old...         
	SIR VIVIAN RICHARDS: Sir Garfield had a talent like no other and was an inspiration for me... I remember hed come to Antigua for a match, but that day, he didnt trouble the scorers... However, just seeing him walk to the wicket was enough for me... Collar, as stiff as possible, up... It was a sight... If somebody didnt want to imitate one so graceful, then something had to be wrong... He remains the worlds greatest all-rounder... Lets raise a toast to Sir Garfield...         
	IAN CHAPPELL: My usual greeting... Sobers you b******! I took his place in the South Australia team when he had to return to the West Indies for a Test series and Id tell everybody that Id replaced the worlds greatest cricketer... I was an 18-year-old, then, but hed treat me as an equal... Sobers wasnt only a champion cricketer, but a champion bloke... If I had a problem and went to him, hed say son, get a beer, and well talk about it... I cant forget the 254 he scored (in the second innings) for the Rest of World against Australia at the MCG, in 1971-72... Ill end with what Keith Miller said while watching TV and seeing graphics on the greatest cricketers... When something was shown on Sir Donald Bradman, he jumped up and declared greatest batsman of all time Bradman, greatest cricketer Sobers...         
	SUNIL GAVASKAR: If I stand tall before you... Err, let me correct myself, if I stand short before you, its all thanks to Sir Garfield... If he hadnt given me a life very early in my first Test innings (in Port of Spain), then I may not have played another Test... He dropped me later, too, so Im really thankful... I kept scoring and as Sir Garfield wasnt getting hundreds in that 1970-71 series, he said hed touch me to try and get some of my luck. So, he touched my shoulder before the second innings in Georgetown and got an unbeaten 108... Next Test (Bridgetown) and he got 178 not out in the first innings... Next Test (Port of Spain, again), and this was crucial as we had a 1-0 lead and only needed a draw to win the five-match series, he got 132 in the first innings... Before the second, when it became evident Sir Garfield was coming to our dressing room, captain Ajit Wadekar locked me up in the toilet! He made it clear that, under no circumstances, could Sir Garfield touch me before the series last innings... He didnt and, guess what, fell for a duck, bowled first ball by Abid Ali... For me, on that tour, breathing the same air as him meant everything... When I was picked for the Rest of World, in 1971-72, I had to pinch myself to believe that Id be playing under Sir Garfield... Even then, I couldnt fully believe it... With the Clive Lloyds also around, it was a cricketing education beyond compare... I couldve paid a million dollars and still not got it... I recall Sir Garfield asking me to join him at golf one day, during that Rest of World-Australia series... Hed insisted even after my telling him that I knew nothing of golf... Anyway, he took me to the course... I missed the first few times and, then, hit the ball skimming the greens... After a few such hits, Sir Garfield told me son, in this game, youre allowed to hit the ball in the air!... Thats when I realised golf could never be for me... I mean, I didnt want easy centuries... Sir Garfield, youre the greatest and I pray that you get a century in life, too...         
	BRIAN LARA: I didnt know much about Sir Garfield till I was 13 or so and came to Barbados with the Fatima College team to participate in the schoolboys tournament named after him... I read a lot before coming and, on meeting him, my first question was did you actually score 365 not out in a Test match?... Sir Garfield answered yes and, since that day, hes been an inspiration... A great friend... Indeed, a father-figure... Ill never forget the day when, in Antigua, I broke his record in 1994... Ill never forget how he came inside the ground and hugged me... I recall there was a time when I wasnt getting runs and Id been practising in Kingston... His advice was back and across is fine, but keep your head steady... Its moving all over the place. I didnt forget that. Sir Garfield, I appreciate what youve done for me... Youre a genius and a true legend...               
	Now, excerpts from Sir Garrys address, which was often interrupted by applause and laughter. It was another gem of a performance from the all-time icon...         
	It has been a difficult situation, listening to all the accolades... Ive had a life, so far, of satisfaction and have been able to give something back to cricket... Im thankful for all the kind words...         
	Brian Lara... I remember him as a little boy who couldnt get the ball off the square... But, then, nobody could get him out either... A year later, in the same schoolboys tournament, he was a changed batsman... Hed become stronger and had begun to play shots... Youve expressed a great many sentiments, Brian, my feelings towards you are the same...         
	Ian Chappell... I recall hed always be in the South Australia dressing room, after play, listening to what the more experienced would talk about... How do you judge greatness? By the number of runs scored? Id say it would be the conditions in which the runs have been scored... That matter the most... Greg was obviously stylish, but if theres one batsman I had to pick, it would always be Ian... He made runs against express bowlers, not the lollipop ones... If I had to invite one Australian to this function, it would have been you. Im so glad that my son, Daniel, invited you...         
	Viv Richards... What an excellent batsman... This game is beyond coaches, books... Its about what the players do... Hed find the gaps... Orthodox cricket is playing like the English, hitting it straight to the fielder at cover... Unorthodox is hitting the same ball, pitched outside off, over mid-wicket... You score with the bat, not pads... Viv did that...         
	Sunil Gavaskar... Hes talked of the lives I gave him... Well, he must indeed be lucky... Hes been a true great, one beyond (the ordinary)...         
	Wesley Winfield Hall... My greatest friend... Somebody I could always depend on... Even now, if theres something, I give him a call... Weve had a number of innings together (laughs)...         
	[Sir Garry went on to narrate Halls picking or not picking of Bhagwat Chandrasekhars googly in the 1966-67 Test at the Brabourne.]         
	People are amazed at some of the things I did... Sometimes, even Im amazed... There were times when I didnt sleep for two days and still got runs... Id be out enjoying myself till 4 am, but I wouldnt advise that to others... My make-up was such that I couldnt toss and turn in bed, trying to sleep from the curfew hour of 10.30... In my last Test at Lords, I completed a hundred, despite not having slept the night before...         
	Wow, what an innings!

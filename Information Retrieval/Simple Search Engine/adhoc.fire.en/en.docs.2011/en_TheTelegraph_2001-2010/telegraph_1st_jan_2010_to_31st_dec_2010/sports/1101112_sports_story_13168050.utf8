The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ryder is unlikely to bowl: Vettori 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ryder is unlikely to bowl: Vettori 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag in Hyderabad, on Thursday                           
	Hyderabad: The common perception about Daniel Vettoris side at the start of the series was that they didnt have enough firepower to take 20 Indian wickets. Apart from the overall inexperience of the New Zealand bowling attack, their meek surrender at the hands of Bangladesh was the chief reason behind such views.         
	And the Black Caps were further hurt when fast bowler Hamish Bennett was sent back with a groin injury. On Thursday, Vettori, speaking at a media conference, revealed another bad news when he said that all-rounder Jesse Ryders role in the match had been reduced to that of a batsman.         
	Asked about the status of Ryders stiff calf muscle, Vettori said: Jesses getting better I dont think he will bowl in this Test match, but he will be available to bat.         
	The Black Caps had used Ryders medium-pace to fill the fifth bowlers slot in the Ahmedabad Test, where he picked up the wicket of Gautam Gambhir.         
	Speaking on the ideal bowling combination, the New Zealand captain said: Well certainly look at playing two spinners for this game. The wicket obviously is reasonably flat, but it will have a little more pace in it than the one in Ahmedabad.         
	India have done it for a long time and have been successful with it, but that doesnt necessarily mean it will work for us. We have to replace Bennett anyway So well have a look at all our seamers and see what the right combination is.         
	Asked how big a challenge it was to counter Dhoni amp; Co. in Indian conditions, Vettori said: I think thats the big challenge for teams coming to India  to take 20 wickets Because of the formidable batting line-up and also, the nature of the wickets. We managed to do it in the first Test, but thats been and gone. We have to do it in this one, and thats our aim. We have to take 20 wickets.

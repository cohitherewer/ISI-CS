The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England are stupid, says Beckenbauer
                                                                                                                       7                                        England are stupid, says Beckenbauer
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH             Franz Beckenbauer                           
	Franz Beckenbauer has claimed England are a tired team who have been stupid to set up a World Cup last-16 clash with Germany.         
	Beckenbauer, a World Cup winner as a coach and a player, believes the England players are burnt out following a gruelling Premier League season.         
	Englands failure to win Group C means they will meet Group D winners Germany in the first knockout phase match in Bloemfontein on Sunday, and Beckenbauer would rather have seen the two sides go head to head later in the competition.         
	A game like this should be a semi-final, not a last-16 game, said Beckenbauer. Stupidly, the English have slipped up a little by finishing second in their group.         
	However, Beckenbauer believes Germany are fresher than Fabio Capellos side and that this will work in their favour on Sunday.         
	The English look a little tired, he said. There is a good reason for that: the Premier League players have got to play far more games than their Bundesliga colleagues, including two national cup competitions.         
	Therefore, when it comes to a World Cup or a European Championships, they are burnt out.         
	Our players, on the other hand, seem to be in a physically better condition.         
	Of course we respect them, but we certainly dont fear them. Englands first two appearances at the World Cup were paltry, but they improved against Slovenia.         
	Beckenbauer admitted it will not be an easy game for Germany, since he expects England to be particularly motivated, not only due to the age-old rivalry between the two nations.         
	What makes them dangerous is that their key players Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and John Terry sense that this could be the last chance in their career to win a World Cup, he added. And after all, England have been waiting since 1966 for a title.         
	Fabio Capello appears to have brought discipline to the troops. After they failed to qualify for Euro 2008, England hit rock bottom. Capello has brought in a new structure.         
	The stage is set for another fantastic football battle which Beckenbauer says is guaranteed when the two teams lock horns.         
	England against Germany  they were always the biggest, most unforgettable games in our history, said Beckenbauer.         
	Football fans can only look forward to this classic.         
	Germany captain Philipp Lahm could not agree more because he too used the same word to describe the upcoming humdinger  classic.         
	The duel against England is of course a classic. The anticipation ahead of it is huge, Lahm said. We are looking ahead with confidence. But we know that we have to do some things better.         
	Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff started the mind games early by insisting that England, in spite of their nervy and unimpressive start to the tournament, will be favourites for the game in Bloemfontein on Sunday afternoon.         
	Perhaps it is an advantage not to be the absolute favourites against England, Bierhoff said. Germany coach Joachim Loew is aware of the history between the two sides in the tournament and said he was expecting another close encounter.         
	We are looking forward to taking on England, its always special for us. There is a great history in the World Cup between England and Germany, Loew said.

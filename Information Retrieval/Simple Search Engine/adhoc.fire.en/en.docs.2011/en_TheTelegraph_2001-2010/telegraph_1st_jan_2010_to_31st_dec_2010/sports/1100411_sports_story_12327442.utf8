The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We were rubbish: Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                      We were rubbish: Sourav
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Bangalore: Eleven purple and gold jerseys on the field and, perhaps, no more than 11 in the Chinnaswamy stands.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders werent just outnumbered on that count, they were outgunned, too, by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who won an absolutely must-win match by seven wickets and with 2.5 overs to spare.         
	Theres only one word for that in a T20 game  thrashing. Or, as a fuming captain, Sourav Ganguly, exploded: Rubbish.         
	Now, to make the semi-finals of IPL III, the Knights will have to win each of the three remaining matches. That, of course, is easier said than done.         
	Sourav couldnt have been more blunt. We need to play better cricket... If we continue this way, then we dont deserve to be in the semi-finals. Other teams are playing better...         
	We played good cricket for the first 10 overs, but for the next 30, were absolutely rubbish... In one line, we were rubbish...         
	Sourav had never been as furious even after a very bad day during his years as the Team India captain.         
	The question is: Will the inconsistent fellow-Knights get the message? Unbelievably, for a team which had to win, as many as three catches were put down.         
	If there was a small Rahul Dravid versus Sourav battle within the war of the franchises, even that was lost by the Knights. Dravid scored more and, clearly, had the much bigger impact on the game.         
	The MoM award went to quick Ranganath Vinay Kumar, who broke the Knights momentum by claiming Sourav (103 for two in the 12th over). He took two wickets more to return wowing figures of three for 23.         
	While the national selectors must be pleased that theyve picked Kumar, the son of a one-time auto driver, for the World T20, they may actually be regretting having ignored Robin Uthappa.         
	Uthappa wasnt among the 30 probables  in fact, hes been out of favour for quite sometime, but has emerged as an excellent finisher in this tournament.         
	On Saturday, under the floodlights, he was brilliant (50 not out from 21 balls, 4x4, 4x6).         
	Dravid gave the solidity at the top, Uthappa landed the killer blows as the Ishant Sharmas and Ajantha Mendiss were hit all over the park and beyond.         
	Incidentally, the Royal Challengers decision (probably aimed at surprising) to cap ex-ICL all-rounder Sridharan Sriram didnt backfire.         
	Captain Anil Kumble was delighted as was owner Vijay Mallya and the franchises new face  Deepika Padukone.         
	It was a fantastic effort from the bowlers after they got 100 runs in the 11th over... The smiles are back in the dressing room, Kumble remarked.         
	The Knights have plenty to work on and a probe would cover (a) the failure to get around 180 after such a muscular start; (b) the failure to both penetrate and be disciplined while bowling and (c) the failure to hold catches.         
	Sourav himself dropped one, that of Jacques Kallis, but the hotshot performer wasnt able to capitalise.         
	One shouldnt get too emotional with the results, coach Dav Whatmore told The Telegraphthe other day. Well, principal owner Shah Rukh Khan, for one, would possibly tweet to differ.

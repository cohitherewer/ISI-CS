	Yeongam (South Korea): Force India will look to leave behind the Japan disappointment and improve their position in the constructors championships with a few car upgrades when they hit the brand new Yeongam circuit for the Korean Grand Prix on Sunday.         
	Both drivers  Adrian Sutil and Vitantonio Liuzzi  failed to finish in the Japan leg of the Formula One Championship but with a few upgrades on the anvil, team principal Vijay Mallya is hopeful of scoring points this weekend.         
	We were disappointed by the Japanese event. We didnt make the most of qualifying and we had a double retirement in the race.         
	Weve got some work to do to maintain our advantage in the constructors championship, said chairman and team principal Mallya.         
	Weve put a lot of effort into Korean Grand Prix. Weve got some changes to front wing and a small mechanical update that we didnt use in Suzuka because of the weather.         
	We are also looking at introducing some new aero tweaks to strengthen performance, but of course we want to make sure any effort is targeted and will give a genuine improvement, he said.

	Shillong: Lajong FC will be fighting to keep their place in the I-League when they take on Chirag United here on Wednesday, but they will be fervently praying that the rains do not play spoilsport.         
	Its a very important match for us since a win will ensure that we are out of the relegation zone. But we hope that the rain does not hamper the match, Lajong coach Stanley Rozario said .         
	Chirag, however, will be missing two of their midfielders  Denson Devadas and Jayanta Sen. While Denson is under suspension for double-booking, Jayanta is out with an injury.         
	Chirag team management, too, were worried with the weather. We havent played in such weather conditions for the past six months, and hence we are a bit worried about the match, an official said.         
	It remains to be seen how Chirag, who are placed sixth on the points table, handle the drop in mercury level.         
	In the other match of the day Mahindra United will face Pune FC.

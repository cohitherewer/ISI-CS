            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is contemplating introducing a Test league from where the top four teams would qualify for a quadrennial play-off event to begin in 2013.         
	The recommendation was made at the ICC chief executives committee (CEC) meeting, which was held in Cape Town, on Monday and Tuesday.         
	Apart from the Test play-off, the CEC also recommended an ODI league from next year.         
	The Future Tours Programme (FTP) should consist of a Test league to provide context for all Test matches. The league would determine the top four teams to qualify for an ICC Test play-off. The play-off should be held once every four years to determine the Test champion team with a request to hold the first such play-off in 2013, the ICC said in a statement, on Tuesday.         
	 The FTP should also consist of an one-day International league, the first to run from April 2011 until April 2014, culminating in the crowning of an ODI league champion. This would run separate to the ICC Cricket World Cup, it added.         
	The CEC also recommended that the games governing body should consider a 10-team format for the ICCs flagship event, the ODI World Cup, from 2015 and a 16-team format for the mens World Twenty20 from 2012.         
	The committee also recommended the introduction of Twenty20 International rankings.         
	On the bad light issue, the statement quoted David Richardson, ICC general manager  cricket, as saying: There is a clear instruction to match officials that the players should only go off the field when conditions are considered dangerous or unreasonable. In addition, players should not go off the field when the ground floodlights are switched on and these were deemed before the series to be adequate.         
	The CEC also discussed the need to ensure that Test match pitches provide a fair balance between bat and ball and approved a revised guideline to the ICC pitch and outfield monitoring process.         
	The CEC also received a detailed progress report on preparations for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, including the release of the next phase of match tickets on October 15.

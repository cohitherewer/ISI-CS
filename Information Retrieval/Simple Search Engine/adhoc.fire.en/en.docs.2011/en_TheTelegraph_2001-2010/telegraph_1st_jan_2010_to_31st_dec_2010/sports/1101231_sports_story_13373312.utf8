                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag hold Dempo
                      
	Margao: A late goal by Joshimar helped Chirag United hold Dempo to a 1-1 draw in the sixth round of the I-League, played at Nehru Stadium, here Thursday.         
	Dempo took the lead in the stoppage time of the first half through Cliffton Gonsalves which was cancelled by Joshimar in the 89th minute. After this draw, Dempo and Chirag have nine points each from six matches but Dempo are placed fourth due to a better goal difference.         
	In Gurgaon, an impressive AIFF XI beat HAL 2-1. Striker Malsawmfela (33rd minute) and Bikramjit Singh (53rd) scored for AIFF XI while RC Prakash found the target for HAL through a penalty kick in the 88th minute at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium. They have seven points from six matches, the same as HAL from the same number of matches. ONGC were held by Churchill to a draw, 1-1, in Kolhapur.         
	Dempo finally tasted success in the injury time of the first half when Betos well-directed cross from the left saw Clifton gently tap in after Ranty failed to guide the ball home.         
	AIFF XI were clearly the better side, on Thursday, today though the scoreline did not tell the whole story. They could have won by a bigger margin had not captain Jeje Lalpekhlua missed a spot kick and the woodwork come in their way twice.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It was an incredible moment: Gavaskar
                                                                                                                       7                                        It was an incredible moment: Gavaskar
                  Sunil Gavaskar                     
	Sunil Gavaskar, under whose captaincy India won the WCC, recently spoke to Lokendra Pratap Sahi, exclusively on that tournament. The following are excerpts from the two-part interview published in The Telegraph on February 18 and 19:                 
	Q Mood in the team on landing in Australia         
	A Basically, the mood was positive. Positive because we had a change in personnel, we had younger players coming into the team... That always makes a difference. Siva (Laxman Sivaramakrishnan), Sadanand (Viswanath)... If you have guys who have not had the trauma of defeat hanging over them, new guys, then they bring a fresh perspective and are a lot more positive. That rubs off on everybody... Sadanand, I remember, was absolutely magical...         
	His own feelings after everything that had happened in the 1984-85 season         
	I was very confident. I was also very relaxed in the mind, as I had decided to give up the captaincy... Confident because we had a good team, we had all-rounders and we had very, very good spinners (Siva, Ravi Shastri)... The MCG, especially, is a big ground and to try and hit a leg-spinner consistently into the stands would not be easy. Unlike now, in those days, you had to clear the fence (not just the rope) for the hit to be a six... The all-rounders did make a difference.         
	The first match being against Pakistan...         
	In fact, Pakistan was probably the best team to face... For, if you beat them, you would be on a roll. Playing them first up was, perhaps, the best thing that could have happened. It really meant that we simply could not afford to be slow starters, had to be quick off the block.         
	Three wins on the trot and India making the semis, against New Zealand         
	Luckily, none of the guys in the team were complacent, for the simple reason that there was an Audi as the prize for the man of the tournament, the Champion of Champions. So you could see that those who were doing well were not going to be complacent, despite the fact that they might have got runs and/or wickets in the earlier matches. In those days, you could not get a foreign car that easily, a fair bit of red tape was involved... There was no complacency, just a bit of wariness that our record against New Zealand wasnt very good.         
	Bowling out New Zealand for 206...         
	I recall the assault by Lance Cairns (39 off 29 balls) in the final overs. Till he exploded, we had been looking to restrict them to a much lower score... But, then, Cairns had an unorthodox manner and was capable of hitting the ball from way outside the off stump over square leg... He was dropped off Madanlal by, I think, (Krishnamachari) Srikkanth... Later, he did catch Cairns, but after not making an effort once in between... I was a bit upset and, because I was fielding some distance away from him, gestured that he should at least make an effort.         
	Being up against Pakistan in the final         
	We were in such a confident frame of mind that we would not have minded the Rest of the World... The West Indies featured in the other semi-final and they would always be difficult. They would have been far more difficult opponents, so Pakistan was just fine.         
	Memories of the final...         
	The Siva delivery which got rid of Javed (Miandad)... Was an absolute beauty... Also, the way Kapil Dev got the opening batsmen (Mudassar Nazar, Ramiz Raja)... The bowling of Chetan Sharma as well... Everybody contributed, with Jimmy (Mohinder Amarnath), too, bowling a very good spell... Very little freedom was given to the Pakistanis. We were, in fact, in such a situation that Pakistan were nine down with about 35 minutes remaining for the interval. The last thing I wanted was for the last wicket to fall before the half-an-hour business. Because, then, we would have had to play maybe four or five overs and they would have gone flat out. I didnt want that to happen. I remember actually giving Chetan the ball and, when he started to mark his run-up, I sort of pretended to scratch my head... After he had marked his run-up, I said hang on a minute and I called, I think, Shastri to bowl that over. That took up two-three minutes, by which time it was well past that half-an-hour stipulation. There was no chance of us batting before the break. Unfortunately, we could not take the last wicket and Pakistan finished on 176 for nine... That was the only time in the tournament we had not dismissed the opposition.         
	After the winning run had been hit         
	It was an incredible moment. We were all in the dressing room and were jumping... Champagne had been arranged and people were spraying the bubbly on each other... There was a lot of screaming and shouting, as you would expect.         
	Finally, significance of that win 25 years down the line         
	Restored self-belief... Because, after the 1983 World Cup, we had lost to the West Indies in all the one-day matches... We had been beaten by England... The WCC victory made us believe that we could win anywhere.

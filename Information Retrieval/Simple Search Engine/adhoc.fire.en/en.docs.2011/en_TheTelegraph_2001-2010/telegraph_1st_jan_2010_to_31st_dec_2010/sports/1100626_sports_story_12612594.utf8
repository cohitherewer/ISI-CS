The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clearances, Modi bills put on hold
                                                                                                                       7                                        Clearances, Modi bills put on hold
    - Facilitation fee of Rs 425 crore will now be the BCCIs             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                    Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi (top) and Sunil Gavaskar, in Mumbai, on Friday                            
	Calcutta: Lalit Kumar Modi flew off to an appreciably cooler Europe, aboard tycoon and buddy Vijay Mallyas private jet on Thursday, but its getting very hot for him in India.         
	In fact, the temperature soared at one stroke, with MSM Satellite (Singapore) Pte Ltd agreeing to pay Rs 425 crore, earmarked as its facilitation fee for the Indian Premier League (IPL)s media rights, to the Board, instead of WSG Mauritius Ltd.         
	A facilitation fee is a polite way of describing a kickback.         
	So far, on the rights issue, the fingers have all pointed at Modi, the suspended chairman and commissioner of the IPL, in whose regime the deal was struck.         
	Its an admission of wrongdoing by the company, formerly Sony Entertainment Television India Pvt Ltd, otherwise why would it agree to make good a loss to the Board, which owns the IPL property.         
	According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, the fear of legal action probably played a significant part in the scripts change.         
	The scandalous facts were placed before the IPLs governing council, which met in Mumbai on Friday, causing Modis stock to hit rock bottom.         
	Going by the fresh agreement, the BCCI is assured of Rs 300 crore, in structured payments, while the remaining Rs 125 crore will be paid once recovered from WSG Mauritius Ltd.         
	Significantly, with Board president Shashank Manohar vowing to run a clean IPL, the council put on hold a request from the Kings XI Punjab co-owners, except Priety Zinta, to sell 93 per cent of their stake.         
	Permission also wasnt given to GMR, which owns the Delhi DareDevils, to recast its internal arrangement.         
	As one source put it: With Central government agencies looking into so many things, this isnt the time to allow for the shareholding patterns to change... Let us first get the green signal from the agencies probing this and that...         
	The government agencies, one understands, continue to ask uncomfortable questions with regard to the Rajasthan Royals contract with the IPL.         
	Modis relatives have a stake there.         
	Meanwhile, its learnt that the council withheld the okaying of two bills related to the IPLs third edition, this year.         
	The bills are (a) those sent by the Four Seasons Hotel, in Mumbai, which had been Modis HQ, and (b) his ground transportation.         
	The Four Seasons bill is around Rs 1.23 crore... Even though the Board gave the IPL ample space at the Cricket Centre (Wankhede Stadium), Modi chose to work out of the hotel... The bills include those in the names of some of his friends... How can they be cleared by the council? Modi shouldve settled those bills himself, instead of treating his friends on the IPLs account, another source said.         
	Thats not all.         
	As much as Rs 43 lakh was spent on Modis ground transportation. It may be re-checked, but a Mercedes Benz was brought from Hyderabad to Nagpur, for a few hours usage by Modi... Then, a BMW was driven to Dharamshala, from Delhi, for his use there. Would you believe it?         
	Well, Modi really made the most of his years as the IPLs supreme authority. Now, of course, hes facing the music. And the heat, too.         
	Footnote: The Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan Royals will each have to pay back the Rs 13 crore received from the IPL for the scrapping of the 2008 Champions League, after 26/11.

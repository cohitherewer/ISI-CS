The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer will bounce back: Kohli
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zaheer will bounce back: Kohli
                      
	Dhaka: Indian teams new batting star Virat Kohli stood strongly behind his senior colleague Zaheer Khan who has been expensive in the two matches that India has played so far.         
	The Delhi batsman stated that Zaheer has enough experience to come back hard at the opposition in the last few matches. One of the seniormost players, Zaheer has gone wicketless in the two matches.         
	Zaheer hasnt done that badly. He is such an experienced bowler who can take corrective measures and comeback strongly. I dont think his form is a reason for worry, Kohli said after the teams practice session at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium ahead of Sundays match against Sri Lanka.         
	Kohli said Indian team is confident of beating Lankans on Sunday.         
	Sri Lanka and India have played a lot between themselves in the last few months and we know the strength and drawbacks of each other very well.         
	It will be a tough match tomorrow and we want to win it, the youngster said in no uncertain terms.         
	Asked about his personal form in the tournament so far, Kohli said he is looking to keep up his good work and would like to play another long innings.         
	The Indian team had an optional practice session on Saturday without vice-captain Sehwag, who decided to stay put at the team hotel, but Kohli said there was nothing to worry about as the dashing opener was fit and fine.         
	Kohli, who was the skipper of the Indian colts that won the Under-19 World Cup two years back in Malaysia, wished good luck to the current members of the junior team who will be defending the title in New Zealand this month.         
	Under 19 World Cup is a big platform to graduate to the higher level. I wish them good luck, he said.           (PTI)

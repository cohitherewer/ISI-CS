	London: A day of publicity stunts involving Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi in East London descended into pandemonium. The diminutive Argentina forward had been due to take part in a match at Hackney Marshes, home to hundreds of amateur football sides.         
	Yet as he arrived by helicopter Messi was mobbed by excited fans  who had been tipped off about the event via a social networking site prompting security guards to pull the plug on the stars scheduled appearance as a substitute.         
	Messi did appear at a subsequent football boot giveaway near Brick Lane, but his scheduled appearance at a five-a-side match in Stepney Green was cancelled  and when representatives of sponsors Adidas, told the crowd that Messi would not be showing up, the scene turned violent. Fans threw bottles, cans and cups on to the caged five-a-side pitch, forcing police to call in reinforcements to disperse the assembled throng.

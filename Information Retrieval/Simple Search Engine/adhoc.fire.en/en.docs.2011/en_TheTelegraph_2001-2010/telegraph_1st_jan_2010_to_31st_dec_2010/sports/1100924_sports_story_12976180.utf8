The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav: I hope Sachin wins Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav: I hope Sachin wins Cup
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly says Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. would be under a lot of pressure to lift the World Cup next year but hoped Sachin Tendulkars experience would steer them to the title.         
	With around 150 days to go until the start of the World Cup, Sourav believes that if India was to lift the trophy at the Wankhede on April 2, it would be a fitting finale to Sachins World Cup career.         
	I hope he makes it (to the final) and wins it. That is the best way he can give back to Indian cricket. He is a phenomenon and his records and achievements have been fantastic, and hopefully, he can add that feather in his cap, Sourav was quoted as saying in an ICC release.         
	Sourav believes that although India will be under pressure to win at the World Cup, the side has the quality needed to win the trophy.         
	There will be pressure  there is no doubt. For the home teams there is pressure, especially when you play in India. Every time Dhoni and his boys, like Sachin, walk out of the hotel there will be people saying we want you to win, we want you to win it. That does add a bit of pressure but I am sure they are used to it, he said.         
	Its very difficult to say who will be the winner of the tournament, but I will definitely be backing India. India have a strong team and hopefully they will go all the way, he added.         
	Sourav said India have enough batting talent but the team need to work on their bowling. I am not a big person who compares (sides) but this is a very good side with a very good batting line up. A side which has batsmen like Sehwag, Sachin, Yuvraj, Dhoni in the shorter format  and Gambhir  it must be a serious batting line.         
	The bowling just worries me a bit but hopefully they will all stay fit and do well in the big tournament.         
	Sourav also believes that the interest in the tournament will be huge and that the World Cup 2011 will attract admiration from across the globe as a major sporting event.

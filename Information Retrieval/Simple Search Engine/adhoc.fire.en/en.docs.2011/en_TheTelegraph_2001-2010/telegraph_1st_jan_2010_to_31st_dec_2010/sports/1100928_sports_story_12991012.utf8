The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Milla twist for Games
                                                                                                                       7                                        Milla twist for Games
  - Icon will visit Delhi to encourage compatriots         JAYDEEP BASU            Roger Milla                                 
	New Delhi: Rendered low on glamour by a spate of pullouts, the Commonwealth Games will get a much-needed boost when soccer star Roger Milla joins his Cameroon compatriots this week.         
	According to sources in the Cameroon CWG squad, which checked into the Village on Sunday, the legendary African footballer will fly down to Delhi to encourage the athletes from his country in the 12-day extravaganza beginning on October 3.         
	Milla is expected to come sometime this week, an official of the Cameroon team said.         
	He is supposed to accompany our minister for sports and physical education to watch some of the events in the Games, the official added. He, however, was not aware whether the former star would stay at the Games Village.         
	Though football is not a part of the Commonwealth Games, Milla is coming to the Games on the strength of being the sports ambassador of Cameroon.         
	Easily the most famous name of the sporting fraternity of his country, Milla spends most of his time jetting around the world to spread the message of sports and goodwill.         
	Milla achieved international stardom in the 1990 World Cup scoring four goals, each celebrated with special dance steps, which has become a trademark in modern football. A few months later, Milla visited Calcutta when he played a match for Diamond Club as a part of Mohun Bagans centenary celebrations.         
	In 2004, Milla was chosen by Pele and Fifa as one of the top 125 living soccer players and in 2006 as the best African soccer player of the last century by the African football association.         
	Currently, Milla is also one of the ambassadors for Qatars bid to host the World Cup football in 2022.         
	Milla, who achieved stardom at the age of 38 in the 1990 World Cup, was recently in the news when he accused the present day footballers of reserving their best for their clubs and ignoring the national team.         
	Millas comments, which was mainly aimed at Cameroon soccer star Samuel Eto after the World Cup in South Africa, resulted in a war of words between the two football icons.         
	The situation turned so bad that Cameroons minister of sports finally decided to reconcile the two and made Milla and Eto to meet and sort out their differences.

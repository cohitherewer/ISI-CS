                                                                                                                       7                                      EB are firm favourites
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The brilliance of East Bengal will be up against the youth of the AIFF XI, in an I-League encounter, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Sunday.         
	If surprises are kept at bay, the high flying red and gold brigade should stroll to victory against the inexperienced AIFF side. East Bengal are too strong an opposition for the kids who are coached by David Bulpin.         
	With wins in their first two matches, Trevor Morgans side will look to garner full points on Sunday as well. After all, taking an early lead in the points table eases future pressure.         
	Fresh from a morale-boosting success against Dempo in their last match, East Bengal at the moment are confidence personified. Barring defender Ogba Okpara, Morgan has almost his entire team from the last match at his disposal. Okpara has a throat infection and is a doubtful starter against the AIFF team.         
	Morgan though sounded a word of caution saying that he is well aware of the high energy-level of the AIFF XI. We will definitely fight to keep the winning momentum going and will be gunning for three points. But I do know that the AIFF XI is a young side, full of energy For us to be successful, we have to match their speed, he said.         
	He was also of the opinion that the oppositions nothing-to-lose attitude makes them even more dangerous. They will be playing freely since they have nothing to lose. Gaining experience is their only goal and that makes them dangerous. They can play an attacking game, Morgan said.         
	The AIFF XI, on the other hand, will look to outpace their more fancied rivals. Tired after a pretty long Calcutta Football League, East Bengals fitness is a big worry.

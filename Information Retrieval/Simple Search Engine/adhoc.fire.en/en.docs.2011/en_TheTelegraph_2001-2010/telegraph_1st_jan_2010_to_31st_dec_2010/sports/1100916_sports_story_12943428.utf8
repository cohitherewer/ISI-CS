                                                                                                                       7                                        Aamer gets Musharraf support!
                  Pervez Musharraf                     
	Hong Kong: Former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf is of the view that compassion should be shown to young fast bowler Mohammed Aamer, accused of spot-fixing, as he is from a poor family.         
	Pakistans tour of England has been overshadowed by allegations of spot-fixing against Test captain Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Aamer.         
	Musharraf described the allegations as very sad, adding that anyone involved has to be punished.         
	But Aamer, the youngest of the group, should be viewed compassionately because of his familys low-income status and the 18-year-olds contribution to the game, Musharraf added.         
	It is a very sad incident, he told reporters in Hong Kong after addressing an annual investors forum.         
	Anyone involved has to be punished... But (Aamers) case, I feel, needs to be seen compassionately... He comes from a poor family. Destroying him would destroy his family.         
	Pakistans former leader, who said he plans to stand for parliament in the countrys next general election in 2013, said Aamer is a great cricketer and we must not allow cricket to lose.         
	(Aamer) came under the influence of senior players, Musharraf added.         
	The three players were provisionally suspended by the ICC on September 2.           (PTI)

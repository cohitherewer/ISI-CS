The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Collingwood: It cant get any bigger than this
                                                                                                                       7                                      Collingwood: It cant get any bigger than this
                      
	Bridgetown: England captain Paul Collingwood said he was not surprised by Australias remarkable last-over win over Pakistan and believes his team are ready to beat their old rivals in Sundays World Twenty20 final.         
	We always knew what Australia were capable of, said Collingwood. Nothing surprised us yesterday. All we can concentrate on is our game. Australia have always been a very strong side, and they still are. It bodes well for what should be a very, very good final.         
	Whether it had been Pakistan or Australia, we will have to play well, he said.         
	 Collingwood said that the team, which is likely to be unchanged, are relishing the biggest challenge yet.         
	Theres plenty of confidence in our side, the way weve played throughout this tournament has given us a lot of belief. We believe weve got the skills to beat any side on the day. We have surprised a few ourselves in this tournament  and the guys are very, very positive.         
	England have never won a global limited overs in the 35 years since the ICC began organising them.         
	When youre going into a World Cup final theres a lot of emotion around. But the guys seem very relaxed, and know their roles very well.         
	We havent won anything yet -- thats the thing. Weve got to a final, but it means nothing until we win a World Cup. Until we do that, were going to keep our feet on the ground.         
	This is literally the ultimate. Youve got through to a World Cup final; youre playing against the old enemy, Australia. It doesnt get much better than this, he said.         
	Englands last attempt to win a world event was the 2004 Champions Trophy, which ended in defeat to West Indies and Collingwood is the only survivor from that team.         
	I think if you have played in big matches it does help but there is also the cause that if you are fresh into a side and you dont know what its all about it can sometimes help.         
	There are a lot of guys in our side that havent experienced finals but I really do sense the guys are ready, he said.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Verbal duel before war

  - We are a better team: Schweinsteiger       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      German players during a training session at the Super Stadium, in Atteridgeville, near Pretoria, on Monday. (AP)      
	Johannesburg: Forty-eight hours before the clash of titans  Germany and Spain  in the second semi-final on Wednesday, the war of words has charged up both the camps.         
	On Monday, the players of the two teams fired salvos at each other, indicating it could be a high tension affair at the Moses Mabhida stadium in Durban.         
	Midfield general Bastian Schweinsteiger, one of the chief architects of Germanys blazing show in the World Cup so far, has already sounded a warning to the Spaniards saying he was determined to reverse the result of the Euro 2008 final.         
	Germany have painful memories of the final played in Vienna when they lost to Spain, thanks to a Fernando Torres goal.         
	Spain then had looked a far superior side and were surely unlucky not to send the ball a few more times into the German net.         
	What happened two years ago is not going to be repeated, Schweinsteiger said.         
	We are a younger side and a better team. They (Spain) havent changed much. Sergio Busquets has replaced Marcos Senna but otherwise they are pretty much the same side as two years ago, said Schweinsteiger, who has transformed himself from an underachieving left winger to a thriving playmaker.         
	I dont have any disrespect for Spain. All I want to say that we are a developing side while Spain are stagnating. Xavi, (Andres) Iniesta, (David) Villa are all great players but we wont provide them many chances to get into our area, said Schweinsteiger. In the last two matches we have proved that we can beat teams that appear the better on paper.         
	Germany seem to have developed a strategy of putting pressure on the rivals before a big match with Schweinsteiger taking the lead in undermining the opponents.         
	Against Argentina, too, the midfielder called the South American side a team that lacked respects for their rivals.         
	In the Spanish camp, the onus was on Fernando Torres to give something back to the Germans.         
	Torres is himself under pressure for non-performance but he decided have a go at the Germans.         
	Two years ago, I was the one who scored the only goal of the match to give Spain their first Euro title in many years, said Torres.         
	Now we are hoping to make our first ever World Cup final. No matter how Germany play and no matter who scores for us, we will reach the final and make history again, added the Liverpool striker.         
	Wednesdays match could be a big day for German striker Miroslav Klose, who, with his two goals against Argentina, now has 14 World Cup goals  one behind Brazils World record holder Ronaldo.         
	Klose, who already had a dig at Ronaldo saying the Brazilian shouldnt be too worried, said he was confident of getting a few more against Spain.         
	We will sit down together and analyse the strengths and weaknesses of Spain and find a strategy to counter them. They are better than England and Germany, but wont be able stop us, Klose said.         
	Interestingly, the two coaches, Joachim Loew and Vicente del Bosque have so far carefully avoided getting at each others team, leaving it for the players to do the talking.         
	While Loew said he has respect for the opponents, Del Bosque promised a better brand of football.         
	The Germans had also exchanged salvos with Diego Maradonas Argentina in the build-up to their quarter final clash. Going by what they did to the Lionel Messis, it seems the three-time world champions know a thing or tow about backing their words with action. Schweinsteiger had taken the lead then too and had said the Argentines displayed a lack of respect for their rivals.

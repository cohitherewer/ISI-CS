The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Missed out on big prize: Kumble
                                                                                                                       7                                      Missed out on big prize: Kumble
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Royal Challengers Bangalore skipper Anil Kumble said Wednesday that his side failed when it came to being on the top of their game for the 40 overs of the match and paid the price for it, losing to the Mumbai Indians by 35 runs in the first semi-final.               
	The following are excerpts:               
	The last five overs of MIs innings         
	We gave away a lot more runs than what we should have. The over I bowled gave them the momentum. I thought the way we bowled the first 15 overs, we should be able to restrict them to 165-175.         
	On the teams batting collapse         
	We were on course at 90 for two after nine overs. In T20 thats a par score, especially on a wicket like this. But two wickets in two balls (of Rahul Dravid and Robin Uthappa) didnt help.         
	The Champions League slot         
	We have a couple of days to reflect. That (Champions League T20 slot) would be a consolation for us but the big prize is winning the IPL and we have missed out on that.         
	Kieron Pollard         
	In T20, one player is always going to have a good day. Today it was Pollard. But I dont think we played well for the full 40 overs. We bowled well the first 15 overs and batted well in the first eight.         
	The role of the seniors         
	This is a professional team with some of the guys having played more than 100 internationals. Its disappointing when you put up such a batting performance but lets give credit to the Mumbai Indians.

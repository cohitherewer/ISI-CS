  - Kohli and Pandey shine as RCB defeat Lions by six wickets 
                  Manish Pandey on way to his 44, in Johannesburg, on Tuesday                     
	Johannesburg: Royal Challengers Bangalores top-order fired in unison as they humbled the Lions by six wickets to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League Twenty20 tournament here on Tuesday.         
	In a virtual quarter final, Royals first restricted the Lions to 159 for six and then achieved the target with six balls to spare to become the first IPL team to reach the last four stage of the T20 tournament.         
	Openers Manish Pandey (44) and Rahul Dravid (33) set the tone for a successful run chase with the former India skipper turning out to be the main aggressor. Virat Kohli then hit a whirlwind 29-ball 49 in pressure cooker situation to see the team through.         
	Earlier, Alviro Petersen smashed a 29-ball 45 while Robert Frylinck provided the late charge to help Lions post a competitive 159 after they decided to bat first.         
	Pandey started the proceedings for the RCB, hitting Deacon for the first boundary. Soon Dravid got into the act and blasted consecutive boundaries off Reilly in the second over.         
	Reilly was treated with equal disdain in the next over by Dravid, who slashed him across the point boundary, before sending Frylinck on a leather hunt past mid-on.         
	Pandey then smashed Reilly through the covers to pick up another four, while Dravid sent Richard Cameron across the deep backward point boundary.         
	Looking for a boundary on the off side in the eighth over off Aaron Phangiso, Dravid saw his stumps crashed as RCB lost their first wicket with 53 on the board. Pandey then took the responsibility and picked up a boundary off Cameron, before smashing Phangiso for a four and a six in the 10th over.         
	The Karnataka batsman smashed Frylinck for another boundary at square leg but holed out to Reilly at long-off in the 12th over off Cameron as RCB slumped to 85 for two in 11.3 overs.         
	Out-of-form Ross Taylor (5) was the next to go. Trying to hit a Deacon delivery, he failed to clear the inside circle and was caught by Petersen.         
	Robin Uthappa (7) also got out cheaply while trying to steal a run as Lions clawed back into the game, reducing RCB to 112 for four in 15 overs.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England leave Irish to rue their luck
                                                                                                                       7                                      England leave Irish to rue their luck
                      
	Georgetown: England entered the Super Eight stage of the World Twenty20 after heavy downpour washed out their crucial Group D tie against Ireland here.         
	With each team getting one point, England qualified for the Super Eight stage, thanks to superior net run-rate. England have a net run-rate of -0.45, better than Irelands -3.50 after the two group matches. Hosts West Indies have already qualified as the top team from Group D.         
	Put into bat, England got off to a dismal start but Eoin Morgans determined 37-ball 45 against a team he has represented at one time helped them eke out a modest 120 for eight Tuesday.         
	Morgan, who struck five fours, found good support in Luke Wright (20 off 24). The duo came together with the team struggling at 49 for four and added 41 runs for the fifth wicket to script timely recovery.         
	Rain halted the match soon after Ireland had started their chase. They were four for no loss from 1.2 overs when the skies opened up.         
	The proceedings resumed under a laden sky after almost half-an-hour but Ireland could add only 10 runs in 13 balls before it started pouring again.         
	Ireland lost their only wicket during those few minutes of play when opener Paul Stirling fell for a duck to Ryan Sidebottom in the second over.         
	Ireland were 14 for one in 3.3 overs with captain William Porterfield (4 not out) and Niall Brien (9 not out) at the crease when play was halted for a second time. (PTI)

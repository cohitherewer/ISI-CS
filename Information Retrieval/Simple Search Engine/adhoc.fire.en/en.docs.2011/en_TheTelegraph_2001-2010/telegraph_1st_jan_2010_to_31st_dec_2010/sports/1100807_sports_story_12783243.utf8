The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal spot on vs Goa
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal spot on vs Goa
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bengal players celebrate their win over Goa, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Its difficult to come up trumps in crunch situations without a slice of luck.         
	Otherwise, how would one explain victory for a team that lost its main striker (Nilendra Dewan) in the seventh minute and trailed till the 84th minute.         
	Bengals love affair with Santosh Trophy continues as the 29-time winners defeated defending champions Goa 5-4 (1-1 regulation time) via tie-breaker, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Friday.         
	It was also a sweet revenge as the hosts lost to Goa in the final in Chennai last year. They will meet Punjab in the final on Sunday, who beat Tamil Nadu 3-1 in the second semi-final.         
	Even the tie-breaker started on a disastrous note for Bengal with Felix DSouza saving Rajiv Ghoshs shot. Captain Snehasish Chakraborty, Souvik Chakraborty, Sheikh Azim then scored.         
	For Goa, Denzil Franco, Cavin Lobo and Adil Khan converted from the spot. At 3-3, John Dias shot hit the post and and then Nicholas Rodrigues feeble push was anticipated correctly by Abhra Mondal. As Denson Devadas smashed home to clinch the issue, it seemed the hosts are riding on champions luck.         
	From Bengals perspective, it would be fair to say that hosts were pathetic in the first 45 minutes and impressive in the second.         
	That was the time when they made repeated forays into the Goan territory but Robin Singh lacked the finishing touch.         
	With no Shankar Oraon (he is out for six months) around him and Tarif Ahmed being almost non-existent, Robins inexperience saw him miss a couple of sitters.         
	Yet, Shabbir should be grateful that Robin provided the equaliser in the 84th minute. Following a Dhanarajan throw, Robin took his marker John Dias in his stride and packed a lot of punch in his left footer as Goan captain Felix DSouza had no chance.         
	Goa got the lead in the 20th minute. Denzil Francos corner was met at the far post by Peter Carvalho, whose beautiful assist was nodded home by Milagres. Surprisingly neither Arnab Mondal nor Shiekh Azim bothered to mark Milagres. After the change of ends, Goa had one clear attempt at goal. But Cavin Lobo shot wide with Abhra at his mercy.         
	After that, it was Bengal all the way.         
	TEAMS         
	Bengal: Abhra Mondal, R.Dhanarajan, Arnab Mondal, Sheikh Azim, Rajiv Ghosh, Snehasish Chakraborty, Jayanta Sen, Denson Devadas, Gauranga Dutta (Safar Sardar, 116th), Nilendra Dewan (Robin Singh, 7th), Tarif Ahmed (Souvik Chakraborty,73rd).

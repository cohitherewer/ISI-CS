	New Delhi: Indias gold rush continued unabated at the Commonwealth Games shooting, on Friday as Gagan Narang, Omkar Singh and Vijay Kumar ensured three more gold medals at the Karni Singh shooting range.         
	Narang, who stayed unbeaten in all his three events so far, is in line to bag six gold medals from this meet. The Hyderabad boy is hot favourite to win the individual category of the event on Saturday, and would later compete in the 50m prone pairs and individual events. He now has a strong chance of erasing pistol shooter Samresh Jungs record of winning five gold medals in the Commonwealth Games.         
	While Narang and Omkar clinched their third gold medal of the Games with resounding performance, Vijay Kumar picked up his second gold in the 25m air pistol event. Narang was the winner of the 50m rifle 3-postion pairs with Imran Hasan Khan while Omkar Singh won the 10m air pistol individual event.         
	Indias tally of medals from the shooting events now stands at 10 gold, seven silver and one bronze medal.         
	I prepared myself well for the Commonwealth Games, said Narang later. But the job is not yet finished. The whole nation expects the shooting squad to come up with an excellent performance on the home turf.         
	Currently ranked third in the world in 10m air rifle, Gagan shot 1167 (prone 397, standing 385, kneeling 385) while Imran shot 1158 (prone 395, standing 381, kneeling 382) as India won the gold with a total of 2325 points, a Games record.         
	In the mens 25m rapid-fire pistol individual event, Vijay Kumar dished out a sparkling display. The Army boy broke his own Games record to take the top spot. His total score of 787.5 (583 in qualifying, 204.5 in final) was way ahead of his previous park (778.2) that he set in Melbourne in 2006.         
	Thursdays hero, Gurpreet Singh won the bronze, totalling 758.7 (569 qualifying, 189.7 final). Vijay Kumar, on the other hand, was not happy with his own performance despite setting the Games record. Creating the Games record for the second time in four years is always a special occasion but I am not happy with my scores, he said.         
	In the mens trap pairs, the famed Indian duo of Manavjit Singh and Mansher Singh came up with a superb performance of 198 points but had to remain satisfied with the silver medal.         
	Omkar equalled the Games record in the qualifying round by shooting 584. In the final, he shot 97.8 to finish with 681.8.

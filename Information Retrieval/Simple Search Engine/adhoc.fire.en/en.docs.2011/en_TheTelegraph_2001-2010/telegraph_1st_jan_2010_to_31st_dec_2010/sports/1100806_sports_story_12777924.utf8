The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Benzema makes France return
                                                                                                                       7                                        Benzema makes France return

	Paris: Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema returned to the France squad for next weeks friendly against Norway despite his involvement in an investigation over allegations that he solicited an underage prostitute.         
	Benzema, who was not at the World Cup after an unimpressive season, received a call on Thursday along with seven new players. Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery is also involved in the case and was left out by France coach Laurent Blanc because he was among the 23 players who went on strike during a World Cup training session. Those players are suspended for Blancs first game in charge in Norway on Wednesday.         
	Last month, a French judge issued preliminary charges against Ribery and Benzema as part of a probe into a suspected network of prostitutes operating out of a nightclub on Paris Champs-Elysees.         
	Some members of the French government said it would be better if the players were left out of the national squad during the investigation, but Blanc said Benzemas private life was none of his business.         
	I thought it was important to give him a call because he can be part of the teams core in a near future, Blanc said.         
	France will begin their 2012 European Championship qualifying campaign against Belarus on September 3 .         
	For the Norway friendly, Blanc called in an experimental group of 22 players, including 13 uncapped players and seven new faces. Blanc, however, also called up experienced players like Arsenals Samir Nasri, Hatem Ben Arfa of Marseille and AS Roma defender Philippe Mexes, who had been shunned by predecessor Raymond Domenech for the World Cup.         
	Meanwhile, Anelka said Domenech made him feel disgusted with football by forcing him to play out of position during the World Cup.           (AGENCIES)

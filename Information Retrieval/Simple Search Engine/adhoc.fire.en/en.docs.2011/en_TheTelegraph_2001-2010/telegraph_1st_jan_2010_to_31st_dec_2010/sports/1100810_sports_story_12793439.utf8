The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | An ideal preparation for Cup, says Taylor
                                                                                                                       7                                      An ideal preparation for Cup, says Taylor
            A CORRESPONDENT                                
	New Zealand captain Ross Taylor believes that the tri-series in Sri Lanka would be the ideal preparation for his team ahead of the 2011 World Cup in the subcontinent.         
	Taylor, who is leading the side in the absence of Daniel Vettori, said: Definitely, an ideal preparation Obviously, coming from New Zealand, the pitches are going to play differently; but the conditions that we have here and in India and Bangladesh will be similar to what we are going to experience in the World Cup. So this experience is going to be valuable for the team and for the youngsters leading in to the selection for the World Cup.         
	Speaking at a media conference on the Monday, the eve of their first match of the tri-series against India, Taylor also said that youngsters would have a chance to prove themselves before the selection of the World Cup squad.         
	If we can have a squad of 20-odd to pick from and push each other, I think it will augur well for the upcoming months and for the World Cup, he said.         
	However, he dismissed any views that the inexperienced Black Caps side would treat the tournament only as a practice meet. We have come here to win, we won the warm-up games and probably have got an edge over them in playing the competition. We know its going to be tough, but we are looking forward to the challenge, the captain said.         
	Speaking about his team, Taylor made special mention of Andy McKay, saying he is the fastest bowler in the squad and a possible replacement for the retired Shane Bond. We have very exciting players Andy McKay is our fastest bowler in the squad and after losing Shane Bond through retirement, he is going to become a big part of our side. BJ Watling and Kane Williamson are two young and exciting players. Kane is a player who has been earmarked to play for New Zealand for a long time. Hes only just turned 20, is an exciting raw talent and he is a pretty level-headed guy, he said.         
	Taylor also informed that there were no injury worries for his side though a few were ill. Everyones fit. There are a couple of illnesses but we will find more about it tomorrow (Tuesday), he said.         
	New Zealand coach Mark Greatbatch echoed Taylors view as he said that the youngsters should grab the opportunity to perform. Brendon McCullum and Daniel Vettori have just had their second children and it is an opportunity for them to spend some time with their families. They will come back fresh and strong. It has turned out to be a positive thing for them and for the youngsters as well, he said.

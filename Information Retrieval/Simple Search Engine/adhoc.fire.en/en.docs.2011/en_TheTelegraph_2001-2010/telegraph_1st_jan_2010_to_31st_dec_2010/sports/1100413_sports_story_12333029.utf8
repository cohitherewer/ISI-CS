The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Morale is okay and intact: Dav
                                                                                                                       7                                      Morale is okay and intact: Dav
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Dav Whatmore on Tuesday said that the morale of the side was okay and intact despite being whipped by Royal Challengers Bangalore. The Knight Riders coach said at a press conference that it was just a naughty day in Bangalore.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The morale of the team ahead of Tuesdays match         
	We have spoken individually to a number of boys. We are okay and intact. This is not a problem and this is not the first time any international cricketer may have gone through it. We have identified the issues and addressed them with the individual players.         
	Plans for the bowlers         
	We have not decided on the final XI. Both the teams would be looking to attack and win the game.         
	If the side was struggling with momentum and consistency         
	We still managed to achieve 160 In the previous two games we scored much more (180 and 200)... Looking back, I would say that we have been playing well and had one naughty day in Bangalore.         
	Keeping Shane Bond out in the last match         
	We looked only at the team balance. Bond was not there because we can only have four overseas players in the playing XI.         
	Sourav slamming the team         
	I can understand that people talking when they are emotional.         
	The loss to RCB         
	We as a group do talk within the closed doors and do not reveal outside that room. We are keen to reverse... The Knight Riders have had two wins together and then we take a few steps back and pick it and go again... Whatever introspection we do, we do it in-house. It is not for public consumption.         
	On the players performance in their last match         
	Yes, we could have fought a little bit harder in Bangalore. These things do happen. People drop catches. On that night, it looked as though one teams fielding was fine while the other team was struggling to take the catch. It is never nice to be part of it. What really counts is the angry reaction to it We are very keen to react in the right way and play some really good competitive cricket. This is part of IPL cricket. These are the sort of situations that throw up all the time. We are trying to focus on what we can control. We are trying the best we can.         
	Chennai Super Kings as an opposition         
	Everyone with a yellow shirt is a threat. We respect every opposition. We will play as hard as we can and tomorrow is no exception in our goal to win the match.

            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Chirag United rsquo;s Junior Elijah fights for the ball with Eastern Railway rsquo;s Babun Kar, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture		    
	Calcutta: Chirag United will owe their 4-0 thumping of Eastern Railway to Jerry Zirsanga and Lalkamal Bhowmick.         
	While Zirsanga became the catalyst of the teams first and third goal, Lalkamal was useful in scoring the teams second and orchestrating the final for the Subrata Bhattacharya-coached team.         
	The Durand Cup champions, who almost threatened to dislodge CFL toppers East Bengal from their perch at the top, continued their good show though they are no more in the running for the league title. On Wednesday, they played with passion, showed discretion and scored with fury against a lacklustre Eastern Railway outfit.         
	After Bapan Beras piledriver from 30-yards failed to threaten Chirag custodian Somnath Khara, Bhattacharyas men immediately went into the attacking mode. Substituting Gaurana Biswas with Zirsanga reaped dividends just three minutes later, when the right-half latched on to a Sergey Tokov lob and flicked it back for skipper Arnab Mandal to steer it home on the slide.         
	The goal seemed to have rattled the Eastern Railway defence as Chirag started mounting their attacks like one wave after another. Junior Elijah, however, paid for his overconfidence when he dived to head one in, rather than using his foot to tap it home.         
	However, Lalkamal made up for Elijahs gaffe when he scored through a curling freekick in the 53rd minute. Zirsanga, who probed the Eastern Railway defence with some telling runs, set up Elijah for the third. The right-half sailed in a neat cross for the Nigerian to nod it in.         
	It was Man of the Match Lalkamals arduous run that accounted for the fourth goal. The midfielders cross in added time allowed Denson Devadas to head in the fourth and final goal for his side.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: South Africa captain Graeme Smith was well on course of his recovery from his finger injury and should be back to full fitness in four weeks time, according to a Cricket South Africa (CSA) release on Thursday.         
	That brightens up his chances of participating in the Twenty20 World Cup, which begins on April 30 in the West Indies. Smith had injured his finger while taking a catch in the Indian Premier League.         
	Graeme Smith should be back to full fitness within the space of the next four weeks. This was the finding of CSAs team of medical specialists.         
	This will allow sufficient time for him to take full part in the Proteas preparation in the World Twenty20, said the release.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Somdev Dev Varman lived up to his billing of being the top-seeded player in mens singles tennis at the Commonwealth Games, on Sunday. Carrying hopes of Indias lone gold in the racket event, Somdev delivered a solid performance to rout Australias Greg Jones 6-4,6-2 at the RK Khanna Stadium. I dont even have words now, Im simply ecstatic! said an elated Somdev after the match.         
	I just took one match at a time, didnt even think about the fact that I was top seeded. Me being top-seeded doesnt happen often for me yet, but I sure would like to change it, the 25-year-old said. Somdev and Greg began on par in the first set till the Indian got a break point opportunity at 3-3. From that point, there was no looking back for the Indian. I simply made it because of the crowd. They were fantastic. They supported me throughout, said the world No. 97.         
	In an all-Indian bronze medal play-off, Sania Mirza and Rushmi Chakravarthi defeated Nirupama Sanjeev and Poojashree Venkatesh 6-4, 6-2.

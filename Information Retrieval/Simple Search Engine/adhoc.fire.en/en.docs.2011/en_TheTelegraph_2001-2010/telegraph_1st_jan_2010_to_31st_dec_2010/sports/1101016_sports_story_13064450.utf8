The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imran: Need change in PCB set-up
                                                                                                                       7                                      Imran: Need change in PCB set-up
                      
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan has called for an overhaul of the countrys cricket set-up after the ICC warned the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to improve its governance and enforce anti-corruption measures.         
	For years now our players have been linked to corruption, Imran told the Geo News channel on Thursday after the ICCs warning. When the spot fixing allegations first came out against our players in the News of the World newspaper, the PCB itself should have taken action against the players instead of waiting for the ICC to step in, Imran said.         
	The ICC suspended Pakistan Test skipper Salman Butt and pace bowlers Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif after the newspaper claimed they had been bribed to do spot fixing during the fourth Test against England at Lords in August.         
	The three players have denied any wrongdoing.         
	PCB chairman Ijaz Butt also had to withdraw allegations he made against the England team that they were involved in taking bribes to lose the third ODI at the Oval on September 17.         
	The ICCs move to warn us and put us on notice is a shameful day for every Pakistani. It is a shame for Pakistan cricket and the reason is we dont have any cricket institution in Pakistan, Imran said.         
	Ijaz Butts governance has been a failure. He should have resigned the moment he apologised to the England board and withdrew his statement because they threatened him with legal action, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazil see red over Kaka expulsion
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brazil see red over Kaka expulsion
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: A day after French referee Stephane Lannoy ordered Kaka out of the field for an alleged foul on Ivory Coasts Abdul Kader Keita, the Brazilian camp is yet to reconcile to the fact that the former World Footballer of the Year was dismissed for no fault of his own.         
	The decision against Kaka had Brazil coach Dunga shaking with anger. It was totally unjustified A disgraceful decision. I cant believe it. It was a very complicated game, a very physical I might add, said Dunga. There were many fouls committed and all of us, who love football and desire beautiful football, feel that the beautiful game should be controlled, he added.         
	Dunga said he was sad that the French referee did little to control Ivory Coasts rough football in the second half.         
	We played much better than Ivory Coast and received more yellow cards than our opponents without really having committed any serious fouls. So we are left a little bit in doubt. What do we really have to do not to receive those yellow cards? asked Dunga.         
	But then, what happened to Kaka is nothing unusual in football. In the 1998 World Cup, the home fans watched in horror when Slaven Bilic of Croatia cost Frances Laurent Blanc a place in the final by exaggerating a nudge in the chest into a blow to the face.         
	Kaka himself said he was still at a loss to understand why he was asked to leave the field. I am not impressed with the decision, I am not happy at all with the way the card was given to us, said the Real Madrid star.         
	All I know is that I did no wrong. I am a kind of player, who usually does not get red cards. The last time I was sent off was when I was playing for Sao Paulo. All I can say is that the referee was too harsh on me, commented Kaka.

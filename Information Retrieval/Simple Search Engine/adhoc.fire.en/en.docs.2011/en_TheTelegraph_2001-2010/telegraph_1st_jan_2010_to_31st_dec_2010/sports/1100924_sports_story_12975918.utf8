The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cant promise gold: Saina 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cant promise gold: Saina 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Saina Nehwal on Thursday expressed concerns about a depleted field due to the pull out of several star athletes but Grand Slam champion Mahesh Bhupathi remained upbeat about facing up to some tough challenges in the upcoming Commonwealth Games.         
	I am disappointed with some top athletes pulling out of the Delhi Games. If there is no competition then it wont be good because people want to see good contests, Saina, who was conferred the Khel Ratna last month, said on the sidelines of a promotional event.         
	Bhupathi, however, had a different opinion.         
	I know top singles players (Andy) Murray and (Lleyton) Hewitt are not going to be there but we are expecting a tough challenge, Bhupathi, who will be teaming up with Leander Paes in the mens doubles, said at another function here on Thursday.         
	Saina had criticised the preparedness of the Games before retracting her comments a few days ago. She seemed to be once bitten twice shy and gave a clean chit to the badminton courts at the Siri Fort complex.         
	Talking about Indias chances at the Commonwealth Games, Saina said the hosts are well poised to win a medal in each of the six events in badminton in Delhi.         
	Talking about her own chances, especially in the light of the comments from her predecessor Aparna Popat that the country expected nothing less than a gold from her, Saina promised she would do her best.         
	I cannot promise gold, though I will be aiming for one. I will give it my best shot, thats for sure, she said.         
	Meanwhile, Indias first World Champion wrestler Sushil Kumar implored the media to portray the CWG in a positive light.

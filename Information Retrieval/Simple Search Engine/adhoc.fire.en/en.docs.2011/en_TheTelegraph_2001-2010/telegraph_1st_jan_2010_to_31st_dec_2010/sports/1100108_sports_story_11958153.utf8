The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indian colts raring to go
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indian colts raring to go
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Defending champions India have turned out some impressive performances at the U19 World Cup and all signs point towards another strong showing when the upcoming edition gets underway in New Zealand on January 15.         
	India have been placed in group A with England and first-time participants Afghanistan and Hong Kong and should face little difficulty in securing the top qualifying spot. India play Afghanistan on the opening day.         
	India, who had defeated South Africa in the final of the last edition, in 2008, at Kuala Lumpur, have a rich history at the meet, having won it twice (2000 and 2008) and ending runners-up in 2006.         
	India have sounded the early warning with their marauding form in the build-up to the competition.         
	The Indian colts won the tri-series, in South Africa, and, although the title was decided on the basis of points after the final was abandoned without a ball being bowled, the youngsters kept a hundred per cent record in the tourney.         
	They beat Sri Lanka twice and South Africa once en route to the final and that should give them the confidence to perform in New Zealand. The only question is over the ability of the batsmen to adjust to New Zealands seamer-friendly pitches.         
	But pacer Saurabh Netravalkar should be up to the challenge after taking eight wickets in three matches in South Africa and, in the process, picking up the Man of the Series award.         
	The team is led by all-rounder Ashok Menaria who bats in the middle-order and has the ability to pick up wickets with his right-arm googlies.

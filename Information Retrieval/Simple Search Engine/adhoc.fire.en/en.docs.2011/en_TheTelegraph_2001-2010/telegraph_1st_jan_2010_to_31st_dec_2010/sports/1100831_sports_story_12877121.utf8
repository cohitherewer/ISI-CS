The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali backs Yuvi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Murali backs Yuvi
                      
	Chennai: Middle-order batsman Yuvraj Singh will soon rediscover his touch and play an important role for India in the next years World Cup in the subcontinent, feels Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	Yuvraj is a great batsman. All cricketers go through bad phases. I think, the media has to be careful in criticising him. It has put a lot of pressure on him and its affecting his batting, Murali said on Monday.         
	But he will certainly make an impact in the 2011 ODI World Cup, he added.         
	In the recent tri-nation ODI series in Sri Lanka, Yuvraj had averaged only 18.75, having scored 75 runs in four matches with 38 as his highest score.         
	Murali was speaking on the sidelines of a Chennai Super Kings function, where he was felicitated for becoming the first cricketer to take 800 Test wickets.         
	He made it clear he will continue to play cricket for another three years as he felt fit enough to feature in the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the English county circuit.         
	I think my body is good enough to play cricket for another three years. I would like to play IPL and some county cricket in England. I have received some offers (from the counties) but cant disclose them at this moment, he said.         
	Murali said that he had agreed to former Indian captain Anil Kumbles offer to join him in starting an academy but refused to disclose the details of the venture.         
	Asked whether he would play in next years World Cup Murali said, It is still too early. I want to see how I play in the Champions League Twenty20 and then decide on the World Cup, the 38-year-old added.         
	Murali felt Harbhajan Singh had the best chance of reaching the 800 figure mark but he could not predict whether the Indian off-spinner would achieve the feat or not.

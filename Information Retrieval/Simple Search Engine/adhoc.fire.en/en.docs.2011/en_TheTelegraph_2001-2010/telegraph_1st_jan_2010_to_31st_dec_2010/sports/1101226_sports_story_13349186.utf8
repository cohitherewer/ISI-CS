                                                                                                                       7                                        Bruce chases maiden win over Sir Alex
                  Alex Ferguson                     
	London: Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is an admirer of the job done by Steve Bruce as Sunderland boss, but intends to put a dent in his proteges progress when the teams clash in the Premier League on Sunday.         
	Sunderland have risen to sixth in the standings by winning four and losing only one of their past eight matches, and go to Old Trafford with more confidence than usual at the intimidating venue.         
	Bruce, who featured in three of Fergusons title winning sides, has moulded a young side into potential Europe qualifiers during his 18 months in charge.         
	Manchester United top the table by two points, thanks in no small part to Sunderland having beaten title aspirants Chelsea and Manchester City while holding second-place Arsenal to a draw.         
	Steves changed the club around, Ferguson said.         
	Hes brought different types of player in. Hes brought in (Darren) Bent and (Asamoah) Gyan, hes brought through the boy (Jordan) Henderson whos doing fantastically well, hes brought back (Lee) Cattermole and hes shaped his own team.         
	Despite being a manager for 12 years, Bruce still looks up to Ferguson  even if his sides have never managed to beat United in 16 attempts.         
	I will owe him a debt for the rest of my days, the 49-year-old former defender said. He is the most outstanding manager there has ever been. Whatever era you are in, to manage Manchester United for 24 years and win the trophies he has won is incredible ... I dont think anyone else will ever come anywhere near it.         
	While the game has an aura of master and apprentice, a win by Sunderland will bring the Black Cats within four points of United.         
	All the lads have their feet on the ground  we know what is ahead, Sunderland defender Phil Bardsley said.         
	We have got a tough second half of the season and this Christmas period now will show where teams are going to lie.         
	We will look forward to it and hopefully pick as many points up as possible.         
	Sunderland will be without seven first-team players. Striker Danny Welbeck is ineligible under the terms of the loan agreement between the Black Cats and United, while captain Lee Cattermole is suspended and John Mensah, Titus Bramble, Michael Turner, David Meyler and Fraizer Campbell are all injured.         
	Last season, Bruces team came within seconds of victory at Old Trafford  where Sunderland has not won for 42 years  until Anton Ferdinands own goal gifted United an equaliser.         
	The pressure is on United to capture three points on Sunday with second-place Arsenal taking on Chelsea the following night.           (AGENCIES)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Hockey India (HI) Tuesday sought to put a lid on the controversy over the captaincy of the national team and ruled out any change of guard before the World Cup.         
	Asked whether Rajpal Singh would be replaced by Prabhjot Singh as captain, HI secretary Narender Batra replied in the negative.         
	Rajpal will lead the team in the World Cup since he has been picked by the selectors to do so, Batra said. My advice to the players and the coaches is to not get into these controversies and concentrate on the preparations for the World Cup, the HI official said.         
	Ever since Rajpal was named captain there have been reports that the players and coaches are at loggerheads with the federation since they want Prabhjot to be declared the skipper for the World Cup.         
	While unconfirmed reports said that a section of the players had written to HI asking the parent body to reconsider their decision on the captaincy, Batra said he was yet to receive any such letter.         
	We have received no letter from the team asking us to name Prabhjot captain in place of Rajpal. But I would like to make it clear that the decision of the selectors to continue with Rajpal as captain is final and binding, Batra said.         
	The selectors are all former players and experienced professionals and they have decided to continue with Rajpal in the World Cup. It was (chief coach) Jose Brasa who had earlier named Rajpal captain and there were no adverse reports on his captaincy from the team management.         
	Hinting that HI was not amused by the players and the coaches taking so much interest in the matter, Batra added: The players and coaches should not be indulging in technical decisions. The players job is to play and ensure that India achieves a podium finish in the World Cup and the coachs is to guide them.         
	HI had retained Rajpal as skipper of the national team even though Brasa preferred Prabhjot for the job.         
	Team sources have claimed that Brasa was in favour of making Prabhjot the captain but backed out after the five-member selection committee, comprising Ajitpal Singh, Zafar Iqbal, BP Govinda, Madhu Yadav and Sita Mehta, called for Rajpals appointment.         
	The captaincy issue has always created controversy in Indian hockey. In the 1968 Olympics, the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) appointed two captains to please two warring groups in the team. India failed to make the Olympic final for the first time in history at the qualification playoff in Mexico.         
	Pakistan, Australia, Spain, England and South Africa are the other teams in Indias group.

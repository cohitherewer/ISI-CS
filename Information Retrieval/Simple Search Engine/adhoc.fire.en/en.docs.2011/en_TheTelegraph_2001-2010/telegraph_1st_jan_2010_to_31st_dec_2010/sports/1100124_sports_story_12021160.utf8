                                                                                                                       7                                      India must lift game:   Hadlee
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Former New Zealand cricketer Sir Richard Hadlee said on Saturday that Australia and South Africa would do everything to make India s stay in the No. 1 position in Test cricket as short as possible.         
	Talking to the newspersons on the sidelines of a seminar to promote New Zealand as an investment destination, the legendary all-rounder said the Australians would hate to see some other team holding the No. 1 position for a long time.         
	I am sure the Aussies and the South Africans would do everything to dislodge India , said Hadlee. Cricket would be exciting now. India will have to be extremely careful and really lift their performance to match the challengers.         
	The current India team is definitely a good side and deserves the top spot but India need to develop a good pool of players to keep the good things going.         
	Hadlee said to have a pool of fast bowlers was the most important thing that the Indians need to address at the moment. If there is an injury, you can have replacements who are of international standard.         
	You need to have quality fast bowlers because bowlers will win matches. You got to have all bases covered with a good pace attack. India s got most things covered, he added.         
	The strength of an international side, Hadlee said, depended on the performance of the team outside their own country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 2 Indians make cut 
                                                                                                                       7                                      2 Indians make cut 
                      
	Jeju Island: Shiv Kapur (73) and Gaganjeet Bhullar (75) Saturday made the cut despite returning over-par cards in the second round of the weather-hit Ballantines Championship, which has been reduced to a 54-hole tournament.         
	Both Kapur and Bhullar share the 34th spot with totals of one-under 143.         
	However, three other Indians in fray missed the cut which was set at one-over.         
	Seasoned pro Jyoti Randhawa was among those who missed the cut after carding a two-over 74 to total 146. C Muniyappa was a further stroke adrift after also turning in a 74, while Anirban Lahiri was right at the bottom following a disastrous 85 that left him 18-over overall.

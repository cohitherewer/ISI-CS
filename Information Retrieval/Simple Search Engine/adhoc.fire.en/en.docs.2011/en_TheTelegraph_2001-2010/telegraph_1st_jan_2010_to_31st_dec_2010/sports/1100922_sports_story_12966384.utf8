	Melbourne: An Australian television channel has claimed that its crew got past security personnel and entered the Commonwealth Games village with crude explosives bought in New Delhi a few days ago, raising questions over safety at the event venues.         
	Channel 7 journalist Mike Duffy claimed that he walked into one of the Games venues with a case of explosives, which could have triggered explosions if fitted with a detonator.         
	The video footage put up in a website showed Duffy secretly filming the purchase of the case from the boot of a car in New Delhi.         
	The video also showed how Duffy was even given a demonstration by the vendors.         
	If I need to blow up this car, all I need further is a detonator and explosive, the vendor told Duffy in the video.         
	Duffy claimed that he was easily able to buy the items, including ammonium nitrate and explosives used for mining, in New Delhi, which is scheduled to host the Commonwealth Games from October 3 to 14.         
	We found that without too much trouble one can purchase these explosives and equipment on the streets of New Delhi. At the mining areas, they sell it almost alongside groceries, he said in the news footage in the website.

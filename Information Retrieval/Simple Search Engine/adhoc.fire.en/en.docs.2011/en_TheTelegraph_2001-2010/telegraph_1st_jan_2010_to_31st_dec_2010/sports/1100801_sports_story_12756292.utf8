            A STAFF REPORTER            Action during the Services vs Karnataka match, at Salt Lake Stadium, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Services brought their Santosh Trophy campaign back on track with a 2-1 victory over Karnataka in a quarter final league tie, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Saturday. Services had lost their first match, against Punjab, 1-0.         
	However, Karnatakas second defeat on the trot knocked them out of the 64th edition of the tournament. They now take on Punjab in their last match.         
	After a barren first-half, it was Services who took the lead. Captain Dileep M scored in the 54th minute to make it 1-0. A freekick by Gordon Z from the right edge of the box was met by a smart header from Dileep.         
	Stunned by the goal, Karnataka launched counter attacks and were finally able to restore parity in the 68th minute when J. Karthigeyan found the mark. Karthigeyan capitalised on a cross from the left flank to make use of the opportunity and found the back of net.         
	However, Shaji A DSilva put Services back into the lead when he scored in the 75th minute.         
	Despite the victory, Services were guilty of squandering many chances with striker Shkhohao Tuboi being the culprit on more than one occasion. In the 23rd minute of the match, Tuboi failed to connect after Subba Rao set it up for him inside the box.         
	Services coach Siddhartha Chatterjees decision to replace Tuboi in the 63rd minute, bringing in DSilva, seemed to be a masterstroke as that lifted their game.         
	In the other match of the day, Cavin Lobo scored a brace as Goa outclassed Punjab 3-0, in group A quarter final league encounter.         
	This was Goas second win on the trot, having beaten Karnataka earlier, and that bolstered their chances of making it to the semis.         
	Both the teams started the match on a aggressive note with Goa looking sharp and combined, in comparison to their last match against Karnataka.         
	Goa got missed their first opportunity when Milagres Gonsalvess right footer sailed over the woodwork, while Punjab came close through Balrajs right footer, which was marginally wide off the target.         
	At the stroke of the half time, Goa almost scored the opener, but to their frustration, Peter Carvalhos shot hit the crossbar with both the teams going for the break with the scoreline reading 0-0. However, Goa stepped up the gas in the second half and Cavin Lobo drew first blood for the Goa in the 57th minute. Cavin exchanged a couple of passes with Adil before placing his right footer past Punjab goalkeeper Paramjit Singh.         
	Cavin added his and Goas second in the 90th minute before Branco Cardozo headed in a Nicolas Rodrigues flag-kick in the added time.

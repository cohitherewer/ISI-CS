                                                                                                                       7                                      City, Reds win
                      
	Berne: Juventus were astonishingly held to a 3-3 home draw by Lech Poznan as the Europa League group stage kicked off, on Thursday, while holders Atletico Madrid began the defence of their crown with a 1-0 defeat at Aris Salonika. Liverpool and Manchester City enjoyed a Europa League cruise as the tournament gorged on a feast of 78 goals and three hattricks.         
	Manchester City won 2-0 at Salzburg in a clash of two big-spending clubs, who had been aiming for the Champions League but had to settle for the second-tier competition. None of Italys four representatives won a game between them while three of the four Spanish teams were beaten.         
	Juves Felipe Melo gave away an early penalty as the Italians fell two goals behind with Artjoms Rudnevs grabbing a hattrick for the visitors in their Group A match.         
	City failed to make the Premier League top four last season while Salzburg, bought by the Red Bull soft drinks company in 2005 amid protests by fans, have lost in the Champions League qualifying rounds four times in the last five seasons. Liverpool cruised to a 4-1 win over Steaua Bucharest in a Group K meeting of two former European champions.         
	Joe Cole put the hosts ahead in the first minute only for Cristian Tanase to level 12 minutes later. Liverpool striker David Ngog scored twice in the second half, including a penalty, with Brazilian midfielder Lucas notching the other goal.         
	Aleksandr Kerzhakov hit a first-half hat-trick as 2008 UEFA Cup winners Zenit St Petersburg won 3-1 at Anderlecht in Group G. Patrick Helmes also scored a treble to help Bayer Leverkusen, missing injured captain Michael Ballack, a 4-0 win over Rosenborg in Group B while Stefan Reinartz scored the other. The other two German teams also won.

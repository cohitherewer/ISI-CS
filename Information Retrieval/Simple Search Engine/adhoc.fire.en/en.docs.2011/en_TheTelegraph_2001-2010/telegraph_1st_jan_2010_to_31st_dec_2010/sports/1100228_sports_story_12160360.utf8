	Calcutta: With the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) round the corner, Kolkata Knight Riders coach Dav Whatmore made his intentions clear Saturday, saying this is a very serious season for all of us.         
	Speaking at a promotional of Nokia Para Cricket, the Australian said: We want to put our best foot forward and ensure that we perform well.         
	He also said: Since (Brendon) McCullum wont be available till April, we want some back-up for Saha. We are testing out a few keepers (Deep Dasgupta, Tilak Naidu and Rajat Sabarwal).

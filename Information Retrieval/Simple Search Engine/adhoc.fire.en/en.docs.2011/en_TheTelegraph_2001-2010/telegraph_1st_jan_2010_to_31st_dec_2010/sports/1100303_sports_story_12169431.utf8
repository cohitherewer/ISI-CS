            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Abdul Haseem Khan after scoring one of his two goals on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	New Delhi: Forty-eight hours after the humiliating defeat against India in their World Cup opener, four-time champions Pakistan Tuesday made a sensational comeback in the tournament with a 2-1 victory over mighty Spain.         
	Clearly the underdogs against the Olympic silver medallists, Pakistan, who looked a reformed lot, unleashed wave after wave of attacks in the first half to rattle the Europeans and take the lead through Abdul Haseem Khan. Khan eventually scored both goals for the winners.         
	Spain restored parity in the 64th minute through David Alegre but Pakistan had hit back within a 60 seconds when a deflection off Sohail Abbass brilliantly taken penalty corner was put into the goal by Khan.         
	Cheered on by a goodly crowd which appreciated their every move, the Pakistanis turned on the style at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium and even ran a victory lap after the match.         
	The penalty corner by Sohail that led to the second goal was certainly the days best moment. It was the only penalty corner that Pakistan earned in the match and Sohail had the Spanish defenders puzzled taking advantage of which Khan deflected the ball in.         
	It is a great win and we are back in contention, Abbas said later. There was tremendous pressure on us. We could have played better but couldnt. Hopefully we will win again in the next match.         
	The drag-flicker was very appreciative of the crowd. They supported us throughout the match. It definitely helped us play better, said the veteran of more than 300 international matches.         
	In the days first match, European champions England defeated South Africa 6-4 to register their second consecutive win in Pool B.         
	For England, Richard Mantell (15th minute, 57th), Robert Moore (23rd), Ashley Jackson (43rd), Nick Catlin (50th) and Iain Mackay (51st) were on target, while Marvin Harper (10th, 53rd), Lloyd Norris-Jones (25th) and Thornton Mcdade (67th) got on to the scoresheet for South Africa.

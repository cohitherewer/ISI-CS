	San Jose: Former No. 1 Pete Sampras showed glimpses of his dominating best against a top player 12 years his junior in the second set of his 6-3, 7-6 (2) exhibition loss to Spains Fernando Verdasco on Monday at the SAP Open.         
	It was a pretty rough night, Sampras said. I never really felt I could get into his service games. Playing defence is harder for me today (Monday). Thats something I used to do a pretty good job at. Its harder to move.         
	Sampras received a rousing standing ovation once it was over. He waved and hit three balls into the crowd before telling everybody he felt a little old out there.         
	It was first exhibition match for the 14-time Grand Slam champion since he beat longtime American rival Andre Agassi 3-6, 6-3, 10-8, decided on a match tiebreak at Macau in late October.         
	The 38-year-old Sampras, who retired in 2003 after a 15-year career, acknowledges hes no longer his sure, sharp self  and its tougher to cover the court. His left calf caused him trouble in the first set.         
	He plays about a half-dozen exhibition events a year and is using a bigger racket these days to try to keep up with the hard-hitting youngsters on tour now.         
	Sampras joked around with Verdasco during a tournament VIP kickoff banquet about an hour before they began.           (AGENCIES)

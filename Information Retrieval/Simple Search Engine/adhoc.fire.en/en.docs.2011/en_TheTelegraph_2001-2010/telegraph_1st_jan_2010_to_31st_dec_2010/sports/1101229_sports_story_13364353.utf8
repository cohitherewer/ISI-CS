The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A duel heats up Durban
                                                                                                                       7                                      A duel heats up Durban
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      Graeme Smith and Sreesanth       
	Durban: Not only is the second Test possibly heading for a tight finish, but the inter-team relationship has got really hot.         
	Indeed, there was one very public exchange between South Africas captain, Graeme Smith, and Sreesanth, on the third afternoon, at Kingsmead. Smith went to the extent of pointing his bat at the quick for much more than a few moments.         
	That didnt quite come through as cricket being played in the right spirit.         
	Sreesanth must have said something personal for our captain to have reacted the way he did... Sreesanth has been making personal remarks and they cant be condoned, left-arm spinner Paul Harris pointed out.         
	Reacting, a member of the team management told The Telegraph: Smith was abusing Sree and he gave it back to him... Who is saying that Sree caused the provocation? Not at all.         
	Sreesanth, of course, had the proverbial last laugh: He claimed Smith, who appeared to lose composure, and added Hashim Amlas wicket as well.         
	The days hero, V.V.S. Laxman, scored off the field as well. Look, even their bowlers have come hard at us... When the two top teams are playing, a keen tussle is there... Its bound to happen when the intensity is high, he maintained.         
	Till late on Tuesday, it couldnt be confirmed whether Match Referee Andy Pycroft had informally spoken to the dramatis personae.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England look to strike back
                                                                                                                       7                                      England look to strike back
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Indian womens team will warm-up for the upcoming T20 world championship with a three-match series against ODI world champions England starting here Wednesday.         
	Jhulan Goswami and Co. will be high on confidence after clinching the preceding five-match one-day series 3-2, but the two-wicket thrilling win in the final game would have boosted Charlotte Edwards side too.         
	With the BCCI issuing a gag order on the home team, there was no match-eve press conference. The batting in the one-dayers had depended heavily on Mithali Raj and the hosts would be keen to set it right.         
	The visitors would take heart from the fact that the three games (the second and third slated for Saturday and Monday) are to be played at the MCA ground where the pitch has been more to their liking.         
	The three games are very important for us. The one-day series has been a disappointment, we havent played well. Our batting has been a let down, Edwards said.

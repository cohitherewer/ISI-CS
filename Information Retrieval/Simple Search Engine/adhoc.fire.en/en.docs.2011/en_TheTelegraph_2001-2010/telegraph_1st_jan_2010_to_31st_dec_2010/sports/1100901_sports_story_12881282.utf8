	New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday said that people bringing disgrace to the game make him sad as it leaves a bad impression on cricket, which should always head in the right direction.         
	Yes. It doesnt leave a good impression about cricket and cricketers.         
	It is something, one would like to erase and make sure cricket heads in the right direction so that it helps cricket to grow across the globe, Sachin stated in obvious reference to spot fixing allegations against Pakistan Test captain Salman Butt and pacers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer.         
	In an interview to a news channel on the occasion of Joy Of Giving, Sachin said that his father has always been the most influential figure in his life.         
	My biggest influence has been my father. He has left a huge impact on my life. As a child, I learnt a lot just by observing him.         
	The culture and values of my family have made me what I am, he said.         
	Sachin said the 1999 cricket World Cup, when his father Ramesh Tendulkar died, was the most difficult phase of his life but it was the strength of his family that helped him to ride over that emotional crisis.         
	It was the most difficult moment of my life. I came back from England midway through the World Cup.         
	But my mother, wife, brother and everybody told me that my father would have wanted me to go back and play and so I did, he said.         
	Asked about his retirement plans, the maestro said that he has not thought of it as yet.         
	I have not thought about it. There are no retirement plans, I will tell you when I decide, he said.         
	Sachin said that cricket has always been the centrestage of his life right from the childhood days as he had always dreamt of playing for India.         
	Right from school days, I had the love and passion for the game. Playing for India was the ultimate dream. Whatever happened in my life happened around cricket. Cricket helped me to grow, he said.         
	Asked about how his mentor Ramakant Achrekar, who used to place a coin on his stumps while coaching, Tendulkar said those coins are as good as gold medals for him.         
	Those coins are gold medals for me. (PTI)

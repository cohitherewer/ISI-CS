The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer is game for London test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Federer is game for London test
  - For Novak Djokovic, Davis Cup comes first                             
	London: There is hardly anything Roger Federer has not achieved in tennis over the past decade but the Swiss admits seizing back the world No. 1 ranking from Rafael Nadal may stretch even his mercurial powers. Federer has arrived in London for the ATP World Tour finals a distant second to the phenomenal Spaniard in the rankings and while his desire still burns as strong as ever he is not expecting a return to the top any time soon.         
	Sure, its going to be challenging, Federer told reporters from a hotel lounge overlooking the River Thames and the Houses of Parliament.         
	Its going to be very difficult because Rafa is playing well and I have to defend my points in Australia and he has no points to defend here in London, added Federer, immaculate in a navy blue suit and tie.         
	Federer, 29, who began the year by winning the Australian Open but subsequently lost the top ranking to Nadal just one week short of equalling the 265 weeks Pete Sampras spent as No. 1, has not ruled out the possibility altogether though. Right now the No. 1 ranking is not something I have in my mind, said the 16-time Grand Slam champion.         
	My goal is to play well here in London and then prepare well for next season and then hopefully, at some stage, Ill try get it back. If not Ill focus on winning tournaments because I enjoy doing that too.         
	Federer has won the year-ending showpiece four times and, outside the four Grand Slams, rates it as a priority each year. Right now its about saving energy, getting ready to play the matches, he said. Ive played four of the last five weeks and my game is right where I want it to be. Its the ninth time for me and I know the drill. I feel like Ive got one more tournament left in me. This is a huge tournament for me. It is a goal of the season to make it here. I hope I can save my best until last.         
	Federer is in a group with his French Open conqueror Robin Soderling, Briton Andy Murray and Spaniard David Ferrer, who he plays first on Sunday.         
	Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic is trying his best to keep his mind on the London meet rather than the upcoming Davis Cup. In two weeks, Djokovic will lead his country in their first ever appearance in the Davis Cup final in front of a sell-out home crowd in Belgrade.         
	Honestly my biggest goal is to win the Davis Cup, Djokovic said. I have had opportunities to be part of this event before and hopefully in the future I will be a part of it again, but the Davis Cup final at home, maybe its only one time. Who knows if were going to have this opportunity again? (agencies)

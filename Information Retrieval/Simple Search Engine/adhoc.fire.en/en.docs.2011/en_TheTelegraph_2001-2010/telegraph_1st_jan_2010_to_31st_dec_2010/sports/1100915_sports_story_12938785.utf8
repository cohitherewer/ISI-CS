The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chance to say yes to no balls
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chance to say yes to no balls
                      
	London: Condemned for their alleged involvement in spot-fixing scandal, the tainted Pakistani trio of Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer have been offered a chance to generate public goodwill by an animal rights group by starring in a different kind of promo  sterilising dogs and cats by fixing with no-balls.         
	Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), UK said in an open letter addressed to the trio and left-arm pacer Wahab Riaz, who would be questioned by Scotland Yard in London Wednesday, that they can help in sterilising dogs and cats by doing the ads to remove the balls of the animals.         
	Many of us here at Peta are big cricket fans, so we were saddened to hear the allegations regarding match-fixing. We would like to offer you an opportunity to generate public goodwill towards your team while helping to take the spotlight off this controversy: star in a Peta ad promoting a different kind of fixing  sterilising dogs and cats. No one would call you out about that.         
	No balls may be a bad thing in cricket, but for dogs and cats, no balls are a lifesaver. Because of unchecked breeding and a lack of good homes, millions of dogs and cats all over the world languish in animal shelters or are euthanised every year.         
	Countless other animals struggle to survive on the streets. Fixing dogs and cats by having them spayed or neutered is the key to ending this suffering, the letter said.           (PTI)

	Chennai: Billed as the title favourite, French Open finalist Robin Soderling would have some laborious tasks in hand as a tough field awaits the Swede in the $400,000 ATP Chennai Open tennis tournament commencing here from Monday.         
	Top seed Soderling, who is ranked eighth in the ATP ranking chart, will certainly take heart from his recent victory over world No. Roger Federer when he starts campaign in the event by taking on Robby Ginepri of the United States.         
	The 25-year-old stunned Federer in their 13th meeting, in an exhibition tournament at Abu Dhabi, before losing the final to Rafael Nadal Saturday.         
	Meanwhile, the Indians, including the countrys top singles player Somdev Dev Varman will also have to overcome some stiff competition in what is considered as one of the toughest first round draws in the Opens history.         
	Somdev, ranked 127, plays Rainer Schuettler of Germany, while compatriot Rohan Bopanna have to come out with almost flawless tennis when he locks horn with third seed Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who is currently ranked world No. 21.         
	The Indian wild card, however, was looking to capitalise on the home support before the tough encounter. It will surely be a tough match and I am counting on the home support, Bopanna said.         
	Somdev almost won the title last year before losing to Croatian Marin Cilic in the final.         
	Somdev, 24, along with Bopanna, was instrumental in bringing India back to the Davis Cup World Group last year and the duo will try to re-create the magic here once again.         
	Vijay Amritraj praised Somdev but at the same time reminded that his campaign-opener would not be an easy one. If Scheuttler brings his hundred per cent on court, it will turn out to be a good match, Amritraj said.         
	The bottom draw looks to be much stronger as defending champion and second seed Cilic and fourth-seeded Serb Janko Tipsarevic, are tipped to have a run up to the semi-final.         
	Cilic, who beat world No. 2 Andy Murray in the US Open pre-quarter final last year, is pitted against Russian Igor Kunistyn in the first round, while Tipsarevic plays two-time champion Carlos Moya of Spain  a wild card entrant.         
	In the doubles main draw, starting Monday, Indian interest revolves around the pair of Mahesh Bhupathi and Bopanna and wild card pairs of Somdev-Sanam Singh and Yuki Bhambri-Moya.         
	Third-seeded pair Bhupathi and Bopanna, drawn in the bottom half, cross swords with American pair of James Cerretani and Travis Rettenmaier, while Somdev and Sanam from the top half take on the South African-American pair of Rik de Voest and Scott Lipsky. Bhambri and Moya fight the American-Israeli pair of Robby Ginepri and Dudi Sela.         
	Meanwhile, Prakash Amritraj and Bhambri survived some anxious moments before advancing to the final round of singles qualifying event Sunday. An error-prone Amritraj dropped the first set but recovered in time to get the better of Peter Polansky of Canada 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (9) in a two-and-a-half hour battle, while 17-year-old Bhambri came through a first set tiebreak to oust Ilya Marchenko of Ukraine 7-6 (2), 6-3.

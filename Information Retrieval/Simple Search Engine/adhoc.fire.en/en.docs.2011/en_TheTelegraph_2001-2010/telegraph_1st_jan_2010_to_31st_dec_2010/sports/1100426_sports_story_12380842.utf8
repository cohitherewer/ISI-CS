	Mumbai: It had taken nearly two years for the victory to come, but when it did come it had the familiar sweet fragrance.         
	The Chennai Super Kings made amends for their last-ball defeat in the inaugural IPL final as they beat the Mumbai Indians comprehensively by 22 runs to win the third edition of the T20 league tournament.         
	Sachin Tendulkar braved his webbing injury to play a masterly innings of 48 at the top and Kieron Pollard hit a robust 27 towards the end, but all that proved insufficient as the Mumbai Indians fell 22 runs short of Chennais total of 168 for five.         
	Suresh Raina was the saviour for the Super Kings with an unbeaten 57 that lifted the team from 67 for 3 at one stage. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni pitched in with a 15-ball 22 and stitched a crucial fourth-wicket stand with his vice-captain.         
	The Super Kings made a steady start with Murali Vijay (26) and Matthew Hayden (17) putting on 44 runs for the opening stand.         
	Vijay was majestic when he clouted Zaheer Khan over the mid wicket fence and then managed to clear the square leg boundary pulling Dilhara Fernando. But the Sri Lankan pacer had the last laugh when Vijay edged a similar shot and holed out to Saurabh Tiwary in the deep.         
	Hayden survived a series of leg before appeals. He tried to hit his way out of trouble, driving Harbhajan Singh over the long on fence, but a top edge of Kieron Pollard ended his poor outing.         
	When S. Badrinath, too, failed to negotiate the pace of Fernando (2/23), three wickets had fallen in the space of 23 runs. Then as Dhoni clubbed Pollard for a six and a four in the same over, it was clear that the Super Kings had identified the West Indian as the weakest link in the Mumbai sides armour.         
	So, after the captain, it was the deputys turn to go after the 22-year-old all-round sensation. An inside-out lofted shot over deep extra-cover was followed by a huge swing off a slower one that sailed over the long on ropes.         
	When the two were separated, Dhoni falling to Zaheer off the immediate next ball, they had added 72 runs for the fourth wicket from just 35 balls.         
	But all that could have been different had the Mumbai Indians not reprieved Raina twice, on 13 and 28.         
	On he first occasion, Abhishek Nayar and Fernando failed to call and the ball dropped in between them, the bowler being Zaheer. But Zaheer himself was the culprit the second time when he dropped a sitter off Pollard, that was before Raina added insult to the bowlers injury.         
	Tendulkar showed what mettle champions are made off. The webbing injury might have kept him away from the slip cordon while fielding, but it had little influence on his batting. After all, Tendulkar had come to rely more on touch than brute power.         
	So, he scoop-sweeped Ashwin, who opened the innings with a maiden over, to backward square-leg boundary. He then essayed a Nataraja shot to Albie Morkel and followed it up with a front-foot cover drive.         
	Abhishek Nayar got third time unlucky as survived two run out chances and still lost his wicket, much to the fury of his skipper, by committing a mid-pitch hara-kiri.         
	The move to send Harbhajan early flopped when he was trapped plumb in front by Raina. Then Tendulkars innings came to a tame end when his lofted drive off Jakati found Vijay at long off fence.         
	Raina was in action again when he took a brilliant catch in the deep to get rid of the dangerous Saurabh Tiwary for nought in the same over.         
	Those back to back dismissals helped the Super Kings put the squeeze on the Mumbai Indians.         
	JP Duminy fell while trying to break the shackles, leaving Ambati Rayudu and Kieron Pollard with 55 to score in 18 balls.         
	Pollard got stuck into Bollinger, plundering 22 runs from the 17th over with two fours and as many sixes. Thirty five needed from 12.         
	The West Indian struck a full-blooded boundary over Morkels head in the next over but tragedy struck when a mix-up saw Rayudu being run out.         
	The Super Kings then trapped Pollard with some intelligent field placing, sounding the death knell for Mumbai.

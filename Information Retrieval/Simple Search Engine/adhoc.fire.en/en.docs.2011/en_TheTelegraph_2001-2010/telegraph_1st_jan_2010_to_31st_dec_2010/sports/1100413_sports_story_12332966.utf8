The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shipperds turn to slam Kotla pitch
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shipperds turn to slam Kotla pitch
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: After Anil Kumble and Gautam Gambhir, Delhi DareDevils coach Greg Shipperd said on Monday that the pitch at the Kotla is not the ideal one for Twenty20 cricket.         
	Australian Shipperd did not blame the teams defeat against the Kings XI Punjab on the Kotla wicket, but said it was not best suited for a T20 game.         
	Its difficult to say. We also won three games in a row (against the Kolkata Knight Riders, the Rajasthan Royals and the Royal Challengers Bangalore), Shipperd said, asked if his team had been robbed of the home advantage by the dead track at the Kotla.         
	The wicket has become very tired. It had too much variable bounce yesterday (Sunday). Having said that, we had two run outs (against the Kings XI), which had nothing to do with the wicket.         
	Kumble had earlier said that the Kotla track was not suited for a T20 game after the Royal Challengers loss and DareDevils skipper Gautam Gambhir, too, had criticised the wicket, following his teams dismal performance Monday.         
	Shipperd believed the Kotla was not the only track that demanded attention and said there should be more options on the playing square so as to avoid tracks becoming dead.         
	It (Kotla) is not fantastic for T20. It was nice early on but like other venues, has become worn and tired  we need to have more wickets in the centre block, he said.

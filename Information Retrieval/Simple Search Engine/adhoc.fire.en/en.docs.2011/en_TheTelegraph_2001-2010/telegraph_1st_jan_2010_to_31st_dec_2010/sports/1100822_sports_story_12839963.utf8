The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ready to challenge Viru: Sangakkara 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ready to challenge Viru: Sangakkara 
            A CORRESPONDENT            Kumar Sangakkara plays pool, in Dambulla, on Saturday. (AP)                           
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara at a media conference on Saturday, said that he wants his boys to come out all guns blazing in the must-win tri-series tie vs India, in Dambulla, on Sunday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The must-win situation on Sunday         
	Its a must-win game for us as we are on six points while New Zealand are on seven (with the bonus point). If we beat India we will sail through to the final. If the match gets abandoned, a lot will depend on the India-New Zealand match. There are lots of permutations that we can think of. However, at the end of the day, we have to go out and win. We are in a do-or-die situation. The key is to enjoy the game.         
	If the no ball incident would have an impact on Virender Sehwag and Suraj Randiv         
	It depends on how being charged up affects their performances. If you want to react, its up to you. At the end of the day, you do whats best for the side and you. Thats the bottom line.         
	On the importance of dismissing Sehwag early         
	His wicket is very important. For us, each and every wicket is important. Viru has been adjusting well to the challenges that sides have thrown at him. We will try and throw a few more tough challenges at him and see how he copes with them.         
	Bonus points         
	We dont need to win with the bonus point. If we win, we are in the final. We want to play well and end up on a winning note.         
	Angelo Mathews role in the team         
	Angelo Mathews is crucial in our scheme of things. Even before he was in the national side, he showed a lot of hunger. Whatever the level, he plays and tries to give his best. We know how important he is and he knows how to handle pressure.         
	On Lasith Malingas role in one-dayers         
	Hes very capable of getting the breakthroughs with the old ball as well. Hes probably the most versatile bowler we have. Its easy to work with him.         
	The threat of rain         
	To be honest, if it rains tomorrow (Sunday) and the next day, we will get eight points. India have five points now while New Zealand have seven. If the last group match is played, the team that win will be through to the final. So we still have a chance even if theres rain in the next match.         
	His take on Fridays Nathan McCullum incident         
	When the batsmen are taking a single or a two, the bowler has to be behind the wicket or aside. When I went for the first run, I knew I could get two. On the last couple of steps, for some reason, Nathan came out of the crease and was obstructing my way. There was some contact. When that happened, I turned the other way. He (McCullum) took offence and complained to the umpire. The umpires told the Match Referee that I was at fault. But the Match Referee saw the footage and decided that I was not at fault.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Dinesh Karthik, Virat Kohli/Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Ashish Nehra, Pragyan Ojha.         
	Sri Lanka (from): Kumar Sangakkara, Upul Tharanga, Tillekaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedera, Chamara Silva, Suraj Randiv, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Ajantha Mendis, Dilhara Fernando, Thisara Perera, Rangana Herath         
	Match starts: 2:30 pm (IST)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelsea back at the top
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chelsea back at the top
                      
	London: Chelsea returned to the top of the Premier League when they convincingly beat Birmingham City 3-0 at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.         
	Two goals from Frank Lampard and one from Florent Malouda lifted Chelsea to 51 points from 22 matches as they ended Birminghams unbeaten run of 12 league games.         
	The victory put Chelsea back in first place after seven days in which Arsenal and Manchester United swapped places at the top while the Blues were inactive in the league.         
	Arsenal, who started the night in second place, had a chance to go top provided they matched or bettered Chelseas performance, but they were held goalless at Aston Villa and slipped to third with 49 points from 23 games.         
	It was a miserable night for Arsenal whose 24-year-old Belgian defender Thomas Vermaelen went off in the first half with a suspected broken leg.         
	Manchester United are now second with 50 points from 23 outings.         
	Tottenham Hotspur complete the top four on 41 points following their 2-0 win over Fulham on Tuesday.         
	Birmingham boss Alex McLeish, whose side were unbeaten in 15 matches in all competitions, said his players were distraught after losing for the first time since October 17. Improving Everton beat Sunderland 2-0 at Goodison Park to climb up to ninth.         
	Blackburn moved up to 11th with a 2-1 win over Wigan Athletic. (REUTERS)

	London: Roger Federer has set himself a target of at least 20 Grand Slam titles .         
	The 29-year-old Swiss, who took his tally to 16 with the Australian Open win earlier this year, said: I believe that having won three Grand Slams per season three times, and two per year a couple of times, its something doable for me, he said. I only play 16-20 tournaments per year, so Im not overplaying, and that keeps the fire burning.

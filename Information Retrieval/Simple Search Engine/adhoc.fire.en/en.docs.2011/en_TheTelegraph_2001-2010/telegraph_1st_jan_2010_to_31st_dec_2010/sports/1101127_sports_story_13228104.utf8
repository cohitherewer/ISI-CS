                                                                                                                       7                                                                                                        
	Calcutta: South Africa captain Graeme Smith will recover in time from his hand injury for the home Test series against India, starting on December 16, said Dr Shuaib Manjra, Cricket South Africa medical committee chairman.    
	Graeme consulted a hand surgeon Friday. Following that consultation, we have been given the assurance that Graemes injury is healing within expectation and we are confident that he will make a full recovery and be available for the entire series against India, he said in a statement.        
	Karachi: Mohammed Asif has reached London to hold consultations with his lawyer ahead of the full hearing of the ICC code of conduct commission in January. Sources said that Asif had been summoned to London by his lawyer Elizabeth Robertson.        
	Karachi: Javed Miandad may soon become the batting coach of the national team, sources said Friday. Sources in the PCB said chairman Ijaz Butt has taken a decision in this regard on the direction of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, who is also patron of the Board.        
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has said that it would give a fair chance to wicket-keeper Zulqarnain Haider to explain his position before taking any disciplinary action against him for deserting the team midway through a series against South Africa in UAE earlier this month.        
	Colombo: The fourth days play of the second cricket Test, between Sri Lanka and the West Indies, was called off without a ball being bowled because of rain. West Indies were to resume their first innings at 165 for five on Friday, but persistent rain prevented play from starting. Sri Lanka declared their first innings on 387 for nine.        
	Sydney: The Australian company behind the spectacular fireworks at the Commonwealth Games, in New Delhi, Friday accused organisers of incompetence and unethical behaviour, saying they had not paid their bills. Andrew Howard said his company, Howard and Sons, was still awaiting $300,000 in payments, while some much-needed equipment remained in India because officials were yet to complete the required paperwork for export.          
	Khon Kaen: Indian golfer Himmat Rai turned in a sedate two-under 70 to lie tied eighth after the second round of the Kings Cup golf tournament on Friday. Himmat, who carded 69 on Thursday, took his two-day total to five-under 139. Overnight tied sixth, Anirban Lahiri, however, had a difficult day as the Calcutta golfer brought home a two-over 74 to slip to tied 23rd.

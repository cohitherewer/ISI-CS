	Ax-3Domaines (France): Christophe Riblon took the first Pyrenees stage of the Tour de France on Sunday, leading the field from the first few kilometres to a solo victory high in the mountains. Andy Schleck held on to the leaders yellow jersey in a stage that failed to separate the major contenders.         
	It was the first Tour de France victory for the 29-year-old Frenchman and the biggest of his career to date.         
	Ive been a professional for five and a half years and Ive been waiting for this for that long, Riblon said.         
	He broke away in a small group in the first 30 kilometres of the race, but slipped away from the last of that group on the major climb of the day, the Port de Pailheres. He held his lead over the top and down the long descent before the climb up to the ski resort of Ax-3 Domaines.         
	He finished in 4 hours, 52 minutes, 42 seconds  54 seconds ahead of Denis Menchov of Russia and Samuel Sanchez of Spain. It was the fourth French win of the Tour de France this yearand it delighted the crowd, who in past years have struggled to find home success to celebrate.

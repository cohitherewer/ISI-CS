The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smiles are back, says Kumble
                                                                                                                       7                                      Smiles are back, says Kumble
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble admitted that the smiles were back after their convincing seven wicket victory over the Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday. The former India captain lauded his bowlers for a splendid comeback after the Knights had reached 100 in only 11 overs.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Sourav Ganguly: We played good cricket for the first 10 overs, but for the next 30, were absolutely rubbish In one line, we were rubbish We need to play better cricket If we continue this way, then we dont deserve to be in the semi-finals. Other teams are playing better If we have to get there, first lets play better cricket and win matches Some of these guys need to look at themselves They were just pathetic I dont mind losing, but we were pathetic on the field, lets be honest. I can talk, I can lift them up but they need to lift themselves. I cant go and field for them, I cant go and bowl for them. When I was leading India, I had some serious talent to look after. That probably helped. Hopefully, these guys will look after themselves They have to pick themselves up, theres no option. They are professionals. The entire world is watching, the selectors are watching if they play like this good God help their careers.         
	Anil Kumble: It was a fantastic effort from the bowlers after they got 100 runs from 11 overs. In the earlier matches, we were giving away 180-190 runs and it was splendid bowling especially by someone like Vinay Rahul (Dravid) and Robin (Uthappa) batted amazingly. Robins left-handed (switch hit) sixes were great to watch. It was a great wicket where there was something for the bowlers as well. Its nice to see that the smiles are back in the dressing room. It makes us all feel good before we travel to Nagpur for our next match.         
	R. Vinay Kumar: I stuck to the basics and tried to bowl in the right areas. With world-class bowlers like Dale Steyn, Jacques Kallis and Praveen Kumar bowling at the other end, it is a learning experience. I would like to dedicate this Man of the Match award to my dad as it was his birthday a couple of days back.         
	Rahul Dravid: It was a crucial win for us as both teams were on 10 points. Hopefully, we get a couple more (wins) from the next three matches. It was nice to get some runs. Actually, we have a great batting line-up where all our seven batsmen can bat in the top three. So, we just try to mix and match. Today, I got a chance to bat as Jacques got out. It was also necessary that we scored at a brisk pace so that power hitters like Robin and Cameron White got enough balls to make an impact. The balance and depth of our side can be judged by the fact that some like Kevin Pietersen has to sit out. But thats how it is. You can only play four foreigners and rightly so. This is the Indian Premier League.

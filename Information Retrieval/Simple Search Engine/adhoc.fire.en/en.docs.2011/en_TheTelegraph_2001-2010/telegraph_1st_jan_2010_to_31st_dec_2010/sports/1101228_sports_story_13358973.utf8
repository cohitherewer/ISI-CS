The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fergie: Rooney is playing well
                                                                                                                       7                                        Fergie: Rooney is playing well
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Wayne Rooney                                 
	Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson insists hes unconcerned about Wayne Rooneys goal drought, believing the England striker is close to once again becoming the countrys deadliest striker.         
	Rooney has not scored for Manchester United in open play since netting against Bayern Munich in March, but Ferguson was delighted with the England forwards overall contribution in Sundays 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford. Wayne had a couple of tries. He was very unlucky with the chip and there were a couple of shots saved by the goalkeeper, Ferguson said. He is getting there. The important thing is he is playing well. That is refreshing.         
	Meanwhile, Ferguson hopes to welcome back Darren Fletcher and Nani at Birmingham, on Tuesday, after his team maintained pole position in the Premier League with Sundays three points.         
	Ferguson was without the pair for the win at Old Trafford that was cemented by two goals from Bulgaria forward Dimitar Berbatov, who now has 13 for the season, and a man of the match performance from Brazilian playmaker Anderson. The Scot, who turns 69 on Friday, was able to take off Anderson and evergreen winger Ryan Giggs early in the second half. While Ferguson declared himself happy with an unbeaten league run that now extends to 22 games, the return of Fletcher and Nani can only help United consolidate first place when they travel to St Andrews.         
	You have to make changes, said Ferguson, noting that Birmingham will have benefited from the postponement of their Boxing Day visit to Everton. I took Anderson off, took Ryan off. Weve got a game in two days time. Birmingham have not played, they will be nice and fresh.         
	Darren Fletcher had a bit of a cold, he came down with it this morning, we couldnt take any chances. Nani has been feeling his hip the last few days so we left him out. He should be ready for the Birmingham game. Birmingham will be fresh. Going down there is always a difficult place, theyve always had a strong home record, theyre difficult to beat on their own ground.         
	Ever the perfectionist, Ferguson did confess that his teams failure to convert a host of chances they created against Sunderland was a disappointment.         
	Absolutely, said Ferguson. We hit the bar, the post, the goalkeeper made a couple of saves, we had some really good football, some exciting stuff.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Governing council   a failure: Pataudi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Governing council   a failure: Pataudi
    - Yes, I think he (Modi) should go, says former India captain             OUR BUREAU AGENCIES            Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi                                       
	Even as the mud slinging continues, one of Indias most respected cricketers, former captain and a member of the IPL governing council, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, on Thursday admitted that the council was a complete failure, otherwise the ongoing controversy surrounding the Twenty20 league could have been avoided.         
	He also said that Lalit Modi should step down if he has so much conviction in his innocence.         
	Pataudi, however, felt that if Modi keeps himself away from Mondays governing council meeting, his ouster from the IPL chairman and commissioners post was almost certain.         
	It (the governing council) has been a failure certainly because we should have been more aware of what is happening. We should have been doing the questioning, but we didnt, because everything seemed okay. We were all carried away by how well he (Modi) was doing, Pataudi told a news channel.         
	If Modi doesnt come for the meeting, I suspect the BCCI will take a very strict view of this. But Lalit is also playing very hard, I am not sure what he is up to.         
	Unless Modi comes and says at the meeting that he has been working 20 hours a day for the last six weeks and need 3-4 days time to prepare his answer, his ouster is certain. But if he does that, the Board may give him time, he said.         
	Pataudi, though, credited Modi for the IPLs success but said there were some factions within the governing council who were not happy with the IPL chiefs functioning.         
	I feel the chap (Modi) is telling the truth in the sense that he has been working very hard. He is actually behind all the success of IPL so far. So if he wants 3-4 days, I think he should be given the time, he said.         
	[That, of course, will not happen. As reported by The Telegraph on Thursday, the governing council will meet on Monday. That stands If some member doesnt wish to attend, what can I do? BCCI president Shashank Manohar said.]         
	But there were some people who were against Lalits style of working. I have no objection to it personally, but there was already an anti-Modi movement getting stronger everyday. And I think the governing council was getting aware that everything was not right, Pataudi said.         
	Asked if Modi should step aside in the best interests of IPL, Pataudi said: Yes, I think so. Let these allegations and accusations come to some kind of conclusion and lets see because hes kept on saying ...for the last few weeks that hes done nothing wrong. So fine, if he has done nothing wrong, let them take it out.         
	Pataudi found nothing wrong with Modis relatives having stakes in IPL teams since BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, who heads India Cements, was allowed to successfully bid for the Chennai franchise.         
	Pataudi said what mattered was whether Modi, like Srinivasan, had taken the BCCI into confidence on the matter or not. Lets put it this way, there are certain issues which were settled even before the first IPL, the governing council met. And that was that the board gave permission for a BCCI office-bearer to own a team, he said.         
	If a BCCI office-bearer can own a team, then why cannot Modis relations also? Question is did he ask permission from the BCCI? That I dont know.         
	Pataudi said the IPL governing council was also at fault for not meeting frequently.         
	That (not meeting frequently) was one of the reasons but thats hardly an excuse, he said.         
	Asked whether he personally pushed for frequent meetings of governing council members, Pataudi said: No, I didnt push for more meetings. I felt the job he (Modi) was doing was fair and good...but it is his style of functioning which upset many in BCCI.         
	I saw the IPL being very popular. As long as the product looked good to me, I was happy the way it was going. The dirt which is being attached to it now is very sad and disturbing. These dirt, filth and nonsense has to be taken out and has to be cleaned up properly.         
	In the event of Modis ouster, the former India captain was in favour of a group of people running the IPL and not an individual.         
	Asked whether he was in favour of team owners involvement in running the league as suggested by the Deccan Chargers, he said: I dont want owners involved at all because they are not part of the BCCI.         
	Pataudi also welcomed an independent inquiry committee, like the one involved in Satyam scandal, to look into the entire episode.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer, Djokovic in final
                                                                                                                       7                                      Federer, Djokovic in final
                      
	Basel: Roger Federer made short work of Andy Roddick this time, winning 6-2, 6-4 in the Swiss Indoors semi-finals, on Saturday, in their first rematch since the epic 2009 Wimbledon final.         
	Federer broke Roddicks serve twice in each set and fired 13 aces to the Americans four before completing victory in 69 minutes.         
	Last time at Wimbledon, Federers win was much tougher, going to 16-14 in the fifth set after four hours, 16 minutes. Its unfortunate my bad serving day came today, Roddick said. I was just a little bit out of rhythm. You cant afford to do that against Roger.         
	The top-seeded Swiss improved his career record to 20-2 against Roddick.         
	Only retired greats Boris Becker and Ivan Lendl have more victories against a single opponent in the past 30 years. Becker had a 25-10 hold on Stefan Edberg, and Lendl held a 22-13 edge on Jimmy Connors and 21-15 over John McEnroe.         
	Federer will face Novak Djokovic in Sundays final after the defending champion beat his Serbian Davis Cup teammate Viktor Troicki 7-6 (4), 6-4.         
	The Federer-Roddick reunion played out very differently 16 months on. Then, Roddick held serve 38 times before Federer finally broke through to clinch victory.         
	The second-seeded Djokovic was pushed harder for his victory. He saved three set points in the first trailing 6-5, 40-0 on Troickis serve.         
	I was very lucky to get out of the first set and I regained my confidence, said Djokovic, who forced a tiebreaker after starting a run of winners with a blistering forehand return. I closed my eyes and hit it as hard as I could. Thats what we were joking about, he said.         
	Longtime friends, Djokovic and Troicki walked off court laughing with an arm around each others shoulders. They will likely play singles for Serbia when it hosts the Davis Cup final against France on December 3 to 5.

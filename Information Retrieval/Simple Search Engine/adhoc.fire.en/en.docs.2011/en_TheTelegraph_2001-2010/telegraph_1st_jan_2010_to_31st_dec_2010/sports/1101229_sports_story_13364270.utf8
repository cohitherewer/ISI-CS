  - Morgans on-field assessment is excellent, says AI coach Ansari       A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengal players (from left) Robin Singh, Tolgay Ozebe, Sanju Pradhan and Naoba Singh during a practice session, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday.

	Calcutta: Trevor Morgans reputation precedes him these days. Earlier, teams used to confine their fear to players alone. But after East Bengals transformation under Morgan this season, teams are rarely neglecting the additional Moran factor.         
	Languishing at third spot from the bottom of the I-League table, Air India will resist trying to roll over against the marauding red and gold brigade. And while their coach Yusuf Ansari says he will be happy with a point from Wednesdays game, his counterpart insists winning will be important to keep the rhythm going.         
	East Bengal (15 points) have not dropped a point in five games in the I-league this season and are three points clear of Salgaocar (12 points) at the top of the league table. The Calcutta outfit have defeated all big teams, including Dempo and Salgaocar.         
	They (East Bengal) are a tough side. They have one of the best coaches and let us not forget they are Indias No.1 team at the moment. They have won each of their five matches on merit. Well be happy with one point tomorrow, Ansari told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	The Airmen have lost twice to East Bengal this season and Ansari credited Morgan for the teams resurgence. The team has a very good combination. They have a good balance in the squad as well. Almost the same players are playing in every tournament. Barring one or two, who are injured, the rest of the players have been consistent.         
	Morgan is technically very sound and his on-field assessment is excellent. Lets hope they have an off day tomorrow and we can cash in on it, Ansari said.         
	The visitors will have three foreigners on the turf for the first time in the tournament on Wednesday. They had Yusif Ibrahim in the midfield. Eric, who has come on loan from Aryan Club, will play as stopper back and Okorogar will form the Air India strike force with Samson Singh.         
	Gurwinder Singh, who was unavailable in East Bengals last game due to a double booking, will replace Sunil Kumar in defence and Morgan will hope the rest fall into place. Penn Orjis role as an attacking midfielder will be important, as the Airmen will look to crowd the defence.         
	Its obvious Air India will try to be ultra defensive. But we have to be patient and create opportunities. I am not revealing the plan though, Morgan said.         
	Tolgay Ozebes hunger for goals, Robin Singhs anticipation in the area and Sanju Pradhans leading assists are some of the plus points for the home team. How Ansari manages to eliminate these threats will decide the visitors chances on Wednesday.  
	Wednesday rsquo;s matches   
	 East Bengal vs Air India, 
  Salgaocar vs Pune FC, JCT vs Viva Kerala

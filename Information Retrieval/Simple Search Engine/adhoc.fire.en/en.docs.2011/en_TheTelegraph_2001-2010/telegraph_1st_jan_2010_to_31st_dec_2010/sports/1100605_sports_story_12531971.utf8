The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger struggles to get going
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tiger struggles to get going
                  Tiger Woods                     
	Dublin (US): Britains Justin Rose took advantage of ideal conditions and put on a putting clinic for a joint share of the lead with Rickie Fowler and Geoff Ogilvy at the Memorial tournament on Thursday.         
	Rose, who is still seeking his first victory on the PGA Tour, bogeyed his opening hole and made his move late with five birdies in a sizzling six-hole stretch for a seven-under-par 65 at Muirfield Village.         
	Tiger Woods, now grappling with a neck problem after the crisis in his married life, however, was unable to take advantage of the conditions as the world No.1 shot an even-par 72 that did not include a single birdie at any of the four par-fives that he usually feasts on.         
	Indian pro Jeev Milkha Singh, too, did not find the going good and was in danger of missing his second successive cut after turning in a disappointing two-over 74 to in the opening round.         
	Lying tied 87th, Jeev, who missed the cut at last weeks Crowne Plaza International in Texas, could suffer a similar fate here if he fails to raise his game at the Muirfield Village Golf Club.         
	Its a bit of a pun, but I putted scary good with my new Ghost putter, Rose, who has won five times internationally, told reporters. I just kept plugging away and then a few putts started dropping and you find your rhythm.         
	US Masters champion Phil Mickelson was two shots behind the leaders after firing a bogey-free round of 67 that included birdies on three of the par-fives.

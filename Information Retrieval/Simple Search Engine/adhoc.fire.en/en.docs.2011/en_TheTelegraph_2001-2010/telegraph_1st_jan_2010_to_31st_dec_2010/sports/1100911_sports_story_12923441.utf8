            STAR RACER                            
	Calcutta: On an afternoon ruled by less fancied winners, trainer John Stephens long-shot Oyster Cove (apprentice Mohit Singh-up) scored an easy victory over the public-choice Glamorous Spirit in the 1,200m Shahi Bag Handicap, Fridays main event. Alford, who partnered the favourite, was expected to get closer to the 1000-win mark. But he drew a blank to stay put on 997.

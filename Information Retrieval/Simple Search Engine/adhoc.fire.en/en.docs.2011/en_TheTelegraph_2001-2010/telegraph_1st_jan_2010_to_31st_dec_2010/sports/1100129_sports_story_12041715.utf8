            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Wriddhiman Sahas inclusion in the India squad for the Test series against South Africa might have come as a surprise to many, but they were unanimous in saying that the talented wicket-keeper, who is considered one of most technically sound in the country, will only gain from the exposure, irrespective of whether he plays or not.               
	Following is what the cricket fraternity had to say (alphabetically):                 
	Sambaran Banerjee (Chief selector, Bengal): Its definitely a proud moment for Bengal cricket and the experience will help him a lot. Sharing the dressing room with great players will enable him to learn about the rigours of international cricket. Getting picked for a Test squad in itself is an achievement So he shouldnt worry whether he plays or not. I wish him all the luck and hope that he improves himself as a cricketer.                 
	Deep Dasgupta (Former India wicket-keeper): Its a great news for him as well as Bengal. Whether he plays or not is not important because with his talent, he will certainly get a chance in the future. With injury being a major worry these days, he might well get a chance in this series. He is one of the most technically sound keepers in India and he deserves a place more than anyone else. He should just enjoy the experience.                 
	Russi Jeejeebhoy (Manager, Bengal team): It must be a great moment for him  a dream come true. He, of course, deserved this break. Its also good for the cricket in the state and will encourage others. Behind the stumps, theres isnt any doubt that he is technically quite well equipped. But he didnt have a great time with the bat of late and I hope that this exposure helps him recover his form.

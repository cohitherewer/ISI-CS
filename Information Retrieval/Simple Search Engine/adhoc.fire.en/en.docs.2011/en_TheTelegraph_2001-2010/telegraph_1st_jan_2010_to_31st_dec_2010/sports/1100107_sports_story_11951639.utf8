The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karnataka in final
                                                                                                                       7                                        Karnataka in final
          
	Bangalore: Karnataka stormed into the Ranji Trophy final by virtue of their 367-run first innings lead after their semi-final match against Uttar Pradesh that ended in a draw at the Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Wednesday.         
	Karnataka, who had last won the Ranji in 1998-99 season, will meet 38-time champions Mumbai in the summit clash in Mysore, slated for January 11-15.         
	Resuming at their overnight 43 for three, Karnataka declared their second innings moments before tea at 247 for eight.         
	CM Gautam celebrated his call to the South Zone squad for the Duleep Trophy with an enterprising 100 not out on a withering fourth day track. It was Gautams third Ranji century in eight matches.         
	RP Singh bagged four wickets while Piyush Chawla finished with three for 72 for visitors Uttar Pradesh.         
	Uttar Pradesh lost the wicket of Tanmay Srivatsava in their inconsequential second innings before the umpires called off the game an hour before draw of stumps.         
	Uttar Pradesh had made 22 for one in 12 overs.         
	Karnataka face a daunting opponent in Mumbai in the final.         
	In 19 matches between the two sides, Mumbai have trounced Karnataka outright in nine matches while conceding the first lead in four games.         
	Despite the ominous record, Rahul Dravid deemed that Karnataka should go out and enjoy the game.         
	We have a very young team. We got to go out and enjoy ourselves irrespective of who our opponents are, said Dravid.         
	Dravid commended the team for their outstanding performance throughout the season.         
	The boys have performed exceptionally well this season.         
	The young batsmen have scored consistently and the fast bowlers have produced the wickets to put Karnataka in the final.         
	Overall, it has been a great team performance, said Dravid.

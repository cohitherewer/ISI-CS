	Durban: South Africa named inexperienced all-rounder Ryan McLaren in a 15-man squad on Friday for the first Test against India later this month.         
	The 27-year-old has played in one Test, against England in January, and in 10 one-day internationals.         
	It is nice to bring Ryan back and we thought it was important to keep the rest of the guys together, Cricket South Africas convenor of selectors Andrew Hudson told reporters.         
	The selectors kept faith with the squad that shared two draws in the recent series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.         
	The only fitness concerns ahead of the December 16 Test against India in Centurion were Graeme Smith (fractured hand) and batsman Hashim Amla (injured forearm).         
	the Squad         
	Graeme Smith (capt.), Hashim Amla, Johan Botha, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Paul Harris, Jacques Kallis, Ryan McLaren, Morne Morkel, Wayne Parnell, Alviro Petersen, Ashwell Prince, Dale Steyn, Lonwabo Tsotsobe.

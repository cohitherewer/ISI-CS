	Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)s embattled chairman Ijaz Butt has come in for more criticism after details of his extravagant spending on foreign tours, since taking over, were submitted to the National Assemblys Standing Committee (NASC) on sports.         
	According to details, Ijaz Butt from October 19, 2008 to September 2010 has spent approximately Rs.15million from the PCB coffers, on his foreign visits, under the heads of daily allowances, air travel and hotel costs.         
	The details submitted to the committee show that Butt, who works in an honourary capacity in the board, has made 30 foreign visits. The documents show that Butt, in his two-year tenure in the board, has spent some 233 days abroad. The documents show that he claims a daily allowance of 300 while in England and $300 while travelling to other countries.         
	The longest stay abroad for Butt came in the West Indies, where he remained for 23 days and drew daily allowances worth Rs.7.9 million from the PCB coffers. The documents show that he has mostly travelled abroad in first class and the board has spent nearly Rs.4.7 million on his travel.

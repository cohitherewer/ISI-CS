    - New Zealands defeat helps India reclaim No. 2 spot in ODI rankings                 Upul Tharanga in Dambulla, on Friday. (Reuters)                           
	Dambulla: New Zealands loss turned out to be Indias gain as Mahendra Singh Dhonis men reclaimed the second spot in the International Cricket Council (ICC) ODI rankings, on Friday, after the Black Caps suffered a three-wicket defeat against Sri Lanka in the second match of the tri-series.         
	India had surrendered the second position to New Zealand after the humiliating 200-run loss in the series opener.         
	However, Sri Lanka, chasing a 193-run target, huffed and puffed to a narrow victory at the Rangiri Dambulla stadium.         
	Opener Upul Tharanga (70 off 109) was the top-scorer for the hosts as they scored 195 for seven in 40.5 overs.         
	New Zealand, electing to bat, were all out for 192 in 48.1 overs after Sri Lankas pace duo of Lasith Malinga (3/35) and Angelo Mathews (3/36) stifled the visitors.         
	The New Zealand total was built around some good effort by debutant B.J. Watling (55) and Nathan McCullum (36).         
	New Zealand, who had 117 rating points before this match, lost three points to slip to fourth spot behind South Africa (115).         
	India gained a position to second with 116 points behind leaders Australia (132).         
	Like the Black Caps, Sri Lanka, too, made a poor start, losing opener Tillekaratne Dilshan (5) in the third over.         
	Tharanga put on a 85-run stand for the second wicket with skipper Kumar Sangakkara (48) to steady the innings and then, along with Thilan Samaraweera (36 off 38), steered the hosts close to victory.         
	But once Tharanga departed in the 37th over, wickets started tumbling and Sri Lanka were reduced from a comfortable 162 for four to 180 for seven.         
	However, seasoned campaigner Samaraweera kept his cool and ensured full points with 9.1 overs to spare.         
	Tharangas patient knock had nine boundaries and Samaraweera helped himself with four boundaries, with the last one bringing the winning runs, off Kyle Mills.         
	Earlier, after a high in the opening match, New Zealand hit a low with half of their side returning back to the pavilion inside 23.1 overs. The Black Caps were off to a bad start, losing opener Martin Guptill in the second ball of the first over.         
	Mathews then struck twice in the 11th over, trapping captain Ross Taylor (16) in front of wicket off the first ball and then removing Kane Williamson (0) in the third ball, caught at first slip by Samaraweera.         
	Rangana Herath then dismissed removed Scott Styris (24) caught at first slip by Mahela Jayawardene, while in the next over Watling was also sent packing by Mathews as New Zealand slipped to 101 for five in 23.1 over.         
	Malinga then dealt two more blows, getting rid of Gareth Hopkins (11) and Daryl Tuffey (0) in consecutive deliveries.         
	However, McCullum gave some respectability to the New Zealand innings before perishing in the 45th over.         
	At the post-match presentation ceremony, Sangakkara said: Our bowlers started really well and our spinners also came into the game mid-way through. We wanted the bonus point. But that was not to be. I am pretty happy with the win.         
	Man of the Match Tharanga said: After the 35th over, we thought we will go for the bonus point, but we couldnt get it.         
	New Zealand captain Taylor admitted: We were outplayed in all facets. When you are facing Malinga for the first time, it cant be easy.           (AGENCIES)

	Calcutta: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni lost his No. 1 spot but opening batsman Virender Sehwag gained eight places to return to the top-10 at eighth in the ICC ODI rankings, released on Sunday. India held on to the second spot in the team rankings despite losing the tri-series final to Sri Lanka, on Saturday.         
	Sri Lanka, sixth before the series, are just behind India, and in front of South Africa, who drop to fourth, when the ratings are calculated beyond the decimal point.         
	In individual rankings, Tillekaratne Dilshan broke into the top five of the batting chart. He sits in fourth position, level with Hashim Amla.

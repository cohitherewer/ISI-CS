The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal still in awe of Tiger
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nadal still in awe of Tiger
                      
	Madrid: Rafael Nadal still admires scandal-hit golfer Tiger Woods and believes the media were wrong in publishing details of the American world No. 1s private life.         
	The first thing I think (about the Woods issue) is that society is in a bad way, the Spanish world No. 4 said in an interview with a Spanish sports daily.         
	Starting with the sports media, we have to judge Tiger as an athlete. His private life is his business and nobody elses. I still admire him because he is an exemplary athlete.         
	After going into self-imposed exile following revelations about his extra-marital affairs, Woods will return at next months US Masters, the opening major of the year and an event he has won four times.         
	Its funny because a lot of the people who criticised him now want him to come back because sport in general needs him, Nadal said.         
	The Mallorca-born Nadal returned from a six week injury layoff to reach the Indian Wells semi-finals last week but said he was unsure if he was back to his best level following his knee problems.         
	I dont know, I need to keep improving, the six-time Grand Slam winner said.

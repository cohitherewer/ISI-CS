The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Goosen in lead; Woods tumbles

            Larry Dorman            V.V.S. Laxman celebrates his century, on Saturday                           
	Akron: The WGC-Bridgestone Invitational turned into the Revolving Door Open on Friday at Firestone Country Club. Golf balls bounced off spectators and trees and spun off the soft greens. Names hopped around the leader board like drops of water on a hot skillet, but by the end of the day, the board shook out with three major championship winners poised for the weekend.         
	Enter Retief Goosen, a soft-spoken South African who found the putting stroke that won him two United States Opens and who shot a four-under-par 66 to take the lead with a seven-under 133. Goosen, who took only 25 putts in a first-round 67, needed just 26 in the second.         
	Enter Phil Mickelson, who one-putted the final five greens for a 68 that put him in a tie for second place at six-under-par. He is on track in a tournament that could lead him to the top spot in the world for the first time in his career.         
	Exit Lee Westwood, who withdrew from the Bridgestone and next weeks PGA Championship at Whistling Straits in Kohler, after aggravating a calf injury that has been nagging him since two weeks before the British Open. Westwood, whose rounds of 71 and 76 would have placed him 76th in the 81-player field, left Firestone in the afternoon to catch a flight to London to have his leg examined. He is likely to miss a minimum of a month.         
	Enter Justin Leonard, who has yet to finish in the top 10 this season but whose 66 was a product of some hard work he has done the past two months with the instructor Randy Smith to eliminate a shut club face at the top of his backswing. Leonard, whose missed putt at the 72nd hole kept him from winning the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits in 2004, is tied for second with Mickelson.         
	Still going in circles was Westwoods playing partner for the first two days, Tiger Woods, who has been searching unsuccessfully for his swing, rhythm, tempo, putting stroke and mojo. Woods hit only three fairways, making him of 8 of 28 for the first two rounds, and shot a 72 for a total of six-over-par 146.         
	With narrow, tree-lined fairways that place a premium on accurate driving  usually  Firestone and Goosen should be on friendlier terms, but he has had only two top-10 finishes in nine appearances here, with his best a solo fourth in 2008.         
	Although Goosens presence in the lead is a reminder of the days when he drove the ball as straight as anyone on tour and won the 2001 and 2004 United States Opens, his prowess with the putter has put him in a position to challenge for his first title this year. I think the difference here is Im putting pretty well, he said.         
	That would go for Mickelson as well. He had a double bogey at the 14th hole that could easily have derailed his round had he not been rolling in putts with perfect speed to play the final five holes in two-under par.         
	Woods, mired in a tie for 72nd at a course where he has won seven times in 11 previous starts and has never finished out of the top five, would trade places with Mickelson.         
	In fact, he might do just that. He did not stop to talk after his round, hardly a surprise given his overall scratchy play, which included five bogeys, including one at the final hole.

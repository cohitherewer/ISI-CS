The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB set to sack selector 
                                                                                                                       7                                      PCB set to sack selector 
                      
	Karachi: There is never a dull moment in Pakistan cricket and the board has now decided to fire selector Salim Jaffer for allegedly conspiring against chief selector Mohsin Khan.         
	According to reports, the selection affairs came up for discussion at Wednesdays governing council meeting in Lahore where PCB chairman Ijaz Butt found fault with Jaffer.         
	Butt told the members at the council meeting that it had been decided to remove Salim Jaffer from the national selection committee as he had tried to conspire against Mohsin Khan after the squad was announced for the England tour, one source said.         
	Mohsin had flown down to Sri Lanka last month where he held a meeting with the national captain, coach and manager and announced the squads for the Twenty20 and Tests that Pakistan will play in England against Australia and England.         
	The squad had some surprising exclusions including former captain Younis Khan, senior batsman Faisal Iqbal, opener Khurrum Manzoor, wicketkeeper Sarfaraz Ahmed and fast bowler Mohammed Sami.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clean sweep by England
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clean sweep by England
                      
	London: England profited from an abject batting display by Pakistan, on Tuesday, to win the second and final Twenty20 International, in Cardiff, by six wickets.         
	After Pakistan had collapsed to 89 all out from 18.4 overs, England romped to 90 for four with six overs to spare to win the series 2-0.         
	Pakistan could not cope with either a barrage of short-pitched bowling from the England pacemen or the slow bowling of Graeme Swann and Michael Yardy.         
	Paul Collingwood scored 21 from 25 deliveries and Eion Morgan made 18 not out from 14 balls.           (AGENCIES)

    - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 
  -  Jamie Siddons on his priorities             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Jamie Siddons                                       
	Chittagong: Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons, who turned out for Australia in an ODI 22 years ago, spoke to The Telegraph on the eve of the ongoing Test here.         
	The next few months, by the way, are going to be busy for the 45-year-old both professionally and personally  Siddons and his partner Kim, who have an infant daughter (Stella), intend getting married in April.         
	Yeah, a few things are lined up, Siddons said, laughing.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Whats it like coaching a team which, at the Test level, at least, is always seen as the underdog?         
	A Its difficult... At the same time, Im in a situation where, each day that I come to work, I expect to see some improvement... I work towards a goal, instead of (only) worrying where the team is placed and so on. Working towards a goal, that of getting better, is rewarding.         
	You were John Buchanans deputy for a couple of years. What did you learn during your time with Australia?         
	One is always learning, whatever be the profession... One learns from how the best go about their business... Obviously, because of the difference in the skill levels of players, that was a different experience.         
	Your impressions of Buchanan?         
	John was a really good motivator of his team and a very good manager of his staff... He set goals for the team... (After a pause) Im working with totally different types of players... Its a totally different mindset, a different environment... For me, motivating the players alone wont do, Ive got to help develop their skills, too.         
	The roles of coaches differ from team to team...         
	They do, most definitely. Im happy trying to improve the players skills at nets.         
	How would you describe your approach?         
	(Grins) Theres no magic involved... Im here to improve the players skills... It has to be at a high level, otherwise, they just wont be able to compete... Wont be able, for example, to beat India... My job is to enhance the ability of each player... To make him better... The operative word is improvement.         
	Having put in two years, are you satisfied that Bangladesh is on the correct path?         
	Yeah... The skills are there, now its more about development... Dont forget Bangladesh lost many players to the ICL and rebuilding was involved...         
	Do coaches have a shelf life?         
	Depends... After a couple of years, with more experience, I may want to move to a different team... At that point in time, maybe coaching India or Australia would suit me better.         
	Is there a coach who has it all and is there one who has influenced you?         
	I enjoyed working with John... He would motivate... Ive read a lot of books concerning coaches of other disciplines.         
	Youre known to speak your mind. After Bangladesh lost to Ireland in the World T20, last summer, you gave enough indications that youd be reading the Riot Act...         
	I was more disappointed for them... They just didnt back themselves against a team like Ireland... Since then, the boys have worked very hard... I think theyve realised that their places arent secure unless they perform. Theyve also realised Ill be supporting them as long as they work hard.         
	But wasnt a lot made of Bangladesh defeating a grossly under-strength West Indies in the West Indies, last July?         
	I wouldnt say a lot was made of the first overseas Test and series win... It was a huge moment and you cant take that away from the team... Its always good to win, but people do realise that it wasnt the West Indies first XI.         
	Whats the challenge for you, particularly in this series?         
	Proving to people that, as a unit, were getting better... Id love our batters to put up big scores... Id love our fast bowlers, whore at the same speed as the Indian quicks, to make an impact... They need to bowl in the right areas, something they havent always done.         
	Were you offended by Virender Sehwags Bangladesh is an ordinary side comment?         
	(Grins) He couldve put it a little better... Having said that, we havent done anything to suggest were a great team... Were developing... Were a young side... Were not a team of Sehwags. If we were, opinions would be different. Development takes time.         
	Shakib-al Hasan got the captaincy by default, after Mashrafe Mortazas fitness problems. How has he been doing?         
	Shakibs a confident young player... Hes not afraid to try a few things... Hes fairly aggressive and seems to be going along really well... When doing well, particularly, hes a confident and competent captain.         
	The Test before the ongoing one was six months ago, in the West Indies. Arent such long breaks frustrating?         
	Its tough, because weve got to keep starting all over again... Because we play so little, becomes a new thing for us. Whats good is that well be playing five after this series in fairly quick time... One in New Zealand, two at home against England and, then, two in England... The same set of players is there in all forms, which isnt the case with, say, India.         
	Ideally, youd like a different lot for limited overs cricket, is it?         
	When we have the depth.         
	Do you agree with predecessor Dav Whatmores point that the Bangladesh team shouldnt judge itself by rankings, but by the realisation of individual targets?         
	Absolutely... Individual improvement is critical... Surely, we cant jump from No.9 to the top three or something... Even to move to No.8 would take time... Weve got to be realistic and look to first bridging the gap... The gap is wide and, in any case, we dont play that much.         
	Bangladesh is a co-host of the 2011 World Cup. Would playing at home be an advantage or, because of the pressure, a disadvantage?         
	Id like to turn it into a real advantage...         
	How do you handle the pressure which comes on your shoulders?         
	Actually, havent really felt the pressure, as I dont judge this team on wins and losses... People in Bangladesh may want success straightaway, but the development of this cricket team is a long-term thing... I do feel pressure of sorts when I find that a particular player isnt improving.         
	The final one... Is there something youve learnt during your time with Bangladesh?         
	(Grins) Not to get too caught up in the politics of whats happening at the Board-level... Ive got to focus on my brief, not to look at changing the world in a hurry... A lot of things could be done better, but that takes time and calls for money. Its not fair to compare things here with Australia.

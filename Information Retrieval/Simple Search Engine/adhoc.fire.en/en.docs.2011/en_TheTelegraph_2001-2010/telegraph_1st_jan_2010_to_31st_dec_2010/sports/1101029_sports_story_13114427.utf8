The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For Kevin, Buchanan is nobody
                                                                                                                       7                                      For Kevin, Buchanan is nobody
                                Kevin Pietersen      
	London: England batsman Kevin Pietersen has hit back at John Buchanan for criticising him and described the former Australian coach as a nobody.         
	Buchanan, who won three out of four Ashes series during his six-year tenure with the Australian team, had earlier said that Pietersen had the potential to be a major problem during the Ashes if he did not halt the alarming slump in form which has seen him go 27 Test innings without a century.         
	Reacting to the 57-year-olds comments, the English middle-order batsman said: I didnt react to it (Buchanans comments) because it was strange that he made headlines.         
	Im not interested in what he has to say. Who is he? Hes a nobody.         
	He had the best team to coach in the history of cricket. Anyone could have coached that team.         
	He has done nothing else solid, so I wont even take it with a pinch of salt, he said.         
	After his successful coaching stint with the Australian national team, Buchanan joined the Indian Premier League franchise the Kolkata Knight Riders as coach, but was not very successful.         
	He got sacked after the team fared badly in the first two seasons of the T20 tournament under him.         
	He drew criticism from every quarter for inducing more controversies in the team than confidence.         
	Besides, he also got involved in a blow-up with the skipper of the first season, Sourav Ganguly, who was unceremoniously dropped from leading the side in the second season on the behest of Buchanan.

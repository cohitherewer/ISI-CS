The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal hurt before tie
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bengal hurt before tie
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Bengal camp, on the eve of their crucial Ranji Trophy tie against Gujarat, resembles a hospital ward, literally.         
	Ashok Dinda and Rohan Banerjee didnt travel with the team to Ahmedabad, courtesy fever and injury respectively. The casualty list grew on Tuesday as Abhishek Jhunjhunwala (stomach pain) and young pacer Shami Ahmed (viral fever) were hospitalised.         
	Another youngster, Writam Porel, too, has viral fever and is unlikely to play Wednesday. Bengal wouldnt be getting the services of Wrddhiman Saha either as the wicket-keeper has been called up for national duty.

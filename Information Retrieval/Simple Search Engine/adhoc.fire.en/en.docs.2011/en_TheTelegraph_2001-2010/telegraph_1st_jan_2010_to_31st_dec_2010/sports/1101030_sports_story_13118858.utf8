                                                                                                                       7                                        United bank on new hero Hernandez
                  Javier Hernandez                     
	London: It is only a week since Manchester United were in uproar over the future of striker Wayne Rooney yet the name on the lips of every fan has quickly changed to that of his livewire stand-in Javier Hernandez.         
	The Mexican scored twice in last Sundays 2-1 win at Stoke City, notched the winner in Tuesdays League Cup win over Wolverhampton Wanderers and with Rooney and now Michael Owen out injured, is expected to start alongside Dimitar Berbatov in Saturdays Premier League game against Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford.         
	We tend to build up heroes very quickly here but the boy is justifying the praise he is getting at the moment, Ferguson said after the 22-year-olds late winner against Wolves.         
	Some observers have compared Hernandez to a young Owen but his teammate, who has struggled to rediscover his best form after lengthy injury lay-offs, warned that the future would not always be such smooth going.         
	Hes young, sharp and a good finisher, said Owen. He seems to be thriving, hes always got a smile on his face, he enjoys his football and the fans have taken to him already.         
	Uniteds fans will certainly expect the good times to keep rolling for one more week at least against a team they have dominated for two decades. Spurs have not beaten United for nine years and their last win at Old Trafford pre-dated the Premier League, coming in December 1989, when Hernandez was 18 months old.         
	United, along with Arsenal and Manchester City, are on 17 points, five behind Chelsea, who visit Blackburn Rovers on Saturday.         
	Meanwhile, Wayne Rooney could miss the Manchester derby on Nov 10 after Sir Alex Ferguson revealed that the United striker could be out for longer than the three weeks first thought with an ankle injury.         
	When asked at a press conference today if three weeks was still the prognosis, Ferguson said: I think it may be longer.

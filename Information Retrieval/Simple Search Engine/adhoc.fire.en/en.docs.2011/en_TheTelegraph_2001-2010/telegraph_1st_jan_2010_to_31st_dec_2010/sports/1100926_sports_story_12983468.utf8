	Calcutta: While Cricket Australia (CA) is pushing for an independent review of corruption in the sport, which will have nothing to do with the International Cricket Council (ICC), the body isnt going to recommend who should be at the helm of such an exercise.         
	Its interesting that instead of issuing a statement, CA got its views put across by chief executive James Sutherland, during an interview he gave the other day.         
	The ICC hasnt reacted, but its nothing short of a royal snub from one of the Founding Members.         
	Corruption in cricket has become the talk of the season, thanks to the spot-fixing scandal in the UK, involving at least three players from Pakistan  Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer.         
	We dont have anybody in mind and dont intend recommending the name of any one person... Its not our intention and, so, we havent thought about it... Obviously, the person must have credibility, CA spokesman Peter Young told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday, Young added: In principle, wed like a review which has nothing to do with anything currently being done by the ICC...         
	Such an exercise would lift the peoples confidence. This, after all, is an opportunity for things to be brought out into the open.         
	According to Young, the idea of an independent review was raised during the recent ICC chief executives meeting, in Cape Town.         
	That didnt figure in the media release put out by the ICC, though.         
	When a specific response was sought from the ICC, a spokesman said hed get back after running a check.         
	A review on the lines of what CA wants would, of course, be seen as a huge vote of no-confidence in the ICCs handling of match-fixing and spot-fixing scandals.         
	The News of the World expose has unlocked the Pandoras box. In fact, things have gone so much out of hand that two Boards  Pakistan and England  are actually slugging it out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players sign up with AIFF
                                                                                                                       7                                      Players sign up with AIFF
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) Tuesday signed 17 top footballers on an exclusive eight-month contract for the national team till the Asian Cup but not before agreeing to hikes for at least five players.         
	The rest of the players in the 30-strong squad, except Subrata Paul and Sunil Chetri, are expected to sign their contracts in the next couple of days. While Chetri is currently playing in Major League Soccer, Paul has left for Canada to try out for a local club, the Vancouver Whitecaps.         
	Churchill Brothers defender Gourmangi Singh would be leaving for Australia on Thursday to appear for trials with Melbourne FC. Gourmangi will be in Australia for two weeks while Paul is expected to return after 10 days.         
	There was some uncertainty at the Football House after five players  Climax Lawrence, Clifford Miranda, Samir Naik, Anthony Pereira and Steven Dias  initially refused to sign the contracts as they were not happy with the mode of payment devised by the national association.         
	While Lawrence, Miranda, Naik and Pereira play for Dempo, Dias has recently joined Churchill after Mahindra United decided to disband the team.         
	According to AIFF sources, all five said they were not ready to accept the 15 per cent increment offered by the AIFF on the basis of their contracts from last year since they would be given huge hikes by their respective clubs in the coming season.         
	After some deliberations, the three-member AIFF committee comprising Subroto Dutta, Alberto Colaco and Larsing M. Sawyn decided to accept the players request and pay them eight months salary on the basis of their current contracts.         
	Among the others to sign contracts were skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, Subhasis Roy Chowdhury, NP Pradeep, Mohammed Rafi, Rennedy Singh, Govin Singh, N. Mohanraj, Mahesh Gawli, Anwar, Surkumar Singh, NS Manju and Deepak Mondal.         
	The meeting went off very well, Bhaichung later said. The contracts are satisfactory. Hopefully, we will prepare well for the next eight months, he added.

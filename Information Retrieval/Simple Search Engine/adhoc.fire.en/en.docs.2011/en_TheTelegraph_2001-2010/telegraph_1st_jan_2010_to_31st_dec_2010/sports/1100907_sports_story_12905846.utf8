The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Abbasi fears trail may lead to current official
                                                                                                                       7                                      Abbasi fears trail may lead to current official
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                      Arif Ali Khan Abbasi    
	Calcutta: Arif Ali Khan Abbasi, respected former chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), fears that the spot-fixing trail may actually lead to a current official.         
	Thats definitely a fear... The trail could end up in one of the rooms at the Gaddafi (in Lahore, where the PCB is headquartered)... I dont think the gravity of the News of the World expose has been fully appreciated by those supposed to run the show, Abbasi, a contemporary of Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi at Oxford, told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking from Karachi on Monday afternoon, he added: Im dreading the Sundays to follow and Ive been amazed at the way the PCB has handled the scandal... Instead of the chairman (Ijaz Butt), the countrys high commissioner to the UK, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, has been doing the talking... Thats just not his job... Its strange that the chairman has disappeared into the woodwork...         
	As strange is that the PCB got hold of a lawyer (legal adviser Tafazzul Rizvi) some days after the sting operation became public... That shouldve been done on the very first morning... To nail the three players, though, the investigators have to come up with more. Its possible that theyve been framed, I dont know.         
	The under-fire Butt has been hand-picked by President Asif Ali Zardari, the PCBs patron. The chairman, essentially, is a political appointee.         
	Regarded by many as the PCBs finest administrator in the last couple of decades (at least), Abbasi, who quit soon after the 1996 World Cup, said: To my mind, fixing has been there for over a century and it wont be possible to eliminate it. No way... But, yes, limiting it is definitely possible...         
	Its because of the uncertainty in Pakistans cricket, generally, and the ad-hocism of the PCB, that players probably tend to look at other avenues of income... To give an uncertainty-related example, look at Yasir Hameed, labelled a whistle-blower... How many remember that he scored a hundred in each innings on his Test debut (against Bangladesh, in August 2003)? Yet, in seven years, Hameed has played only 25 Tests. Why so little?         
	Why is poor Younis Khan not in the team? Hes one of the few with a triple hundred in Test cricket (313, against Sri Lanka, in February 2009) and is honest with a capital H... Then, dont forget hes a World T20-winning captain... Younis is not there because, well, he doesnt fit into a particular jigsaw...         
	Angered and upset, Abbasi continued: In fact, Id like to know why Shoaib Maliks ban was quickly lifted and whats Kamran Akmal doing in the team? How is he still keeping when Zulqarnain Haider scored a superb 88 in his debut Test (against England, in August)... One suddenly heard that he has a stress fracture! Akmal keeps on dropping catches like you and I would drop hot potatoes... Surely, theres something rotten.         
	Questioning the role played by the International Cricket Council (ICC)s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit, he wondered: What has the Unit done, except costing millions of dollars? It has never caught any fixer... Id say the ICC is itself such a toothless tiger. It had teeth when Jagmohan Dalmiya was its president, not since his term ended, in 2000. If a world body is toothless, how will it ever administer?         
	In Abbasis view, things wont change in Pakistan unless the PCB again starts functioning like an institution, with clear policies and complete accountability...         
	For now, that seems to be asking for a lot.

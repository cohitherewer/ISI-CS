The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reverse swing on SA minds
                                                                                                                       7                                        Reverse swing on SA minds
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag and Mahendra Singh Dhoni appeal successfully for Jacques Kallis wicket, in Nagpur, on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Nagpur: Jacques Kallis and Hashim Amla were the stars for South Africa in the first innings of the first Test and both, at the news conference after the days play on Sunday, said that reverse swing might play an important part in the remaining part of the match.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	On the days performance         
	Amla: Getting a double hundred in any country is a great achievement. Personal milestones are great. But at the end of the day, its the teams interest that counts most. Im happy that my contribution has helped the teams cause. It came at a time when the team needed it. I didnt have a different game plan for today (Sunday). I just wanted to keep things as simple as possible. Batting for almost the whole day was the most satisfactory experience.         
	Kallis: Im not much worried about missing the double century. Its the media which creates a hype about it. The Indians bowled a defensive line against me today They bowled much wider. Im not losing any sleep over it. I was just a bit unlucky.         
	On their 340-run partnership         
	Amla: Its always great for the team if two persons get in and have a long partnership. For me, it was a privilege watching a great batsman like Jacques play from the other end. Our run rate suffered today as we kept losing wickets. It got a bit difficult for us.         
	Kallis: Hashim has come a long way He lends a solid look to the team. Also, he brings a calmness to the team with his presence. Im sure he will score a lot more for South Africa.         
	On the game plan         
	Amla: The ball was reverse swinging today. It was also quite difficult playing (Amit) Mishra as he beat the bat a number of times. The pitches are not like South Africa. Were looking forward to tomorrow (Monday)s play.         
	Kallis: We wanted to get at least 550 before declaring. Tomorrow morning will be crucial for us. There are some rough spots on the wicket, and it will be up to (Paul) Harris to work on that. Reverse swing will also be a factor. We would definitely want to knock over a few wickets early.         
	On Indias chances         
	Kallis: They are a decent bowling side. Thats one of the reasons why they are the No.1 side. They have the ability to take wickets and they have done it before. As a unit they bowled well today and contained us.

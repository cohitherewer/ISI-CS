	Leicester: Young Saurashtra speedster Jaydev Unadkat produced a memorable performance on debut as India A gained the drivers seat at the end of second days play in their four-day tour match against West Indies A, here on Friday.         
	After the entire first days play was washed out, India A bowlers led by 18-year-old Jaydev skittled out the West Indies for a paltry 144 in 43.3 overs. The left-arm seamer who played for Kolkata Knight Riders during the last IPL, scalped seven for 41 in his 18-over spell after skipper Cheteshwar Pujara opted to field at the Grace Road ground.         
	At stumps, India were in a commanding position having scored 183 for two in 49.1 overs thereby taking a 39-run lead. The Indians would definitely like to force an outright result as there are two more days left in the match. Opener Abhinav Mukund scored 54 while Ajinkya Rahane is batting on 66 along with Pujara who is unbeaten on 34.         
	The day belonged to young Jaydev who till date played only List A matches apart from spearheading Indias attack during the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand. He started the slide dismissing the two openers Devon Smith (5) and Kraigg Brathwaite (13) cheaply before accounting for Omar Phillips (6).         
	Brief Scores: West Indies A 144 in 43.3 overs (Dave Bernard 22, I. Khan 28, J. Unadkat 7/41). India A 183/2 (A. Rahane 66 batting, A. Mukund 54). Match to continue (Agencies)

            STAR RACER                          Trainer Arti Doctor leading in Romantic Impact (Shailesh-up)                            
	Calcutta: Jockey Kishore Kadam notched up a quick treble while trainer Darius Byramjis course-favourites, Missoni and Alacrity, bit the dust in Wednesdays seven-event race card. Kadams operation begun with the start-to-finish victory of Sangoma in the 1,800m Elusive Study Handicap. The jockeys forceful handling of All Time High, in the following race, the 1,100m Serrafina Handicap, earned him kudos. Kadam also proved to be a giant killer as he humbled the half-money favourite Missoni in the upper division of the Karans Choice Handicap.          
	Alacrity, too, found trainer Arti Doctors new import from the west, Romantic Impact, a hard nut to crack in the 1,200m Supernova Cup. Jockey Shailesh Shinde rode a well-judged waiting race on the winner when he pounced on the tiring Alacrity, close home.

       Centurion: Warriors produced a clinical display and   defeated South Australia Red  backs comprehensively by 30   runs to storm into the final of   the Champions League Twenty20 here Saturday.  Riding on captain Davy Jacobs rsquo; blistering 61 and his 105-  run second-wicket stand with   Colin Ingram (46), Warriors   posted a challenging 175 for six   and then restricted South Australia to 145 for seven to register a comfortable win in the   second semi-final at the Super  Sport Park.  Warriors will take on   Chennai Super Kings in the   final at the Wanderers Sunday.  Earlier, opting to bat, Jacobs led from the front with   the quickfire half century, and   together with Ingram set the   tone for the competitive score   with the century plus second-  wicket partnership that came   off just 72 balls.  Medium-pacer Daniel Har  ris pulled South Australia   back into the match with fig  ures of three for 18 from his   four overs, while Shaun Tait   scalped two victims for 37.  South Australia rsquo;s chase   never got going as they lost   wickets upfront to find them  selves in a precarious position   and eventually fell short by 30   runs.  Callum Ferguson fought a  losing cause for South Aus  tralia with a 71 that came off   just 49 balls but his heroics   were not enough to take his   side into the summit clash.  For Warriors Lonwabo   Tsotsobe and Johan Botha   picked up two wickets apiece,   giving away 16 and 34 runs, respectively.

  - Sachin, Yuvraj set to be in; toss-up likely between Dinda and ishant       OUR BUREAU                                      Zaheer Khan      
	There is confusion over Zaheer Khans availability for the tri-series in Sri Lanka. While the senior pacer is expected to be fit, the selectors are still not sure about his availability.         
	Zaheer is understood to be undergoing rehab at the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore.         
	The selectors will meet on Saturday to pick the squad.         
	Those expected to be dropped from the Asia Cup XV, Team Indias last one-day Internationals engagement, are Ravichandran Ashwin and Saurabh Tiwary.         
	Sachin Tendulkar and Yuvraj Singh will come in for them.         
	Theres also a question mark over Ashok Dinda with Ishant Sharma running him close.         
	While Sachin decided to take a break from the Asia Cup, Yuvraj was dropped from the squad.         
	Rahul Dravid, V.V.S. Laxman, Murali Vijay, Wriddhiman Saha, Munaf Patel, Abhimanyu Mithun and Amit Mishra will return from Lanka after the Test series.         
	A young Team India, under the leadership Suresh Raina had travelled to Zimbabwe for an ODI tri-series, that also involved Sri Lanka.         
	However, lacklustre display from the greenhorns saw them fall flat on their face.         
	The Indians, who failed to reach the finals, didnt manage to beat the Zimbabweans even once in the meet.         
	India went back to their seniors, in the Asia Cup, which was held in Sri Lanka last month, where Mahendra Singh Dhoni returned as the captain.         
	The Indians recovered some lost pride by outclassing the hosts by 81 runs in the final.  
	LIKELY XVI  Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir, Dinesh Karthik, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan, Praveen Kumar, Ashok Dinda/Ishant Sharma

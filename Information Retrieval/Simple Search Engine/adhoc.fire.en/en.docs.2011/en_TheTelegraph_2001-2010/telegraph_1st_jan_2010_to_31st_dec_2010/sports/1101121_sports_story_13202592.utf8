The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tarjinder keeps everyone guessing 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tarjinder keeps everyone guessing 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In a curious incident on Saturday, the final day of the Bengal-Assam Ranji tie at the Eden Gardens, Assam batsman Tarjinder Singhs score was suddenly wiped off the scoreboard after he reached his half-century.         
	Everyone was taken by surprise when Singhs individual score read zero as soon as he completed his 50 in the 140th over of the Assam innings. Surprisingly, his score was neither updated nor changed till he got out for 98. Later, when enquired about the anomaly, the scorer at the Eden Gardens said the score was expunged at the batsmans request.         
	I just wanted to focus on my game and not look at the score. I was taking it ball by ball, and did not want the distraction of nearing a century. So, I requested not to display my score, said Tarjinder after the match.         
	It is rare in cricket history when a batsman has made such a request and it was equally surprising to see match referee Prakash J. Bhatt give in to Singhs request. When asked about it, Bhatt tried to avoid the issue calling it an insignificant occurrence. It was a small thing and there is no need to exaggerate it, Bhatt said.         
	CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey said the matter did not concern them. I have only briefly heard about it. It was for the referee to decide on that point. It does not pertain to the Association, and I cant tell what the implications of the matter will be, Dey said.

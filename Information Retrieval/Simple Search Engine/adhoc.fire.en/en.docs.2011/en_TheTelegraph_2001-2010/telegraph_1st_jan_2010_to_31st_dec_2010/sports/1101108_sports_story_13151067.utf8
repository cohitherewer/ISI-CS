The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I tried to play it straight: Kane
                                                                                                                       7                                        I tried to play it straight: Kane
  - The wickets deteriorating and taking a bit of turn, says Williamson       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Chris Martin and Brendon McCullum celebrate the dismissal of Rahul Dravid, on the fourth day of the first Test, in Ahmedabad, on Sunday. (PTI)                                         
	Ahmedabad: Kane Williamson, on Sunday, became the youngest New Zealand batsman to score a hundred on debut. Even though the visitors fell 28 runs short of Indias first innings total, Chris Martin (five for 25) made up for the void with a vitriolic bowling performance.         
	In a media interaction after the days play, Williamson said he had focussed on playing spin before this series, and felt Martins five-wicket haul will give the Black Caps an edge on the final day.               
	The following are excerpts         
	New Zealands chances         
	Our boys play aggressive cricket. The wickets deteriorating and its taking a bit of turn as well. Lets see how it turns out tomorrow (Monday). The ball sometimes was doing too much if it fell on the right areas.         
	Chris Martins performance         
	Well, the bowlers have reasons to feel good with the wickets It will make us confident going into the final day. It was a good effort by Martin because we just have one seamer now (Hamish Bennett batted, but didnt take the field due to his groin injury).         
	On how he prepared for the India series         
	I believe spin is probably the trickiest We knew that it would be the key aspect of this series. (Pragyan) Ojha and Harbhajan (Singh) showed that today (Sunday). So, that was very much our focus. Personally, getting my head in and playing my game was the key I guess.         
	His approach on the day         
	I tried to play it straight and stay patient. That was the plan. I watched the ball carefully and if on the spot, I put it away.         
	On what cornered India         
	Obviously in the three or four overs that we had before tea, we got a lot of momentum from those three wickets. With three good players out before tea and taking three more after coming out, I guess was the key.         
	If there was any talk during tea         
	I think the boys were looking to get out there quickly and get the momentum that we gathered from those few overs and carry on with that.

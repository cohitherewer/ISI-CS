                  Andrew Symonds on Sunday                           
	Cuttack: Andrew Symondss purple patch continued as he came up with yet another all-round display to steer the defending champions Deccan Chargers to a 10-run win over the Delhi DareDevils in a thrilling Indian Premier League (IPL) match here Sunday.         
	Symonds first scored a brisk 24-ball 35 and then starred with the ball with figures of three for 21, apart from a coming up with a stunning catch to dismiss dangerman Dinesh Karthik, to guide the Chargers home in the match that saw fortunes fluctuating from one team to the other.         
	With this win, the Hyderabad outfit has recorded their third consecutive victory in the Twenty20 event after losing the tournament opener against the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	The DareDevils, on the other hand, have slumped to their third defeat on the trot from as many as five outings.         
	For the Daredevils, explosive David Warner made a quickfire 57 off 33 balls upfront, while skipper Karthik seemed determined to see his side home with a dangerous-looking 27-ball 46-run innings. Symonds was ably supported by left-arm spinner Rahul Sharma, who captured two crucial wickets for 42 to help his sides cause.         
	Earlier, opting to bat, the Chargers skipper Adam Gilchrist (24 off 14), Herschelle Gibbs (31 off 26), Rohit Sharma (45 off 30) and T Suman (29 off 19) chipped in with useful contributions, apart from Symonds, to help Chargers post a competitive 171 for six on the board.

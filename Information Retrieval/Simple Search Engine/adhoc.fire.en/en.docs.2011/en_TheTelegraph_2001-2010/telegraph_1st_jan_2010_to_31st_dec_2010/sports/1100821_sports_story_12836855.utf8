                  Caroline Wozniacki in action, on Thursday                     
	Montreal: World No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki needed a little advice from dad but Kim Clijsters needed help from no one as she raced into the quarter finals of the Rogers Cup on Thursday, with a 6-2, 6-1 demolition of Kaia Kanepi.         
	Clijsters, back on centre court about 15 hours after a testing three-set win over American Bethanie Mattek-Sands, shrugged off the quick turnaround to see off 34th-ranked Kanepi in 55 minutes.         
	Wozniacki,had to battle stubborn Italian Flavia Pennetta for over two hours before clinching a 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 victory.         
	Clijsters has a 21-2 record on hardcourts this season, including her current 13-match winning streak that stretches back to a victory in Miami earlier this spring.         
	Australia Open semi-finalist Zheng Jie of China delivered the shock of the day, ending Elena Dementievas title defence with a gritty 7-6, 6-4 win over the fourth-seeded Russian. French Open champion and sixth seed Francesca Schiavone of Italy advanced with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Russian Dinara Safina.         
	In a rematch of the San Diego final two weeks ago, Svetlana Kuznetsova looked to be hitting her stride at the right time battling past seventh seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland 6-4, 1-6, 6-3.         
	Wimbledon finalist Vera Zvonareva had a 6-3, 6-3 win over Hungarys Agnes Szava. (AFP)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Come Friday, India will figure among the continents elite footballing nations when the draw ceremony for the Asian Cup final rounds is held at Aspire Dome in Doha. The championships are to be held in Doha from January 7 to 29 of next year.         
	Having qualified by virtue of winning the AFC Challenge Cup in 2008, India are the lowest-ranked team in the prestigious 16-nation meet that includes big names like Australia, Japan, South and North Korea and Saudi Arabia.         
	But the truckload of All India Football Federation (AIFF) officials, including president Praful Patel and general secretary Alberto Colaco, that will be attending the ceremony in Doha might just end up seeing India get an unfavourable draw that leaves them with minimum chance of getting past the first round.         
	The AIFF, however, are trying their best to raise a decent team that on its day is able to rise to the challenge. It has already shortlisted 30 top footballers and has a plan to enter into an exclusive contract with them. Under the contract, the players will have to be available for national duty for eight months between June 2010 and January 2011.         
	According to sources, the selected players would be asked to sign a contract with AIFF for the new season and would be paid as per this seasons (2009-10) contract with their respective clubs.         
	At the moment, the federation is examining all the contracts. Once that is over, the players will be contacted individually to apprise them of the situation, sources said.         
	Strangely enough, no one in AIFF is sure how a player whose club contract goes beyond the current season would be approached.         
	There are several players who have two or three-year contracts with their clubs. Under what rule AIFF asks these clubs to break those contracts remains to be seen, said an official.         
	Teams in final round         
	Direct entry: Iraq (Fifa rank 81/AFC rank 7), Saudi Arabia (62/4), South Korea (49/3) and Qatar (hosts, 97/13).         
	AFC Challenge Cup champions: India (132/22) and North Korea (105/17).         
	Qualifiers: Australia (19/1), Japan (45/2), Iran (63/5), Bahrain (67/6), China (84/8), Kuwait (94/9), Uzbekistan (95/10), Syria (97/12), Jordan (102/14) and UAE (102/15).

	Rome: Colombian qualifier Santiago Giraldo unleashed an arsenal of winners to upset former champion Juan Carlos Ferrero 6-0, 6-3 Monday in the opening round of the Rome Masters.         
	The 76th-ranked Giraldo hit 32 winners to Ferreros nine, and required only 17 minutes to win the opening set.         
	The 12th-seeded Ferrero won the Rome tournament in 2001 and entered with an 18-3 record on clay this season, but Giraldo came in on a run of his own, having beaten tour veterans Nicolas Lapentti and Jarkko Nieminen in qualifying.         
	Also, 14th-seeded John Isner celebrated his 25th birthday by rallying to beat Horacio Zeballos of Argentina, 4-6, 7-6 (5), 7-5.         
	Isner, the top American in the draw following Andy Roddicks withdrawal, hit 20 aces and faced only one break point  which he lost.         
	It was the 2.06-meter (6-foot-9) Isners first win on clay this season, and the turning point came when a drop shot attempt from Zeballos hit the net to hand Isner his first break of the match and a 6-5 lead in the third set.         
	The American then managed to shake off some nerves and finish Zeballos off on his third match point.         
	Ernests Gulbis of Latvia cruised past Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus 6-2, 6-2 and will next face top-ranked Roger Federer.         
	In other matches, Italian wild card Paolo Lorenzi rallied to beat 31st-ranked Albert Montanes 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, and Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany eliminated Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay 6-7 (1), 6-1, 6-4.         
	The top eight seeded players have first-round byes in singles.         
	Roger Federer opened his clay-court season with a doubles victory Monday at the Rome Masters.         
	The top-ranked player paired with Swiss Davis Cup teammate Yves Allegro to beat Johan Brunstrom of Sweden and Jean-Julien Rojer of the Netherlands Antilles 6-4, 7-6 (4).         
	Federer never dropped his serve and showed off effective volleying skills in his first match inside the new 10,500-seat stadium at the Foro Italico.         
	Federer and Allegro will next face sixth-seeded Simon Aspelin of Sweden and Paul Hanley of Australia.         
	Meanwhile, seasoned Indian pros Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi have advanced to the pre-quarter finals of the Masters event along with their respective partners after getting a first-round bye.         
	Paes and his Czech partner Lukas Dlouhy, seeded third, now await the winner of the match between Ivan Ljubicic/Michael Llodra and Julian Knowle/Andy Ram.         
	Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi of Belarus, seeded fourth, will take on the winner of the match, which Simone Bolelli/Potito Starace play against Igor Andreev/Mikhail Youzhny.         
	Both the Indian players have done well in the elite Masters series events in the recent past.         
	Bhupathi and Knowles have two runners-up finish to their credit in the Masters events this season.         
	Last week, they lost the final of the Monte Carlo Masters and before that they had ended runners-up to Paes and Dlouhy at the Miami Masters.           (AGENCIES)

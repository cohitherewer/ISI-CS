                                                                                                                       7                                      Real to sign Mourinho
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Real Madrid have parted company with coach Manuel Pellegrini, paving the way for Jose Mourinho to take over.         
	Pellegrini was midway through a two-year contract with the Spanish giants but pays the penalty for an unsuccessful first season in charge at the Bernabeu.         
	Madrid, despite spending around 250 million euros in bringing in the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Karim Benzema and Xabi Alonso last summer, suffered their second successive trophy-less campaign. Madrid president Florentino Perez announced the news at a press conference on Wednesday at the Bernabeu following a board meeting.         
	Perez also announced their intention to appoint Mourinho as the next coach of Madrid once his contractual situation with Inter Milan has been resolved. We have dedicated the last few weeks to analysing and reflecting upon the past season. And we have decided to bring to an end Manuel Pellegrinis time at the club, said Perez.         
	We want to thank him and his team for their hard work, professionalism and conduct.         
	The board also agreed to contract Jose Mourinho as the new coach of Real Madrid once his contractual relationship with Inter Milan has been resolved.

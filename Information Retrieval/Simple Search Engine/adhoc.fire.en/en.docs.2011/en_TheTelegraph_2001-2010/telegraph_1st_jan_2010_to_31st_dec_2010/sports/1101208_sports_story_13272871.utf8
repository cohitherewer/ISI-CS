The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A turning point of my career: Yusuf 
                                                                                                                       7                                        A turning point of my career: Yusuf 
  - Have never seen something like this, says stand-in captain Gambhir       A CORRESPONDENT            Yusuf Pathan after reaching his century, on Tuesday. (PTI)                                 
	Bangalore: Yusuf Pathan played a blinder to help India romp to a five-wicket victory over New Zealand on Tuesday.         
	No team has successfully chased a total of 250 or more at the Chinnaswamy Stadium. But the Baroda bombers 96-ball 123 helped the hosts chase down New Zealands 315 and thus register the highest successful run chase at the venue.         
	Man of the Match Yusuf, who walked in at 108 for 4 when the match was evenly poised, smote New Zealand bowlers all over the park and rekindled hopes of a World Cup berth.         
	Yusuf termed his unbeaten hundred as the turning point of his career at the post-match presentation ceremony.               
	The following are excerpts:         
	Gautam Gambhir: I have never seen something like this. I have always said that Yusuf (Pathan) is such a great talent that he can finish the game on his shoulders and he has proved himself today. We were playing seven batsmen and we had the depth in our batting... And the kind of cricketers we have down the order... Yuvraj (Singh), Yusuf (Pathan) and Saurabh (Tiwary)  they are all clean hitters of the ball. We always knew that if we have the wickets in hand, these guys can chase any target on the board. I always felt till the time Yusuf was there, we were in with a chance. And Dhonis message to Yusuf was to bat as long as possible.         
	If one team gets 315 and the other team ends up chasing the score this shows how good a wicket it was. Its a fantastic one-day wicket and I hope the wicket stays like this. I feel every game is important and we have got a young side. This win will give us a lot of confidence and well try and win the next one as well.         
	Daniel Vettori: It was a great game of cricket... Over 300 runs were scored by both teams and though we lost, the innings by Yusuf Pathan was pretty amazing... And, particularly in that last portion of the power play, he really took the game away from us. It was a very good wicket and, obviously, James (Franklin) played himself in nicely to give us a formidable total. But as I said before, Yusufs innings was amazing and it took the game away from us. The rain does break a bit of momentum for the batting team and it gives chance to the bowling side to regroup. So, it was better for us but it didnt go our way. The wicket wasnt too bad after the drizzle. We couldnt probably get the balls in the right places.         
	Yusuf Pathan: This innings was very special for me. Whenever I have played any good innings, something special has happened. And this one was also special (India won by 5 wickets). I kept discussing with Saurabh (Tiwary) that the game is closely placed and that we have to play carefully. At the end, Saurabh played really well.         
	It was big target (316) for us and initially I controlled myself. But, as the ball started coming nicely to the bat, I played my shots. When Rohit (Sharma) and I were on the crease we discussed that we have to play the full 50 overs. And whoever stays in will play his shots. After Rohit got out, I had the same plan with Saurabh. I think this is the turning point for my life and career.

	Georgetown: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori feels he will need to play a key role on the slow Caribbean pitches.         
	The spinners are expected to play an important role at most of the venues for the ICC World Twenty20 and New Zealand have chosen a squad with several slow-bowling options. New Zealand will play their league games against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in Guyana.         
	Nathan McCullum is expected to be his major backup in the spin department. Were very confident, Vettori said. You throw in Kyle Mills, whos come back and has been a very successful bowler for us, Tim Southee has done a good job, Ian Butler has come back from injury as well and at times has done a good job for us, so between the five of them from the seam bowling department I think theyll be very adequate.         
	But I think spin bowling is going to play a big part, particularly on the slower grounds in the Caribbean. Were expecting myself and Nathan McCullum to play a big role.         
	New Zealand have been regular semi-finalists in major tournaments over the past few years, reaching the final four at the 2007 World Twenty20 in South Africa, the World Cup in the West Indies earlier that year, and the 2006 Champions Trophy. They went one better by reaching the decider of last years Champions Trophy but batsman Scott Styris said nothing short of securing the silverware will satisfy them this time.         
	We keep making it to the semi-finals and not going any further, although the Champions Trophy we did make the final, Styris said. What it shows is that we do play well in these big tournaments. We have a history of doing pretty well right back for the last ten years or so.         
	If we play well weve a chance, and were not just looking for a semi-final spot or a Super Eights, its a real chance to win. We go in to this tournament with the view that we have to win this tournament. Were good enough to win it, and if we dont win it then it has to be disappointing.         
	Although an attack fronted by Vettori and Shane Bond is threatening, their chances of success will rest heavily on how the top order performs.         
	I think weve got a very explosive top order, Oram said. Our batting line-up to me is very, very strong and right down to No. 8, 9 and even 10 sometimes, weve got guys who can come in and hit the ball a long way. I think thats our main strength.         
	Vettoris men open against Sri Lanka at Providence Stadium on Friday.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                        Sehwag bats for UDRS
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Virender Sehwag at the CCI, on Sunday. (PTI)                           
	Mumbai: Virender Sehwag says he is in favour of having the Umpires Decision Referral System (UDRS) but is not so sure about resting key players for the five one-day Internationals (ODI), against New Zealand.         
	The UDRS has been a sticky issue for the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) ever since the International Cricket Council (ICC) started using it in 2008.         
	Sehwag, known for his no-nonsense approach, explained why he supported the UDRS, but stated categorically that his individual view should not be seen as that of Team Indias.         
	I am big fan of the UDRS. I would love to have it for the New Zealand series as well as the South Africa tour. But thats my personal opinion, Sehwag said at a promotional, here on Sunday. Sometimes the batsman knows that he can benefit There were a couple of instances recently when the umpire gave me out and I knew that the umpire was wrong. So if the system had been there, it might have been reversed.         
	The BCCI has also received a proposal from coach Gary Kirsten to leave out of select players from the squad for the ODIs against New Zealand and, instead, send them to South Africa early for acclimatisation and preparation.         
	Sehwag said that ideally, the team picked to play New Zealand should be in full strength, especially given the fact that it would be Indias last series at home in the shorter format before the World Cup.         
	We will try to play as a full strength team that would play the World Cup. But we are playing so much cricket that we also need a break, he said.         
	The new comers have also done well. But I am hoping that we play the full team... It all depends on what the team management and the BCCI wants to do. Its not a personal opinion.         
	Speaking on a different issue, Sehwag cautioned against getting carried away with the search for all-rounders.         
	We are winning now and thats what should matter. One should not disturb the winning combination. All-rounders come and go, and its not that only fast-bowlers can be all-rounders. Even spinners can do the job, he said.         
	Sehwag was also cool to the ICCs plans to have under-cover anti-corruption officials posing as bookies in an effort to weed out the bookie-player nexus.         
	Asked to comment on Sachin Tendulkars approaching the landmark of 100 international centuries, Sehwag said: Only God can do that. I am lucky to be playing with him and to have him as a role model. If there is any one in the game who deserves that record, its Sachin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My age doesnt bother me,   says Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                      My age doesn't bother me,   says Sachin
                            
	London: Indias batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar, who has been in blistering form this year and has surged to the top of the ICC Test rankings for batsmen for the first time since 2002, is not worried with his age.         
	I am really enjoying my cricket right now. I dont know how long I am going to continue playing, but as long as I enjoy myself and feel that I can contribute, I will be playing. My age doesnt bother me  age is in the mind, the 37-year-old said.         
	Tendulkar spoke after receiving the Lebara Peoples Choice Award and the Outstanding Achievement in Sport Award, at the Asian Awards, at Grosvenor House, on Tuesday night.         
	Sachin also said that England batsman Kevin Pietersen can regain his form if he clears his mind before the Ashes series against an Australian side who are no longer the team to beat in Test cricket.         
	If Kevin Pietersen is thinking right, it will reflect in his game and the runs will come. All I would say to him is just be relaxed, be calm and watch the ball as closely as possible because that is what a batsman is meant to do, Tendulkar said.         
	If Kevin clears his mind and perceives that Australia are no longer the team to beat, he will regain his form. The thought process has to be free flowing and thats when you react and your body movement is not stiff and tight. If he can clear his mind, I am sure his game will improve.         
	The iconic batsman gave Australia a torrid time in the recently concluded Test series against India, with his mammoth first-innings score of 214, helping India to a comfortable win over the visitors in Bangalore.         
	In stark contrast to Tendulkars dominance, Pietersen has been struggling, with the last of his 16 Test centuries coming way back in March 2009.         
	However, with just four weeks to go before the first Ashes Test kicks off in Brisbane, Tendulkar sees a solution to the England batsmans slump.         
	Australia fell to the fifth spot in the ICC rankings and, crucially, below England, for the first time since the standings were launched in 2003.         
	The Australians competed very hard, which they always do, but India, as a team, showed tremendous character, Tendulkar said.         
	If we are talking about the side to beat in Test cricket right now, I would say that would be South Africa in South Africa. They compete hard and use their conditions to their advantage.

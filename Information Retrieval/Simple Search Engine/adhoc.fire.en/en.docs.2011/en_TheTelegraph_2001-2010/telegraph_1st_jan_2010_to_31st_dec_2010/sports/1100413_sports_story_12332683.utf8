The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Test of character for Delhi DareDevils
                                                                                                                       7                                      Test of character for Delhi DareDevils
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Delhi DareDevils will be keen to bounce back from successive losses to low-rung teams, and upset the Mumbai Indians here Tuesday. With 12 points following six wins from nine matches at one stage of the tournament, the DareDevils should have sealed their place in the semis a long time ago.         
	But after defeats to a struggling Kolkata Knight Riders and King XI Punjab, who are out of the reckoning, they face a test of character.         
	In both matches, the DareDevils top order failed to deliver. The track at the Kotla might have been uninspiring for strokeplayers like Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir, but the pitch at the Brabourne Stadium should bring the best out of them. The DareDevils will continue to miss Dirk Nannes because of injury.         
	The Mumbai Indians decided against practising Monday, following their delayed arrival from Jaipur. With their entry to the semis confirmed, the hosts could experiment with their combination.         
	Zaheer Khan and Lasith Malinga, could get some well-deserved rest but Sachin Tendulkar could play, considering this is a home game. The captain might opt out of the last two league games, both away, against the Knight Riders and the Royal Challengers Bangalore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | English need to free their minds 
                                                                                                                       7                                      English need to free their minds 
            Henry Winter                                Fabio Capello    
	Every day in South Africa brings another moment that stretches the senses, another sight that expands the mind. Here in Cape Town, there is the serenity of Kommetjie contrasting with 78-feet waves in savage seas.         
	There are the seals basking within yards of thousands of partying Dutch and Uruguayans, mingling with the merry English who simply refuse to go home.         
	Apart from Howard Webb, the most impressive English people here have been the supporters, who have endured the dross that was Fabio Capellos team, travelled far and wide across the Veldt, smelled the roses on the Garden Route and made friends and memories for life.         
	On Monday morning, groups of England fans headed to Robben Island, braving a stomach-testing swell on the boat ride over. They queued to see the cell of Nelson Mandela and listened respectfully to a former political prisoner reflecting with remarkable lack of rancour on his incarceration and torture.         
	Robben Island has been visited by many nationalities these past few weeks, by footballers as well as fans. Hollands players came en masse, Germanys too.         
	Even the Dutch WAGS walked quietly through the prison, taking pictures and absorbing every word from their guide. It is hard to envisage many England WAGS visiting Robben Island, although it does have a shop and a beach.         
	Englands impoverished World Cup showing has made it open season on their partners but some of the criticism has been naive. Most of the players do care, are committed to their careers and are mindful of refuelling and conditioning. But England players should follow the example of the fans and remove their blinkers.         
	Stirring surprise locally, Capellos men failed to take advantage of a day off in Cape Town after the Algeria game to visit Robben Island, the type of place that would introduce instant perspective into their lives.         
	Englands obsession with cutting themselves off from a country needs tackling.         
	England have been down this road in South Africa before, when some of Sven-Goran Erikssons players declined the chance to meet Nelson Mandela at a special gathering when England were in Durban in 2003. It is symptomatic of Englands damaging insularity, of an unwillingness to look, listen and learn.         
	Capello must also expand his horizons. The Italians failure to stay on at the tournament and do some general scouting into the successful tactics remains baffling. An international ingnue, Capello could have analysed how the Dutch manipulate the ball and how Uruguay counter-attack on Tuesday.         
	He could have flown to Durban on Wednesday, assessing again the strengths of Germanys 4-2-3-1 system and seen Spains princes of possession at first hand. Enough England fans have made the effort. Just look for the flags.         
	Everybody needs a holiday, and Capello looked drained by the end, but he could have postponed his vacation until after the July 11 final. If England cannot beat them, they should join the queue to be educated by them.         
	Holland, Germany and Spain will probably fill three of the four semi-final slots at Euro 2012 so placing an even greater imperative on England to study the Continents three wise men.         
	At least some of the Premier League clubs are beginning to take the blinkers off, responding to Englands problems.         
	The Tottenham Hotspur manager, Harry Redknapp, on Monday agreed that four of his youngsters, Andros Townsend, Steven Caulker, Dean Parrett and Ryan Mason, could join England Under-19s for a tournament in France.         
	Spurs initially wanted the quartet to work on their fitness at home but have now agreed to release them. If they need the kids we will get it sorted out,: Redknapp said.         
	It is still only a small step on Englands journey towards enlightenment.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

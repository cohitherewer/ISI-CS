	Pele picks Brazil, Spain  
	Johannesburg: Football great Pele has singled out Brazil and Spain as the strongest teams at the World Cup, yet wants to see an African side take on his country in the final.  
	At the moment, we have Spain in Europe and Brazil in South America. They are the two best teams  no doubt. I am very proud to see the World Cup in Africa... It would be fantastic to see Brazil playing an African team in the final, he said.               
	Vieira view  
	Johannesburg: Patrick Vieira thinks an African team could lift the trophy this year. Vieira, who was born in Senegal but was part of the France team that won the 1998 tournament on home soil, said Thursday that Ivory Coast and Cameroon were best placed to be Africas first World Cup winner.  
	Lukas promise  
	Pretoria: Lukas Podolski promised on Thursday to put his poor club form behind him and return to the scoring exploits that helped Germany reach the World Cup semi-finals four years ago. I want to pick up where I left off four years ago. I have had a very good preparation and I want to bring that to the matches, he said.  
	Flu horn  
	Johannesburg: Already criticised by some for being too noisy, the vuvuzela may also be spreading colds and flu germs, according to a London doctor. But with the flu season in South Africa in full swing, Dr. Ruth McNerney of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that the instrument has the potential to infect those seated near a person blowing a vuvuzela.  
	Twitter ban  
	Amsterdam: Netherlands defender Gregory van der Wiel says his squad is banned from using Twitter during the World Cup, one day after a teammate used a Dutch term insulting to Moroccans on a live streaming video. Eljero Elia appeared to make the remark Tuesday in response to a jesting insult made by a Moroccan friend on a chat forum connected with the video.  
	Prison Cup  
	Bangkok: Serving a 16-year sentence for drug trafficking, Alexander Kreps is one of 190 inmates participating in The World Cup Behind Bars, organised by Thailands ministry of justice to coincide with the actual World Cup about to kick off in South Africa.   
	Etoo support  
	Durban: Cameroon coach Paul Le Guen is publicly backing Samuel Eto despite the star strikers threats to quit the team ahead of the World Cup. He is my captain, a great player, one of the best players in the world and he wants to do well, Le Guen said Thursday.

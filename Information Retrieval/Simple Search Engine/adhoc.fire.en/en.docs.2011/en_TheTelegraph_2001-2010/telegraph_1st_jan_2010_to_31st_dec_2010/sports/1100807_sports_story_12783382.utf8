The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nobody comes close to Viv Richards: Aravinda
                                                                                                                       7                                        Nobody comes close to Viv Richards: Aravinda
    - Former Sri Lanka captain picks his top batsmen             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                    
	Colombo: Aravinda de Silva, one of the finest of his generation, spoke to The Telegraph on batting and chose his top willow-wielders. Asked to pick five, he selected one more, saying that the sixth was necessary.         
	A former Sri Lanka captain, Aravinda is now the chief selector.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On the qualities he looks for in batsmen         
	Attitude, commitment... A lot of players have the talent, but not everybody has a high degree of commitment... The want to do well must always be high. Whats important is how you allow your talent to flourish... The ability to come out of tough situations has to be there.         
	His idol         
	(Enthusiastically) Sir Vivian Richards... For me, he remains the greatest... Nobody comes close to him... He didnt spare any attack and wasnt bothered with reputations... He tore into the quickest and, back then, there were some very fast bowlers... Has anybody forgotten his swagger? He had such a presence...         
	Top batsmen (alphabetically) from the current lot         
	MAHELA JAYAWARDENE: A free-scoring batsman who can quietly alter the course of a match... Thats a big quality to possess... Mahela can change the complexion without taking many risks.         
	JACQUES KALLIS: In Sri Lanka, at least, weve never underestimated him... The media may be underrating him, but fellow-professionals are aware of just how good he is... Kallis knows when to lift his game and brings so much to the table.         
	KEVIN PIETERSEN: Hes a class act and I quite like his arrogance. There are times when batsmen need to be arrogant... Pietersen makes a difference to the England line-up... He appears to have plenty of belief in his abilities.         
	RICKY PONTING: A great all-round player... Ponting has the qualities Id look for in batsmen.         
	VIRENDER SEHWAG: The way he plays makes it easier for the rest... Runs come fast and, when that happens, the pressure is less... Sehwag expresses himself and sticks to his strengths. By doing so, he gives the team strength... That he can single-handedly turn a match on its head makes him invaluable. He really is destructive... A great batsman and a match-winner... Sanath (Jayasuriya) would bat in much the same manner and was allowed to play his normal game.         
	SACHIN TENDULKAR: I admire his dedication, admire his commitment to continue playing even after 20 years... I dont have to say that Sachins career has been extraordinary, for his achievements are so well documented... Hes also been such a wonderful ambassador for the sport.         
	Wickets nowadays         
	(Looks concerned) Definitely much more suited for the batsmen and, if this continues, then nobody may take to fast bowling... Why put in so much of an effort on every ball if theres nothing in the track? Cricket, in my view, faces a serious issue.         
	Finally, message for young batsmen...         
	Be committed on and off the field and concentrate on it... Come out of difficult situations, for the ability to do so separates the good players from the very ordinary.

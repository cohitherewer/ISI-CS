The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Venus begins with easy victory
                                                                                                                       7                                      Venus begins with easy victory
                      
	Miami: Venus Williams thought she looked solid in her opening win at the Miami Open on Thursday, a rather drab adjective considering she played in a red corset. It was more like an eye-popping victory. Williams began a bid for a fourth Key Biscayne title and her first since 2001 by beating Sorana Cirstea 6-4, 6-3.         
	As is customary for the Williams sisters at the start of a tournament, Venus unveiled a new outfit  a corset with spaghetti straps and a flounce. The first eight questions at her postmatch news conference addressed the 1890s-style dress.         
	Like Can-Can, she said. The motif is really about sporty sexy, and kind of that whole attitude of bringing that to my game. I usually dont wear red. This is kind of new for me.         
	The dress will be back in the third round, when the No. 3-seeded Venus plays unseeded Roberta Vinci, who beat No. 30 Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-4, 7-6 (5). With sister Serena Williams sidelined by a knee injury, Venus may be the woman to beat in a tournament she considers her hometown event.         
	 Both sets followed similar patterns, with Venus losing serve early and finishing strong. She swept the final four games of the first set and the last three games of the match.         
	Former No. 1-ranked Ana Ivanovic beat Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 6-3 and said her career is moving in the right direction again. With the victory she broke a four-match losing streak, the longest of her career.         
	Top-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova struggled in her opening match to beat Chinas Peng Shuai 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. Kuznetsova, the 2006 champion, next plays No. 27 Agnes Szavay, who shut out Alicia Molik 6-0, 6-0.         
	On the mens side, lucky loser Nicolas Lapentti and qualifier Kevin Anderson were among those reaching the third round. The 33-year-old Lapentti, who made the draw only because another player pulled out, will face No. 1 Roger Federer on Saturday.

	Calcutta: East Bengal will miss the services of captain Syed Rahim Nabi for the clubs 17th round I-League match against Air India on Sunday. Nabi is suffering from a side strain. Ghanaian winger Abel Hammond, too, looks doubtful with an ankle injury.

	East Bengal are seventh on the table with 21 points while Air India are placed 12th with 18 points from 16 matches.         
	Meanwhile, East Bengals training session at the club ground was cut short when the mounted police instructed them to leave the ground as a BHA league match was scheduled there.

    - Terry and Co. thrash Wigan 8-0 to break United hearts           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Chelsea players celebrate at Stamford Bridge, on Sunday. (AP)                                 
	Chelsea have won the Premier League trophy for the third time in six seasons after thrashing Wigan 8-0. The Premier Leagues final day turned into a procession with Nicolas Anelka putting Chelsea in the lead after five minutes against Wigan.         
	And though Manchester United comfortably defeated Stoke City 4-0, they were left to rue what might have been. Indeed the only real fireworks at Old Trafford occurred before the kick-off when anti-Glazer protestors let off a smoke bomb outside the club shop.         
	Chelsea have scored 103 goals in their 38 games  a Premier League record, while they have now scored 25 goals in their last five home games. They became the first side to pass the century mark in the top flight since Tottenham Hotspur in 1963.         
	Arsenal secured third place thanks to a 4-0 victory against Fulham, who rested several senior players ahead of Wednesdays Europa League final against Atletico Madrid.         
	Tottenhams season finished on a low note when they were beaten 4-2 at Burnley despite taking a 2-0 lead. Burnley were relegated along with Hull City and Portsmouth.         
	Wigan actually began brightly at Stamford Bridge, but Chelseas nerves were settled when Anelka volleyed past Mike Pollitt to put them ahead.         
	And the game was put to bed when Frank Lampard scored the second goal from penalty spot after being pulled down by Gary Caldwell, who was sent off.         
	Anelka and Saloman Kalou stretched the lead after the break, while Didier Drogba added three late goals to win the golden boot ahead of Wayne Rooney. Ashley Cole, too, had time to sneak one in as Chelsea finished the race in flamboyant fashion.         
	Rooney failed to score in the 4-0 win against Stoke, with the goals coming from Darren Fletcher, Ryan Giggs, Park Ji-sung and a Danny Higginbottom own goal.         
	Chelsea, who prevented United winning a record 19th league title and a fourth in succession, can complete the double in next weeks FA Cup final against Portsmouth.         
	Its been a hard three years watching United win the titles year after year, Chelsea skipper John Terry said before being presented with the Premier League trophy for the first time since Jose Mourinho was coach in 2006.         
	Its their turn to watch us today. Now (that) weve got it back, we want to do what they did. Its been an up and down year but this is what weve worked for.         
	It marked a fantastic start in English football for Ancelotti after 33 years playing and coaching in Italy.         
	The only blot on a day of celebrations was a show of petulance from Drogba when he barely celebrated Lampards penalty which put the Blues 2-0 up, the Ivory Coast striker clearly upset that he had not been allowed the chance to go clear in the race for the Golden Boot.         
	Any doubts that Chelsea would fluff their lines were wiped out in the opening half-hour.         
	Anelka gave them a sixth-minute lead when he pounced on Florent Maloudas chested pass and Lampards spot kick made it 2-0. Kalou made it 3-0 early in the second half and the rest of the game was purely about whether Chelsea would break the 100-mark and Drogba would beat Rooney to the Golden Boot.         
	Anelka rattled in a fourth before Drogba got in on the act with a header, a penalty and a tap-in and Cole completed the rout. All that was left to do was spray the champagne.         
	It was all a bit flat at Old Trafford where United did what they had to do  although the sight of Rooney limping off with a groin injury marred the victory. United manager Alex Ferguson, however, allayed any fears. Rooney has aggravated his groin again, I dont think its serious  he should be OK for England, the Scot said.

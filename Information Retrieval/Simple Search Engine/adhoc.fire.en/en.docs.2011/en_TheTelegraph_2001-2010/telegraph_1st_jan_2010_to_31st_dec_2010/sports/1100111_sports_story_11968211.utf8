            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: The final of the Chennai Open on Sunday was the toughest match of his career, said Marin Cilic.         
	The Croatian, who won the fourth ATP title of his career and was richer by $68,450, said the weather in Chennai was the biggest problem.         
	It was the longest final I had played, said Cilic. The condition out there was very humid. It wasnt easy to play for nearly three hours. At times the ball was spinning.         
	Its winter here, I was told. I tried to imagine what it would be in summer here. But then, I am very proud to win it again in Chennai. Next year I would love to come back for a hattrick, said the AC Milan fan.         
	Asked what made the difference between him and Wawrinka, the world No. 14 said: The mental toughness.         
	He (Wawrinka) played well in the first few points but after that he wasnt as good. The match turned more physical after that. He could not keep it up, commented Cilic.         
	Wawrinka, who earned $35,980 for his runners-up finish, said it was a close match. It was great tennis and was decided in tie-breaker. I wasnt good in that, he said.         
	Asked why he lost so many finals in his career (six out of seven finals), Wawrinka said he always succumbed to top players. I was not bad at all. I am happy with my game. The experience here is definitely going to help me, he said.

            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A Telegraph Exclusive            V.V.S. Laxman                           
	Durban: V.V.S. Laxman was listening to shlokas when The Telegraph met him in his room at the Southern Sun Elangeni, on Thursday.         
	Laxman, the MoM in the second Test, had completed his puja, a give away being the chandan tilak on his forehead.         
	Incidentally, as the hotel bed could aggravate his back, Laxman has been sleeping on the floor with a double mattress.         
	Just reinforces that the champion batsman is a down-to-earth type!               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q An entire scheduled day of cricket off is a luxury. Did you wake up feeling any different?         
	A (Laughs) Definitely woke up feeling great... The Test is now history, but Ill remember the role I played in our win. Theres nothing like contributing to a winning cause.         
	When did the significance of your effort really sink in?         
	This morning... More than what I did, Im happy that the team put in such a fine show... The bowlers, in particular, were outstanding.         
	Thanks to your Kingsmead performance, youve made it to the top-10 of the ICC rankings for the first time. Are you conscious about rankings and records?         
	I dont follow the rankings, nor am I a big one for statistics... If you work hard, then I suppose that gets reflected in the rankings.         
	You totalled a mere 15 in the first Test (Centurion). What did you do in Johannesburg in the days following the massive defeat?         
	Worked at nets and faced quite a lot of Zaheer Khans bowling... He hadnt played in Centurion, so he wanted to get into rhythm. That helped me too.         
	Technically...         
	Well, I did work out what had gone wrong in Centurion and realised that I needed to work on my head-position. I did so.         
	What about the mental aspect?         
	Its important to look at what went right and what didnt go right... Yes, one needs to prepare mentally and one has to be positive. Self-belief is also a factor.         
	Dale Steyn appears to have a psychological hold over most of our batsmen. Did you study him at length before coming to South Africa?         
	Absolutely... Batsmen study bowlers and bowlers study batsmen... Its a part of the preparations... Steyn has pace, generates bounce and gets it to swing. Facing him and Morne Morkel is a challenge and its very satisfying that I delivered in conditions which suited them.         
	How does one counter the quicks?         
	The thought process comes into play in a big way... Because you have little time to react, its important for the mind to be free, for there to be no distractions... There will be problems if the mind is cluttered.         
	In recent years, weve won at the Wanderers, at the WACA, at Kingsmead... Havent we shown that were capable of winning even on the most lively tracks?         
	Of course... I think this started with our superb win at Headingley (under Sourav Ganguly), in 2002...         
	Well, how do you look back on 2010?         
	Plenty of satisfaction... In a competitive environment, weve held on to our No.1 ranking. Its no small achievement... Thrice this year, weve come back from defeats and, in the process, shown a lot of character. Dont forget that weve been working hard and preparing well. That has been rewarded.         
	The No.1 challenge...         
	To be consistent, no matter how trying the conditions... For the team, the No.1 challenge is to win in Cape Town and do a first  beat South Africa in South Africa... Not many of us will tour here again and, so, it would be wonderful to create history.         
	Fine, whats needed?         
	A positive mindset... We must carry this confidence forward and play to our potential.         
	Was there a team dinner on Wednesday?         
	Not a team dinner, really, but around 10 of us went to an Italian restaurant... The big celebration, hopefully, will be in Cape Town!         
	The last one... Wife Sailaja appears to be wearing many hats, including that of a motivator...         
	(Laughs) Its tough being a cricketers wife, for were on the road for so many months in a year... The children have to be brought up almost entirely by the wife... Its really tough on them... Sailaja keeps lifting my confidence and my conversations with her after Centurion helped in my taking to the second Test in a good frame of mind. Thats why Ive dedicated the MoM award to her... As sport has its ups and downs, its important for well-wishers to pump up your morale... Id been a little low after the first Test, but my wife ensured that I quickly got out of that frame of mind.

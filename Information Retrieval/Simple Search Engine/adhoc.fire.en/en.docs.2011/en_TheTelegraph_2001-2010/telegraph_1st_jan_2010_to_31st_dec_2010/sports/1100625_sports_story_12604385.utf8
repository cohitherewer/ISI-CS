The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Great spell by Nehra, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Great spell by Nehra, says Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni praised Ashish Nehra for producing a great spell of fast bowling when it mattered the most. The captain also added that dismissing a dangerous player like Tillekaratne Dilshan out early helped their cause.         
	He didnt forget to thank his bowlers for giving him an opportunity to affect five dismissals. His opposite number Kumar Sangakkara said that losing early wickets in the first 15 overs made things difficult for them.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Dhoni: The guys were putting in a lot of effort  both on their fitness and their skills. The result only reflects their hard work. Its good to win the Asia Cup after such a long time. We basically wanted to get (Tillekaratne) Dilshan out early because he is one player who can take away the match from you if he stays longer at the crease. So it was good to get him early. Then Ashish Nehra produced one of the best spells of fast bowling under the conditions. You have to raise your levels in the finals because what you do before that doesnt matter. I was just expecting the wicket to do a bit I know my bowlers and they can do the trick with a little help from the conditions. Also I must thank my bowlers for providing me with the opportunity to affect five dismissals. I would want more of them! The Sri Lankans have a good side  the right mix of youth and experience. We looking forward to an exciting Test series against them.         
	Sangakkara: What made the difference were the first 15 overs. The way we bowled in the first 15 overs and the way the Indians did during the same period. And of course, losing four wickets is not a great way to start. But the target was achieveable. The wicket was fresh and the conditions tended to help the bowlers a bit. However we needed more application and should have been tighter on the ground. We played well all through and were the best team coming into the final. The final is a one-off affair. They had some great partnerships and that too made the difference. The Indian bowlers bowled well and pitched it in the right areas. We are quite disappointed not to win in front of our home crowd. We are looking forward to the Test series against India...         
	Dinesh Karthik (MoM): Were very happy. Its great feeling to win the Asia Cup after 15 years. I had no idea that I would be joining the squad here (in Sri Lanka) and was in Kuwait. Gambhir gave us a great start and I just thought that I should continue for as long as possible. But I got out to a pretty easy delivery. In the end, we played better than them and handled things really well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Poulter has last laugh
                                                                                                                       7                                        Poulter has last laugh
                  Ian Poulter of England, after winning the Match Play Championship, on Sunday                     
	Marana: Ian Poulter broke his American duck when he outplayed fellow Briton Paul Casey 4 amp;2 to win the Accenture Match Play Championship at Dove Mountain on Sunday.         
	To finally win over here, it means everything, Poulter told reporters. Im just so happy to finally win on American soil.         
	I was very comfortable on the course. I felt in control of my game all week. I dont know if there was any given point where it was going to be my week (but) I just felt very calm.         
	The win gave Poulter a $1.4 million winners cheque and propelled him to fifth in the world rankings, but the Briton said he would have to hold off on the celebrations.         
	Poulter, who collected his 10th European Tour win with the victory, was quoted in media reports a couple of years ago saying he felt he could challenge Tiger Woods for the top ranking, were he to fulfil his potential.         
	I didnt quite say it was just me and Tiger (but) I just felt that if I could deliver what I believed I could, then I could put myself in a good situation and Ive certainly done that over the last 18 months and Ive certainly been able to deliver on that today.         
	Poulter dominated most of the 36-hole final, trailing for only one hole early before taking the lead for good at the seventh. He was two-up after 18 holes and never led by less during the second round.         
	Ian played great stuff, Casey told reporters. Youre probably going to write Casey played rubbish but you have to realise Ian played excellent golf. I think he kept it in play on every single hole around here, and made a lot of clutch putts. Hes putting very, very well.         
	Poulter, 34, has employed science to hone his putting, using a new system that charts the exact break on the greens.         
	I dont know if I want to give the secret away but Ive done a lot of homework on the greens this week, he said.         
	The Englishman also caught a lucky break when Caseys semi-final against Camilo Villegas stretched into Sunday morning after the two were deadlocked after five extra holes late on Saturday.         
	Though Casey needed only one more hole to despatch Villegas on Sunday, he appeared drained and made a scrappy start to the final.         
	I was just amazed they were on the course three hours after Id finished, said Poulter. That might be one of the factors why Ive come through the way I have.         
	Added Casey: I feel mentally tired but Im not going to make excuses. There were a lot of shots I wanted to pull off and didnt. (Reuters)

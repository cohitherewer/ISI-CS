The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra rally to beat Sporting
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mahindra rally to beat Sporting
                      
	Mumbai: Mahindra United scored two goals in the dying moments as the hosts defeated Sporting Clube de Goa 2-1 in a ninth round match of the I-League at the Cooperage ground, here on Monday.         
	The Sporting Clube de Goa surged ahead through skipper Junior in the 44th minute and did well to hang on to their lead until substitute Thoi Singh equalised for the hosts in the 88th minute and Paresh Shivalkar scored the winner three minutes later.         
	With this win, Mahindra moved to tied third place along with Goan giants Churchill Brothers in the points table. Both have 17 points from nine matches each. However, the Mumbai team enjoys a better goal difference.         
	The visitors started well and created numerous chances. Junior had an opportunity to put them ahead but his attempt off a pass from Nathaniel Amos was blocked well by Mahindra goalkeeper Subhashish Roy Chowdhury.         
	Soon after, Amos did well to beat defenders D Ravannan and Kali Alaudeen, but failed to find the target.         
	However, a defensive lapse by Ravanan just before the half time allowed Junior to put his team ahead.         
	Unable to find the equaliser, Mahindra brought in Mohaamed Rafi for Subair Murithala Ali, Lamine Tamba for Svetozar Mijin and Thoi Singh for Denzil Franco.         
	Thoi made an impact almost immediately heading in a Steven Dias delivery from the right. Then, Shivalkar tapped in a Dias corner to earn a dramatic victory for Mahindra. (PTI)

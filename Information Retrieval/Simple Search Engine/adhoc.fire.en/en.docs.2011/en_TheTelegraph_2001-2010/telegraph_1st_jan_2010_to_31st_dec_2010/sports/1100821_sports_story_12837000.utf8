The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kenyon key to Huang bid
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kenyon key to Huang bid

	Former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon has emerged as a key player in Kenneth Huangs proposed takeover of Liverpool, it was reported on Thursday night. Kenyon, who was in charge at Chelsea at the height of the clubs rivalry with Liverpool, is understood to have been in talks with Anfield chairman Martin Broughton on behalf of Huangs QSL Sports bid.         
	It was reported, on Thursday, that Kenyon, now a director at the US-based Creative Artists Agency (CAA), was recruited several months ago because of his experience in English football and to offer insight into the financial situation of American owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett.         
	It is understood that Kenyon will remain involved during negotiations but would not take a seat on the club board if Huang wins control. If confirmed, the revelation of Kenyons involvement may offer the Huang bid credibility. But it could be controversial among supporters given the animosity between Liverpool and his former clubs.         
	Kenyon was chief executive at Old Trafford from 2000 to 2003, and at Chelsea until last year, overseeing the clubs rise under Jose Mourinho that saw a bitter Champions League rivalry develop with Liverpool.

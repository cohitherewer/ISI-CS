The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Diego is keen on Villa job
                                                                                                                       7                                      Diego is keen on Villa job
            [+uc('Peter Lansley amp; Patrick Barclay   The Times, London')+]                      
	Diego Maradona has told Aston Villa that he is the man to succeed Martin Neill.         
	As Randy Lerner lambasted Manchester City for the manner of their pursuit of James Milner, the Villa chairman was offered the opportunity to invite the Argentina legend to become his next manager.         
	Maradona left his post in charge of Argentina after their 4-0 defeat by Germany in the World Cup quarter-finals and Walter Soriano, his official European representative, claimed the controversial figure would welcome an approach.         
	I think Diego would be very open to the idea of coming to England and managing Aston Villa, Soriano said. He is very attracted to English football and the way of life in your country and I know he would be very willing to move there. He loves the countryside and your respect for privacy, so he would be very happy there, especially at a big club like Aston Villa. If the owner Randy Lerner wants to make him a serious offer, I am sure he would get a positive response.         
	Lerner is unlikely to give Maradonas offer serious consideration at this stage, as he prepares to provide Kevin MacDonald, the caretaker manager, every opportunity to stake his claim after a convincing 3-0 victory over West Ham United on Saturday.         
	Neill left Villa last Monday after falling out with the board over what funding would be available from the imminent sale of Milner to City.         
	Lerner has made it clear that he wants a manager, who can coach, and has intimated that big egos need not apply. There are those managers who like the show and the attention, and then there are those such as Kevin, he said. If handling Neills personality was becoming an issue for Villa, then Maradona seems an unlikely heir apparent.         
	Milner should complete his 26 million move to the City of Manchester Stadium this week before the teams start their respective Europa League campaigns, once Stephen Ireland, rated at  8million as he moves in the opposite direction as part of the deal, has agreed his payoff from City.         
	But Lerner remains incensed at the manner in which City have conducted their business. Big bad Manchester City came along and asked for Milner and we said, No, he is not for sale, Lerner said.         
	And under the rules you have to respect that. Manchester City respected that for two whole days. And then they violated the rules and came in for him again.         
	Harry Redknapp also believes City are too bullish. After their goalless draw at White Hart Lane on Saturday, the Tottenham Hotspur manager predicted that Roberto Mancinis team will not win the league this season and may even miss out on the top four.

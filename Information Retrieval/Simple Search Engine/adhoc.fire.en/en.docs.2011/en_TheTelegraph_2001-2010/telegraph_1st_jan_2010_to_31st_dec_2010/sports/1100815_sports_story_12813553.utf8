The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Razzaq is keen   on Tests 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Razzaq is keen   on Tests 
                            
	Karachi: Pakistans veteran all-rounder Abdul Razzaq has not given up hope of playing Test cricket for the national team despite being overlooked for the ongoing tour of England.         
	Razzaq said he still had hopes of making it into the Test team once again.         
	Razzaq, who is playing for Hampshire in the Friends Provident Twenty20, said he would have been a worthy addition to Pakistans Test squad in England because of his experience and performances.         
	Razzaq said that he wanted to get rid of the tag of being a limited-overs player.         
	Razzaq, who has not played a Test since 2006, said that he could have contributed a lot to the team in the seamer friendly conditions in England.         
	In England, I would have been effective, especially given the nature of the wickets at both Nottingham and Birmingham, he said.         
	I dont believe that my Test career is over. I am ready to return to Test cricket whenever I am required. Of course its out of my hands and down to the selectors and those that select the squads, he added.

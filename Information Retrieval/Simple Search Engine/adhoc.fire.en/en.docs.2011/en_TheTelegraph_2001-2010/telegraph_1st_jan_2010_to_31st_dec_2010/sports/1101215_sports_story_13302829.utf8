	Blackburn: Blackburns new owners Venkys intend to hire a British manager to replace Sam Allardyce and want the new in-charge to deliver entertaining football and can bring the club in the top-five of the Premier League.         
	Anuradha Desai, chairman of Venkys, said the decision to sack Allardyce had been in our minds (for) a long time and has a demanding set of targets for the former Bolton and Newcastle managers successor.         
	We want Blackburn to be fourth or fifth in the league or even better, Desai said. The fans should trust us because this is in the best interests of the club.         
	The team is currently in 13th place in the standings.

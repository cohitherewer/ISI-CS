The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shooting meet on schedule
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shooting meet on schedule
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Commonwealth shooting championship, scheduled from February 17 to 28, will be held on time, according to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) secretary general Randhir Singh.         
	Singh, however, wasnt ready to reveal whether it would be the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) or an ad hoc committee that conducts the meet after the Delhi high court Monday refused to stay an order passed by a lower court declaring the composition of the NRAI invalid.         
	I am aware of the situation but it has got nothing to do with the championship, Randhir told The Telegraph on Tuesday. If need be, the championship can be conducted by a special committee in consultation with other agencies.         
	Asked whether the government, too, could form an ad hoc committee to run the show, Randhir said: So far, we havent received any such directive or suggestion from the government.         
	The NRAI, fighting in the court of law against some of its own members over the validity of its elections, found itself in a spot of bother after the lower court said that association president         
	Digvijay Singh and secretary general Baljit Singh Sethi cannot continue in office as they have flouted norms by holding on to their respective posts despite completing two terms.         
	Sethi said there was no threat to the championship. As far as we are concerned, the meet is on. We have the green signal from the international body.         
	An official at the ministry of sports said they were keeping an eye on the developments. If at all that is needed, we are ready to step in to see the championship is conducted smoothly.         
	In another interesting development, the sports ministry Tuesday asked the IOA and the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee (OC) to immediately designate their central public information officers and appellate authorities under the Right to Information (RTI) act.         
	Both organisations have been asked to fulfil various obligations of being a Public Authority as per Section 4 of the Right to Information Act 2005, including maintaining all their records duly catalogued and indexed in a manner so as to facilitate the right to information under this Act, the release said.

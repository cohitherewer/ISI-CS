The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Katich: India tour will help
                                                                                                                       7                                      Katich: India tour will help
                      
	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting might consider it less than ideal but senior batsman Simon Katich feels playing a Test series in India could actually be good preparation for the Ashes.         
	Theres no ideal situation and you have to get used to it as a player, so weve got to adapt as quickly as possible, he said.         
	Were playing Test cricket, so if thats not going to be a good enough preparation for us to play a tough series against England, then I dont know what is, Katich told an Australian news agency.         
	The five-Test Ashes series begins on November 25 in Brisbane and Australia will play two Tests against India in October. Ponting is not too happy with the timing of the India series as he feels playing on the spinning tracks would hamper the teams Ashes preparations.         
	The 34-year-old Katich, however, expressed concerns about Australias frequent batting collapses and said the problem could cost the team dearly during the Ashes.         
	Wickets were lost in quick succession, first at Lords and then The Oval, during last years series won 2-1 by England.         
	The Australians were also out for low scores against West Indies in Perth last year, then against Pakistan in Sydney in January and most recently at Headingley in July.         
	Being brutally honest, its still been a problem because its happened a couple of times since the Ashes last year, Katich said.         
	Until we can actually rectify that in a match, thats going to be still hanging over our heads, and unfortunately you cant replicate it in the nets. As much as you try, its got to happen in test matches when the pressure is on, he added.

	Vadodara: Manoj Tiwary struck an unbeaten 61 and produced a 74-run partnership with Wriddhiman Saha to help Bengal beat Karnataka by four wickets and enter the Vijay Hazare Trophy final here Saturday. Bengal will meet Tamil Nadu in the final on Tuesday.         
	Put into bat, Karnataka managed 230 for nine in the stipulated 50 overs and then came back strongly to overhaul the target with one over to spare.         
	Chasing 231, Bengal were given a blistering start by opener Arindam Das (59 off 62 balls) and Sreevats Goswami (45 off 59 balls), who stitched together 111 runs in 19 overs.         
	Karnatakas Udit Patel tried to stop the run flow, removing both the openers.         
	However, Tiwary soon took control of the match, and even though Bengal kept losing wickets at the other end, he in company of Wriddhiman Saha (36 off 101 balls) helped them reach the target in the 49th over.         
	Earlier, Ashok Dinda (2/50), Laxmi Ratan Shukla (2/52) and Soumya Pakre (2/34) helped Bengal restrict Karnataka at 230 for nine.         
	In Rajkot, Tamil Nadu beat Madhya Pradesh by 134 runs. Opting to bat first, Tamil Nadu scored 348/5. In reply, Madhya Pradesh were bundled out for 214. Tamil Nadu skipper Abhinav Mukund led from the front with a brilliant century which helped his side post a huge total of 348. The Tamil Nadu bowlers Yo Mahesh and R Satish then completed the job by folding up Madhya Pradesh for 214 off 43.1 overs.         
	Tamil Nadu acting skipper Mukund and S Anirduddh built a solid foundation by scoring 177 runs for the opening wicket off 32 overs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A happy experience
                                                                                                                       7                                        A happy experience
  - I was playing well Knew the three-figure knock would come soon: Gambhir       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sreesanth celebrates with teammates after dismissing Jamie How, in Jaipur, on Wednesday. (AP)                                 
	Jaipur: Getting a century in an International outing is always a matter of great pleasure but there cannot be a greater satisfaction than winning the match, said stand-in India captain Gautam Gambhir, on Wednesday.         
	Speaking after a media conference, after winning the second ODI, against New Zealand, to lead the five-match series 2-0, Gambhir also said the 259-run target was quite difficult but an all-round show by the Indians did the trick.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	If he could be touted as the future India captain         
	I have not given a thought to it. All of us know that (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni has been doing a great job and he is the present captain of India. I have been given a job for the series and I am only trying to do it in the best possible manner. I would rather concentrate on my present assignment than thinking what could be in store for me in future.         
	His own batting         
	It was a good total to chase and someone had to play a big innings to win the match. Fortunately, I was the one who did it. The wicket was not easy to bat in the second innings, though the ball was coming on nicely to the bat. You always need a batsman to take the lead and I did it.         
	If he was relieved to get a century, at last         
	I was playing well. So I knew the three-figure knock would come soon. After the Eden Gardens match (against Sri Lanka), I played only nine one-dayers. It is simply not possible to play a big innings every time you pick up the bat. Today (Wednesday) it was a happy experience.         
	Whether the target was easy         
	It was not a small total to chase. On this wicket, I think 258 was a good total But we batted and bowled well to win the match. The idea is now to keep the momentum and win the rest of the matches in the series.         
	On Ashish Nehras performance         
	This is cricket and no one can perform at the same level always That is not possible. Nehra is a good and experienced bowler and I feel he did a fine job. Sreesanth bowled exceptionally well and all the Indian bowlers came up with a fine performance to make the victory possible.         
	R. Ashwins bowling         
	He did a good job in Guwahati and here as well It is a good start for his career. I am sure he would do better in the future.

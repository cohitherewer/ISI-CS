The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ferdinand banned for 4 matches
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ferdinand banned for 4 matches
                      
	London: Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has been given a four-match ban after the Football Association branded his appeal against a violent conduct charge frivolous.         
	Ferdinand had denied the charge relating to an incident with Hull Citys Craig Fagan last Saturday, meaning he was free to play in Uniteds League Cup semi-final second leg on Wednesday.         
	Uniteds decision to appeal the charge means what would have been an automatic three-match ban has been increased to four.         
	The Independent Commission felt that the players claim against the charge was frivolous and on that basis have awarded an additional one-match ban upon the statutory three-match ban awarded for violent conduct, the FA said in a statement.         
	Ferdinand, who had just returned for his first game since October because of a back injury, will miss his sides Premier League match at Arsenal on Sunday as well as games at home to Portsmouth, away to Aston Villa and away to Everton.

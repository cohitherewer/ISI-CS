The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brutal decisions confront Loew
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brutal decisions confront Loew
                                Germany rsquo;s Lukas Podolski vies with a Hungary player, on Saturday      
	Germany coach Joachim Loew admits he faces some brutal decisions in the next few days as he looks to cut two players for his 2010 Fifa World Cup squad in the wake of his sides 3-0 friendly win over Hungary. Germany warmed up for South Africa with a convincing win over the hosts at the Ferenc Puskas Stadium on Saturday with a Lukas Podolski penalty and second-half goals by substitutes Mario Gomez and Brazilian-born Cacau.         
	Loew, according to the Fifa website, will sit down with his coaching team to decide which two players will not be travelling to South Africa with the final 23-man squad set to be announced on Tuesday.         
	There will be lots of speculation in the next few days, said Loew. The coaches will sit down together on Sunday and Monday with the coaching staff and announce the squad on Tuesday. Of course, it will hurt for the players concerned, but, unfortunately, we can only take 23.         
	Germany midfielder Sami Khedira stepped into injured captain Michael Ballacks boots with an impressive performance, making a strong case for inclusion in the final 23.         
	Sami played very well in the first half, coach Joachim Loew, who had to take Khedira off in the second half with a minor muscle problem, said.         
	I liked him. He was also very good in organising the game, Loew added.         
	Khedira, who now looks set to partner Bastian Schweinsteiger in central midfield at the World Cup, was lively in his fourth international appearance, repeatedly slicing open the Hungarian defence at will with quick, accurate passing in the first half.         
	Lukas Podolski fired Germany into an early lead with a powerful penalty and Mario Gomez added another in the 69th minute from close range before substitute Cacau netted his third goal in his last two matches with a fine solo effort in the 72nd minute.         
	The margin of victory could have been much higher were it not for journeyman keeper Gabor Kiraly, who repeatedly denied the Germans with superb saves in the first half.         
	His German counterpart, Manuel Neuer, had little work in his first match after winning the starting spot for the World Cup on Friday.         
	Loew made a string of substitutions in the second half, including bringing on midfielder Marcell Jansen, who has recovered from an ankle injury in record time, as he considers which two players to cut from his preliminary 25-man squad by June 1.         
	Midfielder Marko Marin, Cacau and striker Gomez all impressed and Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber came off the bench to make his debut, in the second-half, but Loew knows two of his players will soon be suffering World Cup heartbreak without even boarding the plane to South Africa.         
	I havent yet got the two players in my head who wont be going, he admitted. The decision will be brutal, not only for the players, but also for the coaches.         
	Germany begin their campaign in Group D on June 13 against Australia and fly to South Africa on June 7 after their final warm-up game against Bosnia-Herzegovina next Thursday. With Germany captain Michael Ballack injured and out of this World Cup, Bayern Munich striker Miroslav Klose took over the skippers armband.         
	Having played in last weekends Champions League final defeat, Bayern Munich stars Schweinsteiger and new captain Philipp Lahm were both rested.         
	Although Germany were rarely troubled by the Hungarians, they are sure to face much tougher tests in Group D against Ghana, Australia and Serbia in South Africa. The Hungarians didnt have many chances, said goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. But on the other hand, it was good that we crated a few goals of our own.

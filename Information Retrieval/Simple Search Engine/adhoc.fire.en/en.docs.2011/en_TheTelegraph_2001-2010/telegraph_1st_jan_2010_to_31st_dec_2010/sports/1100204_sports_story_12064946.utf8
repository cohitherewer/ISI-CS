                                                                                                                       7                                        Wriddhiman: Like a dream come true
  - There would be ways to contribute to the team even without being in the XI         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Wriddhiman Saha                                 
	Nagpur: At different levels, Wriddhiman Saha had rubbed shoulders with some of the very best Indian cricketers. However, it was only on Wednesday afternoon that he sat in the Team India bus for the first time.         
	That was when Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men started the journey, from the Pride Hotel, to the VCA Stadium in Jamtha.         
	In some ways, yes, it was like a dream come true for me... Also, when I began training with teammates... All along, Id just imagined what such sessions would be like. I finally got to experience it, Saha told The Telegraph, on returning to the hotel, in the evening.         
	Asked whether hed either felt nervous or excited on sharing space with the Sachin Tendulkars, Saha replied: Well, it felt special... Having made the squad, I must now make full use of the opportunities that come my way...         
	I dont know when Ill get to play, but Im sure there would be ways to contribute to the team even without being in the XI... For now, Im really looking forward to the next few days...         
	According to the Adam Gilchrist admirer, captain Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten spoke to him generally. Tuk-tak kotha holo, is how Saha put it.         
	What about Sachin?         
	I didnt get to talk to him, but an opportunity is bound to come up sooner rather than later, the 25-year-old pointed out.         
	Saha is in the squad as a cover for Dhoni. The captain, though, is absolutely fit.

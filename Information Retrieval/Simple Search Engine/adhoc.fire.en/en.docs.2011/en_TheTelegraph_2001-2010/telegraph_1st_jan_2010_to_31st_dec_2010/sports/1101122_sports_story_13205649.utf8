The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sodhi snaps gold drought for shooters 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sodhi snaps gold drought for shooters 
                      
	Guangzhou: Shotgun ace Ronjan Sodhi, finally, fetched the gold that had eluded the Indian shooting squad by winning the mens double trap individual event after playing his part in notching the team bronze at the Asian Games here on Sunday.         
	Sodhi trapped gold despite trailing Chinas Pan Qiang by four shots at the end of the qualification stage.         
	The 31-year-old, part of the silver winning squad in the same event four years ago at Doha, shot 186, 10 shots below his joint world record, at the Guangzhou Shotgun Centre.         
	Sodhi scored 139 (47, 44 and 48) and was four shots behind Qiang going into the finals competed by six men. He shot 47 in the final while the host shooter flopped with a 38 for an overall tally of 181.         
	Al Maktoum Shaikh of UAE, who shot 138 in the qualification, also fell behind the Indian when shooting for the gold and could score only 44 for a final tally of 182 that fetched him the silver medal.         
	In the shoot-out for third place among Hamad Ali Al Marri of Qatar, Fehaid Aldehani of Kuwait and Qiang, the Qatari shooter prevailed to win the bronze with 181.         
	This is the first gold from the under-fire shooting squad after it started competing on November 13. It was also the eighth medal hauled in by the marksmen and women who had earlier won three silver and four bronze medals.         
	Later, Sodhi expressed his glee at winning the first shooting gold for India in these Games where they came with high hopes after hauling in 14 gold out of 30 medals in last months Commonwealth Games at Delhi.         
	I am very happy after winning the first gold for India in the shooting competition in the Asian Games though I am not happy with my scores. I am very satisfied that these scores got me the gold, said the shooter who had secured the gold with a superb score of 195 in the World Cup in Lonato, Italy this year.         
	Sodhi, who is the joint holder of the world record score (196), said the medal round was a tension-packed affair and he won despite going in with a huge disadvantage.         
	The final was very, very close. In the final, its a different ball game. People start missing and that happened (today), he said.         
	It was very tough. The Chinese led by four points, but, perhaps, the pressure got to him and he did not shoot well in the final. I had a 48 (in the qualification) which is a very good score on any day, he said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Back injury ends Bolts season
                                                                                                                       7                                      Back injury ends Bolts season
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Usain Bolt, the worlds fastest man but looking far from healthy this season, is to stop running with immediate effect and undergo treatment on a lower back problem which, if allowed to develop untreated, could endanger his career.         
	Bolt has cancelled his remaining races for 2010  notably lucrative forthcoming Diamond League appearances in Zurich and Brussels  to make a hurriedly arranged visit to Dr Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt and his sports injury clinic in Munich.         
	Muller Wohlfahrts scans and examinations revealed a tightness that restricts his ability to generate power in the stride and the condition can also manifest itself in tight hamstring and calf muscles.         
	Earlier in the season, the Olympic and world 100m and 200m champion also suffered a month out with a bad Achilles strain after racing in an unfamiliar 300m race.         
	On his return to action last month, Bolt did manage to beat Asafa Powell in Paris, running a reasonably quick 9.84 secs, but last Friday in Stockholm he laboured horribly in both the 100m heats and the final, when he was convincingly defeated by Tyson Gay, only just ducking under ten seconds in 9.97.         
	It wasnt just the defeat  his first in 14 100m races over two years  against an admittedly world-class opponent that set the alarm bells ringing, it was the dead nature of Bolts running.         
	I am very disappointed to miss two of the top meetings on the circuit but trust that it is better for me not to take any risks this year, said Bolt after hearing the diagnosis.         
	2011 and 2012 are very important championship years and I hope to be back fully fit and healthy. I would like to thank everyone for their support and look forward to coming back stronger next year.

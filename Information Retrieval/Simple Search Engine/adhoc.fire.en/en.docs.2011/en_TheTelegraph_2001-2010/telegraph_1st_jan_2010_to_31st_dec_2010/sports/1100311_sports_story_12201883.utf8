                                                                                                                       7                                      Were spoilt for choice: Kumar
                      
	Mohali: Injury worries before their opener against the Delhi DareDevils, in the third edition of the Indian Premier League, on Saturday, notwithstanding, the Kings XI Punjab captain Kumar Sangakkara Wednesday said his side had a great mix of international and domestic players and was spoilt for choice.         
	I would not like to lie by saying absolutely not ... But the choice is wonderful this season as we have a great mix of international and domestic players. We are spoilt for choice, the Sri Lankan told reporters here when asked if his team was dogged by injury worries.         
	The IPL team Wednesday unveiled their attractive fan club  the KXIP Lions Den and animation films of their mascots, Rocky and Ranjit  to their fans. Team chairperson and promoter Preity Zinta, promoter Ness Wadia, former skipper Yuvraj Singh and Brett Lee were also present.         
	Yuvraj, who is recovering from a wrist injury, said he cant say at the moment whether he would be playing the opening tie. It is also not certain whether Australian pacer Lee will play the opening game.         
	Sangakkara said that Shaun Marsh, who had a great outing in the first IPL, particularly in Mohali, James Hopes and Simon Katich are expected to join the team on March 20.         
	He also said that the injured Jerome Taylor would not be able to join the team. Coach Tom Moody is currently busy with the Western Australian team and would arrive in Bangalore on March 15.         
	Our psyche is always attuned to do the best and win. Preparations this year have been very thorough. Scouting for domestic talent has also yielded fruitful results. The coaching staff is of the highest quality. We are also looking forward to some great performances from the domestic players in our team, said Sangakkara.         
	Reetinder Singh Sodhi, Love Ablish, Vipul Sharma and Manvinder Bisla are some of the new domestic players this year for the Kings XI while Mohammed Kaif would also add strength to the batting line-up. Teenaged Adrian Barath of the West Indies is also capable of contributing handsomely.         
	Zinta said that the Kings XI have joined hands with the UNAIDS for creating awareness about HIV/AIDS.           (PTI)

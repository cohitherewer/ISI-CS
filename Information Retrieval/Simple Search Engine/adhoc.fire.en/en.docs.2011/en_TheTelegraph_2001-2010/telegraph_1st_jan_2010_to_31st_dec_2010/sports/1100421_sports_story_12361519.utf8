The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Depleted, but Bagan eye strong show
                                                                                                                       7                                        Depleted, but Bagan eye strong show
            A STAFF REPORTER            Jose Ramirez Barreto                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya has more than one worry ahead of Wednesdays I-League encounter against Mahindra United at the Salt Lake Stadium. Bhattacharya, whose team got back to winning ways in the I-League with a 4-0 thrashing of Mumbai FC last week, has a locker room plagued by injury and health problems that could seriously affect their campaign against the Red Devils from Mumbai.         
	The first and foremost is star striker Edeh Chidi who has an upset stomach. Although Chidis hasnt really been in the best of forms, his mere presence means a lot to the team. The Nigerian adds the required thrust upfront which allows Jose Ramirez Barreto to operate freely as the opposition teams scramble to contain the dreaded Chidi.         
	We will take a call tomorrow (Wednesday) morning. Chidi has to say he feels okay and is ready to play, then only will I field him. Still we will fight and try to win, coach Bhattacharya said.         
	When asked about Chidis replacement, the coach answered: We have two specialist strikers who can partner Barreto. Branco Cardozo and Suraj Mondal. As of now, Branco may get a start tomorrow, he said.         
	Rakesh Masih is another player whom Bagan will miss on Wednesday. Masih, who missed the Mumbai FC match with a double booking, is running a high temperature and is virtually ruled out for Wednesdays match.         
	Thats not all: left-winger Ishfaq Ahmed has pulled a hamstring while Manish Mathani and Marcos Perreira both have minor ankle niggles. However, Bhattacharya is sure both Mathani and Marcos will be fit and available.         
	There, however, was some good news for Bagan as Mahindra hitman Subair Muritala Ali looks to be a doubtful starter with a hamstring problem. Muritalas absence was felt in the last match against Lajong FC which Mahindra lost 0-1.         
	Since Dempo (41 points from 21 matches) have opened a four-point lead over Mahindra (37 points from 21 matches) at the top, it is a must-win game for the Mumbai outfit.

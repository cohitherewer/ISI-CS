The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ivanovic begins with a victory
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ivanovic begins with a victory
                      
	Cincinnati: Former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic showed flashes of the form that took her to the pinnacle of tennis as she upset ninth seed Victoria Azarenka 2-6, 7-6, 6-2 in the first round of the Cincinnati Masters on Monday.         
	The Serb who was a first-round casualty at San Diego last week, had appeared set for another early exit before rallying to beat the in-form Belarusian, who won the Stanford Classic earlier this month.         
	The 2008 French Open champion Ivanovic briefly held the worlds top ranking that year, but a subsequent collapse in form and a series of niggling injuries have seen her ranking slip to 62nd. The Serb was joined in the second round by another fallen former top-ranked player in Russias Dinara Safina, who eased to a 7-5, 6-4 win over Italys Roberta Vinci.         
	Israeli Shahar Peer advanced after Olga Govortsova of Belarus retired when trailing 6-3, 4-1, while Frances Marion Bartoli thrashed Spains Anabel Medina Garrigues 6-4, 6-0.         
	Bartolis compatriot Aravane Rezai was not so fortunate, however, being dumped out by Serb qualifier Bojana Jovanovski 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. (Reuters)

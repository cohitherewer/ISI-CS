	Dhaka: Jonathan Trott made a patient half-century to help England recover from two quick blows and reach 171 for three in reply to Bangladeshs 419 on the second day of the second Test on Sunday.         
	Trott faced 187 balls for his unbeaten 64 and will resume with Ian Bell (25 not out) on the third day with England still trailing the hosts by 248 runs on first innings.         
	The added 64 runs after Bangladesh made two massive breakthroughs in successive overs by removing Kevin Pietersen and Paul Collingwood.         
	Pietersen (45) was undone by a short quick delivery from Shakib al Hasan which he spooned to Imrul Kayes at short cover. Rubel Hossain had Collingwood lbw for a duck in the next over with a hint of reverse swing to leave England stuttering at 107 for three.

	Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik has requested the media to stop hyping his marriage with Sania Mirza and allow them to live a normal life.         
	Shoaib and Sania appeared together for the first time on a Pakistani channel Tuesday, and Shoaib said he was fed up with the hype over his marriage. I am pleased to know that people are happy with our marriage, but I think now it is time to stop this hype and let us live like a normal couple. I would request the media to leave alone both families, he said.         
	Malik said since returning to the country, he had spent most of the time being his wifes personal bodyguard rather than the husband.         
	Two people from different countries got married and it should only be treated as a marriage, nothing more, Malik said on TV. I would ask the media to get rid of the hype and let our families enjoy this occasion as any other family does. Because of all this hype, I couldnt even meet my friends and relatives properly in the reception in Sialkot. It was a mad rush.         
	Sania said she was surprised at all the media hype about their marriage.           (PTI)

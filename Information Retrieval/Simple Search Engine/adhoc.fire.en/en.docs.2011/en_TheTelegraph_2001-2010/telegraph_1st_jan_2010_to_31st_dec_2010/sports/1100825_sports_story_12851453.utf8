            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian football teams much awaited international friendlies which was scheduled in the capital seems to have run into troubled waters with chief coach Bob Houghton expressing his unwillingness to play at least three of the five encounters.         
	Currently camping in Portugal, the Indian were scheduled to play five matches at the Ambedkar Stadium against Thailand, North Korea, Namibia, Gambia and Turkmenistan between September 8 to 25.         
	According to AIFF sources, Houghton has informed the federation that he is ready to play against North Korea and Thailand but not against the other three nations.         
	Houghton has definitely put the federation in a spot of bother, a source informed. The matches were arranged only after the chief coach said India should play against higher ranked sides as a run-up to the preparation for the Asia Cup. Now the coach has other ideas, the AIFF is at a loss to find an alternative, he added.         
	According to sources, Houghton has indicated to the senior officials that he doesnt approve the idea of playing against African teams at the moment.         
	Instead, the national coach has advised the federation to arrange preparatory camp in one of the west Asian countries, where the team would be able to play friendly matches against local club sides.

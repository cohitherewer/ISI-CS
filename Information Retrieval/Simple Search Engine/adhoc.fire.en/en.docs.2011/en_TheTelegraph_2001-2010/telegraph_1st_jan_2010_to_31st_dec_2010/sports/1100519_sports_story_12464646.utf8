The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modi gets more time, again
                                                                                                                       7                                      Modi gets more time, again
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Indian cricket Board has given Lalit Modi 10 more days to reply to the showcause notice issued to him on the basis of allegations made by England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Giles Clarke.         
	He (Modi) had asked for some more time, and he has been given an extension, a BCCI source told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Modis lawyer Mehmood Abdi confirmed in a text message that the deadline for filing the reply, which was earlier set for May 21, has been shifted to May 31.         
	Board secretary N. Srinivasan issued the notice to Modi on May 6 after receiving an e-mail from Clarke who alleged that the suspended IPL chairman and commissioner was involved in activities detrimental to world cricket.         
	Clarke had alleged in his e-mail that Modi, along with some IMG officials, met members of three English Counties in New Delhi on March 31 and discussed plans to have a parallel IPL-style T20 tournament in the UK after bypassing the ECB.         
	On Monday, BCCI president Shashank Manohar, Srinivasan, IPL interim chairman Chirayu Amin and vice-chairman Niranjan Shah met IMG, UK, senior vice-president Andrew Wildblood and their legal counsels Paul Manning and John Laffhagen.

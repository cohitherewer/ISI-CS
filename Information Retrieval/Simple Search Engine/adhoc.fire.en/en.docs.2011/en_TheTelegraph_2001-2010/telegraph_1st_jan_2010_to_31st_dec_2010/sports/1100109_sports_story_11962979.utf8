The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dilshan set to play vs India
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dilshan set to play vs India
                      
	Dhaka: In-form opener Tillekaratne Dilshan is almost certain to play Sundays final league match against India, Sri Lanka team manager Brendon Kuruppu said Friday.         
	Talking to reporters after the Lankans nine-wicket victory over Bangladesh, Kuruppu said Dilshan had almost recovered from his groin injury.         
	We could have even considered playing him today (against Bangladesh) but we held him back. He has a very good chance of playing against India, Kuruppu said.         
	Dilshan suffered a groin strain during his match-winning knock of 104 in the tournament opener against Bangladesh on January 4.         
	Talking at the post-match media conference, senior batsman Mahela Jayawardene, who was drafted into the team as injury reinforcement, said his side were disappointed to lose the ODI series against India last month.         
	We were disappointed to lose the ODI series as we played very good cricket there, Jayawardene said. Both teams have played a lot recently and probably knew each other inside out. I am looking forward to the match on Sunday. (PTI)

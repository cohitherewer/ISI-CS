The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Have to keep on improving: Messi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Have to keep on improving: Messi
                      
	Barcelona: Barcelona awoke on Wednesday revelling in the genius of Lionel Messi, who vowed to keep improving after a stunning performance on the European stage.         
	Messi single-handedly put the defending champions into the Champions League semi-finals after scoring all of his teams goals in a 4-1 victory.         
	Im very happy. The same as the other day when I scored three (goals). Its always nice to score, especially in important matches, said Messi.         
	I have to keep on improving. Im lucky enough to be with a group of players that care about me a lot and say nice things about me.         
	The Netherlands and Barcelona great Johan Cruyff believes Messi is the worlds best player.         
	He has the capacity to do the difficult things without suffering, without distress ... if you suffer, you cant be the best in anything, Cruyff wrote in his regular column for a Spanish newspaper. Leo floats over the field  sometimes you have the sensation hes not even there, that hes hiding. But hes there and the rival knows it.         
	Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola said the secret to Messi is his humility.         
	The good thing about Messi is that tomorrow he will get up and look for the affection of his people and his teammates, Guardiola said. (agencies)

                                                                                                                       7                                      BCCI: 2011 Cup wont be shifted
            OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), on Monday, reiterated that the 2011 World Cup would be held in the subcontinent.         
	A report in the New Zealand media quoted Justin Vaughan, chief executive of New Zealand Cricket (NZC), as saying his country and trans-Tasman neighbour Australia would be the ideal alternative hosts in case the World Cup is shifted from the subcontinent.         
	I dont know what he (Vaughan) had said and why he said it. I dont want to comment on it. As far as the BCCI is concerned, the World Cup is in India. Who can cancel it? Nobody can, BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan told The Telegraph.         
	Vaughan was quoted by a website as saying: You cannot change the timing of the tournament (the World Cup) from March-April. So really, theres only Australia-New Zealand, and South Africa, who could host it.         
	Obviously, players need to be safe, but we cannot run away when a threat is made. By tightening the security measures around the teams we somehow have to make it safe otherwise the sport will struggle to survive if we cannot find a solution.         
	Weve got to find a way to make this work because Asia is the heartbeat of cricket in the present day.         
	In the same report, however, Vaughan went on to emphasise Indias position as the financial powerhouse of world cricket.         
	India is so important and you cannot envisage a scenario when you cannot tour India  its not worth thinking about, the NZC chief reportedly said.         
	The hosts security plans are vital. Id go anywhere in the world if there was the right security plan. Id go to Iraq if the right security was in place.         
	However, Vaughan also said that New Zealand would tour India as scheduled at the end of the year.         
	Haroon Lorgat, the ICC chief executive, assured that major cricket nations would work in unison to ensure the World Cup did not fall prey to terrorism. The World Cup is the big piece of work that we have to deliver, and we intend to do so, Lorgat told a London newspaper.         
	The whole issue of security is dynamic, but we will assess it very carefully and implement whatever measures are necessary to ensure safety and security. I do not share the same concerns for India as Pakistan.         
	We have established a quality network of security managers at each of the full member boards and through that we can develop a far better co-ordinated approach to safety and security.         
	Security fears regarding the upcoming IPL have intensified after the Al-Qaedas operational arm in Pakistan, issued a threat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Russians no match for Paes, Bhupathi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Russians no match for Paes, Bhupathi
  - Davis cup Somdev has nothing to lose against Youzhny: Misra                                           Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes in action,   in Moscow, on Saturday         
	Moscow: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi showed their class and chemistry by recording a clinical win over Igor Kunitsyn and Teimuraz Gabashvili to keep Indias chances alive in the Davis Cup World Group tie against Russia here Saturday.         
	The duo literally toyed with the Russian combination in their 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory in the doubles rubber and reduced the margin to 1-2.         
	India needed a win to keep themselves in the hunt but a tough day awaits them as the reverse singles will be played Sunday. The visitors had conceded a 2-0 lead Friday after Somdev Dev Varman and Rohan Bopanna lost their respective ties.         
	It will be a difficult task for the two youngsters to pull it off for India in the reverse singles. Somdev will play against world No. 13 Mikhail Youzhny and Bopanna will face Kunitsyn.         
	Paes and Bhupathi, both ranked in the top-10 of ATP doubles ranking chart, hardly had any trouble in registering their 23rd consecutive win in the Davis Cup as they were too hot to handle for the hosts.         
	Bhupathis strong serve and Paes immaculate play at the net was a treat for the audience. They got the win for the loss of just seven games and faced only one breakpoint in the whole match.         
	Initially the Russians strategised to attack Paes serve but the Indian combination had weapons to negate any tactics.         
	A volley winner each by Paes and Bhupathi handed them their first breakpoints. They did not waste any time and utilised those to lead in the fourth game of the first set.         
	There was no looking back after that and the Indians easily pocketed the set when Gabashivili failed to return a Paes volley. Gabashvili served well and played more aggressively but could not do much against the rampaging Indian pair.         
	The Indians raced away to a 4-0 lead in the second set with a double break.         
	They were down a breakpoint in the sixth game following a few unforced errors but Paes captivating play at the net spoiled Russias chance. The third set was no different as it too started with a break for India and Paes and Bhupathi wrapped it up in no time.         
	Meanwhile, non-playing captain SP Misra asked Somdev to go all out in Sundays reverse singles. Somdevs match is very critical for us. Youzhny is a higher ranked player but reputations wont count if Somdev plays well. He has nothing to lose and can go all out, Misra said.

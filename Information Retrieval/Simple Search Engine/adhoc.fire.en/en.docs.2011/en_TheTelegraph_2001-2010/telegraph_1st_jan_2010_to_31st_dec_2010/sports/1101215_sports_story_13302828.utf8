The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sir Alex shocked by Wayne miss

            THOM GIBBS                      
	Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has expressed shock about Wayne Rooneys missed penalty against Arsenal. Rooney attempted to out-fox Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczensy with an unconventional curled run-up, but his shot from 18 yards ended seveal feet over the bar.         
	It was an unusual penalty, normally Wayne always keeps them down, Ive never known him to hit one over, Ferguson said. That gave Arsenal a bit of impetus but we defended very well, the back four were fantastic tonight, absolutely magnificent, he added.         
	Park Ji-sungs solitary first half goal extended Uniteds unbeaten start to the season to 16 matches and left them two points clear of Arsenal and Manchester City, with a game in hand.         
	After scoring seven on their last league outing against Blackburn, Fergusons side showed a different side to their character, turning in a superb defensive performance to restrict the visitors to just a single chance. You always worry at 1-0, it only takes a second to lose one, he added. But I thought our back four were fantastic. If my back four keep that foundation of not conceding any goals it gives us a really good chance.         
	We had to play well tonight, but we have been playing well. The first half was excellent and we should have done better on the counter-attack in the second.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A stern message for CA
                                                                                                                       7                                      A stern message for CA
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Mumbai: Unlike the organising committee of the XIX Commonwealth Games, which has had to swallow a volley of insults from foreign entities, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) reacted sharply to Australias misgivings over security in Bangalore, which is to host the second and final Test, from October 9.         
	Mohali stages the series-opener, from Friday. The visitors will also feature in three ODIs.         
	The other day, we made it known to Cricket Australia (CA) that if it didnt have faith in what we were doing, it was free to abandon the tour and that Ricky Ponting and his men could go back home, a very senior BCCI official told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Tuesday evening, the official added: The Australians said they were worried about their players, apparently because of the explosions outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium in April... They forgot that two teams play a cricket match and that wed be equally concerned if anything was amiss...         
	We went to the extent of telling CA that if they did abandon the tour, we wouldnt visit Australia in 2011-12... They got the message and have since fallen in line... Dont forget some of our players are among the biggest cricketers anywhere in the world... Theyre huge icons.         
	Nobody should underestimate the BCCIs ability to organise a series at home at short notice... I dont think well need more than three days to work out an alternative.         
	As for Saturdays shootings in Bangalore, the official maintained: Criminal acts must not be put on a par with terror strikes... Dont shootings take place across the world? Is this the first time that were hosting a national team? We know what to do... But, yes, if somebody has a suggestion which needs to be acted upon, we will certainly do so...         
	It was much too late to get a comment from CA.

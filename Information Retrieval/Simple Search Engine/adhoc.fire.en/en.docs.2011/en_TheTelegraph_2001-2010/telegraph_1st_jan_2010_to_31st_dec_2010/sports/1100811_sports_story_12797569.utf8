The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bounce did us in: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bounce did us in: Dhoni
    - Team India lose No. 2 position after heavy defeat to NZ           A CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Its not often that six out of the 10 batsmen get dismissed being caught in the slip cordon! Mahendra Singh Dhonis boys, who were skittled out for a paltry 88 in the first match of the tri-series, against New Zealand, on Tuesday, did just that, fishing at anything and everything that was a shade outside the off-stump.         
	After being thrashed by a mammoth 200-run margin, India now have also lost their No.2 rank in the ICC ODI team rankings.         
	The batsmen who were trapped in the slips included Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Praveen Kumar, Abhimanyu Mithun and Ravindra Jadeja.         
	New Zealand captain Ross Taylor, who led from the front with fine 95 and later took four catches, said at the post-match presentation ceremony that it felt good to come back after the initial hiccup when they lost three quick wickets. He also praised his bowlers for sticking to a disciplined line and length.         
	Taylors counterpart Dhoni admitted that more than the off-pitch movement, it was the awkward bounce that did them in. The abject surrender by the Indian batsmen was evident as only three  Virender Sehwag (19), Dinesh Karthik (14) and Ravindra Jadeja (20)  reached doubles figures. The fourth highest were the extras as the New Zealand bowlers bowled as many as nine wides.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Taylor: I am very happy with the manner we performed. It was a very tough decision to drop Jeetan Patel But it was good that we fought back hard. Initially, Ashish (Nehra) and Praveen (Kumar) bowled well. It was important that we get a partnership going. Our initial target was 250 to 260.         
	So we when scored 280-plus, I was very happy. Scotty (Scott Styris) also batted very well under difficult conditions. The ball was swinging during the early part and it wasnt very easy to bat on. Later on, we were disciplined while bowling. The catching was also very good. When it comes your way, you either take them or you drop them. It was one of such days when I caught everything that came my way.         
	Dhoni: Well, it was one of the bad days. Taylor and Styris batted really well. Also, a few chances came our way but we failed to grab them. We must admit that we didnt bat well. There was bounce in the pitch but it was a different kind of bounce The bounce was a bit more spongy. Obviously, we are very disappointed for losing in such a manner. The Dambulla pitch doesnt have much for the bowlers. Initially, there is some swing but there is no movement off the pitch.         
	And then, gradually, the pitch becomes easier for batting. Then again in the evening, batting becomes difficult. With New Zealand having tall fast bowlers, they were able to extract more bounce off the pitch. That bounce put us in an awkward position. Hopefully, we will be better prepared when we play next time.

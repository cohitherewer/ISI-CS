	Port of Spain: South Africa recovered from early jolts to reach 190 for five at lunch on the second day of the first Test against the West Indies here on Friday.         
	West Indies Shane Shillingford and Sulieman Benn continued their battle with South Africas batsmen on a pitch that already has a fifth day feel to it.         
	After a positive start, spin accounted for nightwatchman Paul Harris and Jacques Kallis as the visitors slipped to 107 for five. But AB de Villiers (40 batting) and Ashwell Prince (42 batting) then dug in, blunting the spin threat to add an unbeaten 83 for the sixth wicket.         
	Earlier, pouring rain and three wickets set South Africa back in the opening Test against West Indies.         
	The South Africans, electing to bat, reached 70 for three in their first innings when bad light stopped play early on the rain-hit opening day at Queens Park Oval .         
	Only 34 overs were possible in just over two hours of play, as the West Indies Cricket Boards decision to stage a Test in the middle of the Trinidad amp; Tobago wet season seriously backfired.         
	South Africa skipper Graeme Smith gave the Proteas a solid base in an opening stand of 55 with Alviro Petersen, when play started four hours and 35 minutes late because of the weather.

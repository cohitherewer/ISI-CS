The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lajong look to shine in tinsel town
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lajong look to shine in tinsel town
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Lajong face their first major challenge since the stupendous Federation Cup show when they take on title contenders Mahindra United in the I-League on Friday.         
	The northeast club avoided an embarrassing defeat last week to Viva Kerala, thanks to a 90th minute goal from Nepal striker Anil Gurung, and they would be keen to recapture the form that saw them reach the Federation Cup final.         
	The boys are learning the difference between reaching the top and staying there, coach Stanley Rozario said on the eve of the clash at the Cooperage.         
	It will be Lajongs maiden appearance in tinsel town.         
	Rozario, however, had one major concern. Lajong would be without key forward Seikhohao Tuboi due to a double booking. That leaves the coach with only one striker, Gurung.         
	The hosts have their own issues to sort out. Mahindra eked out a 2-1 win over bottom-placed Sporting Clube de Goa last week, the goals coming in the dying minutes after a lacklustre first half.

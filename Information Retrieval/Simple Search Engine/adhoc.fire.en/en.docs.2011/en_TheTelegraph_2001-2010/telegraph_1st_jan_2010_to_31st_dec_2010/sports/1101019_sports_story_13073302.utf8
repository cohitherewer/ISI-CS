                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan ready after rest
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The green and maroon brigade, from the very onset of this season, have been burdened with the criticism that they have looked colourless as compared to the red and gold camp. And Mohun Bagans 0-1 loss at the hands of East Bengal in the Federation Cup final earlier this month only sharpened the critics words.         
	On Tuesday, when Bagan take on George Telegraph in a Calcutta Football League Premier Division encounter, their first match after the Federation Cup; Stanley Rozarios boys would be keen to prove a point.         
	Rozario himself thinks that the break would help rejuvenate his side. The break will help us come back fresh and Im sure it will have a positive result in our performance, the coach said.         
	Jose Barreto, too, echoed his coach as he said that the break will help the team in the longer run. We have rested well and Im hopeful we will do well rest of the season, he said.         
	Against George Telegraph, Bagan will be missing the services of captain Ishfaq Ahmed who is yet to recover from a knee injury. With seven points from four matches, Bagan are placed in the bottom half of the CFL table.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Leander wants more
                                                                                                                       7                                        Leander wants more
  - Indian star fancies teams chances versus Russia in the Davis Cup World Group             Leander Paes in Bangalore on Wednesday. (PTI)                           
	Bangalore: Leander Paes is eyeing five or six more Grand Slam titles, an 11th major crown at the Australian Open serving as an impetus to greater glory for the Indian tennis legend.         
	Paes equalled Mahesh Bhupathis Indian record for most number of Grand Slam titles last week when he partnered Zimbabwean Cara Black to win the mixed doubles crown in Melbourne.         
	I would love to win five or six more Grand Slams. I would love to take part in my sixth Olympics, Paes said at a media interaction here.         
	Paes said he has always enjoyed playing in Australia and described as unfortunate the recent attacks on Indians Down Under.         
	It is very unfortunate the way things have been going on in Australia. I have had a long association with Australians. Tony Roche coached me for three-and-a-half years in Sydney, where I lived with his family.         
	Bob Carmichael, one of the greatest coaches I have worked with, taught me how to play doubles. I lived with him in Melbourne. Speak for myself I can say that Ive had some amazing interactions with them, he said.         
	Australia had forfeited last years Davis Cup tie against India but Paes hoped that things will be better soon.         
	Be it tennis or cricket, people of Australia and India have shared a great professional relationship. I believe that sports should be one of the vehicles to promote good ties between countries, Paes said.         
	There has been talk of the tennis great taking guard in front of movie cameras and Paes said that cinema has always interested him so much so that he was game to face the arc lights if the right script came to him.         
	Cinema is something that has always intrigued me. If down the road the right script, right director, movie and project come along, I would love to explore the actor in me. But I havent signed any role or movie yet. I believe that there is a time and place for everything, he said.         
	As for the upcoming Davis Cup World Group tie against Russia, Paes said it would not be smooth sailing but revealed that he fancied Indias chances for an upset.         
	India have qualified for the World Group after 11 years, following the convincing 4-1 win over South Africa in the playoffs.         
	Playing Russia in the Davis Cup is very, very tough. (Nikolay) Davydenko won the ATP World Tour title beating (Roger) Federer in the final.         
	They have got amazing depth but Ive always felt that the Indian Davis Cup team has pulled off some wonderful upsets My Davis Cup record is testimony to that. Anything can happen in the Davis Cup. To come away with a win will be magical.         
	Paes was of the view that Bhupathi and himself would have to perform consistently to keep their place on the team as the younger players have started doing well.         
	If both of us are injury free then definitely, we are the best team out there. Both of us have to be aware that there are a few guys out there who are wonderful doubles players.         
	The way Somdev Dev Varman and Sanam Singh performed in the Chennai Open. Rohan Bopanna, too, has done well. So we have some guys right on our heels. We need to keep performing well to keep our place on the team, Paes reckoned.         
	Asked how he fancied his chances of winning a medal at the Commonwealth and Asian Games, Paes said: I have always done well playing for the country. These two events would be no different. Tennis has been included for the first time in the Commonwealth Games and it is a big stage for me to come out and perform. I look forward to it.         
	Paes insisted he skipped the Chennai Open last month to acclimatise to Australian conditions but hinted there could be more there than met the eye.         
	I missed the Chennai Open to go to Australia early. I got to Brisbane, played in Auckland. Heading out early to Australia was to give myself enough time to acclimatise and prepare there.         
	I love playing in front of home crowds, I love playing in India. It was unfortunate that I was not welcomed as well as I normally am. To me it seems to have paid off though. Coming away with a victory in the first Grand Slam of the year is great.

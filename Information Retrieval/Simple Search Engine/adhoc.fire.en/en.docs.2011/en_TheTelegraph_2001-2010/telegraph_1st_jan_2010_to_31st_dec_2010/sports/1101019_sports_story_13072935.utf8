                                                                                                                       7                                      Somdev keeps AITA waiting 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Sania Mirza would spearhead the womens tennis challenge but India would be fielding a depleted mens squad at the 16th Asian Games, in Guangzhou (China), from November 12-27.         
	The All India Tennis Association (AITA) has postponed the selection of the mens team as it grapples with the scenario of missing out on the services of Indias top players  Leander Paes, Mahesh Bhupathi and Rohan Bopanna.         
	Paes has made himself unavailable for the meet as he and doubles partner Lukas Dlouhy have qualified for the year-end ATP Tour Finals, which is to be held from November 21-28 in London. Bhupathi and Bopanna have an outside chance of qualifying for the year-ender with their respective partners.         
	Somdev Dev Varman is yet to confirm his participation but the AITA secretary general Anil Khanna remained confident that he would play. The reason for the doubt over the 25-year-olds participation could not be ascertained.         
	I am quite sure he (Dev Varman) would play. Otherwise, we are waiting to see who is qualifying for the World Finals before we finalise the (mens) team, Khanna told The Telegraph.         
	Sania, Poojashree Venkatesh, Rushmi Chakravarthy and Nirupama Sanjeev will play in the team championship, while Tara Iyer and Calcutta girl Shivikha Burman have been included for the individual event.

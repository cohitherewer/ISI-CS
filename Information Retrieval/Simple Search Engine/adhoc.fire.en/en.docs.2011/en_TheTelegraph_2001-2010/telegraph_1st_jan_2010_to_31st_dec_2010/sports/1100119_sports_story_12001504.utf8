            A STAFF REPORTER            Tony Lewis at a city hotel on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: An interaction with former England captain and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) president Tony Lewis will make you fall in love with the old world charm. Someone who believes that Test cricket is the ultimate, swears by MCCs Spirit of Cricket and believes that Richie Benaud is inarguably best captain he has ever seen.         
	Talk about cricket and the proud Welshman (thats how he likes to call himself) will provide lot of thoughtful insights to the game.         
	In the city as a part of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club which will take part in the The Royals Trophy to be played at the RCGC from Thursday, Lewis by his own admission, is slightly better in cricket than golf.         
	Talk about Englands performance during the recently-concluded drawn Test series against South Africa, Lewis has no hesitation in terming the Proteas as a better side.         
	I would have ideally liked to see a series which hadnt been interrupted by weather. Whatever I have seen, South Africa were a superior side. But full marks to England for winning one of the Tests by an innings, the former England captain, who last visited the city some 14 years back, told The Telegraph, on Monday.         
	Talk about English cricket and he terms Jonathan Trott as one who has had the best debut Test hundred of recent times.         
	His debut hundred (119 vs Australia at the Oval) was filled with so much grace and poise, that everyone sat back and took notice, he said.         
	Talk about the ICCs ranking methods, Lewis who is now the chairman of MCCs World Cricket Committee seemed livid.         
	Frankly speaking, I dont like the ranking system. We, the World Cricket Committee of the MCC are the conscience of the game. We (MCC) had provided a few alternate options for rankings but nothing has been done so far on that front, said Lewis, who heads the committee that has names like Barry Richards, Geoffrey Boycott, Steve Waugh, Martin Crowe, Courtney Walsh, Mike Gatting, Rahul Dravid and Anil Kumble.         
	We proposed that Test rankings should be based on winning percentage of a particular team. Our main idea is to see that Test cricket, which is the ultimate test of players craft, should be made more exciting.         
	In fact, Martin (Crowe) gave a couple of proposals which couldnt be followed due to ICCs stringent FTP. Martin wanted all Test playing nations to play at least one series against each other in the next two years. Secondly, a World Test Championship which is the most fair way to judge who is the best, Lewis explained.         
	Dravid and Kumble also gave valuable inputs about the referral system, he said.         
	Although he is a great fan of IPL he would like to see quality and not quantity. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a fabulous captain. But I only hope he doesnt lose his swagger due to the demands of limited overs cricket.         
	Who is a better opener Sunil Gavaskar and Virender Sehwag? I wouldnt like to bowl at Sehwag on his day but I would always fancy a chance to get him out. If you talk about Sunil, he wouldnt play that many shots and would rarely give you a chance.         
	He terms Graeme Smith as the best captain in recent times, but has the ultimate respect for Richie Benaud.         
	I remember he once told me that there are two basic thumbrules about captaincy. Think two overs in advance and be lucky. Because if a captain was capable of thinking two overs ahead, he would definitely be lucky, he signed off.

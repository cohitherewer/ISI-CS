	Colombo: Sri Lankas new venues for next years World Cup are on track but the refurbishment of an existing stadium is behind schedule, the International Cricket Council said Monday.         
	Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament with India and Bangladesh, is set to stage 12 matches at the Premadasa stadium in Colombo and at the newly built grounds in Pallekele and Hambantota, outside the capital.         
	With the exception of the Premadasa stadium, others are on track to play a few first-class and international matches before the tournament starts next February, ICCs structural engineer, Eugene van Vuuren, said.

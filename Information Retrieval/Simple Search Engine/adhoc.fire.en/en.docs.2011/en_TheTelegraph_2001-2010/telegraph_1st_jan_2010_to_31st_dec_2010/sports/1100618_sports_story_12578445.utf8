            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: Lionel Messi is yet to score a goal in the 2010 World Cup but is already the tournaments biggest hit.         
	Such was his performance against South Korea on Thursday that the rival coach, too, could not help but praise him. Argentina have several good players and they all played well. They fully deserve the victory, coach Huh Jung-moo said.         
	We had a plan, we wanted to mark Messi but none of our players could come close to him. He (Messi) definitely did a great job, said the coach who had the onerous duty of marking Diego Maradona when they met in the 1986 World Cup.         
	Maradona has a fair idea of what Messi is capable of, but he too was bowled over by the Barcelona strikers performance. I told you yesterday (Wednesday) that there is no one like Messi in world football at the moment, said the Argentine coach. He proved it once again. I want Messi to be very close to the ball. As long as he has fun, we are all going to have fun.         
	Football wouldnt be beautiful unless Messi is touching the ball all the time. He performed magic on the pitch, he said.         
	Asked why he hugs and kisses his players after the match, Maradona smiled and said: Well, I still prefer women. I am dating Veronica, who is 31-years old. No, I have not gone limp-wristed, but I like to acknowledge and congratulate my players when they play as well as they did. he said.

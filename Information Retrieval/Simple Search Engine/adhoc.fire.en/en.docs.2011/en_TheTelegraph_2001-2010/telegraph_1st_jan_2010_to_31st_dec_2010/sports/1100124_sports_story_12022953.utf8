	Calcutta: Representatives of the warring boards, Cricket Australia (CA) and New Zealand Cricket (NZC), will meet within a week to break the deadlock over who should be nominated as the next vice-president of the world body.         
	Going by the rotation policy adopted by the International Cricket Council (ICC) a few years ago, its the turn of either Australia or New Zealand to nominate Sharad Pawars successor.         
	Pawar will become the president in June and his successor as the vice-president will also succeed him as the president, in the summer of 2012.         
	While CA has decided to field former Prime Minister John Howard, NZC is pitching for its one-time chairman, Sir John Anderson.         
	The meeting will in all probability be held in New Zealand. Both boards are going to have three representatives, with an independent member being there as well.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources in Australia and New Zealand, Sir Roderick Eddington, a former CEO of British Airways, is the independent.         
	Sir Eddington is an Australian (hes now the chairman of Infrastructure Australia), but NZC didnt have a problem in accepting him.         
	The boards should actually have decided on their joint nominee by the end of last year. As it turned out, both CA and NZC requested the ICC for a two-month extension of its deadline.         
	New Zealands point is that Australias Malcolm Gray had been the president only recently and, so, its candidate should be endorsed.         
	So far, Australia has been thinking differently, resulting in the deadlock. Incidentally, in going for Howard, CA has brushed aside the ambitions of its own chairman, Jack Clarke.         
	Its a royal snub.

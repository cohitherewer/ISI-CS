The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB mulls a switch of turf
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB mulls a switch of turf
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After football, artificial turf might invade the cricket grounds of the city. On the lines of the Salt Lake Stadium, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is mulling to install artificial turf at the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus ground.         
	And it is all because of a mail from former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary and current Indian Premier League governing council member Niranjan Shah.         
	Shah has sent an email to the state associations highlighting the utility of artificial turf and how it can help cricket during monsoon. He also cited the example of recently concluded Fifa World Cup in South Africa where artificial turf was used.         
	The CAB brass are now mulling the possibilities of such a plan and have zeroed in on the Jadavpur ground. Prabir Mukherjee, the CAB curator, is also interested with the idea. Praising the concept, he said that the turf, TigerTurf to be precise, would be helpful and he had already spoken to CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya about the matter.         
	However, CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey informed that it was highly unlikely that work would begin before World Cup next year. Its very difficult to do something before the 2011 World Cup as we will be busy with the renovation of the Eden. We may think about it after the Cup is over, Dey said.         
	It remains to be seen if the CAB goes ahead with the idea and if the days of the Super-Sopper are over.

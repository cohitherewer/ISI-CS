The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I was under no extra pressure: Sushil 
                                                                                                                       7                                        I was under no extra pressure: Sushil 
  - Grappler survived on a fruit-and-juice diet during meet       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Sushil Kumar                                 
	New Delhi: For eight days in Moscow, Sushil Kumar Solanki survived on fruits and juices before creating history in the World wrestling championships on Sunday.         
	Since I am a strict vegetarian, it was impossible for me to eat most of the food items here, the newly crowned 66 kg freestyle world champion told The Telegraph before boarding the flight to Delhi. Thankfully, the Indian contingent carried some packed food items from Delhi. For a few days, I took those and then decided to eat only fruits and juices, said the Delhi based wrestler.         
	While all former grapplers described Sushils triumph in the final as the greatest moment in the history of Indian wrestling, Sushil said he was under no pressure when he tamed local hope and crowd favourite Alan Gogaev 3-1 in the final.         
	Though the team officials told me that I was on the brink of becoming the first Indian to win a gold medal in the World championships, it did not put me under any extra pressure. My preparation for the world meet was good and I realised winning the gold would not be an impossible task, Sushil said.         
	Sushil said two of his bouts  in the semi-final against Jabrail Hasanov of Azerbaijan and Gogaev of Russia in the final  were the toughest challenges in his career.         
	In Beijing, I had to go to the repechage rounds after losing to a Ukrainian wrestler in the first round. It was tough job as I had to win three bouts to get the bronze but nothing could be compared with the World championships, said the 27-year-old wrestler.         
	After Beijing, Sushils career hit an all time low when he missed the Asian championships in Thailand in 2009 because of being overweight. Warned by the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) for the lapse, Sushil came back with a vengeance to win the gold medal in the German Grand Prix but failed again the World meet in Denmark.         
	Its a great comeback, said WFI secretary general Kartar Singh, himself a two-time Asian Games gold medallist. His performance has overshadowed the showings of all other wrestlers in the past.         
	In Beijing, Sushil did not even have a masseur. I had to work as a stand-in masseur. In Moscow, our masseur, Arvinder did a great job with the wrestling squad.         
	Satpal, another great name in Indian wrestling and the gold medallist in the 1982 Asian Games, said: I have been coaching Sushil from the time he was only a 14-year-old. I have no doubt he is the greatest wrestler India has ever produced.         
	Meanwhile, Sushils employers Railways have announced a cash award of Rs 10 lakh for his achievement.

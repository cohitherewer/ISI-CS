The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Messi fatigue a worry: Trainer

	Pretoria: Lionel Messis hopes of being crowned the best player at the World Cup could be dashed by the exhaustion of a taxing European season, according to the man responsible for keeping the team in shape.         
	He has arrived at the World Cup tired, the damage is already done and its irreversible, Argentinas fitness trainer Fernando Signorini told a website.         
	Signorini, Maradonas personal fitness trainer for most of his playing career in Europe, said too much was being expected of the young forward who only turns 23 in two weeks.         
	(The organisers) worry about the doping controls but not if players play 70 matches a year, he said this week after an early morning visit by anti-doping testers to Argentinas University of Pretoria camp.         
	Fans and media have seen little of the little Barcelona ace in the last four weeks although he has been involved in Argentinas practices during the two weeks the squad have been in South Africa. Having missed Argentinas 5-0 win over Canada in their last warm-up 17 days ago due to a minor knee injury, Messis last match was in La Liga on May 16. He last played for Argentina against Germany in Munich on March 3.         
	Signorini said Messi was doing no more than absolutely necessary in terms of fitness in the build-up to Argentinas opening Group B match against Nigeria on Saturday.         
	He went on to say Messi is almost a miracle of genetics because in a single movement he makes six or seven (movements). Its his calling to be one of the best (players) in history and surely at the next World Cup hell be better than in this because to his talent he will add experience.         
	Daniel Arcucci, co-writer of Maradonas autobigraphyYo, el Diego (I, Diego), echoed this sentiment when he said: (Messi) has the qualities to be the best ... but it could be in 2014 and not now.         
	It would be an injustice to judge him badly if he doesnt crown himself this year, he said. Messi is excited about the tournament, saying:To win the World Cup would not compare with anything. I think Im in the best form of my career. No one wins alone and Im not going to win the Cup alone.

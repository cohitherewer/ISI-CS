            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengals poor form continued as they lost their second AFC Cup match, against Al Nejmeh of Lebanon, on Wednesday.         
	Phillippe de Ridders men, who were without the services of their star striker Bhaichung Bhutia (because of an injury), were beaten 0-3 in Beirut in the Group D encounter.         
	The Federation Cup champions had earlier suffered a 1-4 drubbing at the hands of Al Ittihad of Syria at home.         
	Al Nejmehs Makeni Diop scored a brace while Abbas Ahmed Atwi netted the other goal. The visitors were thoroughly outplayed in the game as Diop put the hosts ahead in the 21st minute. Atwi hit the second goal in the 43rd minute to put Al Nejmeh 2-0.         
	Diop hammered the final nail in East Bengals coffin when he added the third in the 49th minute.

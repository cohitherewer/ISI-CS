The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Now, the onus on bowlers: Raman
                                                                                                                       7                                      Now, the onus on bowlers: Raman
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Bengal coach WV Raman said it would be fair to expect the teams bowlers to rise to the occasion and make a match of it against Delhi in their Ranji Group A super league tie on Wednesday.         
	There is no point in sulking about not getting a bigger score than 473. We must remember that this is a team game and it is up to our bowlers to make up for that with a good show, Raman said after the second days play, at the Kotla, on Tuesday.         
	At 313 for two after the first day, you would have expected the team to go past 500. Then again, if you can say it could have been better, you could also say it could have been worse.         
	Fact is that Delhi needs to get 384 runs more to get the first innings lead and that is a fair bit, he said. We have to focus and see what we can do to restrict Delhi below our score, he added.         
	Speaking about the Kotla track, Raman said: The Delhi bowlers showed greater discipline with a fairly new ball on Tuesday morning. That session went their way.         
	Ramans counterpart Manoj Prabhakar was not quite happy that his team had allowed Bengal to escape to 473 after reducing it to 357 for six in the morning.         
	We would have been happier if we had restricted Bengal to around 400, Prabhakar said. We should have made things difficult for the seventh wicket pair by making them struggle for runs, he added.

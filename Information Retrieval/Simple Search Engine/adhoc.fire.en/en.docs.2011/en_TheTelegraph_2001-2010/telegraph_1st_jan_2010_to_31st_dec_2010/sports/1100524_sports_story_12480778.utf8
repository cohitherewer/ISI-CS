The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Daddy cool Pietersen is on top of the world 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Daddy cool Pietersen is on top of the world 
  - Ive always played better when Im happy, says the new father       Jim White            Kevin Pietersen                                 
	The number 20 has taken on a new significance in the life of Kevin Pietersen since he returned from Barbados this week, a winners medal from the World Twenty20 tucked into his luggage.         
	Six yesterday, three already this morning, I should easily be up to 20 by the end of the weekend, he says. Nappies, man. Ive changed more than Jess [his wife] has, thats for sure. But then she has had a Caesarean, so she cant bend over. Its a good excuse I suppose.         
	Pietersen, the proud new father, a man now apparently incapable of completing a sentence without grinning from ear to ear, spent part of the recent competition in the West Indies commuting back to England so he could be at the birth of his son, Dylan Blake (yeah, Dylan as in Bob, but its nothing to do with him, Im not a Bob Dylan fan). He could subsidise Englands next tour on the air miles he accumulated.         
	The boy was a little too big to be delivered normally, he explains, so we decided to have a C section, which fitted it nicely into the playing schedule. I knew if I got back for the Monday morning, when the operation was, Id be there for his birth and only miss the New Zealand game.         
	The management were totally fine about it. So I flew from Barbados to Trinidad, from Trinidad to New York, from New York to London. I got in about 11 that night, had to be in the hospital at six the next morning, had the most amazing experience ever, then had a day at home before I flew right back.         
	It hardly sounds the best preparation for a crucial World Cup game. Thank goodness for sleeping pills, he says. I took a couple, was spark out for the whole flight, arrived in Barbados, had a quick spin on a jet ski with Colly [Paul Collingwood], something to eat, went to the team meeting, had another sleeping pill, slept for 11 hours and was totally refreshed and ready to play the next day. Its probably the last decent nights sleep Ill have in a while.         
	To those traditionalists who tut tutted about the absurdity of this modern indulgence, Pietersen responded with two storming performances in the semi-final and final, smashing the ball to all parts of the Caribbean. Any indulgence clearly paid off.         
	Ive always played better when Im happy, he grins. Now, man I was happy. And its definitely changed my perspective on my job. When I came off the field the other day against Sri Lanka [in the competitions semis] and I got that 42 not out, after Id congratulated everyone, I went to my phone, got it out and Ive got this file of pictures of my little boy and I just looked at it for 10 minutes.         
	Mind, he did find time to be part of the rolling maul of celebration that erupted on the Kensington Oval pitch once victory over Australia had been secured in the final. In that moment, did he find compensation for the Ashes series last year, when he was obliged to watch the merriment from the sidelines, crippled by a torn Achilles?         
	Well for missing so much cricket, the tough year I had, yeah it was great, he says. Im lucky, Ive already won the Ashes with England in 2005, and I was part of that Lords victory last year. But just to be involved in such an incredible experience these last two weeks has been priceless.         
	For those of us watching it from afar it was also a pretty incredible experience. Not least the manner in which England, recently so hopeless at the foreshortened game, scratching around, nurdling and nudging and forever falling behind the run rate, were transformed into a side ruthless enough to dispatch Australia with three overs to spare. What on earth happened out there? They cant all have recently become fathers can they?         
	I think one thing was the growing belief that we are good enough to compete, he says. Im not sure we all believed that in the past. But for me the biggest thing is we all enjoy one anothers success. .         
	Though presumably the experience drawn by a core of the players including Pietersen himself  from the recent Indian Premier League had something to do with it too. Absolutely 100 per cent key, he says. You learn about the game only by playing at the highest level.         
	So how does he relax and refresh? Now, I guess Ill change a few more nappies, he grins. Seriously, thats my life. I got four hours sleep last night, four the night before. Im looking to get through this weekend and get to the Test match next week.         
	What, for the experience, for the chance to build an innings over a day or two? No, he says. So I can have some sleep. quot;           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Karim, David in a spat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Karim, David in a spat
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mohun Bagans 2-1 win over Mahindra United on Thursday was marred by an on-field confrontation between the two coaches after the post-match ceremony.         
	Home coach David Booth labelled his counterpart a liar after alleging that the latter had been questioning in public the merit of the Best Coach Award bestowed on him earlier this season by the Football Players Association of India (FPAI).         
	The man has to stop talking. If he wants it (the award) that badly I will pass it to him, Booth said. He is talking to the press and my club people about me getting the award although Mumbai FC (whom he coached last season) finished seventh  I told him that if he has anything to say, say it to me.         
	He said he never said anything like that. I called him a liar. He cant be belittling other coaches. Its not about me, I am more interested in the team.         
	Bencharifa sought to play down the controversy and blamed a section of the media for the same.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohan, Aisam stun the Bryans
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rohan, Aisam stun the Bryans
                      
	Washington: Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi pulled off the biggest win of their careers by upsetting world record holders Mike and Bob Bryan in the quarter finals of the Legg Mason Classic event here.         
	The unseeded Indo-Pak pair recorded a stunning 7-6 (6), 7-5 win over the world No. 2 players, who have a record 62 titles against their name, to avenge last weeks defeat at the Farmers Classic.         
	Bopanna and Qureshi will take on Mardy Fish and Mark Knowles in the semi-finals of the $1,165,500 ATP 500 tournament.         
	This victory is really satisfying on many levels. After the Bryan brothers beat us last week, this win shows that we were able to analyse what went wrong with our game and correct those faults to come back and win convincingly against these very tough players.         
	Both Aisam and I know that our game has been improving steadily and we have the confidence and ability to be amongst the best.         
	Our plan was to play aggressively from the start, and thats what we successfully did, Bopanna said after the win.         
	This was the Bryans first defeat in the US capital city since 2003; they won three successive titles in 2005-2007.         
	The American twins next target on the list is to break Pam Shriver and Martina Navratilovas record of winning 79 Tour titles. They bettered the 61 titles set by the Woodies, last week.         
	Bopanna and Qureshi fired 17 aces as they sealed victory over the reigning ATP World Tour doubles champions in 80 minutes.         
	The unseeded pairing converted one of the five break points they created to seal victory in the 12th game, as Mike Bryan finished with two double faults.         
	Their semi-final opponents, Fish and Knowles, reached their first last-four stage since Memphis in February when they defeated Simon Aspelin and Paul Hanley 6-4, 7-5. They dropped just eight points on first serve.         
	Last week, the Indo-Pak pair lost 2-6, 4-6 to the Americans in the semi-finals of the $619,500 hard court Farmers Classic event in Los Angeles.         
	For their semi-final run, Bopanna and Aisam earned 90 ranking points each and split $9,650 as prize money.         
	Bopanna has been having a great year so far. He reached the quarter finals of the Chennai Open with Mahesh Bhupathi in January this year. Then, in Johannesburg, with Qureshi, he won his second ATP doubles title defeating the combination of Karol Beck and Harel Levy 2-6 6-3 10-5 in a 68-minute final.         
	In April, the Indo-Pak duo reached the final of the ATP event in Casablanca, losing to the Swedish-Romanian duo of Robert Lindstedt and Horia Tecau in three tough sets.         
	A few months later the duo faced a similar ordeal at Nice when they lost in the final to Brazilian pair, Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares.           (AGENCIES)

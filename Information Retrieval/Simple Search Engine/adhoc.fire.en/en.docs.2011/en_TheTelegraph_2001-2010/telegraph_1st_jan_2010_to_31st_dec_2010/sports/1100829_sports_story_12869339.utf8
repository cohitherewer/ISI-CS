The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time to answer the local call
                                                                                                                       7                                        Time to answer the local call
  - CFL Md. Sp. begin campaign today
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	The Calcutta Football League has been an ideal tournament for the citys big guns to gear up for the real battle  the I-League. However, last year, thanks to the Indian Football Associations (IFA) poor scheduling, everything went haywire and the League dragged on till May this year.         
	This time, the IFA has promised to complete the CFL by November 19.         
	And if that happens, this tournament will give enough scope to Stanley Rozario, Trevor James Morgan and Subrata Bhattacharya to tighten up the loose ends. As East Bengal coach Morgan said the other day: The CFL is important since it will give me a fair idea about how my boys are doing.         
	Well, his first test is on Tuesday but, on Sunday, Mohammedan Sporting get into action taking on Calcutta Port Trust at the Salt Lake Stadium. On Monday, its Chirag United, followed by East Bengal on Tuesday and defending champions Mohun Bagan on Wednesday. The Telegraph gives you an idea about the strengths and weaknesses of the top four clubs. Read on                   Subair Murithala Ali      
	MOHUN BAGAN         
	CFL title won: 29 times         
	2009-10: Champions         
	Captain: Ishfaq Ahmed         
	Coach: Stanley Rozario         
	Stars: Jose Ramirez Barreto, Subair Murithala Ali, Edeh Chidi         
	STRENGTHS         
	They have the best forward line in town. In Jose Ramirez Barreto, Subair Murithala Ali and Edeh Chidi they have strikers par excellence. Agreed age has slowed down Barreto, but still his commitment towards the game and his favourite club cant be doubted. This season Bagan will be led by Ishfaq Ahmed, who, till the other day, was seen as someone from former coach Karim Bencharifas camp. This is a good sign and it shows that the club is moving forward and not getting bogged down by preconceived notions. New coach, the amiable Stanley Rozario, has become quite popular with the players. Bagan will surely fancy their chances of winning the CFL fourth year on the trot.         
	WEAKNESSES         
	The green and maroon brigade may be let down by their ageing Bengal brigade. The likes of Ashim Biswas, Jayanta Sen, one-dimensional Snehasish Chakraborty or inconsistent Gauranga Datta may prove to be a burden in the long run. In defence, K Rahul Kumar and Oknoyo Diamondstar do not have the experience of handling the Maidan pressure. Diamondstar, an African-born Australian, who will fill up the Asian quota, looked impressive during the Siliguri camp. But how fast he adapts to the rigours of Calcutta football remains to be seen.                   Denson Devadas      
	CHIRAG UNITED         
	CFL title won: None         
	2009-10: Runners-up         
	Captain: Arnab Mondal         
	Coach: Subrata Bhattacharya         
	Stars: Joshimar, Elijah Junior, Sergei Tokov, Chika Wali, Denson Devadas.         
	STRENGTHS         
	Chirag United are relatively new in the Calcutta scene and they dont have the historical relevance of the Big Three. They are playing in the Premier Division since 2002-03, when they were known as the Ever-Ready Football Club, yet in a short time they have become a formidable force. Last year they almost won the CFL, pipped at the post by Mohun Bagan, and this time they have a team which can give anyone a run for their money. Elijah Junior, Joshimar, Sergei Tokov and Chika Wali are their foreign recruits. It will be interesting to see how Junior and Joshimar perform. Both are seasoned campaigners and coach Subrata Bhattacharya will be looking forward to them for the goals. The presence of Bengals Santosh Trophy hero Denson Devadas in the midfield is also an advantage for Chirag.         
	WEAKNESSES         
	Defence is surely a worry since except Chika Wali, who was superb for Pune FC last season, there is hardly anyone who has earned a name for himself. On the left side of the defence, Sergei Tokov is there but the three-foreigner rule may not see him much in action. If he is drafted in, it will be at the expense of either Chika or one of the two frontliners. Another weakness is obviously Bhattacharyas volatile temperament. Last year he had his share of run-ins with the management but this time, till now, he is keeping a low profile.                   Penn Orji      
	EAST BENGAL         
	CFL title won: 31 times         
	2009-10: Finished third         
	Captain: Saumik Dey         
	Coach: James Morgan         
	Stars: Penn Orji, Ekene Ekewa, Uga Okpara         
	STRENGTHS         
	The most balanced team of the CFL, East Bengal will be the favourites to lift the trophy and end their three-year drought. They have a coach in James Morgan who has an enviable resume. The man was a part of the Hull City Youth Development programme and has already impressed one and all with his coaching. East Bengal have quality foreigners in Penn Orji and Ekene Ekewa. And then, the Indian players like Sanju Pradhan, Mehtab Hossain, R Vashum and Robin Singh will also be there. Robin, in fact, has garnered a lot of hype and it remains to be seen how he does on the pitch. Morgan has already gone on record saying that the 19-year-old will be an asset for the national team within the next two years. The crucial question is: Will he live up to the expectations? Remember, what happened to PC Lalawmpuiya four years back?         
	WEAKNESSES         
	The defence remains a worry. The big-bodied Uga Okpara is there but we all saw how the red and gold defence wilted last year even in his presence. Overall they had conceded 71 goals  only nine in CFL  and this time Morgan, who must have gone through the records, will definitely be worried. Naoba Singh and Gurbinder Singh have been roped in to bolster the defence and Nirmal Chetri is already there. Fans will be hoping the defence doesnt let in soft goals like last year.                   Dipendu Biswas      
	MOHAMMEDAN SPORTING         
	CFL title won: 11 times.         
	2009-10: Finished fourth         
	Captain: David         
	Coach: Syed Nayeemuddin         
	Stars: David, Dipendu Biswas         
	STRENGTHS         
	 There is hope in the Mohammedan Sporting camp and thats their biggest strength. Syed Nayeemuddin is at the helm, making a comeback to the Maidan after a long time. Nayeem hasnt lost any of his old habits. Two sessions of practice every day, strict discipline and those boys are doing well quotes to the media. They have David, the Zimbabwean defender as captain and have a Maidan veteran in Dipendu Biswas. Suraj Mondal is also there upfront.         
	WEAKNESSES         
	 Hardly any player worth a name. Mohammedan Sporting will find the going tough unless and until they rope in some quality foreigners. They have lost the Third Front tag long time back. Now its a battle for survival.

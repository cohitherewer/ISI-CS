The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal is king of Rome again
                                                                                                                       7                                        Nadal is king of Rome again
                  Rafael Nadal with the trophy, on Sunday                     
	Rome: Rafael Nadal rediscovered his clay court form after a rare wobble in the semi-finals to beat fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 7-5, 6-2 in Sundays rain-hit final and claim his fifth Rome Masters title in six years.         
	The chinks in the armour that Latvian Ernests Gulbis exposed in Saturdays three-setter, were not seen as Ferrer could never become threatening. The third seed broke serve twice in the gap between two rain interruptions to take the first set and assume command of the second before cruising home.         
	It was not quite the superlative tennis Nadal displayed to claim his sixth Monte Carlo Masters two weeks ago, but conditions were soggy and he still looks ready to win his fifth title at the upcoming French Open after an injury-hit 2009.         
	I probably didnt play like in Monte Carlo, he told a news conference. I played well, but not at the same level as Monte Carlo, but I still won, and thats important for me.         
	The former world No.1 had nothing to show for the pressure he put on his opponents serve before rain stopped the action at 4-4, after he had failed to convert five break points in the fifth game.

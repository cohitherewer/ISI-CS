The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dinara Safina begins in style
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dinara Safina begins in style
                  Dinara Safina after her win over Andrea Petkovic, in Montreal, on Monday                     
	Montreal: Former world No. 1 Dinara Safina celebrated her return to Stade Uniprix with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Germanys Andrea Petkovic at the Montreal Cup on Monday and declared herself 100-percent pain-free after a horror run of injuries.         
	Russian Safina, who left to a standing ovation with the tournaments crystral trophy two years ago, enjoyed a more humble reception on centre court, with a small afternoon crowd greeting her victory with a smattering of applause.         
	If I was not 100 percent there would be no reason to risk because the year is almost finished, Safina told reporters. If I wasnt healthy I would take time off. Injuries have seen Safinas ranking tumble to 70 after the 24-year-old took top spot last year.         
	Following a back injury that forced her out of Wimbledon, the Russian snapped a run of six consecutive losses by beating Alona Bondarenko in the first round of San Diego earlier this month, but was bundled out in the next match. Kim Clijsters stalled her comeback run in the second round of the Cincinnati Open last week.         
	It hurts (to be ranked 70th) but its more important Im here, Im playing and I am healthy, she said.         
	The win over the 39th-ranked German on Monday was just her fourth since the Australian Open and none of them have been back-to-back. Safina expects that to change in Montreal, one of her favourite venues.         
	Its a nice feeling to be back, Ive played some of the best tennis in my career here, said Safina. I hope they will put me a bit more on centre court so I can feel the crowd. With their support I will try to do my best. For how long I dont know but I will give my best.         
	A return to form for Safina would provide a welcome boost for the tournament, which has suffered from the withdrawals of the Williams sisters and Maria Sharapova, who sustained a heel injury during her loss to Clijsters in the Cincinnati Open final. After a rain delay, Estonias Kaia Kanepi dumped out 14th seed Shahar Peer of Israel 6-3, 6-3.         
	Belgiums Yanina Wickmayer eased past Olga Govortsova of Belarus 6-3, 7-6, while 16th seed Aravane Rezai tamed Czech Petra Kvitova 6-7, 7-5, 6-3.           (AGENCIES)

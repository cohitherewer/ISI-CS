The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina is raring to go
                                                                                                                       7                                        Raina is raring to go
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Suresh Raina                           
	Mumbai: Suresh Raina, captain for the short tour of Zimbabwe, Tuesday said that far from posing a threat for the Indian batsmen, the seamer-friendly pitches of the African country would actually aid the medium-pacers.         
	Leading a young side after the national selectors decided to rest several senior players including skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Raina strongly argued that concerns about Indian batsmens ability to counter pace bowling in the aftermath of the teams debacle in the ICC World T20 Championship in the West Indies were misplaced.         
	In T20 you have to smack every ball from the start. But in the 50-over game, you have to hold back a bit. Its a long format. We have players who have done well in ODIs and Tests, Raina said before the teams departure for Zimbabwe.         
	Some days you get your shots right, some days you dont. But we are the No.1 team in Tests and No.2 in ODIs.         
	Raina said the team had the wherewithal to exploit the conditions in Zimbabwe, where they play a tri-series with Sri Lanka as the third team (May 28-June 9) besides two T20 Internationals against the hosts (June 12-13).         
	It will be the first visit to Zimbabwe by the senior side since the infamous 2005 series when the Greg Chappell-Sourav Ganguly spat broke out.         
	We have some very good medium pacers. Umesh Yadav, Vinay Kumar and Ashok Dinda have done well in domestic cricket to earn their place in the side. The Zimbabwe wickets provide them a good opportunity to prove themselves again, he said.         
	The 23-year-old said that the tour would be a challenge as well as opportunity for the players although most would have to make way when the seniors returned.         
	They have to thank the seniors because they (the seniors) normally dont rest. So cricket-wise its a good opportunity for the players, the Uttar Pradesh player said.         
	It would be an opportunity for Raina as well, to showcase his captaincy skills.         
	Yes, it was my dream, but it also means added responsibility. I have played under Sourav Ganguly, Rahulbhai and Dhoni. I spoke to Dhoni, he just asked me to keep it simple. And Sachin (Tendulkar) always says, if you stay humble youll achieve all that you want, he said.         
	Raina said the players should not be bogged down by the thought that their place in the team was not permanent. Performance for India counts. If you make more runs, you will get more chances, he said.         
	Under Dhoni, Raina has batted at different positions for Team Indian but is hoping that, being the captain, he can have a fixed slot for himself.         
	I will speak to the coach about the line-up. I will try to bat up the order, but all that will depend on the situation there, he said.

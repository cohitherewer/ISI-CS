The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies win final ODI
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies win final ODI
                      
	London: Mike Hussey and Shaun Tait led Australia to a 42-run victory in the fifth and final ODI at Lords on Saturday as England won the series 3-2.         
	Hussey hammered 79 in 60 balls as the visitors totalled 277 for seven before Tait produced some lightning-fast bowling to take four for 48 and help bowl England out for 235.         
	Paul Collingwood fought a lone battle for the home team with 95 and when he was bowled by another quick, full-length delivery from Tait their hopes evaporated.         
	Taits first spell was one of the fastest seen at the home of cricket, with the speedometer reading 100.1-mph in his first over.         
	England won the first three matches but lost the last two as Australia restored some confidence for the Ashes test series that starts in November.         
	The hosts suffered another blow when Kevin Pietersen injured his thigh while fielding and he later had to bat with a runner for his four-ball duck. Pietersen could now be a fitness doubt for the forthcoming one-day series against Bangladesh.         
	Tait, who has retired from tests to prolong his career after a series of injuries, removed captain Andrew Strauss (6) and Michael Yardy (0) inside three balls to reduce England to 19 for two.         
	Strauss lost his off stump after Tait got the ball to swing back into him while fellow left-hander Yardy, promoted up the order because of Pietersens injury, played no stroke and was bowled by a quick, in-swinging delivery.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | McKays apology! 
                                                                                                                       7                                      McKays apology! 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Debutant Andy McKay broke a few thousand hearts Monday when he dismissed Sachin Tendulkar with his third ball of the morning.         
	Sachin (61), thus, lost out on another opportunity to record his 50th Test century. That remained McKays only wicket in Test cricket thus far.         
	I actually want to apologise to the crowd I apologise, McKay said, smiling after the end of the third days play.         
	I bowled quite well yesterday and I think that warranted me taking the second new ball with Chris Martin today. To get a player like Sachin Tendulkar as my first wicket is fantastic I was looking to bowl pretty quick and put a bit more effort into that delivery. And it paid off., he said.         
	McKay said that he enjoyed bowling against Indias strong batting line-up in alien conditions. I think Ive been lucky with the handful of one-day games Ive played in Sri LankaIve come up against Sehwag and a couple of other big players.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gulbis ousts Federer in three sets
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gulbis ousts Federer in three sets
                      
	Rome: Roger Federers form dropped drastically after an easy first set, and the top-ranked player lost to Ernests Gulbis of Latvia 2-6, 6-1, 7-5 Tuesday in his opening match of the clay-court season.         
	It was Federers first singles match in nearly a month. He took off several weeks after losing to Tomas Berdych in the fourth round of the Sony Ericsson Open in Florida, on March 30.         
	The 40th-ranked Gulbis fought off nerves at the end and finally closed out the match on his seventh match point. The 16-time Grand Slam champion struggled with his consistency under a light rain as the match with Gulbis wore on.         
	World No. 2 Novak Djokovic made a stylish start to his Rome Masters campaign, blowing away Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 6-1, 6-1 in just under an hour to reach the third round.         
	The Serb, the 2008 Rome champion, gave Chardy a torrid time on his serve and produced some stunning cross-court winners in a performance that should raise his morale after a low-key start to the season.

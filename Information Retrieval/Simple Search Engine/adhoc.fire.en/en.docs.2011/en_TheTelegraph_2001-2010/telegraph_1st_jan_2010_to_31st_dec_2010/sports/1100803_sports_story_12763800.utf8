The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal turn on style
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal turn on style
            A STAFF REPORTER            Shankar Oraon (from left) and Gauranga Dutta, who scored a brace each, with captain Snehasish Chakraborty, after the Bengal goal-fest against Mizoram, in a Santosh Trophy match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Monday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Mizoram had fan-power and Bengal had the finesse. With clinical precision, the 29-time champions humiliated the boys from Northeast 7-1 in their second quarter final league match of the Santosh Trophy, at the Salt Lake Stadium, here on Monday.         
	Shabbir Alis men are now all but through to the semi-finals of the National Football Championships with four points from two matches. Save Tarif Ahmeds goal (fourth of the match) which was due to a big-time bungle by goalkeeper Danny Lalrohlua, all the other goals were a result of well-orchestrated moves.         
	The Bengal coach should be doubly happy as his twin change in the starting line-up worked wonders. While Gauranga Duttas incisive runs down right were very effective, Shankar Oraon combined well with Tarif Ahmed upfront bringing in a lot of thrust.         
	Both Gauranga and Shankar scored brace, while Jayanta Sen and substitute Nilendra Dewan also found the back of the net with impressive strikes.         
	It was a total team effort, a beaming Shabbir said at the end of the match.         
	The VIP gallery of the Salt Lake Stadium looked as if it was a stadium in Aizawl. Around 200 young Mizoram supporters, armed with drums and vuvuzelas cheered every Mizroram move. And when Mizoram made it 1-5, thanks to F Lalmuanpuias strike in the 68 th minute, they celebrated as if it was the winner!         
	Still all these cheers hardly had any positive effect on the Mizoram team. The Jerry Zirsanghas and Roberts could simply watch in awe as the likes of Snehasish, Gauranga, Jayanta Sen and Denson Devadas took complete control of the midfield.         
	The match was as good as over in the first half itself with the scoreboard reading Bengal 4 Mizoram 0. Even the newly-appointed East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan lost interest and left midway through second half.         
	The first goal came in the ninth minute, when Tarif kept a low centre for Shankar to slot home.         
	The second came in the 29th when Snehasish overlapped from the left and kept a measured cross for Gauranga, who headed home from an acute angle. Gauranga made it 3-0 in the 38th minute with a drop volley after Bengal captain kept another neat centre from the left.         
	Snehasish may be a player with limited abilities but, on his day, he can be devastating on wide left. Even his teammate Ishfaq Ahmed, who was at the ground rooting for Bengal, would agree.         
	The second half saw some good goals, including one when Shankar made a 30-yard sprint before rounding off the goalie. Jayanta played a one-two and then slipped past a couple of defenders and scored with an angular shot. The last one was scored by Nilendra Dewan. His acrobatic volley did not give the rival goalkeeper a chance to move.         
	One can only hope that hosts keep up the good work in the remaining matches.         
	Teams         
	Bengal: Sandip Nandy, Rajib Ghosh, Arnab Mondal (Anupam Sarkar, 86th), Safar Sardar, R. Dhanarajan, Snehasish Chakraborty (Robin Singh 87th), Jayanta Sen, Denson Devadas, Gauranga Dutta, Tarif Ahmed (Nilendra Dewan, 65th), Shankar Oraon         
	Mizoram: Danny Lalrohula, F Lalmuanpuia, L Robert, David Larinmuana, Lalram Luaha (Zodinliana, 49th), F. Lalrinpuia (Lalrinfela, 54th), Lalcchuanmawaia, Lalchhanchhuaha, Z Hmar, Jerry Zirsangha, B Beikhokhei         
	Referee: A. Arjunan         
	In another match of the same group, Tamil Nadu produced a late equaliser to draw 1-1 with Delhi. Tamil Nadu now have four points from two matches while Delhi have two from as many outings.         
	Both the teams started on a cautious note and failed to produce same class of football, which they played in their previous matches. While Delhi failed to combine in the midfield, Tamil Nadu strikers were totally off colour.         
	Tamil Nadu came close to break the deadlock in the 23rd minute, but a fine save by last match hero, Pronoy Roy denied P.C. Riju to open his account as it resulted in a corner. On the resultant corner, M. Pradeep header was just marginally over the woodwork as Tamil Nadu failed to utilise the only chance of the first half.

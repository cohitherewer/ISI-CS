The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gunners aim to fire
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gunners aim to fire
                      
	London: Aiming for the pinnacle in Europe, Arsenal are left with a mountain to climb after the quarter final draw pitted Arsene Wengers boys against holders Barcelona. But the challenge this week  to stay in contention in the English Premier League  should be easily dealt with when West Ham United visit the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.         
	Arsenal should be too strong at home for West Ham even thought Wengers team needed an injury-time winner from the erratic Nicklas Bendtner to beat relegation-haunted Hull 2-1 on Sunday.         
	Like Chelsea, Arsenal have two points to make up on Manchester United and cant afford to drop points at home to their London rivals, who are only three points above the relegation zone.         
	But Arsenal, and United, who play Liverpool on Sunday, could become distracted by their attempts to win the Champions League.         
	The time is therefore ripe for Chelsea to answer their critics by returning to the top of the table. (Agencies)

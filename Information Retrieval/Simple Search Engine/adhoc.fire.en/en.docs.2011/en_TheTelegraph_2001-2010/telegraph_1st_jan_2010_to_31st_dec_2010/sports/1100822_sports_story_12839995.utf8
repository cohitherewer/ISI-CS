	Mason: World No. 1 Rafael Nadal fell to Cypruss Marcos Baghdatis 4-6, 6-4, 4-6 in the quarter finals of the Cincinnati Masters, on Friday, as three of the top four seeds lost out.         
	Britains Andy Murray and Serbian Novak Djokovic both suffered defeats to American opponents with Mardy Fish and Andy Roddick advancing to meet each other Saturday.         
	The only member of the top four to progress was third-seed Roger Federer, who meets a confident Baghdatis for a spot in Sundays final after defeating Russian Nikolay Davydenko 6-4, 7-5.         
	In doubles, Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi booked a semi-final berth after sailing past Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski in straight sets.         
	The fourth seeds scored a comfortable 6-3, 6-2 win over the eight-seeded Polish pair in the quarter finals of the $24,30,000 hard court event.         
	They will next take on fifth seeds Lukasz Kubot of Poland and Oliver Marach of Austria.         
	Nadal was well below his best against an inspired Baghdatis, whose big serve was on full power  he blasted 18 aces while the Spaniard could manage just four.         
	The match turned decisively in favour of the Cypriot, who had lost all six previous meetings with Nadal when the Spaniard double-faulted at break point with the game at 4-4 in the third.         
	It was a mistake the Nadal described as criminal and the 20th ranked Baghdatis served out for the win, giving himself a major confidence boost ahead of the US Open, which begins on August 30.         
	Im playing good; Im feeling happy on court. Im out of injuries. Its nice when you wake up and you dont have pain somewhere, said the Cypriot, beaten finalist in Washington earlier this month.         
	An All-American semi-final is a timely boost for the game in the US which is currently without a top ten male player  although Roddicks win assures he is back to at least ninth in next weeks rankings.         
	Roddick and Fish are close friends who, since their high school days, have spent many hours together practising.         
	There wont be many secrets thats for sure, Roddick said after beating third-ranked Serb Djokovic 6-4, 7-5, his booming serve looking back to its best.         
	We know each other probably better than any other two guys on the tour, added Roddick, who has been struggling for fitness and recently revealed he has been hampered by mononucleosis.         
	But, after his win over fifth-ranked Swede Robin Soderling Thursday and his confident display against Djokovic, the Texan is looking in good shape for the US Open.

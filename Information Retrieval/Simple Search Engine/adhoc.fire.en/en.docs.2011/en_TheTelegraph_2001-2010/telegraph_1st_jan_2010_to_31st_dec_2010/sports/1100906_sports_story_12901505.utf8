The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | France in need of elusive win
                                                                                                                       7                                      France in need of elusive win
                      
	London: France need a victory against Bosnia-Herzegovina, on Tuesday, to kickstart their European Championship qualifying campaign after the beleaguered teams World Cup hangover continued with a surprise home defeat to Belarus in their group D opener.

	Were not scoring many at the moment, said Blanc, who is yet to taste success as France coach since taking over from Raymond Domenech.         
	Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema should return from an ankle injury that forced him out of the Belarus match but Blanc is still short up front. There is a lot of expectation at international level and we need to do more, said Florrent Malouda.

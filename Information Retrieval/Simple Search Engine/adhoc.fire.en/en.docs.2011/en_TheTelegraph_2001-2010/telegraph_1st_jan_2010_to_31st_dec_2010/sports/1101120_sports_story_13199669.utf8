The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Looking to improve all the time: Vettori
                                                                                                                       7                                        Looking to improve all the time: Vettori
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Daniel Vettori in Nagpur, on Friday                           
	Nagpur: Daniel Vettori believes New Zealand will be judged on how they perform in the final Test, beginning Saturday.         
	This one is the most important for us. I think our team will be judged more on this Test rather than the previous two. We cant be satisfied. The moment you are satisfied in world cricket, it is the start of your downfall, the visiting captain said on Friday.         
	We can never put ourselves in that position because we arent good enough yet and we are looking to improve all the time. We are happy with what we have done but we are definitely not satisfied. Our expectations are high even though we are the eighth-ranked team in the world, he added.         
	Vettori put it down to excellent preparations after the rout in the one-day series in Bangladesh.         
	We prepared exceptionally well and we got confidence from that preparation, he said.         
	Elaborating on the preparations, Vettori said they focused on winning the series here. We knew India are a huge challenge here and our talks were mainly about coming here to try and win a series. As soon as the talk veers to draws and gutsy losses, then thats not a good sign. The team picked itself up pretty quickly. We want to continue all the hard work that we have put in so far, he said.         
	Its important that we dont get ahead of ourselves and just let the Test match play itself out. But we are certainly excited to be in this position and we hope we will continue the good work that we have done so far, Vettori added.         
	Vettori didnt wish to pick the favourite going into the final Test. Thats for the media to decide. Both, Dhoni and I think about the game reasonably similarly and go into the game preparing and playing as best as one can.         
	We just have to come back a little harder. We still expect India to be at their best and we know that they have got some amazing players.

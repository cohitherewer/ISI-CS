	Johannesburg: The battle between the biggest and the smallest nation in this World Cup ended on an even note when the United States came back from a 0-2 deficit to hold Slovenia 2-2 in a Group C match at the Ellis Park, on Friday.         
	Ellis Park wore a festive look hours before the match started as supporters of both the teams packed the stands though the Americans fans far outnumbered the Slovenians. A victory for Slovenia would have meant a second-round berth for the country of two million people and they nearly achieved it before the US staged a superb comeback.         
	On the other hand, after being gifted a 1-1 opening draw with England on goalkeeper Robert Greens now-infamous fumble, the US needed a victory to overtake Slovenia, 1-0 winners over Algeria in their first group league encounter. The 2-2 draw leaves both teams with a chance to qualify for the last 16.         
	Slovenia, who had the better of the exchanges early in the match, opened the scoring in the 13th minute when Valter Birsas left-footed strike from around 30 yards flew past the US goalkeeper Tim Howard and crashed into the net. It was a brilliant effort that even had the Slovenian fans stunned for a few seconds.         
	The second Slovenian goal came against the run of play shortly before half time as the Americans were pressing hard for the equaliser. After Miso Brecko sent a through ball, Zlatan Ljubijankic broke the off-side trap to make it 2-0.         
	But the US coach Bob Bradley made a double change at the interval and the move paid immediate dividends with Landon Donavon racing clear on the right and firing high into the roof of the net. Encouraged by the effort, US pushed for the equaliser and found it eight minutes before the final whistle when Bradleys son Michael put the ball in the back of the net.         
	Three minutes later, Maurice Edu scored again for the US but the goal was disallowed as the referee had already blown the whistle for a foul inside the box. Slovenia were definitely lucky to leave the pitch with one point.         
	Expectedly, Bradley was upset with the referee for negating the goal. I am not sure why the goal was not given in our favour, he said. But thats the way things go what can we do about it, he said. This match boosted our confidence. We showed we can also do it at this stage, added Bradley.         
	Donovan said he had repeatedly asked referee Koman Coulibaly from Mali for an explanation but got none. I am assuming it was a foul somewhere. It could not have been offside. We asked him where the foul was but he did not say. To be honest I dont know how much English he speaks. When we asked him numerous times in a non-controversial manner he ignored us, Donovan said.         
	We scored three goals and I would be really interested to find out what the referee called on that last one. As far as I am concerned we should have been leading 3-2, Clint Dempsey said.         
	Slovenia coach Matjaz Kek was left rueing a missed opportunity to reach the second round. We played a fantastic first half but the goal we conceded straight after the break rattled us and we never recovered from it, Kek told a news conference after the pulsating clash. It was a lapse in concentration after which we lost our focus and allowed them back into the match.

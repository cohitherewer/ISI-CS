The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Webber sets the pace at practice
                                                                                                                       7                                      Webber sets the pace at practice
                      
	Silverstone: Red Bulls Mark Webber made a flying start to his British GP weekend on Friday with the fastest lap in the free practice at a revamped Silverstone.         
	Back on track less than two weeks after escaping unscathed when his car flew high into the air in a huge crash in Valencia, the rugged Australian laid down a benchmark with a hot lap of one minute 31.234 seconds.         
	His German teammate Sebastian Vettel, winner of that previous race in Spain as well as from pole position at Silverstone last year, had been quickest in the morning in 1:32.280.         
	Webbers afternoon was clouded only when his car suffered an electrical problem that kept him in the garage for the final 15 minutes. Team boss Christian Horner said it was nothing major.         
	While both Red Bull drivers looked at home at Silverstone, and Ferrari picked up from an anonymous morning session to clock the second fastest lap after lunch with Fernando Alonso, McLaren showed no sign of an expected big step forward.         
	Championship leader Lewis Hamilton was second fastest in the morning, 0.334 off Vettels pace, but then slipped to eighth while reigning champion Jenson Button was only 13th quickest. Michael Schumacher was sixth in a Mercedes.         
	Adrian Sutil of Force India came in at ninth in the second session after finishing fifth in the first while teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi sat out the opening session to allow team test driver Paul di Resta a stint in the car in front of his home crowd.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Smith out of IPL
                                                                                                                       7                                      Smith out of IPL
                      
	New Delhi: The Rajasthan Royals, champions of the first edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), are having a harrowing time this season. After defeats in their first two matches, the Shane Warne-led side will now be without star players Graeme Smith and Dmitri Mascarenhas for the remainder of the IPL.         
	Warne wrote on Twitter that both Smith and Mascarenhas would not be available for the rest of the tournament because of their finger and ankle injuries, respectively.         
	Unfortunately Smith and Mascarenhas are going home due to injury, Warne said. Its a big setback for us as Smith and Mascarenhas are very good players for the Royals and their experience will be hugely missed.         
	Mascarenhas twisted his ankle while Smith hurt his right middle finger while catching Virender Sehwag, both in Ahmedabad against the Delhi DareDevils, on Monday.         
	I have a double fracture in my right middle finger, and so will be missing the IPL. I hurt it taking the catch off Sehwag last night (Monday). When I landed, my finger got hooked in the ground, Smith said.         
	Meanwhile, South Africa have recalled Smith to their one-day squad for the tour of the West Indies in May and June. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spain gear up for Chile test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Spain gear up for Chile test
                            
	Potchefstroom: Chile stand in the way of Spains lofty World Cup hopes, as the European champion go into their final Group H match on Friday needing victory to secure a spot in the knockout phase. With both Switzerland and Honduras still in the mix for one of the last two places in the last 16, Spain know its time to live up to pre-tournament expectations or potentially go home early.         
	For us, its clear what we have to do  we have to beat Chile, said midfielder Andres Iniesta, who is available for the final group match after overcoming a right leg injury.         
	Weve got a clear idea about what we need to do and were confident of reaching the next round. Nothing else is important.         
	Whether its the World Cup favorite tag slapped on it, overconfidence, fatigue after long club seasons or tactical changes, Spain hasnt quite been able to emulate the attractive play that led it to their European triumph two years ago.         
	Despite dominating opponents, they have only found the back of the net twice through David Villa in a 2-0 win over Honduras.         
	Switzerland stifled them in a 1-0 win that led to questions over coach Vicente del Bosques tinkering with the team as he prefers defensive midfielders Sergio Busquets and Xabi Alonso over the likes of attacking players like Cesc Fabregas and David Silva.         
	Likely Teams         
	Spain (4-4-2): 1-Iker Casillas, 15-Sergio Ramos, 3-Gerard Pique, 5-Carles Puyol, 11-Joan Capdevila, 16-Sergio Busquets, 14-Xabi Alonso, 8-Xavi, 6-Andres Iniesta, 9-Fernando Torres, 7-David Villa.         
	Chile (4-4-2): 1-Claudio Bravo, 4-Mauricio Isla, 17-Gary Medel, 3-Waldo Ponce, 18-Gonzalo Jara, 8-Arturo Vidal, 20-Rodrigo Millar, 10-Jorge Valdivia, 9-Humberto Suazo, 15-Juan Beausejour, 7-Alexis Sanchez,         
	Referee: Marco Rodriguez (Mexico)           (AGENCIES)

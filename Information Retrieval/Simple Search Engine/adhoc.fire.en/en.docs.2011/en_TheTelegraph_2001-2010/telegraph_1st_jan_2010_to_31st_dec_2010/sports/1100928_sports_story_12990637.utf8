The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not fazed by delays: Sushil
                                                                                                                       7                                      Not fazed by delays: Sushil
                      
	New Delhi: Brushing aside all talks of delays in construction of the venues and training centres hampering the preparations for the Commonwealth Games, World wrestling champion Sushil Kumar Monday said that such delays do not deter a sportsperson from getting ready for a big event.         
	All these delays in setting up venues do not affect a sportsman as he is always focused on making his preparations and continuing with his training. We, as players, are not so bothered about all these things (delays) and would like to concentrate on our game, the Beijing Olympic Games bronze-medallist said.         
	I would also urge the media to ignore all the negative things surrounding the Games and focus on the positive aspects. After all, the countrys prestige is at stake, he added.         
	Beaming with confidence after becoming the first Indian to win a gold medal at the World Wrestling Championship in Moscow earlier this month, Sushil said he was hoping to translate his recent performance during the October 3-14 Games.         
	I hope to do well. Even the other members of the team are preparing well and working very hard. So, we all are pretty confident of giving our best during the mega-event, said the freestyle wrestler.         
	Sushil also predicted that India would bag at least 10 to 15 golds in the Games. There are a total of 21 gold medals up for grab and I feel that we would be able to win at least 10 to 15 of them.

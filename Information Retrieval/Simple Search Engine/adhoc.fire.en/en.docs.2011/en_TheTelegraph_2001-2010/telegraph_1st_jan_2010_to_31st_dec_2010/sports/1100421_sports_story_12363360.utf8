  - French side travel by minivans to keep semis date with Bayern             Bayern Munich players during a practice session in Munich, on Tuesday. (AP)                           
	Munich: Bayern Munich will have a distinct advantage going into their Champions League semi-final against Lyon as the German hosts have been spared a long journey. Bayern, though, have their own distraction, and sought to deflect uncomfortable questions about star winger Franck Ribery.         
	Lyon, playing in their first ever Champions League semis, had to borrow 10 minivans from their academy to travel to Munich as their flight plans were scuppered by the cloud of ash spewing out from an Icelandic volcano.         
	I think its bothersome before a match like this, Bayern defender Philipp Lahm said. But on the day of the match you are so full of adrenaline, you wont think about it.         
	Lyon were on their way to Stuttgart on Monday, spending the night there and then driving on to Munich on Tuesday morning. Coach trips remind me of when I was young in Brazil, joked Brazil defender Cris, the Lyon captain. Its difficult for everybody but we have to accept it, he told reporters.         
	Were feeling good, were about to play our first semi-final. What we need to do is forget about the trip to focus on our match. Well be ready.         
	The issue Bayern have at hand is that of France international Ribery providing testimony for investigators probing a suspected prostitution ring believed to have been operated out of a Paris nightclub.         
	Sophie Bottai, Riberys lawyer, says no charges were filed against him and that he was not held in police custody. Bayern effectively clamped down on the subject, leaving Ribery out of the news conference Tuesday although he had been scheduled to appear, and telling other players not to discuss the subject with reporters. Daniel van Buyten, Bayerns French-speaking Belgian defender, fended off questions from French reporters by saying Ribery practised very well on Tuesday.         
	Hes very motivated and very happy to be playing in the semi-finals... Van Buyten said, adding that the clubs press chief had told players not to discuss anything else about Ribery.

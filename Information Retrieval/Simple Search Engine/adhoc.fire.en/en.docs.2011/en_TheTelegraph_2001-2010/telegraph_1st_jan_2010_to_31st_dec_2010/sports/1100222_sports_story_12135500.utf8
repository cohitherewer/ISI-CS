The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Luck was not on our side, says Kallis
                                                                                                                       7                                      Luck was not on our side, says Kallis
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Jaipur: South African stand-in captain Jacques Kallis is in no mood to throw in the towel after his teams narrow one-run defeat against India in the first one-dayer on Sunday.         
	We have been in this position in the sub-continent before, said Kallis after the match. Kallis also felt that his team was rather unlucky to lose the thrilling encounter.               
	Following our excerpts                 
	Whether his team was unlucky         
	A Luck was not in our side. Things could have been different had the boundary (which was referred to TV umpire after Sachin Tendulkar cut short to save one run) been given. But it was third umpires call and not ours. We have got to accept it and get on.         
	We simply did not have luck. You saw a (Charl) Langeveldt delivery hitting the stump and going for a four (without dislodging the bail) and you know we didnt have luck.         
	Wayne Parnells performance         
	Parnell is a talented cricketer and he will take a lot away from the match. He has all the qualities to become a good all-rounder.         
	On losing wickets at regular intervals         
	We kept on losing wickets and that created a problem. When you lose wickets then its becomes very difficult to accelerate. In the next two matches, we have to make sure that we dont give away soft wickets.         
	Being 0-1 down in the series         
	We have been in this position in the sub-continent before. If we play the cricket we are capable of playing, then we can get back into the series. We chose to field first because we thought that the dew would come into play later on. And it did because we saw the Indians wiping the ball and it was coming onto the bat a little better.         
	The positives         
	After the Calcutta Test, here, too we came close before losing the match. This is heart-breaking but we have showed our fighting spirit. Wayne (Parnell) and Dale (Steyn) played unbelievably good to get that close.         
	Whether 298 was gettable         
	We thought so. I think we did well to restrict them to 298 when, at one stage, they looked like getting 320-330. We came back well and took vital wickets. I think it was a good effort by the bowlers.         
	On Hashim Amlas exclusion         
	He was not part of the original ODI squad. But most guys will get a chance in the series.

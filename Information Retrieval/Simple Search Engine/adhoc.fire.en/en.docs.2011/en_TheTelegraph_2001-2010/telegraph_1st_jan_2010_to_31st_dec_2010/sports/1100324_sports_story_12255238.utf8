The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australia triumph
                                                                                                                       7                                      Australia triumph
                      
	Wellington: It took Australia longer than they expected, but Phillip Hughes final-day blast allowed them to finish the work and gain a 1-0 lead against New Zealand Tuesday.         
	Brendon McCullums inspired 104 forced the visitors to chase 106, a target they achieved without loss before lunch, thanks to Hughes aggressive 86 off 75 balls, according to Cricinfo.         
	After spending over four days in the field, Ryan Harris, the debutant, finished off New Zealand quickly, taking four for 77 as the hosts were dismissed for 407. Hughes, who grabbed 12 fours and a six, was then in a hurry to end the game and earned to the 10-wicket victory in 23 overs. It was left to Simon Katich, who played the anchors role with 18, to take the winning single off the final ball before lunch.         
	Daniel Vettori came on and his first delivery was hit by Hughes through the covers for four, and his fourth effort went for a six over mid-wicket. Hughes charged down the wicket and swiped it flat and so hard that it came back damaged after hitting the bitumen in the car park.

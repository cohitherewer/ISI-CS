            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Thursday said, in a media release, that it may consider increasing the number of participating teams in the World Twenty20 while reducing the number in the 50-over World Cup.         
	The decision was taken during the two-day ICC Executive Board meeting in Singapore. Speaking on the issue ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said: There is clearly an appetite from all quarters to examine the make-up of the ICC Cricket World Cup and the ICC World Twenty20 and seek the best balance between excellence and development. In terms of the number of participating teams, it is possible that the World Cup could be reduced and the World Twenty20 expanded.         
	The other decisions which were taken during the two-day meeting were as follows:         
	Decision Review System (DRS): Following recommendations from the ICC cricket committee and minor amendments from the chief executives committee, the ICC Board approved 13 recommendations relating to the use of DRS in Test matches and the 2011 ODI World Cup. One of the decisions is that the host member would determine whether to use DRS in home Test series (following consultation with the visiting country).         
	Wanderers Test Match / DRS review: Daryl Harper, the third umpire in the South Africa-England Test at the Wanderers, was given clean chit by the ICC over his controversial decision. The ICC added that technical failure led to the incident.         
	Anti-doping Code: The ICC Board approved the revised rules with minor amendments to be agreed relating to the detailed whereabouts provision of the ICC Anti-doping Code. The code will come into effect on 1 August 2010. Lorgat said: I am satisfied that we have now resolved the long outstanding issue of filing whereabouts information and the contribution of the BCCI in finding a solution needs to be acknowledged.

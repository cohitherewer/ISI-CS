                                                                                                                       7                                      Hope to keep the momentum going: Pragyan
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: Pragyan Ojha, who took two wickets on Saturday, said they would be looking forward to wrapping up the New Zealand tail as early as possible on the second morning of the Test.         
	 Weve gone one up on the opening day We hope to continue this momentum we will have to finish off the tail early tomorrow, put up a good score and the put pressure on them, Ojha said.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni had, on Friday, said that the left-arm spinners role was to contain batsmen and Ojha insisted that he has no qualms about it.         
	When youre playing for the country and the team needs you to do something, thats what you should do, he said. When the wickets turning, you have to attack. When its in the batsmens favour, I feel that if we give loose runs, we will only have to make up for that.         
	I know I have to bowl very straight, but I dont bowl negatively. Yes, Im trying to contain the runs but Im still attacking the stumps, he maintained.

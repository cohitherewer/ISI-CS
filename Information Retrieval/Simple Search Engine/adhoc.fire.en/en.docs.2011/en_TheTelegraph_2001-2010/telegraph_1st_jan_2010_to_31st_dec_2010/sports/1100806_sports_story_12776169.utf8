The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hernandez steals the show in United victory
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hernandez steals the show in United victory
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Wayne Rooney managed 45 minutes on his return to action as Manchester United cruised to a 7-1 victory against a League of Ireland XI in Dublin Wednesday, but it was left to Javier Hernandez, the clubs new Mexican striker, to capture the imagination.         
	Rooney appeared fit and hungry on his first start since Englands World Cup exit to Germany on June 27. He showed no ill effects from his extended break following his exertions in South Africa.         
	He dropped deep to collect possession, ran menacingly at his nervous hosts defence and combined well with Michael Owen, playing his first game since injuring his hamstring in February, as United eased into a two-goal half-time lead, thanks to Ji-Sung Parks fortuitous opener  the ball ricocheting off his leg as Gavin Peers failed to clear his lines  and the former Liverpool strikers delicate lob.         
	Hernandez, a  7 million signing from Chivas, offered tantalising glimpses of his ability when scoring against the MLS All-Stars in Houston last week and for his former side against his new employers in Guadalajara, and his fine first impression continued here.         
	Little more than two minutes after replacing Rooney, Hernandez, known as Chicharito, swept home John Sheas low cross. After goals from Antonio Valencia, a second from Park and Jonny Evans, the 22-year-old won the penalty, converted by Nani, which completed the rout. Dave Mulcahy, the St Patricks striker, scored the hosts consolation.

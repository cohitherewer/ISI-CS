The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fresh salvo at IOC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fresh salvo at IOC
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Three days after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) threatened India with sanctions for the attempted regulation of tenures of national sports officials, the Union ministry of sports hit back saying the proposed regulations were as per the recommendations of the international body.         
	In a letter to IOC president Jacques Rogge, a senior sports ministry official pointed out that the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and other sports federations had been advised to adopt the Basic universal principles of good governance of Olympic and sports movements recommended by the IOC seminar in February 2008 and endorsed by the Olympic Congress in October 2009.         
	The ministry also claimed that in more than 30 countries, including the US, France, Italy, Hungary, Mauritius, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, the sports federations are regulated by government laws.         
	These countries have enacted sports legislation, which contain several mandatory provisions that their sports federations have to conform with to obtain recognition and financial support from the government.         
	For example, the US Amateur Sports Act, 1978 makes it mandatory for the US Olympic Committee to reserve 20 per cent of membership and voting rights in favour of amateur athletes who have represented the country in the preceding 10 years.         
	Similarly, the Sri Lanka Sport Law of 1973 prescribes a two-term tenure limit for sports administrators; besides empowering the sports minister to dissolve national sports associations and appoint interim bodies, the letter said.         
	Requesting the IOC president to schedule a meeting with ministry officials in order to clear the confusion, the letter alleged that a few people who had their axe to grind were attempting to create a false crisis. These people, the ministry claimed, were trying to protect their unduly long tenures with different sports bodies in India.         
	The ministry also severely criticised IOA secretary general Randhir Singh without actually naming him in the letter.         
	It is unfortunate that the IOC member from India has not even cared to consult us before taking up the matter with you thereby exposing his conflict of interest as well, since he has been holding the post of secretary general, IOA for over two decades, the letter said.

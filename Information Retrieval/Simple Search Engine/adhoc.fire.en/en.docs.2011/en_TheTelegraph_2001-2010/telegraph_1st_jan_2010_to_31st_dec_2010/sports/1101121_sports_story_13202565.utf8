            OUR CORRESPONDENT             Wriddhiman                           
	Nagpur: Two uncapped pacers, in a pack of five, have been included for the three-Test series against South Africa, starting December. Bengals wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha has found a place in the 17-member squad as the second keeper ahead of Gujarat skipper Parthiv Patel.         
	Saurashtra pacer Jaydev Unadkat, who was drafted in for the injured Zaheer Khan in the third Test against New Zealand, and Vidarbhas Umesh Yadav have also found a berth.         
	Yuvraj Singh was once again overlooked when the five-man selection committee met to pick the team here, on Saturday evening.         
	Both Unadkat and Yadav had impressed during IPL-III playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Delhi Daredevils respectively.         
	Yadav was part of the Indian squad that toured Zimbabwe in May-June and played three one-dayers.         
	A batch of eight players would leave for South Africa with coach Gary Kirsten on December 6 for a short conditioning camp before the Test series. The camp will most likely be held in Cape Town.         
	Chairman of selectors Krishnamachari Srikkanth refused to dwell much on the South Africa tour, as he wanted to concentrate on the New Zealand series first.         
	I believe in the present. Lets win this Test series versus New Zealand first Only then we will think about South Africa and the World Cup Im optimistic that we will do well, Srikkanth said.         
	According to the chief selector, Zaheer Khan will play one of the five ODIs against New Zealand to prove his fitness before leaving for South Africa. The first Test begins in Centurion on December 16.

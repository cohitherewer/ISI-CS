            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Indian Premier League was in disarray on Tuesday after the Rajasthan Royals obtained a six-week stay on the termination of their franchise rights by the BCCI.         
	The stay order, essentially an interim relief, came after the sole arbitrator hearing the Royals petition in the Bombay high court found the termination order prima facie illegal.         
	The six-week period set by the arbitrator, Justice B.N. Srikrishna, effectively paves the way for the Jaipur franchise to participate in the players auction to be held on January 8-9 in Mumbai.         
	It also indicates that the arbitrator hopes to wrap up the proceedings within that period.         
	There will be no interference with them (Royals) exercising their rights under the franchise agreement. They will be allowed to participate in the auction, Justice Srikrishna said.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) brass will be meeting the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise owners in Mumbai on June 24.         
	The governing council of the IPL will meet the next day. This will be their first meeting of the council after the suspension of Lalit Modi.         
	It may be recalled that the BCCI has slapped three showcause notices on Modi. He has replied to two of these notices and also demanded through another letter that BCCI president Shashank Manohar and secretary N. Srinivasan recuse themselves from any future disciplinary proceedings against him.         
	The new players auction ahead of IPL-IV is another important issue that would crop up at the council meeting to be chaired by the interim head Chirayu Amin.         
	The issue of retention of a specific number of Indian and overseas players by the original eight franchisees is contentious with the addition of two new franchise outfits  Pune and Kochi  into the IPL fold.         
	Opinions are divided over the number of players who can be retained by the original franchises for season IV and beyond.

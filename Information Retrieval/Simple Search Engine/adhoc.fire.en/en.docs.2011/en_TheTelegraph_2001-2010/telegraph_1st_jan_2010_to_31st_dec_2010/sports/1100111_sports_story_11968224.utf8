            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: Bruckner had no peers in the field of seven. The Pesi Shoff-trained horse simply steamrolled the opposition on his way to winning the 2,400 Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes on Sunday. Paul Mulrennan, Shroff, who has been having a fabulous season  winning almost everything he laid his hands on, was ecstatic when asked, what prompted him to send the Ikhtyar-Allies Serenade son as a late entry which cost the owners a whopping sum of about Rs 6 lakh. I was sure Aboline would not stay mile and-a-half; said Shroff. When reminded that Aboline had beaten Jacqueline in the 2,000m Bangalore (summer) Derby. That was another story. Everything went his way in that race; added Shroff who also put paid speculations about Bruckner contesting the citys next mega event, the Champion Trophy, instead of Indian Derby. Bruckners next target is the Indian Derby; said Shroff.          
	While part-owner K.N. Dhunjiboy termed Bruckners victory as brilliant, wife Deepa, who has her roots in Bengal, said it was a fantastic win. The Abolines debacle was taken in a sporting spirit, though nobody from that camp wanted to be quoted. The 13-10 favourite led the field till 600m but was in distress to finish last.

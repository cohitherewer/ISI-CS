The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Captain Shukla draws strength from history
                                                                                                                       7                                        Captain Shukla draws strength from history
            A STAFF REPORTER            Laxmi Ratan Shukla                           
	Calcutta: The Laxmi Ratan Shukla-led Bengal team will lock horns with Saurashtra in the fourth quarter final of the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Thursday. The match will be played at the Motibagh Palace Ground in Vadodara.         
	Bengal had qualified for the final leg as the second best side, behind Orissa, from the East Zone.         
	With two wins and two losses in their kitty, Bengal will be buoyed by the presence of former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who joined the team on Wednesday.         
	Saurashtra, on the other hand, had an all-win record in the West Zone qualifiers and had also thumped Uttar Pradesh by seven wickets in the pre-quarter finals, at the same venue, on Monday.         
	Shukla, however, drew strength from the fact that Bengal had done well in the national one-dayers in the recent years.         
	We have a good team and Im confident of a good show since we have fared quite well in the national one-dayers for past few years. Our top-order is also in good form with Sourav, Manoj (Tiwary) and Sreevats (Goswami) all having decent scores in the last few matches, Shukla said.         
	Shukla also informed that the toss will be important at the Motibagh wicket, which he deems to be a low-scoring one, and he would want to chase if he wins the flip of the coin.         
	Theres a chance that the white Kookabura ball will do something during the first hour in the morning and we would surely want to exploit that, Shukla said.         
	Arindam Das and Saurasish Lahiri are set to make a comeback to the side on Thursday.         
	Arindam and Sreevats would be the obvious choice for the openers slot with Sourav coming in at No. 3. Saurasish, an off-spinner, might also come in handy as a pinch hitter, said Shukla.         
	In the bowling department, Ashok Dinda, Ranadeb Bose and Saurasish are certainties, the team management is yet to decide on the fourth slot for which pacer Sourav Sarkar and all-rounder Arnab Nandi are in the reckoning.         
	Saurashtra had hammered the Bengal bowlers at the Eden in the Ranji Trophy this season and the core of the team remains the same.         
	When reminded, Shukla said: We do have certain plans for Chirag Pathak and Cheteshwar Pujara and we hope to implement them on Thursday. Lets see how it goes, summed-up Shukla.         
	In the other quarter final match of the day, Tamil Nadu will take on Mumbai in Rajkot.

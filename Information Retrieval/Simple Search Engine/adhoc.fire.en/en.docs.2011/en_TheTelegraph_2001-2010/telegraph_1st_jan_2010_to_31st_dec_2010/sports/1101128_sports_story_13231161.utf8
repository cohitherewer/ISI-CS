The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Great challenge: Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                        Great challenge: Gambhir
  - Focus is on winning the series, not on giving an opportunity to all the players       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Gautam Gambhir, in Guwahati, on Saturday                                 
	Guwahati: Gautam Gambhir, who will be captaining Team India for the first time, in the absence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, relishes the challenge of leading the side.         
	Speaking at a media conference on the eve of the first one-day International, against New Zealand, Gambhir also said that the focus will be on winning the series and not necessarily on giving everyone a chance in the absence of the seniors.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The challenge of leading the side         
	Its a great challenge. Its a dream I am really excited and hopefully I will live up to the expectations. Its a responsibility that has been given to the team (to perform without the seniors).         
	On the absence of seniors         
	Its a great opportunity for the players. Most of them have played international cricket. They are experienced We have Ashish (Nehra) and Munaf (Patel), who have enough experience and will be looking after the bowling. In fact, its is a great opportunity for youngsters and hope they will deliver.         
	If everyone would be given a chance in the series         
	The focus, right now, is to win the game, to win the series rather than thinking about giving an opportunity to all the players. We are just about to begin the series and its too early to say that you need to give opportunity to all the players. Its an international series and you are playing for your country Rather than thinking of giving opportunity to all, we should first think of winning the series and then take it from there.         
	On Yuvraj Singh         
	India never had such a match-winner The amount of matches he has won for the team is incredible. Doubting his abilities is not the right thing to do. He already has a half-century to his name in the last one-dayer he played and had done decently in Sri Lanka as well. Its just about playing one big innings and then he will be back to his best.         
	Suresh Rainas recent poor form         
	He finishes game for us. You cant compare Test cricket with one-day cricket He has done brilliantly in the one-dayers. He has played a lot of cricket There will be ups and downs in everybodys career. We need to give them confidence and have patience. See how they (Yuvraj and Raina) have done over one-and-a-half years instead of focusing on just a few matches.         
	On Wriddhiman Sahas ODI debut         
	He has done well for Bengal. It is a great opportunity for him We know he is a good wicket-keeper and now he is also among the runs. Hope he carries his domestic form into International cricket.         
	The Guwahati wicket         
	Guwahati is always a good wicket, which might do a bit in the morning It looks a good one-day wicket. I would like to put up as much as possible, but 270-280 seems a good total because it starts spinning in the second half.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Advani, Sethi bite the dust
                                                                                                                       7                                      Advani, Sethi bite the dust
                      
	Pune: It was curtains for India in the World Billiards Championship with Geet Sethi and defending champion Pankaj Pankaj bowing out in the semi-finals of the time-format, here Friday.         
	While Sethi went down 1022-1668 to Singapores English-born Peter Gilchrist in the first semi-final, Advani lost by a margin of 1300-1417 to Mike Russell of England in the other second.         
	Gilchrist played a composed game of top table billiards, bringing his form to the fore at the right moment, to beat the Indian in the four-hour-long battle at the PYC Hindu Gymkhana.         
	Sethi struggled to even cross the 200-mark although there was a brief moment when he assumed the lead. However, that was in the early part of the match but it proved to be a flash in the pan.         
	Sethi was leading by 387 points when Gilchrist got the balls to his liking and then went about assimilating a break that turned crucial at the end. At the stroke of the second hour, he was on an unfinished break of 597 to take his lead to 210 points, something that Sethi would rue in the end. (PTI)

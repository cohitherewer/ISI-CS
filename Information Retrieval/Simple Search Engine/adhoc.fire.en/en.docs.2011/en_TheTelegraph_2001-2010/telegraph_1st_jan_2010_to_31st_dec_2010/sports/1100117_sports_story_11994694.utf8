    - Former coach looks back and ahead             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL                                          
	Chittagong: Dav Whatmore, who has moved to India and is now with the Kolkata Knight Riders, had been the Bangladesh coach when India last played a Test series against their eastern neighbours. With the latest face-off just hours away, Whatmore shared his thoughts, over the phone, with The Telegraph.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q How did Bangladesh prepare for the last Test series against India, in the summer of 2007?         
	A The Tests were preceded by the ODIs and that limited overs series was a lot closer than the 2-0 scoreline in Indias favour... With some luck, Bangladesh couldve won the first match and the confidence gained wouldve been carried forward to the two Tests... The team did have targets, like aiming to bat for 120 overs or four sessions... The idea was to make things difficult for India. That didnt exactly happen, though.         
	Given the difference between the teams, was it tough motivating your players?         
	Not really... Look, anybody playing for his country doesnt need extra motivation... The team knew that India would be out to avenge the World Cup loss, a couple of months earlier, and Rahul Dravid and Co. did come hard... Nobody, in Bangladesh, expected things to be easy.         
	Was that World Cup moment, in Port of Spain, the high point of your innings with Bangladesh?         
	One, certainly.         
	How should Bangladesh approach the Test series which begins on Sunday?         
	The No.9 team is playing the No.1... There are obvious differences in skill and ability, but Bangladesh shouldnt take the field with a defeatist attitude... Each individual must set himself a target.         
	Collectively, what would be a realistic target?         
	Take both Tests to the fifth day... Make India work for every wicket and every run... They should be made to earn runs and wickets, not get either as a gift... Bangladesh must look to stretch India.         
	Mashrafe Mortazas absence is going to be felt in a big way...         
	Yes... Hes probably okay for limited overs cricket, but isnt fit for Test matches... Hes getting there, but will have to prove his fitness in domestic cricket... Hes an important part of the Bangladesh attack.         
	Many see captain Shakib-al Hasan as the trump card. Do you agree?         
	(Laughs) Bangladesh must first figure out what is trumps... Hes probably their best player.         
	How do you rate this Indian team?         
	Very good... Anil Kumble and Sourav Ganguly had been around the last time... Theyve retired, but the team is still getting good results... The Fab Four is now one less, but no less effective... Then, the opposition also has to contend with Virender Sehwag and his partner, Gautam Gambhir, at the top.         
	Any weaknesses?         
	The teams playing very well.         
	Do you agree with Ian Chappells views?         
	The Indians definitely have two pretty decent bowlers  Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh... Somebody like Ishant Sharma has a lot of potential, but he must understand his game...         
	Did Chappells comment about the quality of Indias bowling surprise you?         
	Not surprised... I think he meant that India lacked match-winners of the calibre of Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath... To win Tests, you need to consistently take 20 wickets.         
	Just how important are rankings?         
	Ultimately, rankings are everything... India and Australia will measure themselves by the rankings, but it has to be different for Bangladesh. For Bangladesh, it should be whether the individual and collective targets are being realised... At this stage, they shouldnt be focusing on the numbers, but judging themselves differently.         
	Will you be following the series?         
	Like I follow any other series.         
	Is there actually a need for specialist bowling or batting coaches/consultants?         
	Yes... Their presence will allow the head coach to spend quality time with his players, instead of having to spread himself around.         
	Your Knights colleague, Wasim Akram, wanted to know just who is Eric Simons, Indias newly-appointed bowling consultant. Does the name ring a bell?         
	He was South Africas coach when I was with Sri Lanka (for the second time)... So, I do know about him.         
	The final one: Isnt it odd that the calendar is structured in such a manner that some teams dont feature in a Test series for six-seven months?         
	The way things are, a long break isnt uncommon...

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hameed: God knows what they were up to
                                                                                                                       7                                        Hameed: God knows what they were up to
            A STAFF REPORTER            Yasir Hameed leaves the Pakistan High Commission in London, on Sunday                           
	Calcutta: Former Pakistan opener Yasir Hameed has claimed that his teammates were involved in fixing almost every match even as a fourth touring Pakistan player came under investigation in the scam which grew in proportion after fresh disclosures.         
	Even before the dust could settle over the suspension of the tainted trio of Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer, British tabloid, News of the World, came out with more explosive revelations (briefly reported in Sundays CM edition).         
	Hameed told the tabloid in a Nottingham hotel that he had been asked by a bookmaker to help fix a Test for 100,000, but turned down the money and said his teammates were fixing almost every match.         
	Theyve been caught. Only the ones that get caught are branded crooks. They were doing it (fixing) in almost every match. God knows what they were up to. Scotland Yard was after them for ages, Hameed was quoted as saying.         
	Since he would not get involved in all these, Hameed claimed: Thats why I was out of the team for two years  two years! Now God has punished them. I played in the (Lords) match. Even though I flopped, these guys have been caught out.         
	Just look at my average. Its 38, 39 (runs scored per innings). Which player in the world has that average and is dropped?         
	If I was playing for any other country, what would I be now? Id be the team captain.         
	In his first 30 one-day Internationals, he scored more runs than any other batsman. Yet, he has bounced in and out of the national team.         
	Despite the interview being widely televised across the world, the 32-year-old Hameed denied having spoken to the tabloid. I am deeply disturbed. There is no truth in that report. I have never spoken to them. I cant even think of accusing my teammates, he said.         
	Hameed was Sunday summoned to the countrys High Commission in London. He reached there in the afternoon and met high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Ijaz Butt.         
	Hameed, incidentally, also spoke to the tabloid about other games that might have been thrown.         
	In the ICC Champions Trophy, at Rose Bowl, we lost a match against the West Indies, do you remember?         
	The match in question is a semi-final game in 2004 . The West Indies won the match by seven wickets despite posting just 132 runs after Pakistan ended at 131.         
	If you sat here and said, Im a bookie and I want you to fix the match tomorrow  Ive met lots of people like that in the past and I refused. They offered me handsome money.         
	I could have come to see you in a Ferrari. They give you so much money that you can live out your dreams, buy a flash car. Ive been offered huge amounts of money, up to 150,000.         
	The truth is Ive never sold a match for Pakistan. Ive always got by on legitimate money. I come from a middle-class hard-working family, he said.         
	He (Majeed) pays the players whatever the rate is. I think they get 20,000 or 25,000 for no balls. God knows what was the deal, I didnt ask.         
	Hameed asked how Asif had been able to amass a big property.         
	Im having a house built and its stopped halfway, said Hameed. Im building it from legitimate money and work has stopped.         
	Asif  how many matches has he played and how many have I played? Ive played 80 matches and hes played around 50. He has four mansions. Where did they come from?         
	He has just built a house in Italian style in Lahore. You go there and you will think you are in Italy  thats how good his house is.

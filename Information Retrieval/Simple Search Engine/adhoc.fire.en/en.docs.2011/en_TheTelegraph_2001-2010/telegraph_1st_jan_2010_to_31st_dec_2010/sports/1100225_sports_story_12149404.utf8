            OUR BUREAU                      
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was an elated man at the post-match presentation ceremony on Wednesday as his team recorded a 153-run victory in the second one-day International to pocket the series.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Dhoni: (Dinesh) Karthik and Sachin (Tendulkar) batted really well. They gave us the platform to put up a good total. The way Sachin played and carried his bat through was exceptional Even when he got tired, he used the pace of the ball excellently. It was certainly one of the best innings.         
	Its also important to have someone like Yusuf (Pathan) in the line-up. The decision to push him up the order was important for the team as well as his confidence. With his talent, he can really be an asset to the side.         
	Kallis: The toss was quite vital The wicket gradually became tougher to bat on. But at the end, our basics were just not good and we were outplayed today (Wednesday). We lost wickets in crucial situations.         
	Sachin was fantastic He took advantage of the conditions.

	Chennai: After succeeding to break into top-100 and grab gold medals at Commonwealth Games and Asian Games in 2010, Indias numero uno singles player Somdev Dev Varman is eyeing a top-50 slot in season-2011, beginning with Chennai Open, here, from Monday.         
	Somdev, who was a finalist at Indias only ATP event in 2009, said he would try to remain in top-100 in the new season and climb up the rankings ladder.         
	Asked about his aim for the new season, Somdev, on Thursday, said he has set higher targets like (getting into) top-75 and top-50. Currently ranked 108, Somdev said, Ill try to get better and better every day.         
	Talking about the medal wins at CWG in New Delhi and at Asian Games in Guangzhou, he said, Obviously that was a great result and Ive had a good pre-season. I am looking forward to Chennai Open. My game is a bit passive, so Ive been trying to retrieve balls more often. Against top players you dont get too many chances, (so) youll have to take them, he said.         
	Asked who he considered the biggest challenge from among the players in the fray at the Chennai Open, Somdev said, There are a lot of talented players like Tomas Berdych, Marin Cilic and Janko Tipsarevic, but the most important thing to me is who I am playing first. Ill only progress to the later rounds if I cross the first stage.         
	The qualifying rounds of the tournament will start on Saturday while the main draw is scheduled to begin on Monday. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhaichungs wary of Lajong
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bhaichungs wary of Lajong

	Guwahati: It will be a battle between experience and exuberance when East Bengal meet underdogs Lajong FC in the Federation Cup final at the Nehru Stadium, here on Sunday.         
	On paper, East Bengal look firm favourites but then going by Lajongs form in the Federation Cup so far, nothing is impossible.         
	The team from Shillong defeated Dempo in the group league and created the biggest upset of the year when they showed Churchill Brothers the door.         
	Lajong did beat East Bengal in the Durand Cup and so it was not surprising that the Calcutta outfit are wary of the youthful Shillong side. But then Lajong will be up against a team, which has gone from strength to strength in the tournament.         
	East Bengals morale after the semi-final win against Mohun Bagan is high and Phillippe de Ridders boys are surely hoping to win the trophy they last won in 2007.         
	In fact, the red and gold brigade havent won anything significant since that Federation Cup triumph in 2007 and for a club as big as East Bengal a trophy drought of two years and three months is too humiliating.         
	Everything, however, will be forgotten if they have the last laugh on Sunday.         
	The fact that Lajong might be without four of their key players should give East Bengal a big advatange.         
	Lajong will miss the services Daniel Bidemi, James Gbilee, S Romeo and skipper Aiborlang Khongjee. Daniel, James and Romeo will out with double bookings, while Aiborlang is down with a fungal infection.         
	Lajong will definitely miss Daniel, the tall African import who has been very impressive in the ongoing tournament.         
	He has stood like a rock in the heart of the defence marking the likes of Okolie Odafe, Sunil Chetri and Ranty Martins in style.         
	His absence will definitely delight the likes of Bhaichung Bhutia, Yusif Yakubu and Subhas Singh.         
	Coach Stanley Rozario hinted on Saturday that Aiborlang may make the cut on Sunday. He is very keen to play.         
	Its big chance for him. Playing in the Fed Cup final is a big thing. I will take a call only on Sunday morning, the affable coach said.         
	Even East Bengal have injury worries and thats giving De Ridder a creased forehead. Yakubu, Bhutia and Syed Rahim Nabi are still not fit while Alvito DCunha, who had to be pulled out midway through the first half in the match against Bagan, is racing against time to be ready for the summit clash.         
	It will also be interesting to see how De Ridder uses Bhutia on Sunday. Bhutia has played less than 30 minutes in two matches in the tournament but have scored a crucial goal. He missed the first two group matches as he was yet to recover from hamstring injury.         
	In the last group match against JCT, he came in from the bench in the 75th minute to score the winning goal to take his side to the semi-final. Against his former club Mohun Bagan in the semifinal, Bhutia set up the second goal scored by Mehtab Hossain.         
	East Bengal defence have not conceded a single goal in the tournament but Uga Okpara, Nirmal Chetri and Mehrajuddin Wadoo will surely be tested by in-form Lajong strikers S. Tuboi and Anil Gurung.         
	For Stanley, the final assumes importance for a very good reason. Last year after the red and gold brigade lost to Bagan in the semi-finals, he was given the boot by the East Bengal officials.         
	A victory will give him a chance to prove a point. Stanley, being a perfect gentleman, played down the personal revenge angle and said he would be happy if Lajong becomes the first team from Northeast to win the Federation Cup. That too in their maiden appearance in the blue riband tournaments main round.         
	That will be quite an achievement, for sure.         
	Match starts: 5pm

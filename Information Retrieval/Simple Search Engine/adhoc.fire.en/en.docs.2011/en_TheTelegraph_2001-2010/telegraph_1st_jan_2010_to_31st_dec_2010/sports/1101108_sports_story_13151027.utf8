The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My best goal ever: Rafique
                                                                                                                       7                                      My best goal ever: Rafique
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Early on Sunday morning, 20-year-old Mohammed Rafique received a phone call from his childhood coach, Samir Chatterjee.         
	It was Samirda, who told me that the win over East Bengal in the semi-final would mean nothing if we fail to lift the Durand Cup, said Rafique with a choked voice immediately after his 75th minute goal enabled Chirag United win the biggest title in their club history.         
	I was happy after scoring against East Bengal but the goal against JCT in the final is the best ever in my short career, said the boy from Sodhpur, who honed his skills with local side Milan Sangha before moving over to Calcutta maidan.         
	Rafique was not the only one, who was taken over by emotion, after Delhi referee Bikramjit Purokayastha blew the final whistle. Alokesh Kundu, the Chirag United general secretary since 1994, said it was a dream-come-true.         
	However hard we tried to build the side, Chirag were always regarded the third or fourth force in Calcutta football behind the three established clubs. This Durand Cup triumph has proved that we, too, can match them in performance.         
	 The sponsor has announced a cash award of Rs 10 lakh for the players for winning the Durand Cup.         
	Chirag coach Subroto Bhattacharya said he had changed his strategy after two stopper backs  Justine Stephen and Chika Wali  had to leave the field because of an ankle injury and back problem, respectively, in the first session.         
	At the half time, I told the boys not to go for tackling in the middle but to wait for the rivals to come and then go for counter attacks. It worked and you know the result, said a smiling Bhattacharya.         
	First time I won the Durand Cup as a coach was in 2000 for Mohun Bagan. It is a big team with lot of fans and top players.         
	Compare to that, Chirag have very little resources with young and upcoming players. Its a great moment for the team, said the former stopper back, who donned the Bagan jersey for 17 years.

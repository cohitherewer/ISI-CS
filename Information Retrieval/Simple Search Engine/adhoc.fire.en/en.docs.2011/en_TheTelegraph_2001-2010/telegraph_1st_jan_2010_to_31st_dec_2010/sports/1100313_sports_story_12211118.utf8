The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hospitality structure unfit
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hospitality structure unfit
  - PWD, fire brigade raise objections which catch KKR unawares       A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR)s super hospitality structure at Eden Gardens has run into rough weather after the Public Works Department (PWD) engineers ruled it unfit on Friday. The fire brigade, too, has ordered the structure to be demolished terming it as dangerous.         
	Knight Riders principal owner Shah Rukh Khan was supposed to sit with his entourage in the hospitality structure.         
	CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey received a letter from director-general of West Bengal Fire amp; Emergency Services Jogesh Chattopadhyay where they clearly stated that the structure should be demolished immediately.         
	They have stated that since plywood has been used in its construction and carpets have been laid out, it can prove to be dangerous when fireworks are set off in the stadium. The PWD, on the other hand, has pointed to the flaws in its construction. I have forwarded the letter from the Fire amp; Emergency Services department to the KKR authorities. Its their call now, Dey said.         
	For the first two home matches of Knight Riders (versus Royal Challengers Bangalore on Sunday and Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday), the PWD and police authorities have clearly instructed the KKR and CAB that no one would be allowed to sit on the galleries.         
	This, however, wont apply to the air-conditioned ground-floor of that structure.         
	The Knight Riders have sold tickets, priced at Rs 32,000 each, for that portion. Apart from watching the match with the Shah Rukhs, the ticket holders would also get five-star facilities at the super hospitality structure, besides invitation for fashion shows.         
	The structure has a total capacity of around 400.         
	Since PWD has declared the temporary structure to be unfit, we cant allow spectators to sit there, police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti told the mediapersons during the afternoon inspection.         
	No Knight Riders official was available for comment.         
	This would mean that Shah Rukh and Co. will have to watch the matches at the Eden from the lower tier of the Club House. They had done the same during the inaugural edition of the IPL in 2008.         
	However there is a meeting lined up on Saturday morning which will in all likelihood clear the picture about the fate of the structure.         
	The security arrangements will however be the same as it was during the last two international matches that India played at this venue (India vs Sri Lanka ODI and India vs South Africa Test match).         
	There will be three-tier security system where the spectators will be frisked at three points before entering the venue.

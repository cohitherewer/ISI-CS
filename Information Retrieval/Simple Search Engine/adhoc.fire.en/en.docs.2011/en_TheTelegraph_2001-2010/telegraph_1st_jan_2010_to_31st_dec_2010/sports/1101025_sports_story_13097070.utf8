The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiwary set to be Ranji captain
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiwary set to be Ranji captain
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Manoj Tiwary, the captain, is all set to graduate from T20s to the longer format. Under Tiwary, who was chosen to lead in T20s, Bengal put up a stellar performance in the East Zone leg of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, winning all their four matches. Tiwary, as a batsman, too, contributed significantly to the teams success.         
	That makes him an automatic choice for the Ranji Trophy captaincy when the Bengal selectors meet on Monday to pick the squad for the first match, against Delhi, from November 1.         
	Manoj is all set to be selected the captain. His recent success (as a captain) will make him a unanimous choice. More importantly, the coach (Woorkeri Raman) has faith in him, said a source in the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB).         
	Chances of last years captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla retaining his job is bleak, to say the least. In fact, if another CAB source is to be believed, the all-rounder will have to be on his toes to keep his place in the team.         
	It is not a secret that for Raman, performance is the last word. Shukla will have to perform if he is to retain his place in the team, the source said.         
	Young pacer Shami Ahmed, who impressed in the T20s, is likely to make the cut. But former India captain Sourav Ganguly will not be available for selection for the tie against Delhi.

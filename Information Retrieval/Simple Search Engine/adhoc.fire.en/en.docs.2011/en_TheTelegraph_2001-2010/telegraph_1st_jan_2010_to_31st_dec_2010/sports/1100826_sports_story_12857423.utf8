 - Dhoni praises Nehra, Praveen for bowling India to victory            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dambulla: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was all praise for Man of the Match Virender Sehwags effort that helped his team clinch a berth in the tri-series final against Sri Lanka on Saturday.         
	While Sehwag spoke to media at the post match press conference, Dhoni answered a few questions at the post-match presentation ceremony.               
	Excerpts from Dhonis post-match comments         
	On Sehwags century         
	He (Sehwag) is the only batsman who seems to be middling the ball. It felt really nice batting with him. In the previous game too, he scored 99 and now a century. While the other batsmen struggled, he took chances and hit boundaries.         
	Bowlers doing a fabulous job         
	In the second half of the game, the bowlers did the job for us. Praveen Kumar bowled well for us. He is a swing bowler. Thats the reason we give him the new ball and let him bowl six to eight overs. He has good control over swing. Ashish Nehra is a pro in these conditions. He has the ability to take the pressure off other bolwers and also bowl well during Powerplays.         
	The confusion regarding batting Powerplay         
	Kyle Mills who was batting told me that he wanted take a batting Powerplay. Accordingly, I set the field. When one over was left, Ashish Nehra who was bowling at that point of time, turned towards me and asked about the number of overs left. I turned towards the umpires and asked the question and they replied: When did Powerplay start? (Laughs). But Mills stood by his word and told the umpires and the matter was sorted out.

	Batting on this wicket         
	The wicket was better today than other matches. After first couple of overs, I felt that if I could apply myself and remain cautious, it will be a good track to bat on. I was just watching how the wicket behaves in the first few overs and then I started playing my shots. Once I started playing my shots, the bowlers were on backfoot and gave me more loose balls.         
	On batting in the first half as compared to batting under lights         
	If you see off the first 15 overs, it becomes easier to bat. But those first few overs are always difficult to survive. Even when I was batting under lights (against SL), we were not chasing a huge target. When you are chasing a target around 170-odd, you can take your own time to settle down. If you are chasing around 250 runs, then it becomes difficult. Obviously, its easier to bat first rather than batting under lights.         
	Repeated failure of the young brigade         
	When I was a youngster, it took me almost 50 to 70 innings to perform consistently. So we have to give more time to youngsters. We are not really worried about their failure because in Dambulla, everybodys not scoring. Its not just the youngsters, but even the seniors are not being able to score. We have give youngsters some confidence and tell them to go out and spend some time at the wicket.         
	Reasons for getting out after being well-set         
	I felt a bit of pain in my back (after hundred), so I asked sought umpires permission to call our physio. The umpire asked if I can wait for another over since the drinks break was due. I tried to bat on for another over, but got out.         
	The mantra of playing away going deliveries         
	Everyone has a different style of batting. Its very easy to say that you should leave the ball or play according to the merit of the ball. When you are in the middle, its difficult reacting according to the merit of the ball in split second. When we were young, it used to be confusing whether to hit or leave. The temptation was to hit and we used to get out. Its important to either leave or play the balls outside off. Defending away going deliveries dont help much. Lets hope we succeed in the next game.         
	If 223 was a winning total         
	I didnt think it was a winning total. But since they had only two experienced batsmen in Styris and Taylor, we knew if we could get early wickets, we could put them under pressure. The bowlers did exceptionally well, especially Praveen Kumar. Full credit to them.         
	On playing four pacers         
	If you look at the previous game, our fast bowlers got all the wickets. So it was decided, that we will try out four fast bowlers. If we played four fast bowlers, we could maintain the pressure even after the 15th over and attack till 28th over. And that is what exactly happened today. Munaf,, Praveen, Ishant and Ashish, did a great job. Everyone took wickets and bowled really well except the last couple of overs.         
	Feelings after 13th hundred         
	I am not worried about that. I just go out there trying to enjoy my game. If I score, its good. If I cant, I will try and score in the next game. I dont play for records.

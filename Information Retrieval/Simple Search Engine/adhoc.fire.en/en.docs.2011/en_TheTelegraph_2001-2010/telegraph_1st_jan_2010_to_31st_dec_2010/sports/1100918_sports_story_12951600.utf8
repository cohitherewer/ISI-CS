The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Such losses hurt: Somdev
                                                                                                                       7                                        Such losses hurt: Somdev
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Rohan Bopanna                           
	Chennai: Rohan Bopanna on Friday admitted that his lack of practice in singles cost him the opening rubber against Brazils Thomaz Bellucci in the Davis Cup World Group playoff.         
	Bopanna said that fitness was not a factor when he failed to convert three match points when Bellucci served to stay in contention at 2-5 in the decider.         
	I didnt make any mistakes. He (Bellucci) hit three winners. You have to give him credit. It was when he was serving 2-5 that I had my best chance. But the lack of singles matches probably made the difference, he said.         
	I was more tired after the third set than in the fifth. When I took the toilet break, I was totally burnt out.         
	But after the break, I managed to get a second wind and towards the end of the fifth set I was playing well. But then, I am not used playing four and a half hours everyday.         
	The US Open doubles finalist said he did not mind playing singles although he had decided to focus on doubles.         
	I have always loved to play singles, but from a career perspective I had to make that decision. Its hard to make a choice but playing for India is always a matter of pride and the crowd kept me going today.         
	Bopanna said that playing doubles had actually helped his overall game, particularly with regard to his second serve.         
	I have been playing a lot of doubles, so the percentage has gone up. I am not tentative anymore and going after my serves. Whenever I am confident, my serve gives me an edge, he said.         
	Somdev Dev Varman said his loss to Ricardo Mello hurt.         
	I started off great. I had a good third set but a shocking fourth set. Even though I lost it (fourth set) 2-6, I had game point in every game. It hurts when you lose like that, he said.         
	When you go into fifth set and lose by one break, it hurts. Unfortunately it happened to both of us. It is terrible to be in this position because it could have been easily 2-0 for us.         
	Its going to be on me (to keep Indias chances alive when he plays Bellucci in the first reverse singles). I will talk to Bops (Bopanna) about Bellucci.         
	Dev Varman, however, said his defeat was not due to lack of fitness. The first set I played like Federer  but couple of things here and there, and the story changed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dempo, EB split points
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dempo, EB split points
          
	Margao: Dempo played out a goalless draw against East Bengal to split points in the 12th round match of the I-League played at the Nehru Stadium here, on Friday.         
	Both the teams played at lively pace, but were unable to break the deadlock.         
	Dempo, who had a better share of exchanges, did not use the flanks well as they build their moves from the middle which helped the rival defence to close the gaps.         
	Defenders Mahesh Gawli and Sameer Naik gave a good account of themselves as they made timely tackles to keep East Bengal forwards Bhaichung Bhutia and Yakubu quiet.         
	East Bengal, however, played a waiting game and relied more on counter attacks.         
	The visitors got their first chance in the ninth minute, but Bhutias header off a Nirmal Chetri centre missed the target narrowly.         
	Few minutes later, Yakubu forced Dempo goalkeeper Laxmikant Kattimani to make a diving save.         
	Dempo created a couple of scoring opportunities but squandered all of them.         
	After the change of ends, Dempo continued to enjoy ball possession and nearly scored through Man of the Match Peter Carvalho whose rasping 30-yard shot was saved by East Bengal custodian Abhra Mondal.         
	Then Joaquim Abranches missed an open chance off a pass from Sunil Chetri.         
	Both the teams pressed hard in the last quarter of the match and East Bengal nearly scored through Abel Hammond.         
	The Ghanaian first failed to beat Dempo keeper Kattimani and later was unlucky to see his fierce shot rattle the post.           (PTI)

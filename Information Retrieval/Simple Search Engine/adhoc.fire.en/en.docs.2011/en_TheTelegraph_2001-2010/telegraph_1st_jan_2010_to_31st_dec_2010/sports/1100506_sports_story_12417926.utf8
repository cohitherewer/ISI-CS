The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Soft Binnys contract will not be renewed 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Soft Binnys contract will not be renewed 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Roger Binny                           
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has decided against renewing the contract of Roger Binny, who coached Bengals senior team last season. It has been learnt that the decision to look for a new coach is unanimous and most of the senior office-bearers feel a change of guard is necessary for the team to do well.         
	Binny is too soft to be the coach of the Bengal team. He was a renowned international cricketer but he has had his share of problems while coaching the team, one of the senior-most office-bearers told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	Bengal failed to qualify for the knockout stage of the Ranji Trophy and the general belief in the CAB corridors is that the coach wasnt strict enough with the players when the situation went out of hand. Even Binny admitted that there was hardly any unity in the team which is an absolute must to be successful at the top level.         
	The onus will again be on president Jagmohan Dalmiya to select the right candidate for the job. It was Dalmiya who had got distinguished international players like Mohinder Amarnath and Binny on board.         
	It has been learnt that the president has already started doing his homework, but will take his time before zeroing in on a particular name.         
	There is a section in the CAB which believes a local coach should be given charge, considering his familiarity with the players and surroundings. However, the CAB had a bad experience with Utpal Chatterjee, the last local man in charge. He had fallen out with chairman of selectors Sambaran Banerjee.         
	While some of the senior players have reportedly expressed their desire to work with Gautam Shome Jr. (who was the assistant coach), the former Bengal all-rounders soft image may go against him.         
	You need someone who is familiar with Bengal cricket, at the same time, he should be one who can be strict when required. Someone in the mould of Ashok Malhotra, said another official.

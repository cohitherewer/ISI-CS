	Calcutta: Defending champions India, who arrived in the city this afternoon, will begin their Asian Senior Mens Volleyball Championship (central zone) campaign against Kazakhstan, on Friday, at the Netaji Indoor stadium. This is the third edition of the championship.         
	We have a good side with a strong reserve bench, said Desh Raj, who is coaching the India team in the absence of head coach GE Sreedharan, after an evening practice session.         
	The team have been practising well and I have no doubt that we will reach the final here.         
	The 12-member team, which returned a few days back from an European exposure tour, will be led by Sanjay Kumar.         
	Last month India had finished a creditable third in the Asian Cup Championships, held in Urmia, Iran. The bronze was Indias first in 24 years at the Asian level. India had lost to Iran in the meet.         
	Our team is the same as the Asian Cup, but we saw some changes in the Iran squad, said Sanjay. We have been playing and training hard. We just came back from an 18-day tour of Poland and Slovenia where we played a few practice matches and performed well. We are looking forward to the challenge.         
	Iran have brought a second string team for the tournament because the main team are preparing for the World Championships, to be held in Italy, later this month.         
	Besides India, Kazakhstan and Iran, Pakistan will also be taking part in the tournament. The Pakistan contingent will be arriving in the city on Thursday morning, ahead of the inauguration of the meet. India were the winners in the second edition of the tournament, held in Islamabad.         
	The tournament will be played in round robin format from where two teams will advance to the final, which is scheduled for Monday.

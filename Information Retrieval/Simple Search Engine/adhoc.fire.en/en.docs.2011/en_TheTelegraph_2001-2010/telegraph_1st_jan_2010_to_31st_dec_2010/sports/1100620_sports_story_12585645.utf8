  - The expectation is high... Now is the time       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Didier Drogba                                 
	Johannesburg: Didier Drogba has a score to settle when Ivory Coast meet Brazil in a crucial World Cup match, here, on Sunday. A few months ago, when the Ivory Coast striker played in a Chelsea shirt in the Champions League home and away matches against Inter Milan, he had to lose against the Brazilian duo of Maicon and Lucio. Both the players will once again stand against him in Sundays outing.         
	On Saturday, after a practice session at the George Thabe Stadium, Drogba said he wasnt looking for any revenge but would love to get three points from the match. I couldnt do much in the two Champions League matches against Inter, admitted the 32-year-old striker, one of the best in the world. I need to win this battle because they won the first two. This one will be mine. They won the battle but not the war.         
	The pressure will be increased. I think Portugal will beat North Korea and we will play against Brazil. They are the best in the world, said the Ivory Coast captain.         
	Drogba, who is often described as the face of African football, is aware that the crowd at the Soccer City would expect him lead the show on Sunday.         
	Yes, we need to change for the better. We need to score goals. But we need to defend the same and may be try to improve the one-on-ones and have more opportunities, he said.         
	Drogbas only problem is the injury that he suffered a few days before the start of the World Cup. That was a big blow, it hurts But I will play against Brazil.         
	Despite facing such a huge challenge, Drogba feels there are high hopes back home. The expectation is high. Most of our players have won things for their clubs but not for the country. So, now is the time.         
	People speak about this being the best Ivory Coast team for years and that is why the supporters expect so much.         
	Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson is also determined to put his most lethal weapon in the starting line up. Dont be surprised if Drogba starts against Brazil, he said.

	Of all the former champions we have seen so far at this World Cup, the Germans have looked the most organised. While Brazil, Italy and England have looked patchy, Argentina, despite their four-star show against South Korea, looked unconvincing in defence.         
	Only Germany have been disciplined on all fronts. And for me, they start as firm favourites against Serbia on Friday. The way they opened, it should give them the confidence to move on to bigger things.         
	Generally, the Germans are very thorough with tactics and they dont commit too many mistakes. Since they adapt to situations very quickly, they can also switch formations without any problem.         
	They played brilliant football against Australia on Sunday last and, although its true that the Socceroos played most of the second half without a red-carded Tim Cahill, theres no denying that the Germans were all over the men from Down Under.         
	The likes of Lukas Podolski, Miroslav Klose, Thomas Mueller give manager Joachim Loew so many options up front, it can only be described as an embarrassment of riches.        
	Mueller has been a revelation for Bayern Munich this season and is playing equally well for his country. Podolski and Klose are seasoned campaigners and I will be watching with interest how the Serbian defence negates the three-pronged threat.         
	After the 4-0 win over Australia, many told me that it was quite unlike Germany to play all their cards in their very first match. I dont agree with them. The Germans did what they were asked to. Not a per cent more, not a per cent less.         
	Had they been asked to score eight on Sunday, they would have. Such is the confidence this team has. Truly amazing. Not for once did it seem that they were missing inspirational captain Michael Ballack.         
	The Serbians are staring at an early exit. They lost their opening match to Ghana from which they could have got at least a point and, now, if they lose on Friday, they are out of the tournament.        
	But this team are no pushovers. Nemanja Vidic, Dejan Stankovic and Nikola Zigic, on their day, can pose quite a few problems for the Germans. Zigic, in particular, was very impressive against Ghana.         
	He is a frontliner but still drops back to help out in defence. And thats the reason why his coach pulls him out after the hour-mark.His height is such that he proves to be an imposing figure on the field.        
	So, if Serbia are to have any hopes of causing an upset, they have look to this tall striker. It will also be interesting to see how the Per Mertesackers deal with Zigic when the Serbian wide men float one into their penalty area.         
	Against Ghana there were hardly any deliveries from the flanks and Zigic was more or less kept silent. I hope Serbia dont repeat the mistake on Friday.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Duleep Trophy camp to get preference
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Bengal players who have been selected in the East Zone squad for the Duleep Trophy wont be able to attend the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) camp which will start at the CC amp;FC from Friday.         
	Four Bengal players  Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Manoj Tiwary, Sourasish Lahiri and Wriddhiman Saha (Ashok Dinda is on national duty)  will have to attend the East Zone camp at the Jadavpur University, Salt Lake campus ground, from January 11-15.         
	The Bengal players can attend the East Zone camp. The KKR has no right to stop them from attending the zonal camp, KKR official Joy Bhattacharjya said.         
	Incidentally, five KKR players (above mentioned four) and Rohan Gavaskar wont be able to attend Fridays session. All of them will play for their respective clubs in the CAB-organised JC Mukherjee T20 Championship.         
	While Laxmi, Manoj, Rohan and Sourasish will play for Kalighat, Wriddhiman Saha will be playing for Mohun Bagan. If both teams happen to win the Fridays game, they will have to skip Saturdays session also as the tournament semi-finals are also lined up.         
	India pacer Ishant Sharma might miss valuable tips from the legendary Wasim Akram as he is unlikely to attend the KKR camp. Ishant, who is a part of the Indian Test squad, will be leaving for Bangaldesh early next week for the two-Test series.         
	Bhattacharjya also informed that outstation players like Cheteswar Pujara, Harshad Khadiwale and Ganapathi Vignesh will arrive in the next couple of days.

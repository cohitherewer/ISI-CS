                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav:   Had the team to do well
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders did end the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) on a winning note, humbling the Mumbai Indians by nine wickets, but captain Sourav Ganguly didnt hide his disappointment at the post-match presentation ceremony.         
	The Knights overhauled the 134-run target with 15 balls to spare. Brendon McCullum top-scored for the home team with an unbeaten 57.         
	The former India captain, who continued with his good form with the bat scoring a 36-ball 42 on Monday, said that it was frustrating not to reach the semi-finals in spite of having a good team.         
	We are disappointed with our campaign this year Honestly speaking, we had the team to do well this year. But we messed up in a few games and lost at some important moments.         
	But I must thank all the players for trying hard and also the crowd for the their support, Sourav said.         
	He also picked the Kings XI Punjab match at Eden and the tie against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore as the two crucial matches, which cost the Knights a last-four berth.         
	The losses against the Kings XI at Eden and the Royal Challengers in Bangalore turned out to be costly. We were in a comfortable position in both the games and yet lost them, he rued.         
	He also praised the 22-yard strip at the Eden saying it had been good all through the tournament.         
	The Eden wicket has been good. However, I think it could have been a little better in the last two games But thats understandable since it is the end of the season, he said.         
	Speaking about his own future in the IPL, the 37-year-old said that he hoped to return for the Knights in the next season.         
	Its good to win and we had a good season. I wish we could proceed further but didnt pick ourselves up at the right moment. Hopefully, I will return for the Knight Riders next season, Sourav said.

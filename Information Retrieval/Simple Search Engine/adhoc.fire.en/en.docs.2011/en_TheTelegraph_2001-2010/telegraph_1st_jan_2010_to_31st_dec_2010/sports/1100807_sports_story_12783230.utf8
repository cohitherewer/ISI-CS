            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Vasudevan Baskaran, the captain of the 1980 Olympic gold medal winning team, strongly feels that there should be one apex body that will run hockey in the country.         
	There should be one body. It should be one for all. If the government is recognising Indian Hockey Federation, then there is no Hockey India. This mockery should stop now, Baskaran, who was in the city with another legend Ashok Kumar, told the reporters.         
	Baskaran added: The union government should form a committee with all the professional players and veterans and, based on their suggestions, should go ahead. Suresh Kalmadi should have stepped down from the Indian Olympic Associations (IOA) post and devoted his time to the organisation of Commonwealth Games.         
	Ashok Kumar, son of late Dhyan Chand is also saddened by the latest scams related to the Commonwealth Games Organising Committee.         
	Commonwealth Games is Indias pride. Its such a prestigious meet. We must ensure that it is conducted smoothly. After all, our nation has conducted so many prestigious meets like the Asiad in 1982. So I dont think there will be any hurdle.         
	Kumar, a member of the 1975 World Cup winning team, also feels that its money and power due to which Pargat Singh lost the Hockey India elections against 83-year-old Vidya Stokes.         
	You know how elections are won! Without money and power, you cannot win elections. If you have power with the support from government, then obviously you will have more influence.         
	Now since the HI has been de-recognised, the Government should give full powers to IHF and hold its elections. Everybody is frustrated at the state and district levels. For players it does not matter who comes and takes charge. Sanity should prevail on the field and not affect the players performance.

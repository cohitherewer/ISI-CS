	New Delhi: Gagan Narangs dream of matching Samresh Jungs feat at the Commonwealth Games fell apart at the Karni Singh range on Wednesday when he failed to qualify for the 50m rifle prone individual event final.         
	Narang lost in a shoot-off after three shooters were tied at 590 for the eighth position in the qualification round. His compatriot Hariom Singh, who was battling viral fever, finished eighth in the final round. Hariom shot 689.6 (591 qualifying, 98.6 final).         
	Narang finished the competition with four gold medals. Jung won five gold medals in pistol events in the Melbourne Games four years ago.         
	As the competition ended on Wednesday, Indian shooters bagged more medals than they did in Melbourne, but couldnt surpass their tally of 16 gold medals they won four years back. India finished with 14 gold, 11 silvers and five bronze medals to finish on top.         
	In the mens 25m standard pistol, Jung won the bronze with a score of 559 while the gold went to Singapores Bin Gai, who shot 570. Trinidad and Tobagos Daniel Peter Rogers got the silver with 563.         
	In 10m air pistol, Patiala-girl Heena Sidhu missed the gold by 0.3 points. She was leading a pack of eight shooters till the seventh shot in the final round, but buckled under pressure in the last three shots to settle for silver.         
	Heena, who missed the gold by a whisker, shot 481.6 (383 qualifying, 98.6 final). Malaysias Pei Chin Bibiana won the event with a score of 481.9 (383 final, 98.9 qualifying). Australias Dina Apsandiyarova settled for bronze with 478.9 points (380 qualifying, 98.8 final).         
	Later, Heena lost her bag which had the medal.

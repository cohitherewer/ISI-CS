	London: Manchester United suffered their most embarrassing FA Cup defeat for 26 years when Leeds United pulled off a stunning 1-0 third-round victory at Old Trafford on Sunday.         
	A 19th-minute goal from in-form striker Jermaine Beckford gave the League One (third division) leaders victory as United, who have won the Cup a record 11 times, went out at this stage for the first time since 1984.         
	Holders Chelsea made sure there was no slip-up at Stamford Bridge where they crushed Championship (second division) Watford 5-0 after streaking into a 3-0 lead in 22 minutes.         
	Daniel Sturridge, John Eustace (own goal) and Florent Malouda settled the outcome with early goals before Sturridge and Frank Lampard scored in the second half to ensure Chelsea eliminated Watford for the second season running.         
	Arsenal left it late to beat West Ham United in a pulsating all-London tie at Upton Park. Goals from Aaron Ramsey after 78 minutes and Eduardo five minutes later gave the visitors a 2-1 win after Alessandro Diamanti had put the Hammers ahead just before the break.         
	However, no one followed the script at Old Trafford after Beckford struck his fifth goal in three games and 20th of the season.         
	The chance was fashioned by a 50-metre ball from Johnny Howson which went over the champions defence, allowing Beckford to control it and angle a shot wide of goalkeeper Tomas Kuszczak.         
	It was the first time Alex Ferguson had suffered defeat in the third round, the stage at which the top clubs enter the FA Cup, since he became United manager in 1986.         
	Uniteds first lost to lower league opposition since 1984 also gave Leeds a memorable victory at a ground where they regularly used to duel with United for national supremacy before their slide down the leagues.         
	The 9,000 away fans went wild with delight at the end of a thrilling Cup tie which produced the first big shock of the round after a series of predictable results on Saturday.         
	I must admit I didnt expect that performance, Ferguson said. If you dont start and the other team does, youre always up against it.

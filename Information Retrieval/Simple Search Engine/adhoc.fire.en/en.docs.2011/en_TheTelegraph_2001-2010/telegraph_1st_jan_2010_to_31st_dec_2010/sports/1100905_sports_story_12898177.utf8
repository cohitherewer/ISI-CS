            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Striker Sarayoot Chaikumdees 73rd minute strike enabled hosts Thailand beat India by a solitary goal at the Yamaha stadium in Bangkok, on Saturday. The two teams will meet again at Delhis Ambedkar Stadium on Wednesday.         
	According to information reaching here, Thailand, coached by former England and Manchester United captain Bryan Robson, were in control for most part of the first half but the visitors played some aggressive football in the second session.         
	Overall, Thailand were definitely the better side but we did not lag behind in the second half, manager Pradeep Chowdhury said after the match.         
	Adjusting to the humid conditions and the slippery turf at the Yamaha Stadium were the biggest problems for the Indian team, playing their first international friendly after the Nehru Cup final, in Delhi last year.         
	Thailand, on the other hand, played compact football and bothered the Indians with their speed. There was a time when the Indian defence was under immense pressure but led by right back Surkumar Singh, the visitors stood their ground well.         
	Goalkeeper Subrata Paul, the hero of Indias Nehru Cup triumph, once again came up with a memorable performance and thwarted the Thailand strikers on several occasions. In the fourth minute, Thailands Teerasil Dangdas shot was saved by Paul as he tipped the ball over horizontal. A few minutes later, the Indian custodian dived full length to stop Sarayoot from putting his team ahead.         
	Sarayoot, however, had the last laugh when he beat Paul to score the only goal of the match midway through the second half. A prolific scorer, Sarayoot had also scored Thailands winning goal in the previous friendly encounter against Singapore at the same venue.         
	After the match, Robson praised the Indian team saying he was impressed with the performance of the rival side. I am looking forward to our match in Delhi. It should be an interesting one, he said.

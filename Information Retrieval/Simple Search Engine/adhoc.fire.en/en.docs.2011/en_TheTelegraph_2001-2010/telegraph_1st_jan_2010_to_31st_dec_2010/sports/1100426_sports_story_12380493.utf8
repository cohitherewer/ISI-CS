                  Wesley Sneijder                     
	Milan: Influential Inter Milan playmaker Wesley Sneijder is a doubt for Wednesdays Champions League semi-final second leg in Barcelona due to a thigh problem.         
	The former Real Madrid man, who scored in Inters 3-1 first-leg win, came off at halftime in the 3-1 Serie A victory over Atalanta which sent Jose Mourinhos side top of then table on Saturday.         
	Wesley Sneijder has undergone a medical check-up which showed a muscle tweak in his left thigh, Inter said in a statement. The condition of the Dutch midfielder will be monitored in the next 48 hours.         
	The possible absence of Sneijder on Wednesday would be a big blow to Inter given he has been one of their most consistent players this season and expertly links midfield and attack.         
	Forward Goran Pandev and right back Maicon were not risked for the Atalanta game because of muscle tightness and a broken tooth, respectively, but are in line to be fit for the Barcelona game.         
	Barcelona need to score at least two goals at Camp Nou if they are to progress to a second successive Champions League final at the expense of Inter on Wednesday.         
	Jose Mourinhos boys travel to Camp Nou with a comfortable cushion but the Portuguese believes that margin is hardly guarantee enough against a Barca side that almost scores at will and is on an average hitting three goals at home.         
	So, despite the substantial advantage, Mourinho says his sides chances are still only 50/50.         
	Anything can happen in the return leg, he said. We can go there and win, we can go there and not win but go through, we can go there and lose the game and lose the tie.         
	Although Mourinho was delighted with the position his side have put themselves in and spoke of his pride at what he has achieved this season, the Special One may find Sneijders void, if the Dutch international misses out, hard to fill.         
	Inter can either go to Madrid to play the final, or come home from Barcelona with our heads held high, he said. If we go to Madrid, we will be happy, if not, we will be sad, but we will know that we have done well.

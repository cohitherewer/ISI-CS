                                                                                                                       7                                        Vettel: Its been an extremely intense season
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Sebastian Vettel in Abu Dhabi, on Sunday. (AP)                           
	Abu Dhabi: Sebastian Vettel became Formula Ones youngest ever champion Sunday, taking advantage of Fernando Alonsos disappointing performance to clinch the title with a win at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.         
	The 23-year-old German Red Bull driver started the race from pole position but needed to make up 15 points on Alonso, who led the championship but failed to secure the title for a second straight race.         
	It has been an incredible journey, to lead the championship after the last race is unbelievable, Vettel said. Its been extremely intense and a tough season mentally.         
	Vettel said he had a few nervous moments after crossing the finish line, while he waited to see whether Alonso could climb up to fourth place on the last lap  which would have given the Spaniard the title.         
	But the celebrations could finally start when he received the message he was hoping for.         
	Weltmeister! Vettels team screamed over the car radio after Rosberg crossed the line in fourth place, using the German word for world champion. Unbelievable! Thank you, Vettel replied in a strained voice, barely able to speak because of the emotion, as Red Bull engineers and crew threw themselves into each others arms.         
	To be honest I didnt know anything until I crossed the chequered flag, Vettel said, explaining that he had no idea what the situation was behind him during the last 10 laps due to a glitch on the race radio.         
	Then he comes on the radio and screams at me that we have won the world championship, Vettel added. We always kept believing in (ourselves), the team, the car, and today was a special day.         
	Red Bulls Mark Webber of Australia came in behind Alonso and finished third overall, 14 points back from his teammate Vettel. Vettel was born July 3, 1987, making him six months younger than Lewis Hamilton was when he won the title in 2008. Hamilton beat defending champion Jenson Button as McLaren took second and third place in the race.         
	For the first time in history, four drivers were in contention for the title heading into the last GP, with Hamilton finishing 16 points behind Vettel in fourth overall. The championship has been so tight, I dont know how many times weve had a different leader, he said.

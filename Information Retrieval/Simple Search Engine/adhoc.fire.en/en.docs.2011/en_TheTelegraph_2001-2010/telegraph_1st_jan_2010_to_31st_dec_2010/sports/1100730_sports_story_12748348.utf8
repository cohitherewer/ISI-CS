The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mourinhos Real   a threat: Zlatan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mourinhos Real   a threat: Zlatan
                            
	Oslo: Zlatan Ibrahimovic fears his former coach Jose Mourinho will create a Real Madrid team capable of ending Barcelonas recent dominance of Spanish soccer.         
	Ibrahimovic, the Barcelona striker who endured a patchy first season at the Nou Camp, played for Mourinho at Inter Milan between 2008 and 2009.         
	Mourinho is one of the best coaches in the world, Ibrahimovic told reporters on Thursday, ahead of Barcelonas pre-season friendly against Norwegian side Valerenga. When he comes to a new club, he will build it up to be a winning machine. It will be difficult to beat (Real), but we are the best team in the world.         
	Ibrahimovic, the Sweden international who scored 16 goals in his first season at Barcelona, said he expects to improve in his second, and that the arrival of David Villa should not put his place under threat.         
	He admitted he had discussed his situation with coach Pep Guardiola after Barcelona bought Villa.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It will be tough for India: Simpson
                                                                                                                       7                                        It will be tough for India: Simpson
    - More pressure than in 1983, says Kapil             OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Kapil Dev, in New Delhi, on Tuesday.                                 
	New Delhi: India may have been in terrific form in the lead-up to the 2011 World Cup but their ability to sustain the pressure of playing in front of home crowd would be the key to their prospects in the quadrennial showpiece, feel former India skipper Kapil Dev and ex-Aussie captain Bobby Simpson.         
	Kapil, who was speaking at a Raj Singh Dungarpur memorial seminar in the capital on Tuesday, said India should try to stay away from distractions and give their best in the showpiece event, beginning February 19 next year. The World Cup-winning captain, however, made it clear that India were definitely the best team in the world at the moment.         
	I must say India have played consistently well for the past two years. No other team, including Australia, have done so in the recent past, said Kapil, who led India to their only ODI World Cup triumph in 1983.         
	In a discussion that involved several former cricketers, including former India captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, spin great Bishan Singh Bedi and former South African skipper Ali Bacher, cricket aficionados were treated to anecdotes and rare insights into the game for more than two hours.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Bobby Simpson: With huge anticipation from the home crowd, it would be tough for India... I did a lot of research and saw that teams which scored most numbers of singles won more matches...         
	Look at history, there is always a dip at the end of a great era. Australia are still competitive, but the bowling department is disappointing. They cant even bowl straight... There is this nonsense about bowling yorkers, which is a mistake of the batsman... Its actually a full toss. I think we have to go back and try to get bowlers who have the guts and skills to get batsmen out.         
	Kapil Dev: India are the best side currently, but it is important to play like a team in those 30-40 days. We have some big names, but its important to have big commitment from every single player. I agree there will be pressure from the home crowd and there will be distractions from friends and sponsors.         
	This time they will have more pressure than we had in 1983. In fact, we had no pressure at all. It was only halfway through the tournament that we realised we were better than what we had thought...         
	Ajay Jadeja: India should not have a problem as long as they are flexible. They have so much talent that its not like opponents can beat them... Only they can beat themselves if they allow fear to set in. India and South Africa have played the most consistent cricket in the past couple of years and, may be, Sri Lanka. Of course, Pakistan can upset anyone. I have been part of three World Cup teams and can tell you that its not always the best team that went on to win. Basically, you have to get to the quarter final and need to get the momentum going.

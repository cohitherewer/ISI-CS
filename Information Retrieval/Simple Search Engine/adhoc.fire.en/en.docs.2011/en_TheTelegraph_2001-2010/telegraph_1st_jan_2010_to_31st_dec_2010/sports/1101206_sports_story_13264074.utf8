The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Becks on FA mind for top job
                                                                                                                       7                                      Becks on FA mind for top job
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	David Beckham is being considered as a future chairman of the English FA in the aftermath of his countrys failed attempt to win the right to host the 2018 World Cup.         
	According to a report in The News of the World, the FA are desperate to use Beckham to restore their reputation after losing out to Russia in Thursdays Fifa vote to pick the World Cup hosts.         
	The FA are aware that Germany, who hosted the 2006 World Cup, benefited from having German legend Franz Beckenbauer promoting their claims, while Michel Platini, now Uefa president, has helped France improve their worldwide profile.         
	It is claimed the FA believe the former Manchester United, Real Madrid and England midfielder has the perfect combination of charm and global recognition to bring respect back to the English games governing body.         
	The tabloid says Beckham would initially work as a roving ambassador for the FA before eventually taking over the chairmanship once he has the experience of world footballs politics.         
	Meanwhile, FA chief executive Alex Horne insists he will push for reform in the World Cup bidding process.         
	With the British sports minister Hugh Robertson revealing that England were led to believe they had eight votes on board in the first round in Zurich, Horne says he will be talking his concerns to the world governing body.         
	I think the process could have sensible reform, Horne said. Any election process or procurement process should be open to review and I would like to talk to other people around the game about how we might review that process.         
	For example a cap on expenditure in the campaign, so for nine bidders to go all the way to Zurich isnt necessary.         
	There could be pre-elimination rounds. I think there are other ways to look at the process, not just bidding one year at a time. I am personally, hugely disappointed. I think there is a need for process reform, certainly a review of process so I will be talking to Fifa about it, yes.         
	Horne believes any reform would stop short of a breakaway from Fifa, however.         
	I dont think its practical, he said.         
	The England bid, however, came under fire from Mike Lee, the Englishman who helped bring the Olympics to London and who helped mastermind Qatars winning bid for the World Cup in 2022.         
	Lee believes the England bid was damaged by the scandal which saw former FA chairman Lord Triesman resign. Lee said: International legacy is very important and Russia and Qatar both presented something very strong in that.         
	 But if Im being absolutely brutal about it and I look at international campaigns from across the world I think this England bid campaign was not Premier League, it was relegation and League One.

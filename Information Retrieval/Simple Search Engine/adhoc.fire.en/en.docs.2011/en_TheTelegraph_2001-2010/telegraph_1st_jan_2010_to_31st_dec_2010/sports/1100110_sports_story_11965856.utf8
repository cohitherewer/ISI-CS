	Togo have withdrawn from the African Nations Cup in Angola following the terrorist attack on their team bus.         
	The death toll has now reportedly risen to four after the bus came under machine gunfire on Friday.         
	It had just crossed the border from the Democratic Republic of Congo into the Angolan enclave of Cabinda.         
	It was reported Friday night that the bus driver was killed in the attack, while Saturday it was reported that assistant coach Abalo Ametele, press officer Stan Ocloo and reserve team goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale have also died from their injuries.         
	Confederation of African Football (CAF) official, Kodjo Samlan, speaking from Cabinda, said: Communications chief Stanislas Ocloo and assistant coach Abalo Amnalete died at four clock this morning.         
	Togo striker Jonathan Ayite said Obilale had died. He told a French radio station: He (Obilale) is dead and even if you bring the president and even (Barack) Obama himself, were leaving immediately, were going back home. Ghana and the Ivory Coast are in solidarity with us.         
	The coach of Obilales club  French amateur side Pontivy  Alain Le Dour told a French newspaper: We have been called to give us this news (of his death) but we have not yet had it in an official manner.         
	It is very difficult to have more precise information. Friday we didnt know where he took a bullet. We were told that he was successfully operated on and we talked about a transfer to South Africa. Officially we dont know any more.         
	Defender Serge Akakpo, who plays his club football in Romania, was confirmed by his club Friday night as the other player shot in the attack.         
	Manchester City have confirmed striker Emmanuel Adebayor  the Togo captain  is returning home.         
	A statement on the clubs official website read: Togo has pulled out of the African Nations Cup after their team bus came under gunfire in Angola. City star Emmanuel Adebayor, who is captain of the Togo side, was unharmed in the ambush and he and his teammates met this morning before deciding that they wished to pull out of the tournament.         
	Their first game in the tournament had been scheduled to take place on Monday against Ghana, but they are now heading home to their families. Organisers have so far insisted the tournament will go ahead.         
	The club is in regular contact with Emmanuel, his advisors and the English Football Association. It has been made clear by manager Roberto Mancini and senior officials that Emmanuel will now be given as much time as he needs to recover from the horrific attack.         
	The separatist group The Front for the Liberation of Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC), which was reported to have claimed responsibility for the attack, has now denied that its role.         
	A statement from the group read: Le Front de Liberation de Enclave du Cabinda deny all responsibility for the criminal attack which the Republic of Togo fell victim to.         
	We vigorously condemn this barbaric act and repeat their commitment to strive for dialogue, reconciliation and peace in Cabinda.

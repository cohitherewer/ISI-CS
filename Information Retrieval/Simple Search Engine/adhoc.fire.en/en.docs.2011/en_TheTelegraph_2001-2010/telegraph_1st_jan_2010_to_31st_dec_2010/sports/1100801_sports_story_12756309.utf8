The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Break for Sachin after groin scare
                                                                                                                       7                                        Break for Sachin after groin scare
    - TRI-SERIES Harbhajan, Gambhir rested; Yuvraj back; Zaheer still unfit             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                                 
	Colombo: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has been silent, but The Telegraph understands that a sore left groin made Sachin Tendulkar request the selectors to keep him out of the XV for the forthcoming tri-series.         
	The August 10-28 tournament will feature India, Sri Lanka and New Zealand.         
	From what I know, the request was routed through the BCCI secretary (Narayanswamy Srinivasan)... But for that scare, Sachin wouldve been picked, as hed initially been keen on playing, a well-placed source said on Saturday evening.         
	Apparently, Sachin even came prepared with his coloured pads.         
	Its not that the injury is serious  a member of the team management insisted that Sachin wasnt in doubt for the third and final Test  but it could get aggravated.         
	With the World Cup less than seven months away, somebody as invaluable as Sachin has to be protected.         
	Sachin, however, hasnt been the only one rested. Also in that category are Harbhajan Singh, who has clearly been struggling, and Gautam Gambhir, who has been bothered by a bad knee.         
	The well-placed source added: Harbhajan has a side strain and, once the Tests get over, needs a break... Then, theres concern over Gambhirs right knee...         
	Incidentally, Sachin hasnt played an ODI after his historic 200 not out in Gwalior, against South Africa, five months ago. Hed been rested for the tri-series in Zimbabwe and himself opted out of the Asia Cup.         
	While Yuvraj Singh has been recalled, Zaheer Khan isnt in the squad as he hasnt completed his rehab, at the National Cricket Academy, in Bangalore.         
	Zaheer, in fact, may take another four-six weeks to recover from his shoulder problem. That puts him in doubt for the Champions League, in South Africa.         
	There were XVI for the last tournament and all but four have retained their places. Out from the Asia Cup squad are Harbhajan, Zaheer, Gambhir and Ashok Dinda.         
	Like Yuvraj, Ishant Sharma has made a comeback, while Abhimanyu Mithun has gained from Zaheers non-availability.         
	Ravichandran Ashwin and Saurabh Tiwary are currently in Australia for the Emerging Players tournament and theyll be replaced there by Dinda and the highly promising Manish Pandey.         
	Tiwary had been touring England with India A when he got the call-up for the Asia Cup. This time, hes in an entirely different part of the globe.         
	Not that the Jharkhand lad will be complaining.

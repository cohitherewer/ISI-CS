The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | By the brace of Murithala
                                                                                                                       7                                      By the brace of Murithala
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: All eyes are on Fridays derby when Mohun Bagan and East Bengal square off for the seasons blockbuster match in the Calcutta Football League (CFL), but the events leading up to the contest will certainly have a bearing on the two teams battling for supremacy.         
	While East Bengal were held by Chirag United on Sunday, Mohun Bagan came from behind to win 2-1 against Peerless S.C. at the club ground on Monday.         
	With the win, Mohun Bagan equalled East Bengals tally of 37 points, and from now on, it would be a contest between the city giants fighting neck-to-neck for the top spot. While Mohun Bagan have played 14 matches, the red and gold brigade have played a match less.         
	Bagan showed glimpses of their ruthlessness and an undying fervour in the face of adversity. Peerless took lead seconds before half time through Binod Bauri. But Murithala Ali scored a brace at stoppage time to ensure the Bagan flag was flying full mast.         
	It was not like Bagan was not in grip of proceedings and the goal was a result of poor football. Stanley Rozarios men flooded Peerless with a barrage of attacks, but the sudden counterattacks, sometimes, found their defence in tatters.         
	Bauris goal was exceptionally good considering the craftiness he showed in ensuring that the ball found the net. Bikash Sur sailed the ball from a corner kick and it floated past two Bagan defenders before Bauri received it, turned left, dribbled past Harpreet Singh and angled it past Bagan keeper Shilton Paul.         
	Bagan created innumerable chances, but failed to get past Peerless custodian Debasish Das. The youngster foiled a flurry of Bagan attacks and even Rozario couldnt stop from giving kudos to the keeper. Their goal-keeper (Das) was outstanding in both halves. He saved some definite goals in the first half, Rozario said.         
	Bagan failed to make use of the set pieces and Das was equally agile to deny the green and maroon brigade any advantage. How Edeh Chidi failed to score in the 68th minute or how Murithala Alis shot was saved by Das from such a close range will continue to baffle. But Murithalas timely run to place Chidis cross for the equaliser and his header off a deflection from Benjamin Thompson at stoppage time saved Bagan the blushes.         
	Peerless were reduced to 10 men after Srikanta Koley was given the marching orders in the 87th minute. Rozario was miffed with the refereeing blunders, especially with a decision that called for penalty when Snehasish Chakraborty was fouled inside the box.         
	Mohun Bagan were an elated bunch after the victory and Rozario captured the mood before Fridays clash saying: The team spirit is high. Till the end, the boys fought and we won the match. I am happy we fought back. Three points is more than enough.

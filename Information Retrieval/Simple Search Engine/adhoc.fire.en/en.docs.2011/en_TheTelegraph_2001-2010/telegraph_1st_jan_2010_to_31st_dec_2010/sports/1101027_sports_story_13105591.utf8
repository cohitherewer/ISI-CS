The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cup of woe overflows as Paul   is no more
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cup of woe overflows as Paul   is no more
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                                      
	Paul, the psychic Octopus, who won unlikely worldwide fame, after correctly predicting a host of World Cup matches, has died. Paul had reached octopus old age of two-and-a-half years and died in his tank on Tuesday morning in an aquarium in the western German city of Oberhausen.         
	Stefan Porwoll, manager of the Oberhausen Sea Life Centre in Germany, said: His success made him almost a bigger story than the World Cup itself.         
	Paul predicted the winners of all Germanys World Cup clashes, and then of the final by selecting one of two boxes, each loaded with a mussel food treat and marked on the outside with one of the teams.         
	Staff at the centre said his death was not entirely unexpected, since common octopuses generally only live a couple of years.         
	He appears to have passed away peacefully during the night, of natural causes, and we are consoled by the knowledge that he enjoyed a good life here, said Mr Porwoll.         
	We may decide to give Paul his own small burial plot within our grounds and erect a modest permanent shrine.         
	Paul seemed to be in good shape when he was checked late Monday, but he did not make it through the night. He died of natural causes, spokeswoman Ariane Vieregge said.         
	 We had all naturally grown very fond of him and he will be sorely missed, Porwoll said.         
	After rising to global prominence during the World Cup in South Africa in June and July, Paul retired from the predictions business after the final between Spain and the Netherlands  the result of which he also forecast correctly  and returned to his prime role of making children happy.         
	In July, the Sea Life aquarium in Oberhausen said Paul was stepping back from the official oracle business. He wont give any more oracle predictions  neither in football, nor in politics, lifestyle or economy, said spokeswoman Tanja Munzig. Paul will get back to his former job, namely making children laugh.         
	After his World Cup soothsaying skills were revealed, the English-born Paul was appointed as an ambassador to Englands bid to host the 2018 World Cup. He had English roots, having been hatched at Weymouth Sea Life Center on Englands south coast in 2008.         
	Paul will live on, meanwhile, in the form of a range of commercial enterprises ranging from special clothing lines to mobile phone applications.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor expects a bouncy pitch
                                                                                                                       7                                      Taylor expects a bouncy pitch
                      
	Hyderabad: Expressing satisfaction over his sides performance in the first Test at Ahmedabad, key New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor on Wednesday said his team would put up a good show against India in the second match starting here from Friday.         
	We are happy with our performance. We can take lot of confidence from the way we batted and bowled. The wicket (in Ahmedabad) was not very helpful. Still, we managed to do well and we can take confidence from that.         
	I dont think this wicket will be as flat here as it was in Ahmedabad. We are expecting different pitch conditions here.         
	We hope it will have lot more bounce and more turn, Taylor told reporters after the practice session at the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket stadium here.         
	Taylor said that the Black Caps would be looking to attack the Indians.         
	We have seen the Indian batsmen and the bowlers. So, we are going to attack them. It will be different and hopefully will put them under pressure, he said.         
	When asked about the opening woes, Taylor said, It is difficult when you bat the first 5-10 overs. It has been a part of the Test make-up. Hopefully, we can get off to a good start.         
	Taylor hoped that paceman Chris Martin, who took five for 25 to put India in a difficult situation in their second innings in Ahmedabad, would repeat his performance here as well.         
	Hopefully, the wicket will offer more bounce and help Chris out here. I also hope he maintain his good form in this game as well, Taylor said.                 (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sarwan banking on home advantage
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sarwan banking on home advantage
                      
	Bridgetown: Ramnaresh Sarwan hopes home advantage will give West Indies the edge in the ICC World Twenty20 beginning on Friday.         
	We have a very good chance of winning this competition. We are at home and that gives us an advantage, Sarwan told a website. What is important is that we play as a team and try and support each other as much as we can, whether its in the field or when we are batting or bowling. That is something we hope to do and we hope we can do it on a consistent basis.         
	Sarwan, who is on a comeback trail from injury, felt the Caribbean fans will have a big role to play in the teams success. There will certainly not be a problem getting support from our fans, he said. I think over the years, although we have not been at our best, the fans have been very supportive and I think they know that we need their support now.         
	The hosts have been grouped with Ireland and England during the preliminary phase of the World Twenty20. In the inaugural tournament in 2007 they suffered a humiliating loss to Bangladesh and exited in the first round and in 2009 they lost to Sri Lanka in the semi-final.         
	Clyde Butts, the president of the West Indies selectors, was optimistic about the teams chances. We have Chris Gayle at the top of the order and he can be a match-winner. It is also good to have our experienced players in the middle-order  Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan  and this gives us strength in the batting, he said.         
	Wavell Hinds has been recalled and he brings a wealth of experience. Dwayne Bravo is one of the leading allrounders in world cricket and he is the key man with bat and ball.         
	We are happy to have Jerome Taylor back in the bowling department and this is a big plus. I also believe Sulieman Benn will play a major role with the ball.           (AGENCIES)

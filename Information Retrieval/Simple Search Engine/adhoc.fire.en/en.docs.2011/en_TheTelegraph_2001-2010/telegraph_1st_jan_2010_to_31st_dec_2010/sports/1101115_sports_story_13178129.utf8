The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gymnastics coach alleges racism
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gymnastics coach alleges racism
                      
	New Delhi: The Indian gymnastics squad at the Guangzhou Asian Games was left without a mentor after their Russian-born coach Vladimir Chertkov deserted them, accusing the Indian officials of racism.         
	The Indian contingent was hit by a controversy with the coach returning to the city after he was barred from taking part in the opening ceremony over a dress row on Friday.         
	Asked if the behaviour against him was racist, Chertkov said it was insult straight on my face. It was humiliation. It was discrimination. The way he was asking me (to go), I can say it was racism.         
	Chertkov told a television channel that managers of different teams of the Indian contingent had complained about the dress given to athletes for the opening ceremony because of the wrong size. He said he was told by Indian chef-de-mission that he could wear something close enough to the dress or same colour blazer, Olympic style.         
	Chertkov said when he went for the opening ceremony with that dress, he was told by chef-de-mission Abhay Singh Chautala that he cannot take part as the dress was not fit and asked him to go away. You cannot go with us. You can go.         
	That was the last straw... If Im not good enough for participating in the opening ceremony, what have I to do? he said.

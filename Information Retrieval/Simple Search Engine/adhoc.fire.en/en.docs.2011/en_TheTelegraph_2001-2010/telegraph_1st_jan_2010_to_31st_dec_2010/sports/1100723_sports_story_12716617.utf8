The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Difficult to play Malinga: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Difficult to play Malinga: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT            Muttiah Muralidharan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Galle, on Thursday                           
	India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said at a press conference that the efficiency of the Sri Lankan bowlers in breaking partnerships cost them the match.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	MoM Malingas bowling         
	Whenever we had some kind of a partnership going, the Sri Lankan bowlers came up with a beautiful delivery.... Its very difficult to play Malinga, especially with the kind of action he has and the reverse swing he gets         
	On how to tackle Malinga         
	You dont have to do anything different. Just have to educate yourself as to where his delivery point is, and what he is looking to do. At times, you miss a delivery because of his unique action.         
	Muralis show         
	I think Murali did really well He bowled really well to get those eight wickets (to reach the 800 mark). I am really happy that, at the end of his Test career, he has got to 800 wickets.         
	Muralis 800th wicket         
	Of course he is a great character. To get the last wicket, with two tailenders batting, he had to bowl a long spell and that was one of his toughest spells. It will be really tough for anyone to break his record. Thats very much impossible         
	The wicket         
	The wicket was quite flat. I dont think it was turning alarmingly or the batsmen were at discomfort. It was a good wicket to bat on.         
	Abhimanyu Mithuns performance         
	He bowled well. Mithun looked very fit. Whether it was bowling or fielding, he was really up to the mark throughout the innings. And we saw he can bat a bit too.         
	On what cost India the match         
	When we had a kind of partnership going between myself and Yuvraj (Singh) in the first innings, we were in a position to avoid follow-on. After that we would have been in a good position to save the Test match. Murali bowled two really good deliveries and got both of us out. Malinga kept getting the breakthroughs, so it was really difficult from that point of time.         
	If he was disappointed with the bowlers         
	Not really Because we were bowling on the first day and the wicket was fresh and it had been under covers. It was quite flat, and there wasnt much help for the spinners.         
	Retaining the No. 1 status         
	We will take care of the game, the ratings will take care of themselves. We know what we need to do well on the field, what went wrong in this game, and we will try to solve them.

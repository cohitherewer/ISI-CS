The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger is ten strokes   off Fowler
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tiger is ten strokes   off Fowler
                  Tiger Woods                           
	Dublin (US): Rickie Fowler ended the third round of the Memorial Tournament as he started it on Saturday, holding a three-shot lead over his nearest challenger.         
	After a day that included two long weather delays that stretched for six hours, Fowler finished shortly before sunset at Muirfield Village with a three-under-par 69 that put him in with a strong chance to secure his first PGA Tour title.         
	Fowler was at 16-under 200, with fellow Americans Ricky Barnes (62) and Tim Petrovic (68) tied for second on 13-under.         
	Briton Justin Rose (70) was another shot behind after finishing with two late bogeys. Fowler said he would not be intimidated by the games biggest names on Sunday, because they were not in contention.         
	Barnes picked up four strokes on the front nine, and he also birdied the par-four 10th, before making eagle at the par-five 11th, where he holed out from 108 yards, a shot that revved up the gallery.         
	Irons were probably the main key to my round, said Barnes, who led into the final round at last years US Open, before finishing tied for second.         
	Woods, meanwhile, shot a three-under 69, leaving the defending champion 10 strokes from the lead and he refused requests for interviews and autographs afterwards, despite hardly playing a bad shot over the final eight holes.         
	The only blemish on his card was a double bogey at 10, where he blocked his drive into the back yard of a house adjacent to the fairway and he did not even bother looking for his ball.

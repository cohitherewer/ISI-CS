The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roddick up 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Roddick up 
                      
	San Jose: Andy Roddick moved closer to a fourth title at the SAP Open with a 6-3, 6-2 win over second-round opponent Leonardo Mayer on Thursday.         
	The top-seeded American, who last won the title here in 2008 after triumphs in 2004 and 2005, took just 75 minutes to book his place in the next round in San Jose.         
	Roddick made 36 of 42 points on his service and never faced a break point against the Argentine.         
	Luckily the court here is helping out a little, Roddick told the Mercury News. Im able to mix it up a little bit more. My first serve was 74 (percent) last night and 73 percent tonight. Ill take that.         
	Looking to rebound from his quarter-final defeat by Marin Cilic at the Australian Open where he was bothered by an injured shoulder, Roddick has yet to drop a set here. (Reuters)

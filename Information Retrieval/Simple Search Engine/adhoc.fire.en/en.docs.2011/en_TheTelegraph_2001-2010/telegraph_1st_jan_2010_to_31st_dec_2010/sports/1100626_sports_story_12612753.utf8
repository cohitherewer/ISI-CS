The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Firing blanks in gritty battle

    - Brazil, Portugal astound fans with a show of tough football           JAYDEEP BASU            Cristiano Ronaldo and Gilberto Silva in an aerial tussle, in Durban, on Friday. The match ended goalless. (AFP)                                 
	Durban: Those who expected Brazil and Portugal to put up a rather soft and gentle show to book their berths in the round of 16 were in for a shock. The two nations share the same language and culture but when the teams confronted each other at the Moses Mabhida stadium on Friday, it was with such bitterness that it left even their most die-hard supporters stunned.         
	In the end, they split points in a goalless draw with Mexican referee Benito Archundia reaching for the yellow card no less than seven times. Brazil topped the group with seven points with Portugal second on five.         
	Even the rival fans had taken things lightly before the start. A number of them were seen waving both Brazilian and Portuguese flags as if they were going for a friendly. In reality, it turned out to be a battle that got as ugly as it could.         
	Football was the biggest loser, commented Brazil coach Dunga later. Portugal defended well but committed too many fouls. It was a difficult game for us.         
	But then, Brazil were surely more disappointing. They were clearly the more talented side but willingly stepped into Portugals trap. At one point of time, the Brazilians looked more interested in matching every foul their rivals were committing, unmindful of the number of cards that were piling against them.         
	Initially, the Brazilians looked runaway winners even without suspended Kaka and injured Robinho. With Julio Baptista doing his best to don the role of a playmaker and Maicon creating havoc on the right with his smooth overlaps, Portugal were themselves surprised for not being down by a couple of goals in the first 20 minutes. For that, they must thank Nilmar and Luis Fabiano for missing easy chances.         
	The Portuguese response was quick and unfortunately, effective. They simply restored to foul play and Brazil, too, adopted a similar tactic.         
	The referee had to take out his card too often. So defiant were the Brazilians that Juan deliberately handled the ball in his own half by bringing it down with his left hand and hardly looked repentant when the referee booked him for the offence.         
	Some of the fouls, especially in the first half, were vicious. The one committed by Portugals Pepe on Felipe Melo was the worst though Melo retaliated a couple minutes later and waited patiently for the referee to come and flash the card.         
	It was a spectacular match, clamed Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz later. We were under pressure and needed the draw. My boys played good football. Brazil were more defensive than us and committed fouls. We shouldnt be blamed alone, Queiroz said.         
	Queirozs lone trump card was Cristiano Ronaldo. Whenever the striker had the ball, the coach could be seen telling the boys to move up. He definitely wanted his captain and best player to get more opportunities to get through the Brazil defence.         
	The Real Madrid striker did not disappoint his coach. He was the best player on the pitch and created the days best chance late in the second half only to see Raul Meireles squander it.         
	Up against four defenders, Ronaldo was alone with the ball. Yet he got the better of them and sent a cross that went straight to Meireles. All that Meireles needed was a soft touch to send his team to the top of the group. Instead, he shot wide.         
	We really felt the absence of Kaka, Dunga said.         
	Even Robinho was missed though I am pleased with Nilmars show. Both have different qualities. I have no choice about my next opponents. You have to play and beat all your rivals to win the World Cup, added the coach.

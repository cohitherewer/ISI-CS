The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hope we can achieve our goal, says Ajantha Mendis
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hope we can achieve our goal, says Ajantha Mendis
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ajantha Mendis sparkled with bat on Friday, and the spinner said at a press conference that the Sri Lanka lower-order is working on sharpening their batting skills. Mendis (78) made his maiden first-class half-century and, with Thilan Samaraweera, added 118 runs for the ninth wicket to help lift Sri Lanka from 125 for eight to 267.         
	The mystery spinner said that initially he just wanted to stick around at one end while Thilan Samaraweera would do all the scoring. However, as he grew in confidence, he decided on accumulating runs. Mendis, believes that secret of his improved show is spending hours in front of the bowling machine. He has received a lot of support from teams support staff, Manoj Chanaka, and some local U-19 bowlers who have regularly bowled to him at the nets.         
	For somebody, whose previous highest score in Test cricket was 27, it would certainly be one of the most satisfying efforts if Lanka goes on to win this Test. Having completed 50 Test wickets earlier in the match, his 78 may be instrumental in turning the course of the match.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His improved batting         
	When I got into the national team, I didnt concentrate too much on my batting. But, of late, Ive realised that I had to improve and Ive concentrated on doing so. As a result, I was able to bat fairly well today         
	Thoughts when he walked out to bat         
	When I went in to bat I faced a difficult situation and I was determined to support Thilan in his endeavour to get some runs on the board Accordingly, I concentrated quite a lot... At that time, the wicket didnt do much and that also helped. Thankfully, I was able to build a partnership with Thilan... My initial thoughts were to get the team up to a total of around 150 but as my confidence grew I thought of scoring as many runs as possible. My intention was to accumulate runs and even a single was valuable at that time because it was going to cause problems for the side batting last.         
	The secret of his innings         
	Of late, the lower-order batsmen have been concentrating on their batting at nets It is the result of the practice and hard work put in that weve been able to make runs when the team requires. Manoj Chanaka (a member of the support staff) helped me in my batting with the bowling machine and I also got practice from the Under-19 bowlers, which has led to the improved showing.         
	On the partnership         
	When I went in to bat in a difficult situation my intention was to support Thilan As I added runs to my kitty, my confidence grew Because I batted well with Thilan, we were able to set a decent target and I hope we can achieve our goal         
	If Lanka can win this Test         
	Theres a tendency for wickets to fall in the morning If we can pick up to 2-3, then well be able to finish it off by the mid-afternoon.

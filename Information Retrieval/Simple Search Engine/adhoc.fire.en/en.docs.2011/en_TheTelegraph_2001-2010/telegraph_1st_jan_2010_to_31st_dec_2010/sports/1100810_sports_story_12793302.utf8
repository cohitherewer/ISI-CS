The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bayliss for ties with other top sides
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bayliss for ties with other top sides
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara is looking to utilise the tri-series as a build-up to the preparations for the World Cup.         
	The important thing is to stay in the present and concentrate on playing each tournament, each match and winning them.         
	Coach Trevor Bayliss said his players need to play against other top sides also for exposure. Its been good playing India because obviously, India are one of the best teams in the world and its good to test ourselves against a team with that talent. But it will also be nice to play some of the other good teams around the world may be a little bit more often.         
	The coach asserted his players have no problem in getting into one-day mode quickly after the drawn Test series. They dont find moving from one format to the other all that difficult, they know how to switch on and switch off. I dont think they will have too many problems at all on that count, he said.

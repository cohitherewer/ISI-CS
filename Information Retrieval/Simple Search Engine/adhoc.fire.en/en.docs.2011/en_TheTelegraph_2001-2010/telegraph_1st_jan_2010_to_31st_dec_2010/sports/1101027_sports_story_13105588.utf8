The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nehra is   ready for   Tests, again
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nehra is   ready for   Tests, again
                                  
	New Delhi: Nearly six and a half years after he last played a Test match, speedster Ashish Nehra is now ready to play the longer version of the game during the upcoming Test series in South Africa in December         
	I had never said that I will not play Test cricket again. It was just that initially, after my comeback, I wanted to concentrate on the one-day Internationals and Twenty20s. Now that I am back in the national side for one and a half years, I feel confident to make a comeback in Tests. I would like to make myself available for selection during the South Africa Test series, Nehra said on Tuesday.         
	The senior pacer, who last played against Pakistan in Rawalpindi in April 2004, has taken 44 wickets from 17 Test matches apart from his 146 ODI scalps from 108 matches.         
	He will be travelling to NCA to continue a strict fitness regimen, as he wont be playing in the Test series against New Zealand in November.         
	I am planning to play one Ranji Trophy match for Delhi before the New Zealand ODI series to check how my body is holding up. I am enjoying my cricket at the moment and I dont see any reason why I cant make a comeback, the 31-year-old said.         
	What has given Nehra confidence is the fact that since he made his comeback against the West Indies in 2009 after Indias Twenty20 debacle, he didnt miss a single match due to injury.         
	For me, the top-most priority is the World Cup next year. That is why I have been so choosy about playing in Tests. But, after the World Cup, there is lot of Test cricket to be played as India would be playing against England and the West Indies. I would like to play Tests again with the same intensity that I used to at the start of my career, he said.         
	The Delhi speedsters availability means good news for Zaheer Khan who has at times lacked support from the other end with both, Ishant Sharma and Sreesanth being erratic at times.

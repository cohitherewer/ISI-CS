The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ballack to team: Look ahead now
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ballack to team: Look ahead now
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Ballack                             
	Germany captain Michael Ballack has left the national team on the final day of their training camp in Sicily and wished them well for the World Cup. The Chelsea midfielder will miss the tournament due to an ankle injury sustained in the FA Cup final win over Portsmouth, but he has spent the last few days with the squad at their training camp to give them his support.         
	Before leaving, he told the Germany squad to forget about my injury and concentrate on winning the cup without him.         
	It was taken for granted for me that I would come here, he said in an address to the squad. You have now got to forget about my injury fast and look forward.         
	You are a strong team, whoever is nominated (in the final 23-man squad) and whoever plays. I am certain that you will play a good and successful World Cup.         
	Meanwhile, Ballack has rubbished claims made in the German media on Friday that a revolutionary treatment could have got him back on his feet again within a fortnight and enabled him to play in South Africa.         
	I had also hoped this, but the doctor (national team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt) soon took the wind out of my sails, he said.         
	There is no alternative to the decision and the treatment.         
	Ballack has also allayed fears that he would never play again.         
	Muller-Wohlfahrt has assured me (that there is no risk) and he has 30 years experience, so he should know, added the 33-year-old.         
	The injury will heal completely and I will be playing normally again next season.         
	The Germany squad left Sicily on a separate plane to Ballack, flying to Verona before transferring to their next training camp in Sudtirol.         
	They will be based there until June 2, during which time they will play friendly matches against Hungary in Budapest and Bosnia-Herzegovina in Frankfurt and coach Joachim Low will decide over the next fortnight how he will be trimming his squad of 26 players down to just 23.         
	He is due to make his decision public at the end of the second and final training camp before flying to South Africa on June 6.

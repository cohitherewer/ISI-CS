The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | German grit vs Spanish flair
                                                                                                                       7                                      German grit vs Spanish flair
 Fabregas injury does not worry Spain; Germans upbeat despite Mueller absence            JAYDEEP BASU                                  Germany players and coaching staff exchange views during the last training session ahead of their semi-final clash against Spain, in Durban, on Tuesday.   The Germans, who lost to the Spaniards in the Euro 2008 final, are looking to get even with Iker Casillas Co. And, going by the rousing form they are in, it wont be a surprise if they enter the World Cup final. Loews men had a romp against England and Argentina and fans are hoping for a similar display on Wednesday. Picture: Getty Images		    
	Durban: At the kickoff of the World Cup, the pundits were busy predicting the fate of the favourites. A lot was heard about Brazil, England, Spain and Argentina. Germany were hanging around somewhere down the list only because they always seem to hang around and find a way to move up the ladder.         
	The tune has changed in a hurry, especially after Germanys methodical dismantling of Argentina in the quarter final. Now, their Wednesdays combat against pre-tournament favourites Spain has been touted as the biggest match of the World Cup so far. For some it is a final that has come a little too soon.         
	On the individual front, it could also be seen as a battle of wits between David Villa and Miroslav Klose, who are chasing personal records in goal scoring. Villa, the top goal-getter of this World Cup so far with five goals is in line for the Golden Boot award, while one more strike will take Kloses tally of World Cup goals to 15, equal to Brazils Ronaldo.         
	There is not much to choose between the two teams because if Germany are the best team on display, Spain are a dazzling side that has lost only two matches in the last four years and are thriving hard to make their first ever final. True, Spain havent shown the same form that won them the Euro title in 2008 but they also havent let in a single goal in the knock out stage.         
	However, on the eve of the match, both Germany and Spain have their own backroom problems to solve. If the suspension of wonder boy and prolific scorer Thomas Mueller is a big blow for Germany, the sudden fitness worry of Cesc Fabregas will keep Spain on their toes.         
	The Arsenal captain was taken to hospital to undergo an MRI scan on the fibula in his right leg, after sustaining the damage in training on Monday. But the Spanish football federation has said in a statement that there is nothing to worry. The tests have ruled out any type of bone injury so the player could be available to play against Germany. He has not been ruled out for the game, the statement said.         
	Fabregas is a vital cog in coach Vicente del Bosques scheme of things as he has been bringing in the Arsenal star as a replacement in the second half of almost every match to add pace upfront, especially in the light of Fernando Torres inability to play his natural game.         
	There is a sense of discomfort in the German camp too as two players  Cacau, Sami Khedira  have apparent fitness problems. Germany manager Oliver Bierhoff, however, said: We have no injury worry. All the boys in the squad are fit to take part in the match.         
	With the pressure rising, the coaches of both the teams are trying desperately to shed the favourites tag. Germany coach Joachim Loew described Spain as a highly talented side and favourites for the title. Hopefully, we also can win, he added modestly.         
	Similar tactics were adopted by Del Bosque: Truly, I find Germany a different side now, he said. Only a few months ago, they looked worn out and tired. But I must say that they have refreshed themselves and are looking a great group together.         
	However, Germany definitely have greater depth despite Muellers absence. While Klose is in fine nick, he is well supported by the in-form Lukas Podolski, Mesut Oezil, Bastian Schweinsteiger and skipper Phillip Lahm.         
	In the other camp, lack of necessary support upfront has remained Villas biggest problem. Torres is in awfully poor touch and to add to the woe, Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Xabi Alonso and Fabregas are only performing in patches and are yet to strike the expected form. Villa said he was determined to create history by taking Spain to their first ever World Cup final. Well, we will have to wait and find out if he succeeds in fulfilling the great Spanish dream.

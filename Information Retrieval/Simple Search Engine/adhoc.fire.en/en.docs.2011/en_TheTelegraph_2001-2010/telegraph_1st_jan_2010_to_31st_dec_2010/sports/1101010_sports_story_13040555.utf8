The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxman ultimate team man: Gary
                                                                                                                       7                                        Laxman ultimate team man: Gary
  - Its a fine line between success and failure, says the Team India coach       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Gary Kirsten                                 
	Bangalore: The moments immediately after Team Indias heart-stopping one-wicket win in Mohali wont be forgotten in a hurry and one of the most abiding memories would be that of a thrilled Gary Kirsten, out on the field, congratulating his players.         
	Usually, the coach stays far away from the cameras and rarely shows emotion. Tuesday, though, was different.         
	Look, Im a low-key type of a person... I like working in the background and Im comfortable that way... I was, of course, delighted in Mohali... Very happy for the team, very pleased for Ishant (Sharma), Kirsten told The Telegraph at the Royal Gardenia.         
	Well, what about V.V.S. Laxman?         
	Kirsten laughed and replied: But youd expect Lax to deliver... For me, hes the ultimate team man... I took Ishants name because wed been working hard on his batting and he himself had been putting in so much of an effort...         
	While Laxman top-scored with an unbeaten 73, Ishant contributed 31 in their 81-run partnership for the ninth wicket. That took the first Test away from Australia, leaving Ricky Ponting to scratch his head and chin.         
	As luck would have it, both Laxman and Ishant have had to miss the second and final Test, which got underway here on Saturday.         
	Its a fine line between success and failure and its important to not get carried away... Even if you fail, whats important is whether the process was being followed... You dont achieve anything just like that, Kirsten pointed out.         
	He added: We had only a few days to prepare for the series and the boys gave it their all... They deserved the success in Mohali...         
	Assuming charge in March 2008, Kirsten, whose approach has been lauded by everybody Sachin Tendulkar downwards, will be around till the 2011 World Cup.

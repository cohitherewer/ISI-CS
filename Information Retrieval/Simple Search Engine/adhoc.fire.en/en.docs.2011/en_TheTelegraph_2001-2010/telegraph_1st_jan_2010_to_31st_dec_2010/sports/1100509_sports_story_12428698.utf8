	St Kitts: Opener Poonam Raut cracked a patient half-century as India inflicted a crushing nine-wicket defeat on Pakistan in their Group B ICC Womens World Twenty20 at Warner Park here Saturday.         
	Priyanka Roys leg-break was too hot to handle for the Pakistani players as the spinner returned with a three-wicket haul to restrict the arch-rivals to 104 for six. The Indians then returned with a clinical batting performance with Poonam leading from the front with a run-a-ball 54. She was involved in an unbroken 79 with Mithali Raj (33) to overhaul the target with 20 balls to spare.         
	Poonam slammed six fours in her 54-ball innings as India scored 106 in 16.4 overs to complete the much-deserving victory. (PTI)

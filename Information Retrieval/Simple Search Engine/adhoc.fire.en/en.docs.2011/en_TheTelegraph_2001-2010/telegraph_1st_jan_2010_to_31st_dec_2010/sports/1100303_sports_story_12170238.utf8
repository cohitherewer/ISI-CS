	Dhaka: England beat Bangladesh by two wickets Tuesday to wrap up the three-match ODI series with a match to go.         
	Eoin Morgan whacked a six over square leg to end a suspenseful match, in which Bangladesh posted their highest ODI total against England and came closest to beating the visitors for the first time in a one-dayer. Chasing Bangladeshs 260 for six the victors had scored 261 for eight with seven balls to spare.         
	England needed 16 to win with 12 balls left and Morgan spoiled Bangladesh hopes by clubbing Shafiul Islams first delivery for a boundary. Two runs followed off the next ball, bringing up Morgans first ODI century for England, and the second of his career.         
	Morgan didnt acknowledge the century, and said afterwards that he didnt realise hed got there in 101 balls. (Agencies)

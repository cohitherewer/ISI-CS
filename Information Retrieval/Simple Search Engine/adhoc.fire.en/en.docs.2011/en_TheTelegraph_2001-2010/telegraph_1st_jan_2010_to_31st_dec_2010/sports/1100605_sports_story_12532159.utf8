            SOCCER CITY                                
	One of the most artistic and awe-inspiring football venues on the African continent, the newly-reconstructed Soccer City Stadium will host the first and final matches of the 2010 World Cup. The grounds design is inspired by the iconic African pot known as the calabash, and its aesthetic appeal will be heightened when the stadium is lit at night. Soccer City is located in Johannesburgs southwest and is only a short distance from one of the countrys football-crazy townships, Soweto. About 40 per cent of Johannesburgs population live in Soweto and this proximity is bound to make the stadium a hub of activity throughout the 2010 finals. The stadium has hosted many important matches in the short history of South African football.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Super Kings look for a turnaround

	Chennai: The Chennai Super Kings face another uphill task when they take on the in-form Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League here Wednesday.         
	Lying second from the bottom with four losses, Mahendra Singh Dhonis team need to turn it around from here or miss the semi-final bus.         
	Anil Kumbles Royal Challengers are comfortably placed second on the points table and their position would be further bolstered by the joining of the hard-hitting Englishman Kevin Pietersen.         
	After the Bangladesh tour, Pietersen went back to England to visit his family for a while before joining the Royal Challengers Monday.         
	There seems no worry for Kumble in the bowling department as his pacers have done their job so far, and the dice is likely to roll in their favour.         
	The last 10 days have been nightmarish for Dhoni, who could not play in three of the teams last four matches. They were dumped to the bottom after the slide that started with the Super Over loss to the Kings XI Punjab. Dhoni himself reasoned that if batsmen fail, it affects all other departments.         
	We made several changes to the team, but nothing is working for us. We are ending up doing more and more changes. We need to settle with one team. From now on, every game is important, he said.         
	Despite having an in-form Matthew Hayden, the Super Kings have struggled as a batting unit and bowling was never their strength anyway.         
	Given their stop-start form, it would be interesting to see to how the batsmen negotiate the class of Kumble and a nippy Vinay Kumar, who is high on confidence after getting a call-up to the national team for the World Twenty20.         
	The Super Kings bowlers will have a tough task trying to restrict the in-form Royal Challengers batsmen, particularly Robin Uthappa and Pietersen. (PTI)

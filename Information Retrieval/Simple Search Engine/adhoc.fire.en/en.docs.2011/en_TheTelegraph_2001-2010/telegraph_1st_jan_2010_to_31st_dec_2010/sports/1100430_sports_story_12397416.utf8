	Silverstone: Britains Prince Andrew joined the club of Formula One world champions Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton on Thursday after being given a taste of their speed by Damon Hill.         
	Queen Elizabeths second son, who serves as a special representative for international trade and investment, roared around the revamped Silverstone circuit in a two-seater Grand Prix car driven by the 1996 F1 champion.         
	He had earlier cut a ribbon on the redesigned layout and accepted honorary membership of the British Racing Drivers Club that owns Silverstone and includes all of the countrys champions .         
	Its a great honour, the Duke of York said after changing back out of his white racing overalls into the more familiar business suit .         
	I dont have any qualifications and I still have no qualifications because all I did was sit passively in the back of the car and hang on. (Reuters)

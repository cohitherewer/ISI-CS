                                                                                                                       7                                      Kuljeet over the moon
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Little known pacer Kuljeet Singh, of Dalhousie AC, was on top of the world as he uprooted Herschelle Gibbs off stump during the first practice session of South Africas one-day specialists at the JU ground, Salt Lake.         
	It was Wessels sir (Kepler Wessels) who told me to bowl stump to stump rather than outside the off stump and Gibbs got out. Its a red letter day for me, said Kuljeet.         
	The ODI specialists, from Tuesday, will train at Eden Gardens after the days play.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roddick is the winner 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Roddick is the winner 
                  Andy Roddick with his trophy, on Sunday                     
	Miami: American Andy Roddick defeated the Czech Republics Tomas Berdych 7-5, 6-4 to win the Sony Ericsson Open on Sunday after an enthralling final.         
	The former world No. 1 captured his 29th career title, and second at Key Biscayne, after two fiercely contested sets.         
	Roddick was especially delighted to win the crown after losing the Indian Wells final to Croatian Ivan Ljubicic two weeks ago.         
	Obviously its a big title for me. I felt a little bit of pressure to win this one, because I had a pretty good opportunity in Indian Wells and didnt come through there, said Roddick, who also triumphed in Brisbane in January. I think just the last month has been real good for me.         
	There was nothing to choose between the pair for most of a high quality first set, with Berdych producing some delightful lobs and Roddick unleashing his powerful serve.         
	But Roddick, who went to high school in South Florida and played many of his early junior tournaments on the Crandon Park courts, broke in the 11th game and then served out the set in style, finishing with a magnificent ace.         
	The 27-year-old American, who had last won a Masters event in 2006, then grabbed the momentum when he broke Berdychs first serve of the second set with some blistering forehand strokes.         
	Once ahead Roddick, roared on by a packed crowd basking in Floridian sunshine, never looked like giving up his advantage, not once offering a break point.         
	But he faced tenacious opposition throughout from Berdych who had beaten world No. 1 Roger Federer on his way to the final.         
	There was much more to Roddicks game than his trademark blasting serve, he sliced well and was smart on his feet.         
	He was really good today. He was really strong, serving well I was looking to get one chance or maybe one is enough, said Berdych. But he held pretty well. I didnt get a chance during the whole match.           (REUTERS)

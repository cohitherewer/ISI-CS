  Whoever breaks my record should be an Indian              LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                
	Colombo: Tuesday will see another record in Sachin Tendulkars awesome CV: Hell become the most capped Test cricketer, moving ahead of Steve Waugh (168).         
	On Monday afternoon, Sachin had a brief interaction with the media in general, at the P. Sara Oval, and then also spoke to The Telegraph separately for a few minutes.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Journey from his debut Test, Karachi, to what will be his 169th...         
	It has been a long journey... I still remember my first Test... The feeling of playing Test cricket was completely different to anything Id felt... Since then, things have worked out well... Im very happy that Ive had this privilege of such a journey... It had been my dream to play one Test, now Ill be playing my 169th. Id say its fantastic.         
	The past 21 years         
	Actually, this journey has gone by very quickly, quicker than Id expected... Time flies... You just have to enjoy it... Its a cycle and youre not always at the top. Sometimes, there are rough patches.         
	Whether hes had a formula         
	It has been simple... Whenever Ive gone through the rough patches, I have found the reason to work harder... I try and spend all my energy on what Ive been trying to get better at... I try and keep things simple. If you keep it that way, its simple to manage things... Im not saying cricket is simple, but if everything around it is kept simple, then it does become relatively easy... Ive used the huge support Ive had over the years... Ive been (more) motivated and gone out and tried to live up to expectations...         
	His preparations which are part of legend         
	I make sure that Im at the top of my game, or, at least, my preparations are such that Im out there to deliver and do my best at all times... The pre-match preparations are extremely important... Ive achieved the results sometimes, and I havent sometimes... But Ive (always) been proud of the way Ive prepared... The results are not always in your hands, but the way you can prepare and play is definitely in your hands. The rest is in the hands of the Almighty.         
	If somebody can break this record         
	Records are meant to be broken... Whoever breaks it should be an Indian... To get this far, an X number of years and an X number of tours/series will be needed... Its good that, in the last couple of years, weve played a reasonable amount of Test cricket. In the early 1990s, we hardly got Test matches...         
	Whether the expectations have been a burden         
	No... It (cricket) has been Gods gift... Ive been able to enjoy it... Has been my passion... It was my desire to play for the country and to try and achieve something.         
	If hell be remembering his late father (Ramesh) the most on Tuesday         
	Yes, not that I dont remember him every single day... Ill also be remembering a host of others, whove stood by me in this long journey.         
	Staying level-headed despite being such a big achiever         
	Thats the way I am.         
	Breaks which help him recharge batteries         
	Theyre important... Breaks allows me to switch off and then switch on again... Being with the family helps me relax, gets me refreshed.         
	Finally, message for youngsters...         
	(Smiles) Its important to dream... Its also important to chase your dreams... Be sincere and honest, dreams do come true.

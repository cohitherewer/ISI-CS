The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina moves up, top seed is eliminated 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Saina moves up, top seed is eliminated 
                      
	Paris: World No. 2 Saina Nehwal beat Russias Ella Diehl in straight games to reach the quarter finals of the World Badminton Championships, on Thursday. The second seeded Indian took just 40 minutes to tame 13th seed Diehl 21-14, 21-18, in the pre-quarter finals of the womens singles event.         
	But minutes before the start of Sainas match, world No. 1 and top seed Yihan Wang of China was stunned by Japans Eriko Hirose in a three-game thriller that lasted an hour fifteen minutes. Hirose won 20-22, 21-16, 21-18.         
	However, Saina did not show any nerves on Thursday nor did she carry forward the sluggishness that marked her match against Chinese Taipeis Chen in the second round.         
	The Indian was aggressive from the start and knowing that her opponent Diehl liked long rallies, kept the pace slow and killed the game in mid court.         
	Within minutes of the start, Saina was off to a 10-5 lead as Diehl made errors at the net. Sainas main weapon, the drop shot, was again used to good effect as thrice in a row the Russian could not pick up the shuttle as it dropped inches off the net on her side.         
	At 18-14, Nehwal reeled off three points in a row, forcing an error at the net from Diehl to win the opening game 21-14.         
	In the second game, Saina again started off winning five consecutive points on her serve before Diehl won her opening point on a net error by the Indian.         
	Both the players were a little more wary as the Russian tried to force the pace with a combination of drop shots and high tosses.         
	At 6-6, it seemed that the game would be tough and hard fought, but changed her strategy and played mid court more often and avoided net play till she had a lead of 15-10. When it almost seemed that the game would go in Sainas favour, the Russian made a last ditch effort and equalised with some smart net play at 17-17.         
	But Sainas got her composure back to take the lead at 20-18 and finally pocketed the match when Diehl sent the shuttle across the sideline.         
	I wouldnt say that the first game was easy. I felt better than my second round game and I did control the play. I know she would have liked to play long rallies because thats her strength and I didnt allow that, Saina said after the match.         
	I think I am more comfortable with the conditions now. But its going to get tougher now as higher seeded players will come through but I am prepared, she said.         
	Its not that I havent played quarter-finals before but a World Championship has its own pressures and I think I am used to it, the Indian added. Saina will next play either 11th seed Jie Yao of the Netherlands or Chinas sixth seed Shixian Wang on Friday.         
	Meanwhile, the Indian mixed doubles pair of V. Diju and Jwala Gutta overcame early sluggishness to beat Singapores Chayut Triyachart and Lei Yao and enter the quarterfinals. Diju and Jwala, quarter-finalists at the last World Championships in Hyderabad, won 14-21, 21-18, 21-14.         
	The Indians will now face 12th seeds South Koreas Sung Hyun Ko and Jung Eun Ha for a place in the semi-finals. The Korean pair had shocked fifth seeds Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Christinna Pedersen of Denmark.         
	I dont think we were at the top of our game, said Diju. We made too many mistakes and its only later that we managed to pick up the pieces and come back in the match.         
	The Indian duo realised that the Singapore pair were no pushovers. A lead of 14-13 for the Singaporeans soon became 20-14 before another error at the net from the Indians saw them concede the first game.         
	Down 0-1, Jwala and Diju knew their task was cut out. The placements became slightly better and Jwala started dominating the net as the lead remained with the Indians at 15-12. A rash of errors gave Singapore pair a chance to equalise at 15-15 as the game became tense. Indians led 17-16 before an error in judgement from Diju ensured Singapore restore parity at 17-17.

                                                                                                                       7                                      QUICK TAKES                
	Football fever has Bangla on boil  
	Dhaka: Running battles between heavily armed Brazil and Argentina fans have left 30 people injured  in Bangladesh. Police were forced to fire a volley of shots to control rioters after two neighbouring villages clashed over their passion for the South American rivals three weeks before the start of the World Cup finals in South Africa. Six policemen were injured when residents of Sheikhpara village fought their neighbours from Dakshinpara village with sticks, clubs and sharp weapons over their World Cup loyalties.  
	Federer and Africa  
	Paris: With a South African mother and his foundation supporting disadvantaged children in the country, Roger Federer is thrilled to see the World Cup being staged in South Africa next month.  
	The 16-time Grand Slam champion said he hoped the country would benefit from the tournament. When I first heard that they had won the right to host the tournament, I was delighted, Federer said. The 28-year-old Swiss great is glad to see his country make it to the finals after a shaky qualifying campaign. Im happy Switzerland went through because at one point, it was unsure it was going to qualify, Federer said.               
	Stroll in the park  
	Saitama: Japan coach Takeshi Okada put his own job on the line but was persuaded to carry on after a morale-sapping 2-0 defeat by South Korea in a World Cup send-off for both sides on Monday. South Korea captain Park Ji-sung stunned Japan in the sixth minute with a superb solo goal. Substitute Park Chu-young added an injury-time penalty to complete a deserved victory.   
	In Melbourne, Brett Holman struck four minutes into injury-time to spare Australian blushes and give an undisciplined Socceroos a 2-1 victory over trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand. Holman grabbed the winner to lift more than 55,000 spectators at the Melbourne Cricket Ground into a frenzy.         
	Earlier, All Whites had sparked hopes of a stunning upset after a 16th-minute goal from Chris Killen. Dario Vidosic equalised for Australia in the 57th minute.           (AGENCIES)

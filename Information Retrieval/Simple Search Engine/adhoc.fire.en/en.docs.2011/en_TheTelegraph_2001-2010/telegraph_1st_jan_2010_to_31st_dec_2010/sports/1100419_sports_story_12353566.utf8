                                                                                                                       7                                        First Asian title for Super Dan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Lin Dan in New Delhi, on Sunday                           
	New Delhi: World and Olympic champion Lin Dan of China added yet another feather to his cap when he won the Yonex Sunrise Badminton Asia Championships mens singles title on Sunday.         
	Playing in front of a near capacity crowd at the Siri Fort Sports Complex, the second seeded Chinese star, known as the Super Dan, played scintillating badminton to beat compatriot Wang Zhengming 21-17, 21-15.         
	I am particularly happy to win this title, said the four-time All-England champion after his triumph over the 2008 World junior champion. This is the one title which had eluded me all these years. I was also determined to win here, as I wasnt in good form in recent tournaments. I didnt do well in England and also was not at my best in other Super Series meets, said Dan, who won the World Championships in Hyderabad last year.         
	Asked whether India had become his happy hunting ground, Dan said: Yes, its nice to come to India and win titles. Its not easy to play against players from my own country and Wang is a very good player. He is young and has the ability to be a future star, he commented.         
	Chinas Li Xuerui, who beat top seed and local favourite Saina Nehwal in the semi-finals, bagged the womens singles title after a hard fought encounter against compatriot Liu Xin. In a battle of two qualifiers, Li prevailed 21-13, 18-21, 21-19.         
	I was confident of going all the way after the victory over Saina. My belief in my ability worked in my favour, said Li. After beating Saina, playing a three-game final was extremely tiring, but I managed to overcome her (Liu Xin), she added.         
	Though no Indian could figure in any of the finals, national coach Pullela Gopichand felt the results of the local players were encouraging. While Saina reached the semi-finals, we had a player in the mens singles quarter finals and two Indian pairs in the doubles quarter finals. With little more focus, these players can do well in the Commonwealth Games.         
	China extended their domination with sixth-seeded pair of Pan Pan and Tian Quig winning the womens doubles title posting a 21-10, 21-6 victory over the Malaysian duo of Vivian Kah Mun Hoo and Woon Khe Wei.         
	Fifth-seeded Cho Gun-woo and Yoo Yeon-seong of South Korea pulled off a shock 21-19, 12-21, 21-17 victory over the top-seeded pair of Chen Hung-Ling and Lim Yu-Lang from Taiwan in the mens doubles final.         
	Malaysias seventh-seeded pair of Chan Peng Soon and Goh Liu Ying won the mixed doubles title with a 21-17, 20-22, 21-19 triumph against the sixth-seeded South Korean duo of Yoo Yeon-seong and Kim Min-jung.

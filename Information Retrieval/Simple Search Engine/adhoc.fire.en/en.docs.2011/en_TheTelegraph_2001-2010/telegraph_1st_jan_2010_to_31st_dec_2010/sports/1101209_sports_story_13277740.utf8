The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harris is awaiting Sachin challenge
                                                                                                                       7                                      Harris is awaiting Sachin challenge
                      
	Johannesburg: South African spinner Paul Harris is looking forward to bowl to Indian batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar during the three-match Test series, starting December 16, at Centurion.         
	Harris dismissed Tendulkar twice out of three times in the two-Test series in India earlier this year.         
	Its a really big thing for me to bowl at him because who would have thought a boy from Kommetjie (near Cape Town) would bowl against Tendulkar, Harris said. Whats even better is that I think the score between us is quite even: Ive got him out a few times and hes scored a few runs against me, he said.         
	Harris said his primary job would be to contain the big hitters but hoped that the Indian batsmen would go after him and it would increase his chances of bagging a wicket.         
	Im comfortable in a holding role. If Dale (Steyn) and Morne (Morkel) are getting us wickets and winning the match then Im okay with keeping things tight at the other end. In Durban, in particular, that will be my job, Harris said.         
	The Indian batsmen have done well against spin which means I will probably have to set more defensive fields for them.         
	I hope they attack me. It was very frustrating against Pakistan when they didnt play a shot against me. If they take me on, theres more chance that Ill get a wicket, he added.         
	Harris made his Test debut against India in 2007 in Cape Town. He has played 34 Tests so far and has taken 99 wickets at an average of 36.8.         
	Meanwhile, in what should please the Indians, South African fast bowlers will be denied a green top in the first Test, at Centurion, as the curator fears that he could be in the line of fire if the visiting bowlers get to exploit it first.         
	Look, everybody wants the ball to fly past the Indian batsmans ears because they are apparently vulnerable against short deliveries. If we win the toss on that pitch and bowl them out cheaply, then Im the hero, but think what could happen if the roles are reversed and they bowl us out cheaply. Then they demand your head and everyone wants to know what went wrong, said SuperSport Park groundsman Hilbert Smith.         
	To make this happen, you need a lot of grass on the pitch. Then you can have a scenario where one team is bowled out for 120 while the other gets 150. Even an average seamer is then made to look world class. That is not what you want, he said.         
	Smith said he is preparing a wicket which will offer something for the bowlers in the first morning.         
	Im definitely not going to prepare a pitch where the Test will be over within three days. But it will be a pitch that will definitely offer something for the bowlers on the first morning.

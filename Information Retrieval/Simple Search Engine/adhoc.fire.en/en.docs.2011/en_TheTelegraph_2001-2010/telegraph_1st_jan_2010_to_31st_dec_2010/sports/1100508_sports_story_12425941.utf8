The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Simons to stay till World Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                        Simons to stay till World Cup
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Eric Simons                            
	Bridgetown: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has given Eric Simons a contract till the end of the 2011 World Cup. The 48-year-old South African will, therefore, continue to function as the bowling coach.         
	Im happy that Ill be with the team till the World Cup gets over, Simons told The Telegraph at the Hilton here.         
	Simons, a former Proteas coach, came on board (on a short-term arrangement) when Team India was in Bangladesh, in January. That Gary Kirsten made a strong recommendation was, obviously, of big help.         
	The BCCI had been looking around for a full-time bowling coach after sacking Venkatesh Prasad last October. For now, that search has ended.

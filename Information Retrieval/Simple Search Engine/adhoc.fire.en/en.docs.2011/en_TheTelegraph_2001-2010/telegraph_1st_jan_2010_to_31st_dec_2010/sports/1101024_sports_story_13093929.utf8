The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Slog bowling a concern: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Slog bowling a concern: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Margao: Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni gave a twist to the news of seniors planning to miss the ODI series versus New Zealand.         
	While addressing the media, on Saturday, Dhoni denied having any knowledge of the same. He also said that slog overs were a concern for Team India.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Indian bowlers conceding runs in the slog overs         
	The last ten overs have always been a big concern for us. Its not a worry we have had (only) over the last 2 or 3 months. We have been bothered by the last ten overs for a long time now. We had done well in between but have not been really consistent. Its still an area where we can definitely improve. The end result can depend on those last five overs. If you give 20-25 extra runs, it becomes really difficult when you are chasing a total like 290-odd runs. Its an area we need to improve. We are putting in a lot of effort but havent achieved the desired result. We have not been consistent with it.         
	Suresh Rainas form         
	The important thing is the great rate at which hes been scoring runs. More often than not he scores at a brisk pace. Hes been like a floater for us, batting at No.5 and 6 depending on the situation. Hes also a very good fielder. Its always good to have excellent fielders in the team. Also, he can bowl a bit.         
	On not batting at No.3         
	At No.3, I have done decently well. If you have people who can do the job up the order, I would rather bat down the order at No.5 or 6. Especially in this side there are plenty of players who can do what I have done at No.3 But batting at No.5 or 6 needs a bit more experience to finish the game.         
	Youngsters facing difficulty in switching from one format to another         
	You have to play your brand of cricket. Thats what is important, especially for the youngsters. Till you (youngsters) cement your place in the side you should be playing (in similar fashion) because of which you are part of the side. Changing gears is important when it comes to switching the format. Switching is more of a mental aspect.         
	Indias performance in this series         
	I personally feel we have done well. In the Test series, not only the batsmen and bowlers, but also the part timers contributed. Lower-order batsmen stood up when needed. Youngsters grabbed at the opportunity thrown to them.         
	Reports that he and other senior players would skip the New Zealand ODI series         
	Not done (written to the Board) anything like that as of now. No communication has been sent from the players side to the BCCI yet and nothing has been received from the BCCI either. This is what I have to say. Tomorrows game is more important to us right now rather than thinking about what to do after the New Zealand series. As I always say, I dont think too much about the future. After this (ODI series vs Australia) what is important is the utilisation of the 4-5 days break that we have got.

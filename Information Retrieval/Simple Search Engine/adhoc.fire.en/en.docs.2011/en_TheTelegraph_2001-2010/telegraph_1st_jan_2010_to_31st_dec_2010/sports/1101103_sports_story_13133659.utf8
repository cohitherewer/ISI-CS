The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ntini to call it quits 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ntini to call it quits 
            A STAFF REPORTER             Makhaya Ntini                           
	Calcutta: Makhaya Ntini, on Tuesday, formally announced his decision to retire from international cricket. He will remain available for his franchise, the Chevrolet Warriors.         
	The pacer, who played the last of his 101 Tests in December 2009 but has been out of favour with the national selectors ever since, will make one final appearance in a Twenty20 International against India, in Durban, on January 9.         
	His decision brings down the curtain on a brilliant career that has seen him take 390 wickets (the 11th highest of all time and the second best by a South African) in Test cricket and 266 wickets in ODIs in 173 appearances.         
	He holds the South African record for the best bowling figures in Test cricket (a match return of 13/132 versus the West Indies in Trinidad in 2005), and in ODIs (6/23 against Australia at Sahara Park Newlands in 2006). He also holds the South African record for the most 10-wicket haul in Tests (four, a mark he shares with Dale Steyn). He is also the only South African bowler to take 10 wickets in a Test match at Lords.         
	It has been a wonderful journey for me to represent my country, said Ntini in a CSA statement. I have so many great memories, which I will carry with me for the rest of my life.         
	My career is by no means over; it just means that internationally my time has come to hang up my boots. Domestic cricket is thriving at the moment, and I want to be a part of the set up, as a player, for as long as possible.         
	It is also my dream to give back. The Makhaya Ntini Cricket Academy in Mdantsane is gathering momentum, and I am keen to put more energy into the project, and let it be a vehicle for change.         
	I am currently in discussions with CSA about getting involved with their Tomorrow campaign, and give back to its cricket development programmes, which are the same structures I came through.         
	CSA will honour Ntini at the Standard Bank International Pro20 for the Krish Mackerdhuj Trophy at the world-class Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban in January both for his contribution to cricket and for his inspiration to current and future generations that has made him the peoples champion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina is the best: Akram
                                                                                                                       7                                        Raina is the best: Akram
            A STAFF REPORTER            Suresh Raina                           
	Calcutta: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has rated Suresh Raina as the best young batsman in the world, though he felt the lefthander has some way to go before he can be compared to Sourav Ganguly.         
	Raina Sunday became only the third batsman in the short history of Twenty20 Internationals to score a hundred when his blazing 60-ball 101 set up Indias win over South Africa.         
	For me, he is the best young batsman in the world. He did well in the Indian Premier League and is keeping up the good work in the Caribbean world championship. However, it is too early to say that he is the next Sourav Ganguly, Akram wrote in his column for a website.         
	Raina is only playing T20s at the moment, let him play Tests and score some runs, then only a comparison with the great Ganguly can be made. Having said that, there is no denying that Raina is immensely gifted, Akram said.         
	Apart from Raina, Yuvraj Singh also played a crucial innings and thats very good news for India. Of late, Yuvi has been out of touch but, mind you, he is one of the most dangerous batsmen in this form of cricket, and an innings like that (30-ball 37 versus South Africa) would do his confidence a world of good.         
	Talking about Pakistans comprehensive defeat against Australia, the former skipper questioned Mohammed Asifs absence from the attack.         
	A genuine pacer will have a ball in the West Indies and thats what the Australian trio of Shaun Tait, Mitchell Johnson and Dirk Nannes did at St Lucia.         
	Pakistans combination also was not right. I do not know why Mohammed Asif is not playing. Mohammed Sami is a talented bowler and he did well against Bangladesh, but against the Kangaroos his length was not up to the mark and thats why he conceded so many runs. Asif has proved time and again his class and should be brought back without further ado, he said.

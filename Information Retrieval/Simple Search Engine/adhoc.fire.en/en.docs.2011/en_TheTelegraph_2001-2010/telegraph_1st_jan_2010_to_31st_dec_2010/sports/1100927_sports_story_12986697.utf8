The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Village hit by fresh criticism 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Village hit by fresh criticism 
    - Four more athletes pull out of games; over 1000 participants arrive           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Just as things were beginning to look up for the crisis-hit Commonwealth Games, fresh criticism hit the Games Village with South African high commissioner here claiming that a snake was found in one of the rooms even as four more top athletes pulled out of the mega event.         
	Citing health and security concerns, Scottish tennis star Elena Baltacha, ranked 50th in the world, withdrew along with Australian cyclist Travis Meyer, table tennis player Stephanie Sang and Malaysian sprinter Siti Zubaidah Adabi.         
	[Agencies add: Australian boxer Damien Hooper faces a dilemma. He is worried about his security also wants to go to New Delhi and win a medal.         
	Hooper, a medal prospect for his country, said he is scared of a terror attack. Ill see what happens if theres any more bridges collapse or bombs go off. Ever since I was 12 Ive been scared of terrorism so its been on my mind, the 18-year-old middleweight pugilist said.         
	Im not 100 per cent about pulling out but I am concerned. My vision is still of winning a medal, the Youth Olympics gold medallist told an Australian newspaper.         
	The president of South Africas Olympic Committee, however, defended New Delhis right to host, saying on Sunday he is willing to clean any toilets himself to help ensure the Games go ahead. SASCOC president Gideon Sam said there would be no complaints from the South Africans.         
	As developing nations we must stand together, Sam said, according to the South African Press Agency. We cannot allow developed countries to go out there and take the last seat in the hall.         
	If they (the athletes) are unhappy with their rooms because they have not been swept, they must take off their jackets and sweep them themselves. We will not complain. South Africans do not do that, Sam said. And when I get there on Friday, if a toilet is not clean, I will clean it myself.         
	But Sam compared criticism of India to that received by South Africa ahead of its ultimately successful hosting of the football World Cup.         
	We had the same problems with these countries who complained before the Fifa World Cup, and I wont even mention them because we know who they are, he said. As South Africans, we have always supported our friends ... and India and Brazil are our best friends.         
	We also want to host events like this, and it is unfair if they are hosted only by countries like England, Canada and Australia.         
	We will be prepared when we get there, we will work side by side with our friends, and we will come back with medals.]         
	Adding to the misery of the organisers, the Malaysian, Botswanian and Rwandan teams complained about the poor state of the residential blocks.         
	There are a lot of construction materials lying in our rooms. Besides filthy bed sheets, bathroom fittings do not work. They are not clean, chef de mission of Botswana Tuelo Daniel Seruftho said.         
	But then, foreigners are not the only ones to complain about the unliveable conditions at the Village. The Indian hockey team, which defeated a full strength England team 3-1 in a practice match at the Dhyan Chand Sports Complex in the evening, were upset about lack of water supply. The Indian swimmers, too, faced a similar problem but their plea for change of rooms has so far fallen in deaf ears.         
	One hockey official, however, had a different story to tell. In the morning we did face some problems, he said. But show me one place in the capital where you dont face water crisis, the official added.         
	Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) CEO Mike Hooper, meanwhile, said CGF cannot be held responsible for the organising committees failure to meet deadlines.         
	Launching a fresh offensive against the organsing committe (OC), with which he has had a strained equation, Hooper said even the government agencies in India did not act in time and delayed the handing over of the venues.         
	However, Hoopers outburst did not go down well with the OC or the government, which called the attack completely unacceptable.         
	There was some good news as well with Englands delegation checking in at the Village to do the groundwork for their athletes arrival on Monday.         
	Im very pleased to announce that our players will be coming Monday to the Games Village, said Craig Hunter, England chef de mission.         
	Its exciting but also a relief. We are now getting back on track with the phased arrival of athletes and we will begin to reach a peak of team numbers (more than 500) on October 5, he said.         
	But the security lockdown of venues could not be completed yet again as last-minute finishing work continued at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, where the opening and closing ceremonies are scheduled.         
	Rattled by continuous negative publicity, Delhi chief minister Shiela Dikshit and other senior government officials spend nearly two hours in the Village in the morning and were briefed on various operations. The chief minister also made a surprise visit in the evening.         
	Foreign contingents continued to drop in with nearly 1100 athletes, officials and technical staff, including those from Scotland and Canada, who have delayed their arrival until their residential areas at the Games Village are cleaned up.         
	The largest contingent to arrive was a 112-member delegation from Kenya, followed by Nigeria (69), and 60 members from Scotland, a release from the OC said.         
	Work has progressed far enough now and were ready to start moving in to the Village, said Scott Stevenson, Director of Sport, Commonwealth Games Canada.

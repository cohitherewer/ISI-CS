The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A first for MCC
                                                                                                                       7                                      A first for MCC
                      
	London: The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) announced Monday that they would be sponsoring the Test and one-day series between Pakistan and Australia in England in July. This will be the first time MCC, the owners of Lords, where the first of two Tests between Pakistan and Australia is due to start on July 13, will sponsor an international series in their 223-year history.         
	The series comes at a time when Pakistan, who will also be playing a Test and one-day series against England this English season, has become a no-go area for international cricket following a terror attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore last year.         
	MCC secretary, Keith Bradshaw, told a news conference Monday: MCC is committed to the health of Test cricket, and by sponsoring the series and hosting the first Test, the club is supporting Pakistani cricket at a time when the countrys Test calendar has been decimated. We often speak about Tests being the pinnacle of the game  now we are acting to back up those words.         
	Bradshaw refused to divulge how much money MCC was putting into the series, which also features a Test at Yorkshires Headingley ground in Leeds, citing commercial confidentiality but insisted it was a not for profit exercise as far as his club was concerned.         
	We feel we are independent and to some extent, the conscience of the game, Bradshaw said of the MCC, which is still responsible for overseeing the games Laws.         
	Pakistan Cricket Board director of cricket operations Zakir Khan said: We thank the England and Wales Cricket Board and Cricket Australia for helping us out and making this series in England happen. We are also thankful to MCC.         
	It is nearly been a century since Lords staged a neutral Test, during the 1912 triangular series involving England, Australia and South Africa. (AFP)

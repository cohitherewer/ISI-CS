	Calcutta: East Bengal made a nightmarish start to the return leg of the I-League, losing 1-2 to Pune FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday.         
	Ivory Coast-based midfielder Douhou Pierre, and Brazilian Edmar Figueira, scored for the winners in the 46th and 52nd minute. Abel Hammond pulled one back for the home team in the 75th minute, courtesy a spot-kick.         
	Soon after East Bengal scored, Bhaichung Bhutia received marching orders after intentionally pushing Pune FC custodian Subrata Paul. Bhaichung was trying to snatch the ball from him in a bid to start the proceedings quickly, after the red-and-gold brigade pulled one back. Subrata did a bit of play-acting and the referee fell for it, showing Bhaichung his second yellow card of the match.         
	Pune FC, with 22 points from 14 encounters, moved up the ladder to the fifth spot on the league table, while East Bengal slipped one place to be seventh, with 20 points from14 games.         
	It was a day when A. Arjunans poor refereeing robbed Pune of a goal. In the 72nd minute, Edmars powerful left-footer landed inside the goal, but after hitting the back-post, came back into play.         
	To everyones horror, neither Arjunan, who was guilty of some other horrible decisions as well, nor assistant referee JP Pandit from Bihar, realise that the ball had actually gone in. Edmar made an animated protest but it fell to deaf ears. The Pune management has decided to appeal against the referees decision so that the scoreline can be altered after the tournament committee watches the footage.         
	East Bengal could have gone ahead in the first half had Subrata not dived full stretch to thwart a Hammond header in the 30th minute. Before that, Indias No.1 goalkeeper dived twice to save Hammonds shot. Bhaichung, who played as a single striker in the first half, wasnt very effective as Othallo Tabia and Sergey Tokov kept him under wraps.         
	In the second half, it was Pune captain S. Venkatesh who played a short pass to Douhou instead of delivering a cross from the flag-kick. Douhou suddenly entered the box and took a shot from an acute angle. A slight deflection wrong-footed East Bengal goalie Abhra Mondal, went in through the first post.         
	Within seven minutes, the Pune outfit made it 2-0 as Edmar dodged Nabi and his left footer found the back of the net. They could have gone 3-0 up had Izumi Arata, who was a livewire in the midfield, properly directed his tap off a Godwin Franco assist. East Bengal could have got a penalty in the 61st minute when Hammonds shot hit Selwyns right hand, but Arjunan chose to overlook it.

	Bangalore: Brijesh Patel, who has been the secretary of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) for more than ten years, has decided not to contest the ensuing elections. The former India cricketer has decided to support the young brigade of stars  Anil Kumble, Jawagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad  who are all set to contest for the 2011-13 term.         
	The elections are scheduled for November 21.         
	Even Rahul Dravid is believed to be contesting the elections. Both Srinath and Prasad admitted that they are set to contest but didnt divulge their plans.         
	Yes, we are contesting the KSCA elections, Prasad said.         
	Earlier, Patel in a press release confirmed that he wont be contesting for the secretarys post during the upcoming term.         
	I had the honour of serving the KSCA for the past 12 years. I contributed to the association in all my might and put my heart and soul to the growth and development of the association during these years.         
	Now, I have decided to step aside and not contest the ensuing elections and support the young distinguished Test cricketers Kumble, Srinath, Dravid and others in the coming elections, the release stated.         
	With the changing times, Im of the firm belief that fresh energy, new ideas and young feet are always good for an institution. We at Karnataka are indeed lucky that we have living cricketing legends Kumble, Dravid, Srinath and others who are willing to sacrifice their time and energy to take Karnataka cricket forward, it further stated.         
	Ive seen these cricketers closely and Ive immense faith and utmost confidence in their ability and commitments to make KSCA a model association not only of the country but also of the world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ex-PM relied too much on Morgans advice
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ex-PM relied too much on Morgans advice
    - Howard lobbied with heads of state/government             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Howard                                 
	Mumbai: John Howard, Australias former Prime Minister, tried almost every trick in the book in his bid to become vice-president of the International Cricket Council (ICC), yet failed.         
	Top sources of The Telegraph have confirmed that Howard personally spoke to the President/Prime Minister of at least three of the seven Test-playing nations opposed to his candidature.         
	Besides, Howard threatened to use his influence and get Australia to terminate all aid to Zimbabwe.         
	In fact, Howard refused to back off even after Cricket Australia (CA) and New Zealand Cricket (NZC), whod nominated him, apparently advised that the numbers just werent in his favour.         
	That bit was probably conveyed unofficially, in April, after the ICCs Executive Board kept Howards nomination on hold.         
	Howard chose to rely more on David Morgan, whose term as the ICC president ended on Thursday, and on his friends in the Foreign Office in Canberra.         
	Morgan and Howards friends got it very wrong, resulting in the ICCs Executive Board throwing out his nomination, in Singapore, during the annual conference week.         
	A vote wasnt taken, but its no secret that India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the West Indies didnt want to have anything to do with Howard.         
	Something reported in these columns more than once in recent weeks.         
	Australia, New Zealand and England were the only ones backing Howard. That, too, owing to compulsions.         
	Shashank Manohar, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, wasnt available for comment, but it seems hed made an offer to CA and NZC  withdraw Howards nomination and propose the name of either Jack Clarke or Alan Issac.         
	Apparently, CA and NZC said their hands were tied, thanks to Howard.         
	Clarke and Issac head CA and NZC, respectively. At one time, Clarke himself wanted to be the joint nominee, but had to quietly forget about his own aspirations once Howard insisted on being the man.         
	When a former Prime Minister gets into the frame, youve got to shelve your ambitions, one top source put it.         
	Meanwhile, anticipating pressure from certain quarters, Manohar has armed himself with a resolution from the working committee, which met on May 2. It states that the BCCI shouldnt support Howard.         
	Jagmohan Dalmiya, significantly, has been a party to that decision.

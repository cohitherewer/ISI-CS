The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warm welcome for Messis
                                                                                                                       7                                        Warm welcome for Messis
    - Players request Diego Maradona to continue as coach             Tim Hart            Fans welcome the Argentine team on their arrival, in Buenos Aires, on Sunday. (AP)                                 
	Tens of thousands of fans welcomed the Argentina team when they returned to Buenos Aires following their exit from the World Cup. Despite being humiliated by Germany in the quarter-finals, losing 4-0, the fans cheered and celebrated as if Argentina had won the World Cup for the third time.         
	As the squad got on to the team bus to leave for the Argentinan Football Association headquarters, the chant that resonated among the supporters was Do not go, Diego in response to Maradonas comments suggesting he may step down as manager.         
	The fans made it clear they want Maradona to remain in charge for next years Copa America, which Argentina are hosting, as well as the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. One banner read: May God let your enemies live long enough so they can stand up to applaud your successes.         
	It would normally take just a matter of minutes to get to the AFA headquarters, but on this occasion, it took over an hour as the coach tried to make their way through the crowd.         
	This reception is in stark contrast to the one Brazil received when they arrived in Rio de Janerio on Sunday. The team were met with insults as well as pushing and shoving from angry fans following their poor showing in South Africa.         
	I never expected people would react this way, but its a huge joy, said Jonas Guttierez. The fans gave us an incredible amount of support. We are very angry because we wanted to stay in the competition for them, but could not.         
	Maradona is yet to decide if he will stay on as Argentina manager but most of the squad hope he is still in charge when they play the Republic of Ireland in a friendly on August 11. During the welcome home party at the AFA, Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez and Mario Bolatti spoke privately with Maradona, trying to persuade him to stay on as manager.         
	Being managed by Maradona is a unique thing. I would like it if he were to continue, but it is his decision, Guttierez added.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

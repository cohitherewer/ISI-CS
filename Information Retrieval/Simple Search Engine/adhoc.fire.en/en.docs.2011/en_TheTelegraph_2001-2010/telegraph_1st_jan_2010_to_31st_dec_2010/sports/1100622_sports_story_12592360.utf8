The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Portuguese sing in the rain
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                          Portuguese sing in the rain
      GUEST COLUMN - P.K BANERJEE                                              
	To use the clich, Portugal now are in seventh heaven. Thats for sure. Scoring seven goals against North Korea in this World Cup Group G was a treat for the millions of football fans around the world. In the true sense, the Cristiano Ronaldos and Tiagos were singing in the rain. The first came at the half-hour mark and then Portugal pumped in six more after the change of ends at the rain-drenched Cape Town Stadium. And with a little bit of luck they could have got at least three more!         
	Goals by Raul Meireles in the first half, Simao Sabrosa, Hugo Almeida and Tiago in a seven-minute blitz early in the second, and further strikes by substitute Liedson, Ronaldo and Tiago again secured the win that took them on to four points.         
	For those who like to hear about history, this is Portugals biggest win in the World Cup and North Koreans heaviest defeat in international football.        
	When the draw was made last December both Portugal and Ivory Coast must have thought of improving their goal difference versus North Korea, the weakest team in the group. But I am sure Portugal never thought of scoring so many! Especially after a not so impressive first match against Ivory Coast and a very ordinary first half against the North Koreans.         
	Right now, they have one foot in the second round, thanks to an imposing nine-goal difference over Ivory Coast. Portugal have scored seven and conceded none, while the Ivorians have scored one and conceded three. The Ivorians now have a mountain to climb and it will be interesting to see how they react against the North Koreans on June 25.        
	There were so many positives coach Carlos Quieroz and his men will take from this match. Skipper Ronaldo got his first international goal  his teams sixth of the match  in 16 months, Tiago, who got a start since Deco was not fit, was a revelation in the centre of the park, and the two lateral backs, Miguel and Fabio Coentrao, were simply amazing.                     Portuguese players celebrate after Tiagos (centre) goal, in Cape Town, on Monday. (AP)      
	The scintillating attacking display even had the great Eusebio on his feet and after Cristiano scored the goal, he was seen showing the thumbs up sign to the Real Madrid frontliner.        
	But North Korea started very brightly and created two chances, which they should have converted. Once Jong Tae-se failed to reach a delightful lob and then Pak Nam-chol could not direct a header off a rebound from very close.         
	Once Portugal got a footing in the treacherous turf, it was all over for the North Koreans. They are now out of the World Cup and their main moto on June 25 will to concede lesser number of goals. They looked amateurish in the second half with no plan whatsoever against the marauding Portuguese and I think heads will roll in the North Korean team once they return home. And to believe 44 years earlier, they had Portugal in all sorts of trouble.        
	I was very impressed by Tiagos performance in the attacking third. He had a role in the first goal, a defence splitting pass, which caught the rival defence on the wrong foot, and then scored two.         
	On Monday, he came in place of an injured Deco and it will be surprising if Deco gets another chance in this World Cup. Tiago has cemented his place in this Portuguese line-up.        
	Now, something about Cristiano. Since he was not getting goals for the national team, he was low on confidence. And with dribbles and step-overs becoming very predictable, Cristiano was not been able to give the cutting edge he is expected to. Once he started to play passes and run, it was a different story altogether.         
	And with luck he also ended his goal drought. After the ball bounced off a diving North Korean goalkeeper Ri Myong-guk, it fell on Cristianos shoulder and then on his head. He did not have a clue where the ball was but once he got an idea he slotted it home with his customary swagger.         
	Sometimes, in football you need luck to back you. With the monkey off his back, I am sure we will see more goals from Cristiano in this World Cup.

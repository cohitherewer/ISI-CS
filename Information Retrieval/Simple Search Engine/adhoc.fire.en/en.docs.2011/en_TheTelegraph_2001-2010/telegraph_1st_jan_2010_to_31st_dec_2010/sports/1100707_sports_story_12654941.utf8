            A STAFF REPORTER            Muralidharan                           
	Calcutta: Worlds leading wicket-taker and Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan has decided to retire from Test cricket after the first Test, against India, in Galle, commencing July 18.         
	In a career spanning 18 years, the 38-year-old has taken 792 wickets in 132 Tests and 515 wickets in 337 ODIs.         
	According to a Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) media release on Tuesday, Muralidharan spoke with the SLC officials and President Mahinda Rajapakse before taking the decision.         
	Muralidharan has had discussions with the national selectors, SLC officials and has had the blessings of the President Mahinda Rajapakse and the minister of sports Hon. C.B. Ratnayake, the release said.         
	Although he will no longer play Test cricket after the first match of the three-Test series against India, Murali has kept open the option of playing the 2011 World Cup, to be co-hosted by Sri Lanka along with India and Bangladesh.         
	His was an enthralling battle for supremacy with Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne as both kept re-writing the highest wicket record. Warne retired with 708 scalps and Murali overtook him in December 2007 against England at his home ground in Kandy.         
	He achieved the grand double of being the highest wicket-taker in ODIs as well when he went past Wasim Akrams record of 502 wickets in 2009.         
	About a year ago, Murali had announced he would retire after the home series against the West Indies later this year, but in last November he said he could advance the Test retirement.         
	I am 37 years old and I cant bowl as much as those days because I get tired after 15-16 overs, he had said. But I will try and play a little bit of one-day cricket thats only 10 overs to bowl.         
	Murali has taken 792 wickets in 132 Tests and 515 wickets in 337 ODIs.

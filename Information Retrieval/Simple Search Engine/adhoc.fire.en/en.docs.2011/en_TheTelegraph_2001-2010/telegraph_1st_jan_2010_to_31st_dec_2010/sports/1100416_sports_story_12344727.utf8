The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Playing in IPL better preparation: Sehwag
                                                                                                                       7                                      Playing in IPL better preparation: Sehwag
                      
	New Delhi: Playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) is a far better way to prepare for the World Twenty20 than merely practising in the nets, according to star Indian opener Virender Sehwag.         
	He dismissed the notion that India would be at a disadvantage because the entire squad, busy playing the IPL till April 25, would not have time to train together before the tournament starts on April 30. The Nawab of Najafgarh said playing matches is far better than having net sessions.         
	Im not too worried about us not being together until just before the tournament as were all practising together here in India during the IPL, and its good to be playing T20 matches rather than practising for four hours, said Sehwag.         
	Besides, he pointed out, it was the same with most other countries as well.         
	Its not that just the India players are not getting practice, there are players from all over the world playing in the IPL, Sehwag was quoted as saying in the World T20 newsletter.         
	India won the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007, in South Africa, and Sehwag sounded optimistic of the teams chances because of the presence of a number of match-winners in their ranks.         
	I think in the Indian team, Yusuf Pathan, Yuvraj Singh, Gautam Gambhir are the key players. When you look at the other teams, I think they all have two or three good players who can win matches on their own, Sehwag remarked.         
	Pakistan, the losing finalists in 2007, won the title in 2009 after beating Sri Lanka in final, and Sehwag expected the Asian teams to do well again.         
	Explaining why the Asians have been doing well in the mega event, the swashbuckling right-hander said: I think because the game is shorter and as Ive said previously, because any team can beat any team on a given day.

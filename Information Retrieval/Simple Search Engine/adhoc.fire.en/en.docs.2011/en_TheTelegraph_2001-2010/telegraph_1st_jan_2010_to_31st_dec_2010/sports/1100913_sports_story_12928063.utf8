The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kim Grand mom, again

            Karen Crouse                                  
	New York: It was over in less than an hour, but no matter. Kim Clijsters will savour her 6-2, 6-1 victory against Vera Zvonareva in the US Open final much longer than she did last years championship.         
	Clijsterss 2009 title run was the first major moment in her life that she was unable to share with her father, Leo, whose death from lung cancer that January had driven her back to the tennis court and out of a 27-month retirement.         
	Last year my emotions were very confusing, she said, because they were happiness but then also sad at the same time.         
	After Clijsters dispatched Zvonareva in 59 minutes Saturday night, her joy was unfettered. She scampered into the Arthur Ashe Stadium seats to give her husband, Brian Lynch, the kind of kiss generally bestowed upon soldiers returning from the battlefield.         
	To come through under that kind of pressure, which was non-existent last year when she was unseeded, is what probably Im most pleased with over these last 14 days, that I was able to do that.         
	Its always an honour to go back to a place, especially a Grand Slam, where youve done well and youve won, and you want to bring your best tennis again. I know if I give my best, Im capable of beating the best players.         
	Before Clijsters, 27, became the queen of the Open with 21 consecutive victories at the tournament, her claim to the crown was roundly questioned.         
	This year it was the 26-year-old Zvonareva who found herself on the couch of the armchair psychoanalysts, with her temperament a continuing topic of conversation. The rub on her was that she was too emotional, as evidenced by her tear-filled meltdowns during a loss in the womens doubles final at Wimbledon and in a fourth-round defeat to Flavia Pennetta at last years Open.         
	The first cracks in Zvonarevas composure on Saturday appeared 19 minutes into the first set, when Clijsters earned her first break point, in the sixth game. She won the point when a backhand by Zvonareva sailed out.         
	That side would be Zvonarevas thorn all night. Twelve of her 17 forced errors and nine of her 24 unforced errors came on her backhand. Zvonareva lost the first set when she netted a backhand after digging herself a 0-40 hole.         
	It was the first set she had dropped in the tournament. On the changeover, Zvonareva remained on the court and shooed a ball girl out of the way so she could hit a backhand over the net.         
	Neither her backhand nor her disposition improved in the second set. In the first game, Zvonareva slid into a half-split position to retrieve a shot deep to her backhand side. When she could not reach the ball, she smashed her racket onto the court three times until it was as frayed as her nerves seemed to be.         
	When I cracked my racket, I was like, Come on, Zvonareva said. The ball is just two steps away. I was able to get this ball in previous matches, and right now Im just like so slow, cannot move. She added: You just let the emotions out. Maybe it will help.         
	Kim just played very well today, Zvonareva said on the court as she fought back tears. She deserved to win.         
	The brevity of the match  59 minutes  made it the shortest womens final at the Open since at least 1980, the first year the matches were timed. Clijsters said she told Zvonareva afterward: Just keep it going. It will happen.         
	A grateful Zvonareva said, Shes not only a great champion but also a great person. She added, Maybe because she said that, maybe Im not so disappointed right now.         
	The scene of Clijsters holding aloft the trophy did not impress Jada Lynch, Clijsterss two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, who warily backed away when Clijsters tried to let her touch the trophy and later was overhead telling photographers, No photos.         
	The first time Clijsters played in an Open final was in 2003, when the tournament was missing the games top two women, Serena and Venus Williams, because of injuries. Clijsters said that her straight-sets loss that year to her fellow Belgian, Justine Henin, was a blur, and that she has learned to better control her emotions.         
	Serena Williams, the current No. 1, was absent again this year after foot surgery. Her absence was supposed to open the draw, but in the end Clijsters became the first woman to successfully defend her Open title since Venus Williams in 2001.

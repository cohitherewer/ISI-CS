The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights better than Kings
                                                                                                                       7                                      Knights better than Kings
  - Manoj top-scorer for kkr with unbeaten 75; captain sourav hits 50       A CORRESPONDENT                                        
	A tale of two overs  thats the best way to summarise the Knights success story at the floodlit Mohali on Saturday.         
	Two overs (during their batting), precisely the first and the last, did the trick for the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) against the Kings XI Punjab as they notched up a handsome 39-run victory.         
	With this well-deserved and much-needed victory, Sourav Gangulys men snapped their three-match losing streak and registered their third win of the meet, thereby moving up to the fifth spot in the points table.         
	The Knights total of 183 for five, their highest so far in this edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), might have proved too much for the Kings XI, but just take away their first over  which yielded 19 runs  and the final one  which brought 21 runs. That subtracts 40 runs from their total. For the record, the Kings XI fell 39 short!         
	And why should we talk about only two overs? Because the Knights donned a similar (as in the last few matches) pale complexion during the middle overs of their innings and it did appear that they were, once again, going to fall short of their desired total.         
	But the day belonged to Manoj Tiwary. The right-handed Bengal batsman, who was drafted into the team in place of Cheteshwar Pujara, justified his selection hitting an unbeaten 47-ball 75 to be the top-scorer for the Knights.         
	His knock was studded with eight boundaries and two sixes, both of which came in the last over off Irfan Pathan. The Knights collected 21 off the last over and it was Manoj who did the damage. He later returned to snare a brilliant diving catch, sending back dangerman Yuvraj Singh and dent the Kings XIs chances.         
	Captain Sourav contributed a well-made 50 off 40 balls to aid his teams cause. His innings, comprising of six boundaries and a six, will also help release some of the pressure on him.         
	Needing 184 for victory, Kumar Sangakkaras side required a solid start. On the contrary, Shane Bond trapped Ravi Bopara with the very second ball of the innings to inflict early damage.         
	Manvinder Bisla (22) and Yuvraj staged a brief fightback before their 42-run stand was terminated. Yuvraj was looking ominous, hitting comeback man Ajit Agarkar for a four and a six off successive balls, before ballooning the next delivery to square leg, where Manoj pulled off a beauty.         
	Much depended on the Sri Lankan duo of Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene. However, both managed mediocre shows scoring 30 and 16 respectively. The hosts managed 144 for six in their 20 overs. Sourav used seven bowlers on the day and barring Ashok Dinda, all of them put up a disciplined performance. Bond and Agarkar claimed two wickets each.         
	The day had begun encouragingly for the Knights as Chris Gayle (14) and some wayward bowling contributed towards the accumulation of 19 runs from the very first over. Aussie Brett Lee, taking the ground for the first time in this IPL, was at the receiving end. Sourav, too, joined the party, smashing Irfan for consecutive boundaries in the very next over.         
	But losing Gayle, followed by young Mandeep Singh (4), took some of the zing off the Knights onslaught.         
	The Knights finally managed to play like kings.

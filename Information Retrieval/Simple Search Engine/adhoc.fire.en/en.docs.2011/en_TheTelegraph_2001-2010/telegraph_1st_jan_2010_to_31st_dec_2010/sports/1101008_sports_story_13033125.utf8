            OUR CORRESPONDENT                Poulami Ghatak and Mouma Das                            
	New Delhi: The Indian womens table tennis team created history when they entered the final, at the Yamuna Sports Complex, here, on Thursday. The fourth-seeded womens team spanked third seed England 3-0.         
	Former national champion Kumaresan Shamini overcame some early challenge before beating Kelly Sibley 3-1 to give the hosts a winning start. Bengals Mouma Das and reigning national champion Poulami Ghatak then defeated Joanna Parker and Hannah Hicks, respectively, with identical 3-0 scorelines.         
	In the final, the Indians will take on top-seeded Singapore, who eased past Malaysia 3-0 in the other semi-final.         
	Its all because of the team spirit. Our China trip has paid off. The way we are playing I dont see any reason why we should not get the gold medal, Poulami told The Telegraph. Poulami, however, added: They are the world champions and so they are the favourites.         
	In tennis, however, it was a mixed day for Leander Paes and Sania Mirza. Paes and Mirza crashed out of the mixed doubles event losing to Scotlands Colin Fleming and Jocelyn Rae 5-7, 4-6. Top-seed in mens singles Somdev Dev Varman, reached the semifinals of five other events.         
	In the afternoon of an unusually humid Thursday, Leander and Mahesh Bhupathi overcame anxious moments to beat the English pair of Josh Goodall and Jason Warden 6-2, 7-6 (4), 6-7 (4). On the centre court, Sania, cheered on by husband and Pakistan cricketer Shoaib Malik, showed New Zealands Marina Erakovic the door with a 6-2 6-3 win.         
	The day began on a high note as Somdev edged past New Zealands sixth seed Rubin Statham 6-3, 6-4. The day got even better when the unseeded pair of Nirupama Sanjeev and Poojashree Venkatesh shocked second-seeded British pair of Sarah Borewell and Anna Smith 7-5 6-4 in the womens doubles quarter-finals.         
	The mens doubles pair of Somdev and Rohan Bopanna, seeded second, also had to slog to beat Australian pair of Matt Ebden and Greg Jones 7-6 (5) 6-4 in the quarter finals.         
	In gymnastics, India created history by bagging their first gymnastics medal with Ashish Kumar clinching the bronze medal in floor exercise category in the mens event.         
	I am very happy to win the bronze medal, said the Kumar.         
	In archery, the India trio of Bheigyabati Chanu, Jhano Hansdah and Gagandeep won bronze in the womens compound event beating Malaysia 223-219.         
	In badminton, P Kashyap pulled off an incredible win over higher-ranked Rajiv Ouseph as India avenged a four-year-old semifinal loss to England, thrashing the visitors 3-0 to assure themselves of a silver in the team event.         
	Kashyap rose to the occasion and notched up a thrilling straight-game win over 16th ranked Ouseph to help India set up a summit clash with Malaysia.         
	The mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V Diju gave India a 1-0 lead with a brilliant 21-17 21-17 win over Nathan Robertson and Jenny Wallwork in the first tie followed by Kashyap, who thrashed Ouseph 21-13 21-17 to extend Indias lead.         
	World No. 3 Saina Nehwal then sent Liz Cann packing 21-18 21-11.         
	In athletics, Bengals Jhuma Khatun clocked her personal best to qualify for the womens 1500m final, while compatriot Sushma Devi fell by the wayside after a disappointing performance. Jhuma bettered her personal best of 4:14.32s, which she set in July, to finish sixth in womens 1500m heat one. Sushma clocked 4:22.05s, way below her personal best of 4:13.22s and seasons best of 4:14.06s, to finish seventh in the second heat and crashed out of the competition.         
	In mens high jump, national record holder Hari Shankar Roy of Bengal and Nikhil Chittarasu qualified for the finals with identical efforts of 2.16m. Roy equalled his seasons best show although he was way below his personal best of 2.25m which he did six years ago.

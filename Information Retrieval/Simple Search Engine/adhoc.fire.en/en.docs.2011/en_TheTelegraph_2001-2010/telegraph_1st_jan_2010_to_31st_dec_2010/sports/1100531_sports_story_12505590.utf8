The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Am hungrier for runs, says Rohit
                                                                                                                       7                                      Am hungrier for runs, says Rohit
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	After hitting back-to-back centuries, India batsman Rohit Sharma said at the post-match presentation ceremony that he is confident about keeping up the good work. His captain Suresh Raina praised him too for his brilliant batting .         
	Raina, who is donning the captains cap as Mahendra Singh Dhoni (along with other seniors) have been rested, admitted that he forgot the bowling Powerplay during the match.         
	Sri Lankan captain Tillekaratne Dilshan felt that it was his batsmen who let him down on a batting wicket. Although Angelo Mathews played well and Dilshan showed glimpses of returning back to form with a half century, 242 was never going to enough against a talented Indian batting line-up.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Raina: Its been an all-round effort. Thanks to both Rohit and Virat (Kohli) who batted well. It was also a good effort from the bowlers as they restricted Lankans to less than 250... Pragyan and Dinda, especially, bowled well. I never thought about bonus points. The focus was on winning the match and I am happy that we have achieved that. I must admit that I forgot about the bowling Powerplay today (Sunday). I thought I had told the umpires about the bowling Powerplay, but when I asked them, they reminded me that I hadnt told them. Now having won this match, we will like to win the remaining matches too.         
	Dilshan: When you have 240 runs on the board, you have to bowl in the right areas. It could have been different had we got 280-290 runs on the board. The two run-outs cost us dear. We were at least 50 runs short on this kind of a track. Neither the fast bowlers nor the spinners got any purchase from the wicket. We couldnt stop the singles, but on this track theres hardly anything one can do. Full credit to Rohit and Kohli for the manner in which they batted. Now we have a must-win game against Zimbabwe. We have to win that one to be back in competition.         
	Rohit: Its always nice to get consecutive hundreds. But this is not the end as I need to continue with this good form. I was very disappointed that we lost the match against Zimbabwe despite having scored a century. But the boys showed character as they fought well to come back in this match. We played beautifully. The best part was to restrict them under 250. Of the two pitches that we have played so far, this was a better wicket. The ball was coming on to the bat nicely. But I would say that it was a bit on the slower side. I would say that the wicket was of two-paced nature. We had to adjust our strokeplay accordingly. We didnt wanted to rush. We knew that one big partnership will do it for us. After 25 overs, we always maintained a run-rate of above five per over. I have been batting well but there is nothing special that I did during the time when I was out of the Indian team. Its just that I am hungrier for runs.

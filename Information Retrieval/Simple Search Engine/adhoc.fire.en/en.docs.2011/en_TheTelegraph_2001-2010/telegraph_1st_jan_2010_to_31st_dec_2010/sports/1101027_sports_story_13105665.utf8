                                                                                                                       7                                      Ponting, Watson return
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Captain Ricky Ponting and all-rounder Shane Watson returned from a short break along with fit-again wicketkeeper Brad Haddin in the 15-member Australian squad for the ODI series against Sri Lanka next month.         
	The selection of this one-day squad marks the start of a very important summer of one-day cricket for the Australian side as it continues its preparation for the ICC Cricket World Cup in the Indian subcontinent, National Selection Panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said in a statement.         
	The squad sees the return of Ponting and Watson after missing the Indian one-day series and also the return of Haddin from injury, he said.         
	The return of the trio, however, shut the door on the explosive David Warner and Callum Ferguson, who were part of the squad for the just-concluded ODI series against India but did not get a game after two of the three matches were washed out. Australia lost the series 0-1.         
	On the bowling front, Mitchell Johnson returns to lead the attack after being given a break.         
	Nathan Hauritz will miss the first one-day game of the series to allow him to be available for selection for the Sheffield Shield match at the Gabba, Hilditch said.         
	THE SQUAD         
	Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke (vice-captain), Xavier Doherty, Brad Haddin, John Hastings, Nathan Hauritz, Mike Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Marsh, Clint McKay, Peter Siddle, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Shane Watson, Cameron White.

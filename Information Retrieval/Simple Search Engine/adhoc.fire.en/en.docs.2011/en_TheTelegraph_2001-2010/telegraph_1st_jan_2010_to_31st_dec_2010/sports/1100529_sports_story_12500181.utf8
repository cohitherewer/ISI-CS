	Berlin: Bayern Munich defender Philipp Lahm will captain Germany in place of the injured Michael Ballack, coach Joachim Loew said on Friday.         
	Lahm has played in his position with great class and will take over the role of captain, Loew said at their Italian training camp. Meanwhile, Mario Gomez and Miroslav Klose scored five times each in Germanys 24-0 victory over an under-20 selection of South Tirol on Wednesday.               
	Johannesburg: Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar is horrified by the ball which will be used at the World Cup, likening it to a cheap one bought from the supermarket.               
	Johannesburg: South Africa has invited Sudans Omar al-Bashir to the continents first World Cup along with the rest of Africas leadership, but will arrest him if he takes up the invitation, President Jacob Zuma said. Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes.               
	Paris: Cameroon could do reasonably well at the World Cup  if Samuel Eto doesnt blow a fuse first. The Inter Milan forward, Cameroons star of the present, is catching some flak from Roger Milla, its star of the past. I wont reply. Im the best goal-scorer in the history of the African Cup Ive won the African Cup, Ive won an Olympic gold medal. That says everything, Eto shot back.

	Calcutta: Mukesh Kumar fired a four-under 66 to race into a three-stroke lead on the third day of the Aircel-PGTI Players Championship being held at the Tollygunge Club. Mukesh currently has a total of 10-under 200. Manav Jaini is placed second.         
	Mukesh Kumar (65, 69, 66), is now on the verge of record ninth title on the PGTI tour. He played a steady and bogey-free round to ensure that he enjoys a comfortable lead heading into the final round. He birdied the fifth and seventh to make the turn at two under. Mukesh had an eagle opportunity from 20 feet on the seventh but just missed out on that putt.         
	Manav (67, 67, 69), who is currently second at seven-under 203, made five birdies against four bogeys for his 69.         
	Anthony Choat of Australia, Calcuttas Raju Ali Mollah and Om Prakash Chouhan are tied third at five-under 205. Digvijay Singh is a further stroke behind in sixth place. Shiv Prakash and Feroz Ali Mollah share seventh place at three-under 207.

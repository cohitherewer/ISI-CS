The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alonso sets the pace at practice
                                                                                                                       7                                      Alonso sets the pace at practice
                      
	Hockenheim: Formula One championship leader Lewis Hamilton crashed his McLaren in practice for the German Grand Prix on Friday while Ferrari and Red Bull rivals demonstrated their speed.         
	Hamilton had to sit out all but 12 minutes of the afternoon session, which ended with Ferraris Fernando Alonso on top, after skidding off and smashing sideways into the tyre wall before lunch.         
	I damaged the car quite heavily this morning. It was very slippery and I hit the limiter coming out of Turn Three, shifted gear, which spun the wheels, and had an oversteer moment, said the Briton. I tried to correct it and that put me on to the grass, where I was just a passenger.         
	The 2008 world champion, a winner at Hockenheim in 2008, still managed to set the seventh fastest time despite completing just 10 laps after lunch to add to eight from the morning. The accident took all four corners off the car, so I was a little bit upset with myself, said the 25-year-old.         
	The guys work so hard during the week to get the car ready, and then you get to the track, do a few laps, and total the car, which isnt great. It was a huge amount of work for the guys, too, but theyve just been phenomenal.         
	Teammate Jenson Button, the reigning world champion who is 12 points behind the younger Briton, ended the first session third fastest but was only 15th in the second.         
	Overall leaders McLaren had hoped to get some testing miles on their new floor and blown diffuser but the wet conditions made that difficult. Despite that, team boss Martin Whitmarsh said the new package would be raced.         
	While the McLaren mechanics worked overtime, Ferrari and Red Bull filled the top four places. Ferraris double world champion Fernando Alonso was fastest with a lap of one minute 16.265, 0.029 quicker than home favourite Sebastian Vettel in the Red Bull.         
	The Germans Australian teammate Mark Webber was fourth behind Ferraris Brazilian Felipe Massa.         
	We have seen before on Fridays that we are very competitive and then on Saturday, the Red Bulls are clearly quicker, so we have to take this result with a pinch of salt, cautioned Alonso.         
	In order to be in front tomorrow, we will have to do something out of the ordinary.         
	In the morning session, run in heavier rain with cars skidding and spinning as if on an ice rink, Force Indias Adrian Sutil topped the timesheets with compatriot Michael Schumacher lapping second slowest on extreme wet tyres.

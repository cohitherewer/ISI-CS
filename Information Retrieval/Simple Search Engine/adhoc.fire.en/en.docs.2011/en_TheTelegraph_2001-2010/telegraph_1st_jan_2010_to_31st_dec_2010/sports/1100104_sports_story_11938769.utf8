	Bangalore: Half centuries from Manish Pandey and K.B. Pawan helped Karnataka make a steady 255 for four on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy semi-final against Uttar Pradesh at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here Sunday.         
	A composed Rahul Dravid and R. Vinay Kumar were at the crease, promising to consolidate the hosts position on a hurriedly prepared slow and low deck.         
	Opting to bat first, Karnataka began on a sedate note with Robin Uthappa and Pawan producing a 42-run stand for the first wicket. Uthappa was in good nick, but committed suicide, attempting to paddle sweep left-arm spinner Praveen Gupta.         
	Umpire Sanjay Hazare had no hesitation in giving Uthappa out leg before wicket.         
	Pawan, a prolific run-getter this season, frustrated Uttar Pradesh with his strong defence, in the company of a confident Ganesh Satish (49).         
	They were in complete command before Rudra Pratap Singh took two wickets in five balls, having Pawan and Satish snared behind the wickets by Amir Khan.           (PTI)

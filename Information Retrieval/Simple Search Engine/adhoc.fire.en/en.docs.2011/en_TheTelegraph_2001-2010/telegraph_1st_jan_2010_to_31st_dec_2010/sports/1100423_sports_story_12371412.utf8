  - Chennai Super Kings set up summit clash with the Mumbai Indians       K. KUMARASWAMY            Chennai Super Kings players celebrate the wicket of Deccan Chargers captain, Adam Gilchrist, during the second semi-final in Navi Mumbai, on Thursday. (PTI)                                 
	Mumbai: The ball dominating the bat and a poor turnout might have been at variance with the proven success formula of the IPL. But it hardly mattered to the Chennai Super Kings.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men stormed into their maiden final after knocking out defending champions Deccan Chargers with a 38-run victory in the second semi-final at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on Thursday.         
	The Chennai side exchanged extravagance for discipline while posting a competitive total of 142 for seven.         
	The Chargers failed to learn the lessons from their rivals approach and were skittled out for 104 with four balls to spare.         
	The win helped the Super Kings snap the Chargers five-match winning streak and set up a date with Mumbai Indians in Sundays summit clash at the same venue.         
	On a pitch offering significant help to the bowlers, the Super Kings applied themselves better than their opponents in all departments of the game.         
	Captain Dhoni (30) and Subramaniam Badrinath (37) demonstrated the virtues of patience with their vital 52-run partnership that contained just four boundaries and no sixes.         
	Then, 23-year-old offie Ravichandran Ashwin (1/14) and Man of the Match Doug Bollinger (4/13), not to forget Muthiah Muralidharan (1/16) and Albie Morkel (1/15), showed that aggression could be shown with the ball too, with their tidy and intimidating bowling.         
	Gilchrist would be disappointed, considering that his side was failing to chase a target for the third time in as many matches here. They had earlier lost to the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Mumbai Indians in the league stage.         
	Definitely, they wouldnt want to believe this is their home centre!         
	The Chargers, however, still have a chance to set that record straight as they would be up against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the third-fourth place play-off on Saturday.         
	The Dhoni-Badrinath association came during a crucial phase of the innings after three wickets had fallen for 29.         
	Matthew Hayden failed to capitalise on the twin reprieves and Suresh Raina failed to negotiate Andrew Symonds turn and bounce.         
	Murali Vijays leg before wicket, from a sharp low turner, was a sign of things to come later in the evening.         
	In the circumstances, Badrinaths knock was commendable. His vigil at the crease ensured that the innings did not fall apart after Dhonis dismissal.         
	It was not as if Badrinath went into a shell either. He slammed Harmeet Singh for a boundary immediately after his skippers departure before picking Pragyan Ojha and Andrew Symonds for a six and four. respectively.         
	The Super Kings then owed it to Aniruddha Srikkanth for the late flourish. Thanks to Srikkanths 15-ball 24, the last five overs fetched 46 runs.         
	If the Chargers were ecstatic during the interval, they soon realised what a mountain of a target they had to overhaul.         
	With offie Ashwin and Bollinger on top of their game, the first two produced just two runs. Bollingers second over, in fact, was a maiden, only the tenth in the IPL this season.         
	The first 13 balls Adam Gilchrist played contained nine dot balls. The Australian had played some sizzlers in his heydays, but on Thursday, his slow reflexes while trying to tackle Bollinger were there to be seen.         
	Bollinger, although pulled for a six over midwicket, had his man when Srikkanth took a good low catch at midwicket.         
	Bollinger then got a bonus for his hard work when Tirumalasetti Suman, the in-form batsman for the Chargers, slashed him straight to Raina at point.         
	Rohit Sharma, in the Indian squad for the World T20, then holed out to long on before Herschelle Gibbs played Shadab Jakati on to his stumps.         
	The last ray of hope vanished with the fall of Symonds for 23.

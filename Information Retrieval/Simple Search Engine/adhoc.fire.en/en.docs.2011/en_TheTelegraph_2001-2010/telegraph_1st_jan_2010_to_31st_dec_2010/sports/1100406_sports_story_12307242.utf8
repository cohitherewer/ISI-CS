The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: Back in the mix
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne: Back in the mix
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Shane Warne attributed the Rajasthan Royals close victory over the Deccan Chargers to team spirit in Nagpur on Monday, and hoped they would make it to the semi-finals.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Warne: It was one of those days when a few things went right for us... Our fielding and catching was superb. We have responded well as a group. Young Dole took a few wickets, Morne bowled a beautiful spell. Its important that you back your players. Sid (Siddharth) Trivedi is an experienced player and we are very happy to have him back. What a superb over. This is the time to start peaking. We are going to get a lot of momentum from this win. We have three matches in Jaipur and are right back in the mix.         
	Adam Gilchrist: Great innings from Rohit (Sharma)... He kept us alive till the end. He did a great job. I had my chances when I was there I let it slip. There are senior players in the side and the experienced heads should take a bit more responsibility.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag adds value: Aravinda
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sehwag adds value: Aravinda
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  Aravinda de Silva        
	Colombo: Hailing Virender Sehwag as one of the finest of the present generation, Aravinda de Silva pointed out that batsmen like him allowed others to focus on their game.         
	In other words, made it easy for the team.         
	Look, 10-15 years ago, Sehwag wouldnt have played another Test after the manner in which he got out this morning... However, times have changed and the batsmen are being allowed to play their natural game, Aravinda, a former captain who is now Sri Lankas chief selector, told The Telegraph.         
	He added: I remember I had to adjust my game in the teams interest... There was pressure from the public, so one had to change... Today, thats not a requirement and the freedom to express yourself is there.         
	Speaking over lunch in the Chairmans Box at the P.Sara Oval, on Thursday, Aravinda continued: Sehwag definitely adds value... If I was the opposition captain, Id try not to give him much room outside off and also not bowl too straight...         
	Triple hundreds dont come easy and Sehwag has two of them... Hes got a quick eye and good co-ordination.         
	Aravinda, incidentally, himself wasnt one to respect reputations and was a blaster in his own right. He played 93 Tests and 308 ODIs between 1984 and 2003.         
	Talking of his new role, Aravinda said: Its challenging, for one would like Sri Lanka to again win the World Cup, in 2011... We have the team, but theres always the chance of players getting injured...         
	In general terms, I feel sorry for the players... Theres enough talent around, but only 11 can play... Its tough to leave out.         
	Aravinda, now 44, had been the MoM both in the semi-final and final of the 1996 World Cup, won under Arjuna Ranatungas captaincy.         
	Hed briefly been a selector once before, around 2004.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manohar is livid at Modi

    - IPL chairman faces censure at governing body meeting           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                  Shashank Manohar amp; Lalit Modi                                 
	Calcutta: Shashank Manohar, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, is understood to be livid at Lalit Modi, the Indian Premier League (IPL)s chairman and commissioner.         
	According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, Manohar has made it amply clear that Modi had no business tweeting on matters official and confidential.         
	Manohar has, in his typically straightforward manner, told Modi that anything to do with the shareholding pattern of a franchise should only be discussed by the IPLs governing council and not on Twitter or some other public forum, one of the well-placed sources pointed out on Tuesday.         
	That, it seems, was conveyed on Monday, after the Team Kochi-Sunanda Pushkar-Shashi Tharoor affair got out of hand and left some of the eight existing franchises and possibly Sahara (which successfully bid for Pune, 2011 onwards) somewhat alarmed.         
	Like Pune, the Kochi franchise will take the field from IPL IV.         
	Manohars stand is that the IPL (which is a BCCI initiative) need not be bothered about the shareholding pattern as long as the bank guarantees are furnished and other mandatory requirements met... If Modi has reservations, he has to discuss within the governing council, not anywhere else, another well-placed source said.         
	With Manohar stepping in, the governing council will meet within 10 days.         
	One learns that Modi, whose appointment is for five years, starting 2007/08, will definitely be censured and unambiguously asked not to run a parallel organisation.         
	The IPL, essentially, is a sub-committee of the BCCI... Modi and his men must not lose sight of that... Hes gone very far and, now, its time for him to step back or be pushed back, emphasised yet another well-placed source.         
	Besides Manohar and Modi, the 14-member governing council includes former captains Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar and Ravi Shastri.         
	Privately, within the BCCI, quite a few accuse Modi of running the IPL like his fiefdom and, worse, of trying to undermine the supremacy of the parent body. The tweets have come in handy for the Modi-baiters.         
	That Modi has not been able to regain control of the Rajasthan Cricket Association, but continues to be a BCCI vice-president (from Central), remains a sore point.         
	Nothing to do with the IPL, yes, but certain things are inter-linked.         
	In keeping with his style, Manohar believes that the Sachin Tendulkars and Mahendra Singh Dhonis should be the face of Indian cricket, not administrators, whether it be Modi or somebody else.         
	Not that it has really been a factor, but Manohar and Modi are not seen as buddies (not since they helped Sharad Pawar oust Jagmohan Dalmiya in November 2005), but Modis bigger problem has been with BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan, who is all set to succeed Manohar, in 2011.         
	Srinivasan runs a franchise, too  the Chennai Super Kings. Many find that odd, but the bottomline is that the BCCI does not feel uncomfortable.         
	That is also odd, but the negatives do not end there.         
	Indeed, what is hardly comforting is the meddling, even in IPL matters, by politicians. Tharoor has admitted having been a mentor to the consortium which bagged Kochi, but the buzz is that two other Union ministers, too, were quite active when the new franchises were auctioned.         
	Modi, in many ways, is actually quite savvy. There is, therefore, surprise in some quarters that he tweeted indiscreetly. Was he pushed into doing so by somebody with plenty of influence?         
	The answer, perhaps, may never be known.

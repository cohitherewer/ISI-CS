	Ahmedabad: The debate whether the Motera strip is not ideal for Test cricket, or, if India fail to play to their potential here will once again rage after Sunday.         
	After taking a 28-run first innings lead, the hosts blew their chances of setting New Zealand a total and push for a result. India wrapped up the visitors for 459, but lost quick wickets to find themselves tottering at 82 for six at the end of the fourth days play.         
	Cricket can be a cussed game. India, who were tormentors in the first innings, were being tormented by New Zealand in the second. From 0 for one (0.3 overs), India were reduced to 2 for 3 in five overs. By tea, New Zealand smelled a famous victory over the No. 1 Test team. And they went one step closer by removing three more Indian batsmen to push the hosts to the brink of another humiliating defeat at Motera (India lost to South Africa by an innings and 90 runs, in April 2008).         
	Chris Martin was the wrecker-in-chief and the Black Caps seamer will remember this day for the rest of his life. He single-handedly decimated the Indian top-order and heralded his ninth five-wicket Test haul amidst extreme jubilation.         
	Martin bowled in two enviable bursts. His first spell returned figures of 9-6-15-4, while his second spell read 4-1-10-1. The crux of New Zealands upswing was their adherence to the basics. In a wicket that had some offering for speedsters on the fourth day, Martin kept it full and straight, varied his length, at times, and rarely sprayed anything wide.         
	Strangely, even a harmless ball like the one to Gautam Gambhir took ominous proportions, thanks to the batsmans mindless antics. Martin had pitched it wide and Gambhir nibbled at it sending an edge to keeper Gareth Hopkins behind stumps.         
	With a wicket down and little over a session left, India should have dropped the anchor and cut down anything ludicrous. But what followed minutes later baffled everyone. Rahul Dravid punched Daniel Vettori through mid-off and before he could finish watching Martin Guptil intercept his shot on follow-through, Virender Sehwag had raced down for a single. A quick throw at the bowlers end pulled the curtains on Sehwag.         
	Dravid spent some nervous moments but his ordeal ended when he poked at a Martin delivery on off stump. With Sachin Tendulkar cracking two fours off Martin in the seventh over, India thought their savour had arrived. But Martin, who had his tail up, got enough curl in the ball to induce an inside edge onto the stumps.         
	After Rainas departure, VVS Laxman and Mahendra Singh Dhoni added 50 runs for the sixth wicket, but it was Martin again who sent the Indian skipper back for 22. India have taken a 110-run lead and Laxman (34 batting) and Harbhajan Singh (12 batting) will start Indias fight to save the first Test on Monday.         
	Earlier, Kane Williamson (131) became the youngest New Zealander to score a Test hundred on debut.         
	Besides his baby-faced innocence, Williamson showed he possesses a buccaneering bat, a tactical mind and a heart of steel when it comes to pursuing ambition. Resuming from his overnight score of 87, not once did the 20-year-old blink against the Indian bowlers. He sailed into the 90s by deftly gliding Zaheer Khan for four in the third over and carted the same bowler for a boundary to bring up his maiden Test hundred.         
	New Zealand played to a plan  the individuals stuck to their task and, most importantly, they didnt crumble under pressure. After avoiding the follow-on Saturday, their next target was to get as close to Indias first innings total. The dearth of partnerships was made up by the 194-run stand between Ryder and Williamson, and Daniel Vettori and Williamson stitched together 86 runs for the sixth wicket to bolster their chances.         
	Vettori survived a few close calls in the morning, but gradually got himself into the mix by nudging for singles. His batting skills stood out when he started picking the Indian bowlers with consummate ease. He hoicked Pragyan Ojha for a six in the latters first over to register New Zealands 400. The Black Caps skipper completed his 4,000 career runs (another milestone at Motera) and during his 43-minute stay at the crease he scored his runs briskly.

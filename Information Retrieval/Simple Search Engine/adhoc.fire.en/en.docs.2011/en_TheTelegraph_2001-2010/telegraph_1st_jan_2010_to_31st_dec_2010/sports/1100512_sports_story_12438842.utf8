                  Arvind Bhat in Kuala Lumpur, on Tuesday                     
	New Delhi: P. Kashyap and Arvind Bhat starred in a 4-1 routing of Australia as India advanced to the last eight stage of the Thomas Cup finals but the womens team went down 1-4 to Korea, despite Saina Nehwals thrilling win over Seung Hee Bae in the Uber Cup in Kuala Lumpur, Tuesday.         
	Kashyap set the ball rolling for India, spanking Jeff Tho 21-8, 21-10 in a 26-minute match, while Arvind Bhat and Guru Sai Dutt also won their respective matches to put India 3-0 ahead.         
	Arvind beat Chad Whitehead 21-6, 21-12, while Guru took 25 minutes to pack off Stuart Gomez 21-15, 21-13.         
	The only blot in the mens team was the 20-22, 18-21 thrashing Sanave Thomas and Rupesh Kumar received at the hands of Glenn Warfe and Ross Smith in first mens doubles.         
	However, V Diju and Akshay Dewalkar swept past Raj Veeran and Chad Whitehead 21-12, 21-17 to wrap up the day with a 4-1 victory over the hapless Aussies.         
	The womens Uber Cup team, which had already reached the quarter finals Monday, however, had a tough day as none apart from Saina could get past the formidable Koreans.         
	World No. 6 Saina started the Indian proceedings, carving out a hard-fought 22-20, 18-21, 17-21 win over Seung Hee Bae in a 66-minute marathon battle.         
	But the Koreans were quick to draw parity with Hyo Jung Lee and Min Jung Kim seeing off Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa 21-11, 21-13 in the first womens doubles match. (PTI)

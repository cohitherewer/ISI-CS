The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gangjee slips to tied 20th 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gangjee slips to tied 20th 
                      
	Johor Bahru: Indian golfer Rahil Gangjee turned in an erratic level-par 72 to slip three places to tied 20th, after the penultimate round of the $1.25 million Iskandar Johor Open here Saturday.         
	The Calcutta-golfer fired five birdies but stumbled to an equal number of bogeys to total five-under 211 here.         
	Digvijay Singh carded a one-over 73 to lie tied 31st with a total of three-under 213.         
	A shot behind is the duo of Anirban Lahiri and Gaganjeet Bhullar, who turned in two-under 70 and one-over 73 respectively, at the Horizon Hills Golf and Country Club here.         
	Birdies and bogeys flew in equal measure from Gangjees club as he missed a stroke on the first hole, gained one at fourth before a bogey-birdie patch on the next two holes to make the turn at level-par.         
	His resumption journey was no different as he dropped two shots on the 11th and 12th but made amends on the 13th and 16th hole, before a bogey-birdie finish brought him back to square one.         
	At the top, Padraig Harrington of Ireland raced to a commanding five-shot lead despite playing with a neck injury, after carding a four-under 68. His three-day total of 17-under 199 put him well clear of Chinese Taipeis Lin Wen-tang, who needed two late birdies for an even-par 72 in the Asian Tour event. Singaporean Mardan Mamat fired a 70 for the third place.           (PTI)

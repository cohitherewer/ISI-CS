The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan nose ahead 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Pakistan nose ahead 
          
	Birmingham: Debutant Zulqarnain Haider scored a courageous 88 to frustrate Englands bid to win inside three days against Pakistan in the second Test at Edgbaston, on Sunday.         
	Pakistan, bowled out for just 72 on Friday before England replied with 251, reached 291 for nine at stumps to lead by 112 with two days remaining. Umar Gul, batting with a runner, was on nine and Mohammed Asif had 13.         
	Gul has been ruled out for the remainder of the series. Pakistan manager Yawar Saeed said that MRI scans and ultra sound tests have shown that Gul has a muscle rapture in his thigh which would take three to four weeks to heal. A decision on Guls replacement has not yet been taken.         
	Meanwhile, Haider came in at 82 for five with his team still 97 runs from avoiding an innings loss. Partnerships of 52 with Mohammed Amir and 115 with Saeed Ajmal, who hit a career best 50, ensured England were at least given a fight.         
	Pakistan, 1-0 down in the four-match series, were jolted by an inspired spell either side of lunch by off-spinner Swann, who took a test-best six for 60. Haider dug in, though, before he was the ninth victim when he drove Swann to mid-off.         
	Wicketkeeper Haider, picked for the omitted Kamran Akmal, looked to have bagged the unwanted tag of a king pair when given out lbw to Swann first ball. But a referral showed the ball had turned too much.         
	Haiders finest stroke was perhaps a thumping straight drive for four off pace bowler James Anderson that took him to 77. Another boundary driven through mid-on off Steven Finn raised his 50, when he knelt and kissed the turf.

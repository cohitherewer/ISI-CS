The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chidi to stay; Marcos will   be released
                                                                                                                       7                                        Chidi to stay; Marcos will   be released
            A STAFF REPORTER            Chidi                                 
	Calcutta: Putting all speculation to rest, Mohun Bagan retained the services of star striker Edeh Chidi for the 2010-11 season. Chidi, along with Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto, are the clubs two foreigners for the upcoming season.         
	We still have our CFL Premier Division title to defend and we didnt want any confusion regarding our foreign recruits. Thus the official announcement, finance secretary Debashish Dutta said.         
	With Mahindra striker Subair Muritala Ali already roped in as the third foreigner, it is curtains for Marcos Pereira who served the club well in the last two seasons. However, club general secretary Anjan Mitra said the announcement about the third foreigner would be made on June 1. This is as per the AIFF regulation which states that clubs cannot officially get into an agreement with any player before the above mentioned date. So, technically, Murithalas name cant be announced yet.         
	I had a couple of very good offers from outstation clubs. It really felt bad to say no to them. But I have no regrets. I had said earlier that I would take a decision after the Derby. The Bagan officials were cordial and sincere in their approach. So I said yes to them, Chidi revealed on his way out of the club premises.         
	East Bengal, on the other hand, have clinched deals with JCT striker Baljit Singh Sahni and defenders Gurwinder Singh and Sunil Kumar.         
	However, the club officials are still in the dark about the contractual commitments of those players who get selected by the AIFF for the 2011 Asian Cup.         
	It is not clear whether the players who are already entering into lucrative deals with various clubs will be paid at par by the AIFF who will reserve the players for a eight-month period during which they will focus exclusively on the meet in Doha.         
	There is some confusion. We arent signing any national team players till we get a circular from the parent body clarifying the terms and conditions of the contracts. Suppose we get into an agreement with a player and he is then roped in by AIFF, then will the contract with the club be valid?         
	Also, what happens to the player who gets seriously injured during the eight-month stint and then is unable to serve the club, wondered Bagan secretary Mitra.         
	A senior AIFF office-bearer, however, said that the federation wouldnt do anything that was detrimental to the interests of the clubs as well as the players.         
	The players interest is of paramount importance. None of the players will be hurt financially, the official said.

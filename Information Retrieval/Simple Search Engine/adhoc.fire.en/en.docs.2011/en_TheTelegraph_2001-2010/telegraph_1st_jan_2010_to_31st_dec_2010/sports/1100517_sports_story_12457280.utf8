The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Englands long wait is over
                                                                                                                       7                                      Englands long wait is over
            Richard Neale                      
	England beat Australia by seven wickets to win the World Twenty20 and record their first-ever triumph in an ICC one-day tournament.         
	Having been set 148 for victory, Kevin Pietersen and Craig Kieswetter made light work of the total in Barbados, sharing in a century stand which took the game away from the current World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy holders.         
	Having lost Michael Lumb early on, the South African-born pair came together on 7-1 and put the Australia bowlers to the sword. Feeding off each others success, the duos shot-making became increasingly audacious, with Kieswetter even hitting a six with one hand off the bat.         
	The Somerset wicketkeeper raced to his first ever international Twenty20 fifty off 40 balls. Pietersen perished trying to join him, caught for 47 by David Warner off the bowling of Steve Smith while attempting to hit a six over long off.         
	The stand had been worth 111, and nerves could have set in when Kieswetter perished soon after, stepping to leg and being bowled by Mitchell Johnson. Paul Collingwood and Eoin Morgan, though, finished the job with three overs to spare.         
	The total had never remotely looked like being enough, though Australia had been happy to post 147 for six from their 20 overs, having at one stage being in disarray at 8 for three in the third over.         
	After winning the toss and inserting Australia, Paul Collingwood got the perfect response from his bowlers with a wicket after just three balls.         
	Shane Watson flashed at an inviting wide ball from Ryan Sidebottom and found the top edge. Kieswetter was unable to hang on to the catch behind the stumps, but Graeme Swann at first slip was on hand to take the rebound.         
	Watsons highly dangerous opening partner, David Warner, went in the next over thanks to a smart piece of work in the field from Lumb. Michael Clarke dropped the ball into the offside and set off for a quick single. But Lumb was in like a flash from cover and broke the stumps with an underarm throw with Warner yards out of his ground.         
	Englands big contingent of fans were in raptures when Brad Haddin was sent on his way shortly afterwards for just one. Kieswetter took an excellent diving catch down the leg side off Sidebottoms bowling, though replays showed the ball probably brushed his shirt and was certainly nowhere near the bat.         
	Clarke and David Hussey set about trying to rebuild the innings and had taken the score to 45 when the Australia captain picked out his counterpart, who took a diving catch to his left at mid-wicket to give Sidebottom his second wicket.         
	Australia had shown in their semi-final victory over Pakistan that they are nothing if not resilient. A response was expected from the current World Cup and ICC Trophy champions and it came in the 13th over.         
	David Hussey and Cameron White both hit huge sixes off Michael Yardy, whose third over went for 21 runs. Suddenly 59 for four was 80 for four.         
	White, who became the leading six-hitter in the tournament, smashed 30 off 19 balls before he was caught by Stuart Broad off Luke Wright, the fielder having spurned the chance to catch a skier from David Hussey just four balls earlier. Broad lost the ball in the swirling wind and in the end did not even get his hands to the catch.         
	That brought together the enterprising Hussey brothers and they took the attack to England, finding holes in the field and amassing a priceless partnership of 47 from just 20 balls.         
	David Hussey was run out by Wright for 59 trying to sneak a second run, but Broad only conceding seven off the final over of the innings certainly swung the balance back Englands way.

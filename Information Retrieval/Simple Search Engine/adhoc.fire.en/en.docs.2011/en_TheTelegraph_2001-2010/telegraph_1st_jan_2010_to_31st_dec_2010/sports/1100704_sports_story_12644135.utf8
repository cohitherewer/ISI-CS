            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Johannesburg: Ghanas hope of taking African football to dizzy heights ended in heartbreak at the Soccer City Stadium on Friday night. As the youthful Black Stars succumbed to Uruguay in penalty shoot out, there were tears on the pitch and in the stands.         
	Moments after Uruguayan substitute Sebastian Abreu delivered a stunning Coup de Grace with his conversion of the last spot kick to take his team to the World Cup semi-finals for the first time in 40 years, the Ghana players were simply inconsolable on the ground. In the stands, several fans could be seen sobbing openly.         
	The Black Stars, without Michael Essien, their best player, became only the third African side after Cameroon and Senegal to reach last eight and came within a whisker of a place in the semi-finals.         
	But then, Ghana had themselves to blame for their shattered dream. They stood just one strike away from taking an African team to the last four for the first time when they were awarded a spot-kick after Luis Suarez handled the ball on the goalline seconds before the end of extra time. Asamoah Gyan had the entire continent behind him, willing him to score but the 24-year-olds strike hit the horizontal before sailing into the stands.         
	I thought we were out, said ace Uruguay striker Diego Forlan when Gyan was gearing up to take the penalty. I was convinced we were going home. I couldnt really believe my eyes when I saw the ball go into the stands. Suarez saved us.         
	Ghanas Serbian coach Milovan Rajevac struggled to contain his emotions during the post-match press conference. In the end, we had a historic opportunity. It would have been a fairytale win for all of us. I can say that we didnt deserve to lose this way, Rajevac said, his eyes swollen.         
	After all, this is football. We had a penalty but you saw it all. The opponents had the psychological advantage in the shoot out. Everything happened so fast. We really had big support and it would have been great if it ended well for us, but I would like to congratulate Uruguay on reaching the semi-finals, Rajevac said gracefully.         
	Like Rajevac, Gyan, too, was hugely disappointed. He wept in the arms of a teammate and was in no mood to talk. I have nothing to say. Its part of the game. The ball went in when Suarez handled the ball and did cross the line but the referee disallowed it. If it was our day, the referee would have seen it and whistled for a goal. We didnt have the luck going our way, Gyan said.         
	Some passionate fans had already made plans to celebrate before the game. Others remained optimistic even after Gyan missed the penalty. But it turned out to be complete anti-climax in the penalty shoot out. It was, however, Uruguay who had the last laugh winning the shoot out, after Ghanas captain John Mensah and Dominic Adiyiah had their spot kicks saved by Fernando Muslera.         
	For Uruguay, Maximiliano Pereira missed but Abreu displayed remarkable poise and grace in a beating Ghana custodian Richard Kingston under the bar with a casual looking shot and set up a semi-final clash with the Netherlands in Cape Town.

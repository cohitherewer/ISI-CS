The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punjab muscle past Nagas

            A STAFF REPORTER            Punjabs Balwant Singh tries to get past his Nagaland marker Imtilemba, on Sunday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Sometimes, in football, knowledge of ones opponents is all that a team need to be absolutely sure of beating them.         
	Quizzed about their tactics after his boys had registered a 1-0 win against Nagaland, in a Cluster III Santosh Trophy match at Khardah, on Sunday, Punjab coach Jagir Singh suggested that more than strategy, he had come to this match with the belief that the result could go no other way.         
	He had never been on the losing side against Nagaland, Singh explained. This was a team he knew well. Having watched the uninspired Nagaland spend a clueless 90 minutes looking for one measly equaliser, it was easy to see what Singh meant.         
	Against a team like Punjab, the odds for Nagaland are always going to be more physical than tactical. And, with that being the case, the challenge is to outsmart rather than outmuscle your opponents. Nagaland would rather beat their opponents at their own game, and that is too bad. Because maybe, had they approached the game a little bit differently, the men from the hills could have thought of a way to cancel out Punjabs physical advantage.         
	What the team needed on Sunday afternoon was a generous dose of gumption. The physical contrast in this match promised an intriguing spectacle. The nimble-footed, lithe Nagas versus the robust, tall and broad-shouldered Punjabis. But one goal was enough for Punjab to get past the Nagas.         
	It came in the ninth minute off an innocuous spill in the midfield with the ball falling for Balwant Singh. Balwant ran with it into the Nagaland penalty area and finished with composure past the onrushing goalkeeper. In other Cluster III matches, Puducherry beat Gujarat 2-1 while Rajasthan clinched a narrow 1-0 victory over Jammu and Kashmir.

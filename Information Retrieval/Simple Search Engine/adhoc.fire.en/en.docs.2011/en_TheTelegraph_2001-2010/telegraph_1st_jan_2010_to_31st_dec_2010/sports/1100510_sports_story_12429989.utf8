The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SA desperate for win

	Gros Islet: Their title defence virtually over, a beleaguered Pakistan will be out to salvage some pride, while South Africa will hope to put their World Twenty20 campaign back on track in the Group E Super Eight stage match at the Beausejour Stadium here Monday.         
	With none of their players featuring in the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), defending champion Pakistan entered the tournament as the only side without any fatigue factor, but they looked rusty and now risk an early return home after losing their first two Super Eight stage matches to England and New Zealand.         
	The 2009 champions looked a rudderless lot under Shahid Afridis timid captaincy and the burden of leading seemed to have bogged down the all-rounder who looked far from his flamboyant self.         
	The Pakistan batting order, barring Salman Butt, has looked patchy with batsmen like Mohammed Hafeez and Misbah-ul Haq coming a cropper while the Akmal brothers  Kamran and Umar  are also lacking consistency.           (PTI)

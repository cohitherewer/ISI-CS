The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Patrice is feeling frustrated
                                                                                                                       7                                      Patrice is feeling frustrated
                      
	Cape Town: Defender Patrice Evra says France must beat Mexico in their next World Cup match to avoid having an enormous amount of pressure on them when they face South Africa in the final group game.         
	Coach Raymond Domenechs predictable tactics and Frances listless attack could not overcome a Uruguay side reduced to ten men in the second half, and the game ended 0-0.         
	An uninspired France missed the chance to take control of Group A following South Africas 1-1 draw with Mexico. France have now failed to score in the opening match of a major tournament three straight times, and Evra  Frances captain  sees Thursdays match as crucial.         
	It will be a good game because both teams will have to win, Evra said. We dont want to go into our last game having to beat the home side on their turf with an enormous amount of pressure on us.         
	Its a game that you have to win if you want to be a bit more relaxed for the final game, Evra said. Thats why Im a bit frustrated because when you see South Africas result against Mexico, we could have pulled ahead.         
	France did reach the World Cup final four years ago after drawing their opening match, but that team had playmaker Zinedine Zidane and striker Thierry Henry, who is now past his prime and was only used as a substitute Friday.         
	The current French side are unable to break down teams which, like Uruguay, pack midfield and defend deep. France had the same problem when they drew 0-0 against Romania in their opening match at the European Championship two years ago.

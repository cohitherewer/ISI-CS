The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fernandos late surge may defy predictions
                                                                                                                       7                                      Fernandos late surge may defy predictions

	Before the Korean Grand Prix two weeks ago, the general opinion and even the mathematics suggested that the 2010 Formula One drivers title would be decided at the last race of the season, in Abu Dhabi, next weekend.         
	Then, the almost unthinkable happened: both of the Red Bull drivers  Mark Webber, the leader of the championship; and his teammate, Sebastian Vettel, another contender for the title  dropped out of the race and failed to score any points.         
	That handed the victory to the Spanish driver, Fernando Alonso of Ferrari, his third victory in four races.         
	It put Alonso, an outsider for much of the season, into the lead of the championship. He had scored 133 points in seven races, 90 of them in the past four. Suddenly, the mathematical certainty is that Alonso can now win the drivers title at the Brazilian GP.         
	He is the only one of the five title contenders who may do that.         
	With a lead of 11 points on Webber, his nearest rival, and 21 points on Lewis Hamilton, Alonso needs only to win the race and to see his rivals fail to pull to within 25 points of him. (A victory rewards a driver with 25 points, and a tie is decided by the number of victories a driver has won in the season.)         
	Alonso is playing it cool, but there is a sense of anticipation in the air. For the past four years, the championship has been decided in Brazil, including both of the Spaniards titles, in 2005 and 2006.         
	I dont want to think about the chances of history repeating itself for a third time: I know it is theoretically possible, but that does not count for me, Alonso said in his diary on the Ferrari Web site last week.         
	We want to tackle this Grand Prix in the same way as all the others, concentrating on ourselves with our feet on the ground, trying to do a good job, without making mistakes and with the aim of beating our rivals.         
	I have said it before and I say it again: we will do the maths in Abu Dhabi.         
	Indeed, all the drivers chasing him also know that with the new points system, anything really can happen. And even with the old points system, they need only look back to 2007.         
	This year, the lowest placed contender for the title is Jenson Button, who won the title in Brazil last year. But he lies 42 points behind Alonso. In the old points system, Button is 16.8 points behind Alonso.

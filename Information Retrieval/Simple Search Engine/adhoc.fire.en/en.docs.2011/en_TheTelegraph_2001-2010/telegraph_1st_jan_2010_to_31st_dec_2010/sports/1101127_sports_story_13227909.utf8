	London: Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone suffered a head injury when he was mugged in central London, police sources said on Friday, just weeks after suggesting the citys streets were more violent than those of Brazil.         
	The 80-year-old billionaire was kicked and punched by his attackers before they escaped with about $319,220 worth of jewellery, media reports said. Four men were waiting for him and his Brazilian girlfriend as they arrived at the headquarters of his business, Formula One Holdings, in Knightsbridge, central London, on Wednesday evening.         
	The offices are near Buckingham Palace and within walking distance of Oxford Street, one of the capitals busiest shopping thoroughfares.           (REUTERS)

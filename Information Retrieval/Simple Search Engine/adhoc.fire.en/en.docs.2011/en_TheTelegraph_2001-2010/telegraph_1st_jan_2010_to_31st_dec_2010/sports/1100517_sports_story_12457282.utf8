The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viv remains a show-stealer
                                                                                                                       7                                        Viv remains a show-stealer
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sir Vivian Richards                           
	Bridgetown: The swagger is still very much there and, clearly, Sir Vivian Richards remains a show-stealer.         
	If theres a difference, its that Sir Viv requires reading glasses. That was seen on Saturday evening, as he wore them before reading his speech at the Knight To Remember function at The Garfield Sobers Gymnasium.         
	Its a sign that Im ageing... Im fine otherwise, though, Sir Viv told The Telegraph, breaking into that trademark laugh of his.         
	There was, as usual, a striking lady no more than an arms length away.         
	Sir Viv stopped terrorising bowlers almost 20 years ago, but that didnt stop young and old from heading for his table and making requests for photographs and autographs (in that order).         
	A former West Indies captain, Sir Viv played 121 Tests (8,540 runs, 24x100) and 187 ODIs (6,721 runs, 11x100). One neednt really emphasise that hed be a huge draw in T20 cricket, too.

	 England  
	Dubbed English footballs golden generation, only to fall flat at Euro 2004 and the 06 World Cup in Germany, the 10 finals may well be the last shot at international silverware for some of the most well-known faces in football now. The tournament takes place in the South African winter, conditions which should suit the English players and style, so there will be no excuses should the Wayne Rooneys fall short once more.   
	Road to South Africa         
	Stormed to no fewer than nine wins from ten group ties. Their only defeat came in Ukraine with passage secured.             
	Star player         
	Leading from the front in terms of both goals and commitment is Manchester United forward Rooney who has matured into a fine team player and a deadly striker.         
	Coach         
	Italian Fabio Capello wasted little time in instilling a renewed work ethic and team spirit in a squad packed with big-name stars and equally large egos.         
	Record         
	England have appeared at 11 previous editions after debuting at Brazil 1950. Victors on home soil in 1966, their best performance outside their own shores came under the late Sir Bobby Robson at Italy 1990, when the side featuring the likes of Gary Lineker and Paul Gascoigne reached the semis only to lose out on penalties to eventual winners West Germany.

	 UsA         
	With typical efficiency, the US qualified in first place in the final six-team Hexagonal phase of North, Central America and Caribbean Zone. Under the careful guidance of coach Bob Bradley, a well-drilled Stars and Stripes side will be keen to build on their second-place finish at the Confederations Cup in 09. And this time the team have an impressive line-up with the likes of Oguchi Onyewu, Jozy Altidore, Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey, all of whom ply their trade in Europe.         
	Road to South Africa         
	The Stars and Stripes kept their nerve against the big regional powers like Mexico and Honduras to stay on track and clinch their South Africa ticket.             
	Star player         
	Landon Donovan is the inspirational presence with stiker often saving his best performances for a US shirt.         
	Coach         
	Although originally appointed on a caretaker basis, Bradley silenced his critics by masterminding a brilliant show at the Confederations Cup 2009 where US ousted favourites Spain in the semis before going down to 2-3 to Brazil in the final.         
	Record         
	The US have taken part at nine World Cups, and their best finals performance came at Uruguay 1930, when they exited at the semi-final stage. South Africa will be the US sixth consecutive finals appearance. The US had enjoyed a 58-match unbeaten home streak against CONCACAF opponents until July 2009, when arch-rivals Mexico thrashed them 5-0 in the final of the Gold Cup.

	Date of birth: March 4, 1982

  First Intl: Vs Mexico in 2000         
	 Algeria         
	Algeria will end a 24-year absence from footballs top table in South Africa. Les Fennecs (the Desert Foxes) may have won the African Cup of Nations since appearing at Mexico 1986, but they spent a long time in the wilderness before slowly working their way back as a competitive force at the start of the century. The current crop of players feel stronger than ever, with enough belief to put in a historic performance in South Africa.         
	Road to South Africa         
	Until finally sealing their place via a one-off play-off match against Egypt in Khartoum, Sudan, Algeria both suffered and impressed in their qualifying campaign. They won all six of home games in the second and third qualifying rounds but lost three of their away visits, while drawing twice and winning the other game.                 
	Star player         
	 Karim Ziani has the talent to play in different positions, although he is best known for being a midfielder. The onus will be on him to get the team going.         
	Coach         
	Following a modest playing career, Cheik (the Elder or the Master) Rabah Saadane quickly tried his hand at coaching and has been associated with the team in that capacity on and off since 1982. He began his current stint in 2007.         
	Record         
	South Africa will mark Algerias third appearance in the finals and they will be looking to graduate from the group stages for the first time in their history. They sizzled for a while in 82 and were lukewarm in 86. They would sure be looking to turn on the heat this time.

  First Intl: Vs Belgium in 2003         
	Slovenia         
	A nation of just two million people, Slovenia have already punched above their weight to secure a place at this World Cup. Their achievement appears near-miraculous when you know they knocked out Poland, Czech Republic and, finally, Russia (population 142 million) to take their place in South Africa. They would sure be determined to continue defying the odds when they take on the worlds best.         
	Road to South Africa         
	A decisive Zlatko Dedic strike in the play-off return leg tie vesus Russia secured one of the great qualifying upsets of recent years as Slovenia qualified.               
	Star player         
	Germany-based striker Milivoje Novakovic leads the attack and the team will be counting on his experience to see them through.         
	Coach         
	A player renowned more for his leadership skills rather than any great natural talent, Matjaz Kek has gone on to exceed all expectations by leading his unfancied band back to the games greatest stage.         
	Record         
	Given that they only gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, Slovenias football history is shorter than the majority of their 2010 rivals. They can, however, reflect with pride on having qualified for the World Cup at just the second time of asking, when a team led by Srecko Katanec pipped the likes of Switzerland and, ironically, Yugoslavia to a place at the 2002 finals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raman is set to be Bengals coach
                                                                                                                       7                                      Raman is set to be Bengals coach
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) are all but sure of roping in former India opener W.V. Raman as the coach of the Bengal team for the next season.         
	It will be Ramans second stint as Bengal coach after the 2001-02 season, when Bengal reached the semi-final of the Ranji Trophy. He has been the coach of the Tamil Nadu team during past few seasons.         
	Although Raman is still not ready to comment on the matter, it was learnt from reliable sources that the CAB has already emailed him a copy of the contract on Wednesday.         
	We had expected to close the deal with Raman on Saturday itself. However, he had reservations about a few clauses in the contract. Today (Wednesday), we have formalised his contract and the clauses that he wanted were incorporated. From our side, we are 99 per cent sure that we will have Raman on board unless something goes horribly wrong, a source informed.         
	The only impediment, as of now, is the release order from the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA). Given the fact that Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary and TNCA supremo N. Srinivasan and CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya arent exactly on good terms, there is apprehension that there may be an inordinate delay which could scuttle CABs plans.         
	Obviously, he will take a couple of days before he signs on dotted lines, he added. It has been learnt that one of the clauses that Raman found objectionable was about the accommodation. While Raman wanted to stay in a hotel, the CAB were ready to put him up at a guest house, where former batting consultant Mohinder Amarnath and former coach Roger Binny had resided.         
	That problem has been sorted out. We dont think he should have any reasons to complain about the revised contract, he further added.

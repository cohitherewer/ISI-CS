The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Will keep Indias interest in mind, says Fleming
                                                                                                                       7                                        Will keep Indias interest in mind, says Fleming
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai, on Wednesday                           
	Mumbai: Chennai Super Kings coach Stephen Fleming said on Thursday that a decision on playing Mahendra Singh Dhoni against the Mumbai Indians would be taken keeping in mind his responsibility to Indian cricket.         
	It (chances of Dhoni playing) looks good. Well take a call in time, seeing how he feels tomorrow (Thursday), Fleming said on the eve of the match. Itd be a psychological boost to have the skipper back. We are hopeful of him playing and batting. There is obviously a responsibility to Indian cricket as well. We are cautious but optimistic.         
	The former New Zealand captain said the team were not unsettled by their back to back losses to Kings XI Punjab and Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	It (against Kings XI) was a big game for us, and then we had to play a good team after that immediately. It was a tough couple of days. We have been in this situation before.         
	There are going to be ups and downs. If you see the history of the tournament, it has come down to the wire in the last two years. We know that if you have a 50-60 winning percentage, or win seven-eight games, its enough to make it to the top four.         
	Fleming defended the elevation of Suresh Raina as the captain instead of going for the seasoned Matthew Hayden. Hayden has not done a lot of captaincy. And the focus of IPL is to develop Indian players. Raina has done well. He is a champion player and a potential captain for India, he said.         
	Flemings Mumbai counterpart Robin Singh said his team would be keen to maintain the winning streak. As you know, in this tournament, its all about momentum. So its up to us to play well and continue that momentum, he said.         
	The former India player said Sanath Jayasuriya has not been scoring enough to justify his place in the playing eleven. We want him (Jayasuriya) to play explosive cricket, but if he is not fulfilling that role, I dont think he is doing his job, he said.

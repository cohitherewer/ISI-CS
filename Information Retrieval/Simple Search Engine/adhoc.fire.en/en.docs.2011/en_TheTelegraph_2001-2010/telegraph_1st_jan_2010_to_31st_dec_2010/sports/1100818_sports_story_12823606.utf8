The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ban Randiv for 5 games: Bedi 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ban Randiv for 5 games: Bedi 
                    Suraj Randiv                
	Suraj Randivs deliberate no-ball to Virender Sehwag, which denied the Indian opener a century in their tri-series match Monday night, evoked mixed reactions from former India captains.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically):         
	Bishan Singh Bedi: That was a poor sportsmanship act by Randiv. It was a deliberate act, no doubt. He should be banned for five games. Playing with the spirit of the game has gone down now. In our times, it was such an important thing.         
	Chandu Borde: No team wants to allow a batsman to cross the century mark and all the teams in the world have succeeded on a number of occasions in denying the batsman of a century. Even we Indians have followed this and never gave freedom, for the batsman to set a mark. It was a brilliant knock by Sehwag, he deserves all the accolades... I would not term it as not cricket. Some people are generous to a fault but others, like the Australians, wont give you an easy 100 to take. There can be two opinions on this: whether Sri Lanka were unsporting or not. I remember (in Delhi in 1958-59 series) against the West Indies, I had scored a century (109) in the first innings and was 96 batting in the second with (fast bowler Roy) Gilchrist repeatedly bowling bouncers at me. When two balls remained, non-striker Vijay Manjrekar came and told me you have to get to the century. I hooked the next ball, it went for a four but I disturbed my wicket and was hit-wicket. In the same match, we didnt allow Gary Sobers to get to his double hundred when he was on 199. Its part of the game.         
	Kapil Dev: On certain things, I do not want to react. It is not worth talking about. Some players are playing the game in their own way... To me, it is important that India won the match. Sehwag deserves appreciation for the manner in which he handled the situation in scoring the 99-run knock.         
	Ajit Wadekar: Its not cricket. Thats not fair, not done in cricket. But a no-ball is a no-ball... Poor chap Sehwag. He deserved a 100. (Agencies)

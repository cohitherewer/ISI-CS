The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal, Murray enter semis
                                                                                                                       7                                        Nadal, Murray enter semis
                  Nadal                     
	London: Incensed, enraged and even a little bit indignant, Rafael Nadal displayed a rare fit of fury Friday at the ATP World Tour Finals.         
	The top-ranked Spaniard was angered when the chair umpire awarded Tomas Berdych a point after a challenge in the first set of his final round-robin match at the O2 Arena.         
	There is no argument, said Nadal, who went on to win 7-6 (3), 6-1. I am right, but its (a) mistake for him.         
	Nadal, who advanced to the semi-finals with three straight wins at the season-ending tournament for the top eight players in the world, still managed to hold serve to 6-6 in that game and force a tiebreaker. He then easily won six of the next seven games in the second set, but rarely has Rafa been so riled while on court.         
	The important thing, I was playing really well before that point. This point doesnt change a lot, said Nadal, who also beat the sixth-ranked Czech in this years Wimbledon final. Finally I was lucky. I won that game.         
	Berdych popped up a backhand that the line judge didnt call out and Nadal put the ball back into play, before raising his hand to signal that the shot had been long. At about the same time, chair umpire Carlos Bernardes stepped in to rule the ball out, giving Nadal the point.         
	But Berdych challenged the call, and the replay showed the ball to be good, just nicking the baseline. Instead of replaying the point, however, the Brazilian chair umpire gave the point to Berdych, making it 15-30 instead of 30-15.         
	When Nadal heard that, he immediately started to argue.         
	In the other match, Andy Murray advanced to the semis beating David Ferrer 6-2, 6-2.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cant match Roger: Rafa
                                                                                                                       7                                        Cant match Roger: Rafa
    - Premature to term Federer as a stationary career target for Spaniard             Harvey Araton            Rafael Nadal                                 
	Rafael Nadal plays down comparisons to Roger Federer: I am not on the way to be the best in history because thats very far.         
	With a pair of 2010 Grand Slam titles already in the bag and a potential third delayed one day because of rain, Rafael Nadal has clearly distanced himself from Roger Federer.         
	It should be achingly apparent that the most compelling and current tennis rivalry is no longer Federer-Nadal, but more of a one-man show, a physiological drama, Nadal against himself.         
	All due respect to Novak Djokovic  handed much-needed rest and improved odds of an upset Monday in the United States Open mens final by Sundays rainout  but nobody threatens Nadals domination quite like the body parts that occasionally surrender to the swashbuckling abandon with which he plays.         
	For his part, Federer has not beaten Nadal at a major since 2007, has lost six of their last seven matches and, based on form, was probably spared a deflating and defining beat-down when he dropped his five-set semi-final to Djokovic Saturday.         
	He and Nadal, likeable Europeans and affable competitors, have electrified their sport and at times even remedied the myopia in the search for the Next Great American.         
	But what was perhaps the best rivalry in sports for about three years has seen its best days. It is either over or on indefinite suspension until Nadal proves healthy enough to restore it in a more historical sense by, say, 2015.         
	Nadal dismisses such talk, remaining charming and humble as he sledgehammers his way from opponent to opponent.         
	I am not on the way to be the best in history because thats very far, he said on Saturday. I really dont believe I can arrive to Rogers level, no?         
	Well see would probably have been the less modest but more honest response. Nadal, a couple of months past his 24th birthday, is eight Grand Slam titles behind Federers record 16, and entering the years when Federer, who won 10 of them between ages 24 and 29, did the bulk of his winning.         
	If Nadal departs New York with a ninth, if he becomes more selective of the tour tournaments he plays and more protective of his tendinitis-ridden knees, its entirely plausible that Federers record, established in 2009, could have a shorter shelf life than Pete Samprass, who won his 14th and final title in 2002.         
	Federer insists he is not going away any time soon, and it would be premature to characterise him as a stationary career target for Nadal, no longer capable of running the seven-match table at a Grand Slam event.         
	There are times when Federer is overpowered by tenniss young sluggers, but other occasions when he seems impatient and distracted. It is possible that his most vexing issue right now is his stage of life, married with young children, more than his age, 29.         
	Once upon an era, premier players tended to burn out or just become bored by their mid-20s  John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg, to name two. But technology has transformed tennis, turned it into a game for fully developed bodies and minds, for men and for women.         
	The science of training is going to prolong everyones optimum playing years, said Mike Wolf, whose 17-year-old charge, the American Jack Sock, won the junior singles title Sunday. Wolfs point was that Sock, a high school senior, could go to college for a couple of years, grow up in a variety of ways, and have plenty of time to become a world-class player.         
	We can wait another year before writing off Federer as a serious contender at the Slams. But even given the benefit of the doubt, hypothesising that he can win one or two more, a healthy Nadal has the goods to restore the rivalry to full historical bloom by the time Federer is gone from the sport, playing family doubles with his wife and twin girls.         
	The unforeseen always lurks, of course. Juan Martdel Potro, injured and absent from this years Open after bludgeoning Federer in their five-set final a year ago, could return to mount a challenge to Nadal. Djokovic seemed to be on the threshold of muscling his way into contention for No.1 a couple of years ago and has a huge opportunity Monday.         
	For all we know, an American is even out there waiting to grow, then pounce. Ryan Harrison showed potential in upsetting Ivan Ljubicic in the first round, and Sock has endeared himself to Djokovic as a hitting partner during the Open.         
	In the meantime, there is nobody in the top 10 or on the radar quite like Nadal, who has transformed himself from the king of clay into the dictator on all surfaces, who has lost the absurd total of two service games in six rounds at the Open and who goes for No.9 Monday on the road back to an enduring rivalry with his good friend Roger.

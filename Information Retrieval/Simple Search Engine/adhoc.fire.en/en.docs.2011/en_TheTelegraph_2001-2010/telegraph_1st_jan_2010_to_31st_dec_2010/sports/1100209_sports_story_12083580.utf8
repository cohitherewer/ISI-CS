The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan seek foreign coach
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pakistan seek foreign coach
                      
	Karachi: Nearly 14 months after firing Australian Geoff Lawson, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is once more looking for a foreign coach.         
	The Board, it appears, has begun cracking the whip for the disastrous show Down Under and the inquest has started with senior players Kamran Akmal and Salman Butt being shown the door in the Shoaib Malik-led team announced Monday for the two Twenty20 Internationals against England, to be played in Dubai.         
	Coach Intikhab Alam, too, is under fire and his fate remains unclear. Intikhab will not travel with the team for the trip to Dubai and the Board did not clarify whether he had been relieved of his duties only for the two matches or permanently. His contract with the PCB runs till October.         
	PCB chairman Ijaz Butt Monday confirmed on a television show that he was in talks with some foreign coaches.         
	Former India coach Greg Chappell and former Pakistan coach Richard Pybus are among the names doing the rounds.         
	We are looking at the possibility of hiring a foreign coach and we are in talks with some people, Butt said.         
	I dont think it is right that every time we lose a series, the captain, coach or the Board management should be changed. But we also want to see good results from the team and that is why we are looking at the possibility of having a foreign coach once again, he added.         
	With Intikhab Alam, coach of the disastrous Australia tour, under scrutiny in an inquiry committee, the PCB Monday named former Test batsman Ijaz Ahmed as the batting and fielding coach for the two Twenty20 matches against England in Dubai on February 19 and 20.         
	Wasim Bari, the chief operating officer of the Board, said the appointment of Ijaz as coach and Yawar Saeed as manager is on an interim basis. Saeed has replaced Abdul Raquib.         
	As expected, changes were made in the 14-member squad for the matches against England, to be played on February 19 and 20. With regular Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi serving a two-match ban for ball tampering, Malik was named skipper.         
	The squad         
	Shoaib Malik (captain), Imran Nazir, Imran Farhat, Khalid Latif, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Yasir Arafat, Abdul Razzaq, Sarfraz Ahmed, Umar Gul, Muhammad Talha, Fawad Alam, Wahab Riaz, Saeed Ajmal.

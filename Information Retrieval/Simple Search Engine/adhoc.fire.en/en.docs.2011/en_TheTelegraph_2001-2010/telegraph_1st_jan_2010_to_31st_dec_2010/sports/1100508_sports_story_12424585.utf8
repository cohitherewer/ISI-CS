The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lewis, father back on talking terms
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lewis, father back on talking terms

	Lewis Hamilton has revealed that he is back in contact with his father and former manager, Anthony, after a contretemps in which the pair went weeks without speaking to one another, but says he is still no nearer to appointing a replacement.         
	Eyebrows were raised by the timing of their split in March, a fortnight before the start of the season. Whatever the motive, Anthony was clearly struggling to come to terms with the new arrangement after more than 20 years together in motorsport and Hamilton confessed at the most recent Grand Prix, in China that it was not all smiles and happiness between them.         
	However, it appears that relations are now thawing with an encouraging exchange of messages. Things are slowly progressing, Hamilton said. Weve been in contact recently.         
	He sent me a message to let me know he is supporting me and if I need anything he is there, which is all Ive ever wanted from my dad.         
	More and more hes coming to terms with it. Its just been a hard transition but Im looking forward to restarting our relationship.         
	Hamilton is still without a manager and the 25 year-old reiterated that he was in no hurry to appoint a new one despite a million calls on the subject.         
	Former world champion and McLaren driver Mika Hakkinen has been heavily linked with the post, but Hamilton claimed they had not spoken and added that managers within Formula One were perhaps limited in terms of what they could offer him.         
	There are other ways you can go, he said. Id like someone who can progress what I am; who would help me grow as a brand.         
	The feeling is that Hamilton, whose recent move from Geneva to Zurich was largely motivated by a desire to be better positioned in terms of international flights, would like to break America and leverage his growing celebrity over there.         
	He has said he would go over to Los Angeles if his girlfriend, Nicole Scherzinger, made the final of Dancing with the Stars, the United States version of Strictly Come Dancing.         
	Meanwhile, Ferrari have performed what looks like an embarrassing U-turn by removing the controversial bar code design from their racing cars livery and team clothing.         
	Critics and recent reports suggested that the design might have been subliminal advertising for title sponsor Marlboro, which would break the ban on tobacco advertising.

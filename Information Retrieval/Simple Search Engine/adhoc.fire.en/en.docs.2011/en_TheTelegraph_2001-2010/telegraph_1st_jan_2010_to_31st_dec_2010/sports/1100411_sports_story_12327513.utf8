  - Icon and former India captain is out to make a difference on new pitch         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE                                              Anil Kumble      
	Bangalore: After years of having made a difference over the 22 yards, former India captain Anil Kumble is now doing his bit for the preservation of wildlife and the conservation of forests.         
	Kumble, in his 40th year, spoke to The Telegraph in his ITC One room at the Royal Gardenia on Saturday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Being the vice-chairman of the state Wildlife Board         
	I got appointed last November... Its a policy making body and comes under the umbrella of the national board, which is chaired by the Prime Minister... The state body is headed by the Chief Minister and its mandatory to meet twice a year... Wildlife and the conservation of forests is its area of concern.         
	Whether he has the rank of a minister         
	(Grins) Minister of state, yes... You could say Im a brand ambassador for wildlife in Karnataka and for the forest department.         
	Colleagues on the Board...         
	There are scientists, bureaucrats, other officials... I work rather closely with one of the scientists, Sanjay Gubbi.         
	First meeting         
	We were to have met in February, but a lot of things were happening in the state then... Once the IPL gets over, Ill have a meeting with Mr (B.S.) Yeddyurappa, the Chief Minister, and take things forward... He has promised to give me plenty of time. Hes the encouragement-giving sort.         
	His role         
	I see myself as a catalyst between the state government and the people... Im trying to educate the people and spread awareness... Im also trying to help improve the quality of life of the forest guards, watchers, the daily wage earners... People need to appreciate the hardships they face and the conditions they work in. Some (forest guards) may be doing the wrong things, but that doesnt mean nobody works.         
	Whether his Kumble Foundation is involved         
	Yes... Within the Foundation is a Jumbo Fund which is for the welfare of the people Ive mentioned... In fact, part of the proceeds from the sale of my just-released book, Wide Angle, will go towards that Fund...         
	[The book, a collectors item, can be bought online at www.wideangle.canvera.com.]         
	Clean image being an advantage         
	You could say that... Also, cricket has such a huge following and my association with the sport continues (as captain of the Royal Challengers Bangalore). Its nice if I can use my name for good causes.         
	Priority         
	One definitely is to increase the area available to wildlife... The national average is just three per cent, which is too little... Animals need space to survive... They need a bigger area...         
	Fund-raising initiatives         
	One is looking at a few things... One will try and do something creative... I couldnt plan anything (except the books release) during the IPL, as too many things are already being done... Obviously, one would like to involve corporates. NGOs, too.         
	His interest in wildlife         
	My love for photography took me outdoors and the Indian teams association with the Save the Tiger campaign, in the latter part of the 1990s, got me hooked on to wildlife. I remember wed gone to Kabini, four-and-a-half hours from Bangalore, and Ive gone back there a number of times since.         
	The focus appearing to be on the tiger only         
	I wouldnt say so... Many animals are endangered... For example, the lion-tailed macaque, on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border.         
	Whether his family is also passionate about wildlife         
	(Laughs) They are... Our holidays are mostly close to wildlife... Actually, the family doesnt have a choice!         
	Finally, if he has a message         
	That we should be proud of our biodiversity... Well be able to protect it only if were proud... The protected areas (national parks, sanctuaries etc.) need to get bigger, we need to give land back to the animals, it cant just be urbanisation...

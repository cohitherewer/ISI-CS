The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knights await payment
                                                                                                                       7                                        Knights await payment
            A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta: The recent Income-Tax related problems which cropped up during the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) have had its impact on the various franchises including the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).         
	As a result, the Indian players who have been on KKR roster are yet to receive any instalments of their contracted amount for the recently concluded third edition. The Knights played last of their 14 matches on April 19 against the Mumbai Indians.         
	Nearly three weeks have passed since, but the players are yet to receive their cheques. However, none of them are ready to come out on record on this issue.         
	But almost all of them are eager to know when the management will start disbursing, at least, the first instalment of their contractual amount.         
	According to reliable sources, none of the top Bengal players like Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Manoj Tiwary and Rohan Gavaskar have received any money for turning up in KKR colours for the third edition of IPL.         
	If sources are to be believed, it will take some time before the players receive their payments. However, it has been learnt that some of the foreign players did receive part payments for this season.         
	When The Telegraph contacted KKRs CEO Joy Bhattacharjya, he did admit that there has been a delay in payments. Let me assure you that it is not that we have a cash crunch. Its just that few unavoidable problems have cropped up. First of all, due to the recent scrutiny by the I-T department, we are still reorganising everything. Since financial transactions are done in a proper process, it is taking some time.         
	The calculations and computation of tax and things like that takes time. Secondly, one of the authorised signatories (Bobby Chawla) is seriously ill. Thats the reason it is taking a bit more time, Bhattacharjya explained.         
	When Manoj was asked to comment on the issue, he said: I am not in a position to say anything in this regard.         
	The Bengal vice-captain, who joined KKR from the Delhi DareDevils, was bought for $600,000. He was picked up by Team Delhi during the first years auction at a whopping $675,000 but didnt get enough chances to play for Delhi and was swapped with Australian Moises Henriques.         
	Manoj won two Man of the Match awards in this edition against the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Kings XI Punjab respectively.

	London: Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti has sought to play down the impact of Inter Milan boss Jose Mourinhos return to Stamford Bridge on Tuesday, saying sentiment would have no bearing on the Champions League game.         
	Mourinho is Chelseas most successful coach, having won two Premier League titles and three cups. The team he built between 2004 and 2007 is largely the side Inter will face when they bid to defend a 2-1 first-leg lead at Stamford Bridge.         
	Ancelotti, who faced Mourinho last season as a fierce city rival at AC Milan, is avoiding the histrionic gestures his opposite number revels in. The Italian said he would for example not be kissing the club badge, preferring only to kiss beautiful women.         
	The players are not distracted by all this, Ancelotti told a news conference on Monday ahead of the last-16 return match. Mourinho will come back. For him it will be a special evening. I think the fans will give him a very good reception. He deserves this but the match will be a different thing.         
	All Chelsea players and Inter players are focused on the game. They are not interested in other things, added Ancelotti. The difference will be made by the different players, the different confidence or courage the players put on the pitch. Ancelotti dismissed suggestions the recent mediocre form of the Serie A leaders would have an impact on the game.         
	Im not considering an Inter who have dropped in form, Im thinking about an Inter who have played so well over the season, said the Italian. Inters 3-1 defeat at Catania last week might serve to spur them to better things in the Champions League, added Ancelotti.         
	Meanwhile, Sevilla coach Manolo Jimenez brushed aside the potential financial impact of failure to make the quarter finals yet the significance of Tuesdays match with CSKA Moscow was far from lost on him.         
	The Andalusians, seeking to reach the last eight for the first time, host the Russian club for the second leg of their last-16 tie after last months first leg finished 1-1.         
	Jimenez looks likely to have strikers Frederic Kanoute, Luis Fabiano and Alvaro Negredo, scorer of the goal in Moscow, fit after all three featured in Saturdays 1-1 La Liga draw with Deportivo Coruna.

	Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara believes that his team has the potential to go all the way in the World T20 in the West Indies.         
	This team has the potential to go all the way in the tournament, Sangakkara said prior to the teams departure on Saturday. Even last year we had a very similar team with a couple of new faces as in this one.         
	Sri Lanka are in Group B with New Zealand whom Sangakkara described as a very dangerous team as we have experienced in the T20 format before and Zimbabwe who have proved giant killers when they beat West Indies in T20s and ODI. They are not teams you can take lightly in T20 cricket. We know how dangerous this format of the game is, Sangakkara said to a website.         
	Sangakkara said Sri Lankas spinners are likely to be one of their strengths. The last time we went to the West Indies most of the wickets were spin-friendly. In T20s, generally the spinners bring a lot to the game. They have become very crucial match winners, he said.         
	They can be used to take wickets, to control games, change the pace of the game and rush through the overs when the opposition is in trouble. Especially, with the quality spinners we have, well be able to make an impact.         
	The Sri Lankan squad have an array of spinners led by the Muttiah Muralidharan supported by Ajantha Mendis, Suraj Randiv, Sanath Jayasuriya and part-timer Tillakeratne Dilshan. The Sri Lankan batting line-up will see Dilshan having a new partner with former captain Mahela Jayawardene joining him to open the innings.

	Johannesburg: Murali Vijay and Mike Hussey cracked sparkling half-centuries as the Chennai Super Kings were crowned the Champions League Twenty20 winners with their eight-wicket victory over Warriors in the grand finale here on Sundayday         
	Vijay (58 off 53 balls), who was let off on 34, cracked his third half century of the tournament while Hussey played sheet anchor and remained not out on 51 as the Super Kings chased down the target of 129 with one over to spare.         
	Earlier, spinners Muttiah Muralitharan (3/16) and Ravichandran Ashwin (2/16) shared five wickets as Chennai restricted Warriors to 128 for seven after the South African champion side elected to bat at the New Wanderers Stadium.Vijay underlined his emergence as a fine Twenty20 batsman by becoming the highest run-getter of the tournament with 294 runs from six matches, eight more than Warriors captain Davy Jacobs.         
	Vijays 53-ball innings was studded with six fours and two sixes while Hussey hit only three fours from 46 balls in his unbeaten knock.         
	CSK were richer by $2.5 million for winning the second edition of the tournament, their second crown in five months after their IPL triumph in April. Warriors received $1.3 million for finishing runners-up.         
	The grand finale of the multi-dollar tournament, however, turned out to be a lopsided match with the Warriors bowlers failing to make any impact on the batsmen of the opposition who have beaten them in their last Group A league fixture four days ago.         
	The total of 128 was too small to defend and the CSK were always in control of the run chase. Hussey and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (17 not out) pulled off the win with a 25-run partnership for the unbroken third wicket after Suresh Rainas early dismissal.         
	Dhoni hit the winning runs  a four off Juan Theron  as the CSK scored 132 for two in 19 overs to lift the title.         
	Vijay and Hussey did not need to take too much risk as they ran mostly in singles in their 103-run opening wicket stand in front of a capacity crowd.         
	Vijay lived dangerously on a couple of occasions with an edge from his bat flying past wicketkepeer Mark Boucher and Justin Kreusch for a four. He was also lucky to survive in the ninth over, with wicketkeeper Mark Boucher missing a simple stumping chance off the bowling of Nicky Boje, when on 34.         
	But he made amends of these lapses later as he struck some fine shots, including two sixes off Nicky Boje.         
	Earlier, Muttiah Muralidharan snapped three wickets as Warriors were restricted to 128 for seven. Muralidharan, who took three for 16, got able support from his spin colleague Ashwin (2/16).

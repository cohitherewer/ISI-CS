                                                                                                                       7                                      Gilly again for Agarkar!
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The adage history repeats itself held true for Ajit Agarkar at the Eden on Thursday.         
	When India played Australia in a tri-series (Zimbabwe being the third side) match at the Nehru Stadium in Kochi on April 1, 1998, it was Agarkar, making a debut, who netted the prized scalp of Adam Gilchrist.         
	Chasing a target of 310, the Australians folded at 268 handing the Mohammed Azharuddin-led Indians a 41-run victory. Gilchrist had made 61.         
	Twelve years down the line, on the same date, something similar happened. In the Indian Premier League match between the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Deccan Chargers, it was Agarkar again who brought about the downfall of Gilchrist. This time, too, his contribution was for a winning cause as his team beat the Chargers by 24 runs.         
	And the coincidence didnt end there  even the figures from both the matches were identical  one for 31.         
	While Agarkar remembered his debut date, it was somebody from the family who actually called on Friday morning and told him about the Gilchrist coincidence.

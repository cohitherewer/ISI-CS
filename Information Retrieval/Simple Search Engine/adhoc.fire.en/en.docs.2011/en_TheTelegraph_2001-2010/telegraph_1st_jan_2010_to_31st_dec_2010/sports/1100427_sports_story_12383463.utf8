                                                                                                                       7                                      Was necessary to suspend Modi for a fair enquiry, says Manohar
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                        
	Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Shashank Manohar on Monday said that vice-president Chirayu Amin was appointed as interim chairman of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in place of the suspended Lalit Modi.         
	The following is Manohars statement to the media after IPLs emergent governing council (GC) meeting on Monday:         
	The IPL is a great property and loved by all of you. The commercial aspects of running such an event are important. However, ethics and transparency are more important.         
	Since the last 15 days, a lot of allegations and counter allegations have been made through the media. The Board looked into them and decided to issue showcause notice to Mr. Lalit Modi and suspended him, pending an enquiry. We never wanted the tournament to be disrupted and so, the showcause notice was sent to him after the closing ceremony was over.         
	The Board, after receiving the reply (from Modi), would hold an enquiry if necessary. If the reply of Mr. Modi convinces the members, the proceedings would be dropped.         
	Today (Monday) an emergent governing council meeting was called because we did not want the tournament to be disrupted. In todays meeting, the committee appointed Chirayu Amin as the interim chairman of the IPL. The committee had also asked Prof Ratnakar Shetty to look into all records, because many documents are missing. Everyday the Income Tax authorities are asking for documents and we dont have them in our custody.         
	It was also decided to go ahead with the 2011 (edition of the IPL). The committee has appointed Ravi Shastri, Sunil Gavaskar and MAK Pataudi to discuss and deliberate the modalities (with regard to each franchise). They have been asked to discuss with the franchises and come back to the BCCI and take a decision.         
	The governing council will meet after a month, sometime in June, after all the preliminary things are done because most of the members of the governing council are unaware of the things happening.         
	Manohar also took questions from the media on Monday.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The charges levelled against Modi         
	There are no charges of betting. The charges which he has been asked to respond to are about  the initial bids of Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab, the broadcasting rights bid, bid rigging with regard to the two new franchises, internet rights and the behavioural pattern (of Modi).         
	Reasons for suspension of Modi         
	It was necessary to suspend him to have a free and fair enquiry(Modi) So that there is not any interference in the process. Suspension is not a punishment.         
	The time frame for the enquiry         
	One years time for the enquiry, but the suspension period is of six months.         
	Doesnt the Board and other GC members share responsibility?         
	Any organisation functions on trust. If you expect all the GC members to come everyday and work 8-9 hours, then you dont need IMG or other professionals. It is said that all members of the GC are party to decisions. But most contracts are entered into without the permission of the GC and brought to the GC after being signed. We have no other option but issue fait accompli.         
	Whether the Board is worried         
	The Board is not worried at all. If others are found to be guilty, we will sack them.         
	Any plans of appointing professionals to run the IPL         
	All of us (the BCCI office bearers) are honorary members. As far as the IPL is concerned, it is a huge and valuable property. Therefore we appointed IMG paying a huge sum of Rs. 27 crore. Its the duty of IMG to look after the professional management of the tournament. Also, we appointed a CEO (Sundar Raman) with a huge salary and separate staff.         
	Whether the broadcast and other rights will be scrapped         
	You cant cancel the rights just because something suspicious is found.         
	Reason why he was away from the IPL III final         
	Did you see me in the IPL finals in the first and second years?         
	If he had persuaded Modi to attend todays meeting         
	I never persuaded him. Its his choice to attend or not. I asked him on April 19 to convene the meeting and after two days when he did not do that, I asked the secretary to convene the meeting.         
	The charge regarding the Rajasthan Royals bid         
	Its about a company based in the UK, Emerging Media, which is solely owned by Mr. Manoj Badale. It was formed four months before the bid and its bid was accepted. The interesting fact is that the company had only two stakeholders  Mr. (Fraser) Castelino and Bal Thakur  when the agreement was signed and they had nothing to do with the bid. Then others have come in (as stakeholders) from Mauritius.         
	Mr. Modi made a statement, the whole world knows the (Rajasthan) franchise owners. But even the GC members were not aware. The bid was sold to two individuals and companies like Tresco and Blue Water. Nobody knows who they are.         
	I didnt find in the shareholders register the names of Raj Kundra or Shilpa Shetty who claim to be the owners. If transfer (of stakes) has been made, it has to be with the permission of the Board and transaction fee of five percent has to be made.         
	About the Kings XI Punjab bid         
	When the bids were given, it was signed only by Preity Zinta. She said she will form a consortium with three people  Mohit Burman, one Mr Paul and a third individual. When the franchise agreement was signed by her, she did not have a single share in that company. The shares were transferred to her after signing of the agreement. Then Mr. Gaurav Burman and the rest got in. Again, the same logic has to be applied  you need to have the consent of the IPL.         
	On Modis behavioural pattern, which has been one of the charges         
	Its about confidential information of the Board being leaked to the media. I have always maintained that the Board functions within the four walls of this building. If you have to leak everything to the media, then you might as well hold this meeting at the Oval ground.         
	Sundar Raman misbehaved with former cricketer Sunil Walson. Also there was an official communication (about Sachin Tendulkar) which he released on twitter, instead of a press release         
	He behaved like their superior.         
	The political interference in the BCCI         
	I dont think that theres any political pressure and I can assure you that as far as Im concerned, theres no political pressure which can influence my decisions.         
	Allegations of Pawars family members holding stakes         
	Those stories are incorrect. There was no involvement of any of the family members of Mr Pawar even in the earlier bids.         
	On N. Srinivasans conflict of interest         
	Theres no question of looking into that because when the concept was discussed there was no bidder. Even the Board was sceptical about the fate of the IPL. Mr Srinivasan officially sought permission from the then president, Mr Pawar, to give a bid and Mr Pawar gave permission. After the bid was accepted, all the bids came for approval before the general body and the general body unanimously approved the bids. Now Mr Srinivasan is not a majority shareholder in India Cements.         
	If he thinks that too much power was vested with one person         
	Unfortunately, I have to say yes.

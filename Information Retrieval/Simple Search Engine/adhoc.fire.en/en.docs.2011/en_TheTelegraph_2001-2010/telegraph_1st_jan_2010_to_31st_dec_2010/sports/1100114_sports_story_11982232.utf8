	Madonna di Campiglio: Michael Schumacher could rue his departure from Ferrari because Fernando Alonso is perfectly placed to beat the German to the world title again, team boss Stefano Domenicali said on Wednesday.         
	Schumacher, 41, will come out of retirement this season to race for the new Mercedes team having left his consultancy role at Ferrari, who have signed Spaniard Alonso.         
	The former Renault driver beat Schumacher to the 2005 and 2006 world titles and Domenicali is confident his new recruit can repeat the trick.         
	Lets not forget Fernando is the only driver on the track who in his career has beaten Michael (to the world championship), Domenicali told a packed news conference at Ferraris winter ski retreat. Fernando has everything to beat him.           (AGENCIES)

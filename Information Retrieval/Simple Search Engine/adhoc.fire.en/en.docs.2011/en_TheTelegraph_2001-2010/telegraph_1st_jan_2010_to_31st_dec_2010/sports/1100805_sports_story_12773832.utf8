The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wrong   to host   CWG:   Bhutia
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wrong   to host   CWG:   Bhutia
            A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Calcutta: With the torrid time that Suresh Kalmadi and Co. are facing over the preparations for the Commonwealth Games (CWG), a few words of praise would be like manna from heaven for them. However, all that they got in the city on Wednesday were brickbats of earthly criticism.         
	And when that comes from an icon, its all the more bitter.         
	India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia, at a media conference, made it clear that the country was not yet ready to host an event of the Commonwealth Games magnitude and shouldnt have taken on a mega responsibility.         
	We should not have taken the decision to host the Games. Our infrastructure is not yet ready. Look at the situation, the venues are not ready. Focus should have been on working on the infrastructure instead of bidding for the event right away.         
	For example, in hockey, there are not enough number of Astroturfs in the country... Similar is the case with football. A nation like Malaysia is better placed to host the Games. We should not have bid for the Games, he said.         
	Providing youngsters and kids with more opportunities for training and sending them abroad is what the authorities should concentrate on. Instead, people went ahead and bid for the CWG, which was a completely wrong decision, he added.         
	With charges of corruption flying thick and fast, Bhaichung feels that effort should be made to ensure that at least the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games bear the stamp of our culture.         
	With the Games round the corner theres no use ruing over it (the mismanagement). I only hope that the opening and closing ceremonies dont become one of those Bollywood awards ceremonies where film stars hog the limelight. We do have a culture rich enough to be projected on the international stage, he reasoned.         
	Speaking about Indian football, Bhaichung stressed on the need for unity among the clubs and state associations. He also reminded that it was the clubs that produced quality players.         
	Its not really the job of the federation to produce quality players... Take the example of Barcelona who have produced stars like Xavi (Hernandez) and (Andreas) Iniesta.         
	The English Premier League teams, too, do the same job.         
	However, its not the case with the Indian clubs. There is a serious need to restructure the entire system with emphasis at the grassroots level, Bhaichung said.         
	Supporting fellow striker Sunil Chetris decision to excuse himself from Major League Soccer to join the India camp in Portugal, Bhaichung said: He has not come back permanently. Its a very good move by him to join the India side.         
	Asked when he was planning to join the camp (after he returned midway with a thyroid-related illness), Bhaichung said that although he had recovered fully, he would join his teammates in Portugal only on August 9 after his son, Ugen, who is ill, was well.         
	I hope that he will be discharged on Sunday. I will leave after that, he informed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hondas look to hit top gear 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hondas look to hit top gear 
                      
	Pretoria: Japan may never have a better opportunity to bring Asias woeful World Cup record against South American opposition to an end than when they face Paraguay in the second round in Pretoria on Tuesday.         
	No Asian team have ever beaten a South American side at the World Cup. Of the 10 encounters between the continents, South America have won eight times with two games drawn (1-1, North Korea vs Chile in 1966 and 0-0, South Korea vs Bolivia in 1994).         
	However, Japans flying form in the group stage this time around makes them strong candidates to break that jinx and qualify for the quarter finals for the first time.         
	While Paraguay topped a group that included world champions Italy, Slovakia and New Zealand they have rarely shown the attacking verve expected of a team featuring top-class forwards Roque Santa Cruz, Lucas Barrios and Nelson Valdez.         
	Japan, meanwhile, have been one of the tournaments delights with their free-flowing attacking style and set-piece mastery.         
	After dominating Denmark 3-1 in their final group game, striker Keisuke Honda, who scored a stunning 30-metre freekick, has now set his sights on a place in the last eight.         
	For me, for the team, the next game is more important because we want to show the Japanese people that nothing is impossible, he said.         
	Japan have also shown the rest of the teams at the World Cup that scoring direct from a freekick with the much-maligned Jabulani ball is far from impossible.         
	Honda and Yasuhito Endo scored stunners in the same game against Denmark and defender Tulio, who has declared himself fit after picking up a knock against the Danes, said Japan could exploit their set-piece superiority again.         
	They (Paraguay) will be trying everything on to rile us. Every goal is so much more precious now in this knockout stage and it is important we try to get our noses in front first, he said.         
	One thing we will have to try and do is vary our set-pieces to surprise them.         
	Paraguay would be happy to get goals from anywhere at the moment after a lacklustre 0-0 draw with New Zealand in the final group game highlighted their shot-shy struggles.         
	Defender Julio Cesar Caceres said Paraguay were not satisfied with just reaching the second round, which they had achieved three times before.         
	Were happy that we went through the first round but our objective is to keep writing history and the match against Japan is the most important thing, he said.         
	We are capable of playing a great match. Japan are a quick team, we have to think about every detail against them.         
	But there is a lot more at stake for the Paraguayans, and striker Roque Santa Cruz gave an idea of what exactly the national team means to his countrymen.         
	Its a massive thing  people need to know also that we are a small country and with all the problems in the country (this) is one of the only happiness people get in the country, Santa Cruz said.         
	People will be, of course, expecting a lot from us and if we make that place (quarter finals) it would be one of the biggest achievements Paraguay have made in their history.         
	To achieve it, though, Santa Cruz and fellow forwards Lucas Barrios and Oscar Cardozo may have to do what they didnt in the group stage  score.         
	Theres more to what we do than just scoring goals, said Santa Cruz, who scored three times in five World Cup qualifiers.         
	Our job is to make sure the defence doesnt have a lot of space to play in, and to try and stop the opposition from controlling possession.         
	Midfielders Enrique Vera and Cristian Riveros have scored, with defender Antolin Alcaraz getting the other group-stage goal.         
	What matters most is how the team plays, Riveros said. When we score its even nicer if its someone whos not a striker and doesnt usually find the target.         
	But the tight defence conceded just once in three group matches.         
	Perhaps Paraguay are not one of the very gorgeous teams, but fundamentally they do have very powerful strengths, the Japan coach said.         
	Starting from a solid defence to being quick offensively, we have to be cautious about those strengths.         
	Likely Teams         
	Paraguay (4-3-3): 1-Justo Villar; 4-Denis Caniza, 21-Antolin Alcaraz, 14-Paulo Da Silva, 3-Claudio Morel, 13-Enrique Vera, 6-Carlos Bonet, 16-Cristian Riveros, 9-Roque Santa Cruz, 18-Nelson Valdez, 19-Lucas Barrios         
	Japan (4-5-1): 21-Eiji Kawashima; 2-Yuki Abe, 22-Yuji Nakazawa, 4-Tulio, 3-Yuichi Komano, 5-Yuto Nagatomo, 16-Yoshito Okubo, 7-Yasuhito Endo, 17-Makoto Hasebe, 8-Daisuke Matsui, 18-Keisuke Honda         
	Referee: Frank de Bleeckere (Belgium)           (REUTERS)

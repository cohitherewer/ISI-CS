The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Beikhokhei strikes gold
                                                                                                                       7                                        Beikhokhei strikes gold
            A STAFF REPORTER            Man of the Match B. Beikhokhei (centre) with captain Syed Rahim Nabi and Alvito DCunha, after the victory at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: To be successful, you must take your chances. On Tuesday, against Chirag United at the Salt Lake Stadium, Phillippe de Ridders boys did just that.         
	The Syed Rahim Nabis had about five chances, grabbed two of them and returned with winning smiles.         
	The 2-1 victory  after B. Beikhokhei scored a brace, Joshimar reduced the margin  was a much-needed one for East Bengal and will no doubt soothe the nerves of those officials and fans who had lost their sleep over the red and gold brigades relegation worries.         
	The win did earn them three vital points, but with Viva Kerala and Sporting Clube de Goa winning their respective I-League matches on the day, De Ridder, at the post-match media conference, rightly said we need at least four more points to be safe.         
	Paucity of quality strikers forced the Belgian to use Yusif Yakubu as the lone forward with Alvito DCunha playing as the withdrawn.         
	East Bengal made their intentions clear as early as in the sixth minute when Yakubus thundering shot, off a goalmouth melee, kissed the horizontal before flying out.         
	With the East Bengal midfield outsmarting their Chirag counterparts, Sandip Nandy, under the Chirag bar, was having a busy time.         
	And had it not been for Syed Rahim Nabis lazy work with the ball in the 18th minute, when he waited for eternity to shoot into an open net, East Bengal could have got their first goal earlier.         
	In the 40th minute, however, Beikhokhei was in the right place to knock in a Yakubu low cross from the right to give the beleaguered giants the lead.         
	The diminutive midfielder doubled the tally in the 67th minute. It was Yakubu, once again, who did the spadework to set up the ball in front of the goal. Beikhokhei, latching on to a defenders wrong pass, was opportunistic enough to slot it home.         
	Chirag did manage to pull one back three minutes later when Joshimars powerful shot off a defection from East Bengals Mehrajuddin Wadoo beat the tall Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The lanky 19-year-old keeper, however, was impressive and justified De Ridders faith in him.         
	Chirags stand-in-coach Anjan Nath was candid enough to admit at the end of the match that if Subrata Bhattacharya had been in the helm, things could have been better for the team who were among the top three after the first phase of the league.         
	But then, the Brazilian duo of Edmilson and Joshimar did get their share of chances. And no coach can teach you how to dance on the chance.         
	De Ridder would know better.

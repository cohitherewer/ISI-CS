The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Binny blasts Bengal attitude
                                                                                                                       7                                        Binny blasts Bengal attitude
            KUSHAN SARKAR            Roger Binny                           
	Calcutta: A section of the senior officials of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) feel Bengal coach Roger Binnys contract should be renewed as one season is too short a time to build a team. But the former India all-rounders nod, if he is offered an extension, is not a certainty.         
	He is a disappointed man after his six-month old stint with the team. He has found an absolute lack of team spirit in the side.         
	If you ask me to point out a couple of reasons for not doing well enough this season, first and foremost will be team spirit. Next is inconsistency, Binny told The Telegraph over phone from Bangalore, on Thursday.         
	 Ive never seen such a team which doesnt have any unity among themselves. Right from my first assignment, (Moin-Ud-Dowlah Trophy in Hyderabad), I found that its a divided unit. From Hyderabad, I proceeded to Chandigarh for the J.P. Atray Trophy, and I got the same vibes. The team that doesnt stay together can hardly expect any success at the highest level, he further added.         
	Its not that Binny has not informed CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya about the way the team functions. He denied the common perception that soft nature has been his undoing.         
	My nature is not to shout on players. I can discuss things with them and put across my point, but cant impose anything on them. I have told them repeatedly not to play football, but they wont listen. They would tell me that this is their lucky game, the coach said. I told them to play touch-rugby where catching is involved, but no one was bothered.         
	I never saw any of the pacers doing endurance training throughout the season. Ask them the reason, they would say they dont need it. Tell a batsman to play a particular shot, he would say he is comfortable in the manner he plays. What can you do? the frustrated man said.         
	He feels if the senior players are not willing to push themselves hard, things wont change.         
	I am 54 now, and I dont see myself coaching beyond the age of 60. I have coached the Karnataka state team, India A, India under-19, but this has been the most disappointing experience. Its not that Bengal dont have good players, but they dont believe in playing together. You have good future players like Arnab Nandi, Sudeep Chatterjee and Mohammed Sami Ahmed. But they need to be groomed properly, said Indias highest wicket-taker in the 1983 World Cup.         
	Surely, the CAB bosses need to do some soul searching.

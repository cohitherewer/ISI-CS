The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No tweets during Ryder Cup 
                                                                                                                       7                                      No tweets during Ryder Cup 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	The US and European players have been banned from using Twitter or Facebook during Ryder Cup, which begins on Friday, at Celtic Manor. Both captains  Corey Pavin and Colin Montgomerie  say there will be a blanket ban in place this week to keep players focused on the three-day competition.         
	Pavin said: We talked about it. The team has come to a consensus not to do it.         
	It can be a little bit distracting sometimes, and I think it is important to focus on the Ryder Cup and playing the matches. Weve decided to not tweet this week, but a week today I am sure tweeting will be all over the place.         
	Concurring with his counterpart, Montgomerie said: We are in the same boat. I think its important we focus on the job in hand this week.         
	We are here to try regain the trophy that Corey has brought back for us. We have to focus on that job, and as Corey rightly says, on Monday October 4, yes, you will find the team probably on social network sites, but not until then.         
	The decision will effect players on both sides. Europes Ian Poulter has more than one million followers and tweets daily, while Americas Stewart Cink is a keen user, with more than 1.2 million followers.         
	Were finally off to Wales!! Wont be tweeting until we get back. I guess Ill have to pass the down time actually reading or something, Cink tweeted before the US teams charter flight from Atlanta to Cardiff. US team members Zach Johnson, Hunter Mahan and Bubba Watson also have active Twitter accounts.         
	Europe team member Ian Poulter has a large following on Twitter but was forced to apologise earlier this year for using an anti-Semitic slur after a football match between north London rivals Tottenham and Arsenal, the team he supports. Graeme McDowell, Rory McIlroy and Francesco Molinari are other members of the European team, who use Twitter.         
	Meanwhile, the US Ryder Cup team arrived at Cardiff airport, on Monday, and even before getting their baggage, Pavin was fielding his first questions about Tiger Woods.         
	The world No. 1 but Ryder Cup wildcard wore sunglasses as he posed with his team mates on the aeroplane steps under skies the colour of Welsh slate. After his traumatic personal problems and a run of poor form, interest in his prospects was cranked up further on Sunday when European captain Colin Montgomerie said Woods would not be his first choice if he could have any American in his team.         
	Woods has played in all five matches at each of his five Ryder Cups but there has been speculation that he might not do so this time. Ive obviously thought about it a lot and, come Thursday, well see who the first pairings will be, Pavin said. Every time Tiger plays in the Ryder Cup he wants to win and so do 11 other players.         
	Rain delays in the final round of the Tour Championship in Atlanta had raised fears of a delayed arrival for the Americans  and Europes second-place finisher Luke Donald  but organisers were relieved the setback was only a couple of hours.         
	Official practice on the pristine Twenty Ten course, green and lush after a week of rain, begins on Tuesday. The weather forecast for later in the week is mixed, with little wind but a fair amount of rain expected. The bigger concern on the prodigiously hilly course, however, is fog.

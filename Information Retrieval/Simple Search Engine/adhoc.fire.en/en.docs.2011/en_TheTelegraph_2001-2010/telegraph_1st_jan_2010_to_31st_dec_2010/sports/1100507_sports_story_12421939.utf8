The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Samuels hits out
                                                                                                                       7                                        Samuels hits out
                  Marlon Samuels                     
	Melbourne: As he gears up to return from a two-year ban for giving team information to a bookie, West Indian batsman Marlon Samuels feels he was made a scapegoat by the International Cricket Council (ICC), which handled the matter unfairly and was merely looking to make an example out of him.         
	Samuels was banned for two years by the ICC for leaking vital team information to a bookie in India, but the 29-year-old had always maintained he did nothing wrong.         
	I am an honest person. My conscience would not allow me to come back if I knew within myself I had done something wrong, Samuels said.         
	They need to spend time on situations like this, it is delicate and very important because you are dealing with players careers, Samuels was quoted as saying by an Australian newspaper.         
	When they looked at my case, they used me as a scapegoat, the ICC wanted to make an example out of me when I was never in a position for them to be able to use me as an example. The way they dealt with my case was very unfair.         
	I really didnt have a case; when I went to the hearing I thought it would be just a fair process but it wasnt like a hearing at all, I was just banned, he said.         
	Samuels was charged with sharing team information with the bookie ahead of a one-dayer against India in Nagpur on January 21, 2007.         
	The case against Samuels centred on a police-tapped telephone conversation he had with Dubai-based Indian national Mukesh Kochhar whom he had first met in Sharjah in 2002.

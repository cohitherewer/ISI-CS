	Calcutta: After their 6-0 mauling of Eastern Railway last Saturday, East Bengal beat George Telegraph 3-1 in their CFL premier division encounter, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday.         
	Carrying on the momentum, the red and gold brigade claimed their authority at the top of the points table, and only something extremely silly or sinister can ruin their dreams of finishing the league with their heads held high.         
	On Tuesday, East Bengal took lead just 10 minutes into the match. Budiram Tudu helped the ball into the George Telegraph net off a cross from Robin Singh inside the box. Robin ran tirelessly, intercepted passes in a flash and mounted the counter-attacks menacingly.         
	Penn Orji was in perfect position to score even before Tudus opener in the fifth minute. Sanju Pradhan combined nicely with Uga Okpra, who passed towards Penn. But an alert George keeper Tanmoy collected the ball before the Nigerian could pose a threat.         
	Sushant Mathew netted the second goal for East Bengal from a Mehtab Hossain corner kick in the twelfth minute. Going 2-0 up, Morgans men started attacking through the right. Mehtab almost set Robin up for the third, 18 minutes later, but the latter failed to latch on to the pass inside the box.         
	George Telegraph, fighting relegation, however, bounced back after the breather. They reduced the margin when midfielder Deepak Dolui split East Bengals complacent defence with a neat strike five minutes into the second half.         
	This was the second goal conceded by East Bengal in the league, while they have hammered 30. With Tuesdays win, East Bengal won their eighth game on the trot and stood with 24 points. George Telegraph stayed put at five points from nine matches.

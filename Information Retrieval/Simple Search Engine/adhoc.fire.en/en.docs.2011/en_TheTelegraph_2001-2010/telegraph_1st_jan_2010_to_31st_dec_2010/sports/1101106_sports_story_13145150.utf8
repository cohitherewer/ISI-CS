The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky to miss final ODI
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ricky to miss final ODI
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Ricky Ponting will miss the final match of the Commonwealth Bank Series against Sri Lanka and return to state cricket in a bid to fine-tune his game ahead of the Ashes, according to a media release.         
	Ponting made just 10 as his side succumbed to Sri Lanka in the second ODI in Sydney on Friday. Since Sri Lanka won the three-match series 2-0, there will be nothing at stake in the final one-dayer.         
	Therefore, the National Selection Panel have opted to give Ponting more time to prepare for Tasmanias Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield Clash against Queensland in Hobart, which starts on Wednesday.         
	NSP member Greg Chappell said: As the series against Sri Lanka has been decided, the NSP has an ideal opportunity to provide Ricky with two solid weeks of red-ball cricket. This allows him what we believe to be the best preparation to lead the Australian Test match team in Brisbane for the first Ashes Test match.

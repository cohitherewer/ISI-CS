	Johannesburg: With the World Twenty20 round the corner, South Africa coach Corrie van Zyl said the Indian Premier League (IPL) returnees of his team need to get accustomed to the national sides approach quickly as they prepare for the ICC event. The meet will be held in the West Indies from April 30 to May 16.         
	Some members of the South African team, including Albie Morkel, JP Duminy, Jacques Kallis, Dale Steyn and a few others, are expected to return home over the next few days.         
	(At the IPL), they played for different franchises, each of them having their own approach. Now, we dont not have much time to get them accustomed again to the manner in which we want them to play (in the World Twenty20), Van Zyl told a South African daily.         
	However, one good thing for the South African coach was that captain Graeme Smith was available for planning as he had returned home midway through the IPL with a broken finger.         
	Van Zyl said he and Smith had done lot of planning on the teams approach in the upcoming tournament.         
	Although its a short and very intense tournament, it does not mean that there will be less preparations for it than what we prepare for other series and tournaments, he said.         
	Bowling at the death is of prime importance. Thats why Graeme (Smith) and I have spent a lot of time in finding the right combination, Van Zyl added.           (PTI)

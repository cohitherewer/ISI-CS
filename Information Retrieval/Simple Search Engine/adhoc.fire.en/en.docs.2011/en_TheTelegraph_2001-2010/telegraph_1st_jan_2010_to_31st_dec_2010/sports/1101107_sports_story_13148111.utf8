            BIVABASU KUMAR              Jesse Ryder after reaching his century on the third day of the first Test, in Ahmedabad, on Saturday. (AP)                      
	Ahmedabad: Its true that statistics dont always tell the full story. But it often throws up reasons to celebrate or suggests need for improvement. New Zealand will take note of the fact that since 2006, the Black Caps openers have never managed to score 100 runs for the first wicket. And, more alarmingly, Stephen Fleming was the last New Zealand opener to have scored a Test hundred on tour in 2004.         
	A successful opening partnership puts any team into the drivers seat. Even more important, for an opener, is to stick around and play himself in when outing in alien conditions. For New Zealand, however, it has not happened recently. Tim McIntosh was history by Friday evening, and, Brendon McCullum failed to build on what promised to be a classy effort in tough subcontinental conditions.         
	After relinquishing his duties as keeper, McCullum is featuring as a specialist batsman in the Black Caps squad. He showed the nerve to survive a treacherous final session on Friday, but failed to sustain the same momentum Saturday.         
	The day, however, belonged to Jesse Ryder (103) and little known all-rounder Kane Williamson (87 batting).         
	Playing his first Test after 14 months, Ryder scored a stroke-bedecked hundred and stitched together194 runs with debutant Williamson. Together, the duo averted the follow-on and helped New Zealand post 331 for five at the end of the third days play.         
	At start, McCullum and Ross Taylor showed maturity and application to build a partnership for the third wicket. The first hour went to the visitors as the duo swept, cut, drove and pushed for their runs.         
	Both batsmen used their feet nicely, McCullum especially. One of his shots off Sreesanth screamed past mid-off and extra cover and he middled each ball even though it kept low sometimes. He got to his 17th Test fifty in 94 balls and Taylor, too, brought up his 10th half-century soon after. In quick time, the two added 100 runs for the third wicket.         
	But Harbhajan Singh broke the partnership in his fourth over. He cleverly set up Taylor by sending in a quick one through the air rapping him on the pads for an leg before appeal. Denied, he tossed the next one up, pulling back the length slightly to see the batsman flick it to VVS Laxman at short mid-wicket.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni sensed a chance to put the pressure back on the visitors and introduced two slips, a forward short leg and a short mid-wicket for Ryder. With three close-in fielders, low bounce and two Indian spinners operating in full swing, the situation couldnt get any more hostile. India could sense the momentum swinging in their favour and within five overs Ojha accounted for Brendon McCullums wicket.         
	In a dusty track, the left-arm spinner got just enough dip and turn to draw McCullum out for Dhoni to clip the bails.         
	Two set batsmen gone, India were clearly on top in the first session. But post lunch, it was a story of an intense vigil by Ryder and Williamson.         
	If India were pressing hard for the last six New Zealand wickets, the opposition were desperate to avert the follow-on. A few edges flew here and there and Ryder would thank Rahul Dravid for dropping him on 11 off Sreesanth.         
	Williamson and Ryder put on an unbroken century stand for the fifth wicket and the two negotiated the Indian leather fingers patiently.         
	Williamson scored his maiden Test fifty under pressure. The all-rounder took full toll on the part-time spinners. Ryder, too, pulled Zaheer Khan and planted Harbhajan for a straight six, after setting his eye in.         
	Sreesanth bowled tirelessly and was aptly rewarded with Ryders wicket shortly after the latters century.

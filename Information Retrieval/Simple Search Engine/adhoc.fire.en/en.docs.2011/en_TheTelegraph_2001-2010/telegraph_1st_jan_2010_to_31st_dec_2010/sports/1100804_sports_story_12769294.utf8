The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachins record unmatchable, says Symonds
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachins record unmatchable, says Symonds
                      
	New Delhi: Former Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds said that Sachin Tendulkars feat of being the most-capped Test player in the world would remain untouchable for years to come.         
	Sachin, who holds almost every batting record, on Tuesday, became the most-capped Test cricketer when he overtook former Australian captain Steve Waughs record of 168 matches after taking the field in the third and final Test, against Sri Lanka, in Colombo.         
	Symonds, who is one of the commentators for this years Champions League Twenty20, was of the view that the game will lose its charm without greats like Tendulkar, and the retired Sri Lankan spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	I doubt it very much that somebody can match Sachins feat. Currently, there is probably (Ricky) Ponting, Boucher and Kallis who played a lot of Test cricket. They are probably the only three who can get near, but I cant see anyone starting cricket now and playing 160-170 Test matches, the 35-year-old Australian said.           (PTI)

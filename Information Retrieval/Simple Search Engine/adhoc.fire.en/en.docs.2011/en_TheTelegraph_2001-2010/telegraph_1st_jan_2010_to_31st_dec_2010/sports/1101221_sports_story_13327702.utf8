	Centurion: Middle-order batsman Jean Paul Duminy and left-arm pacer Wayne Parnell have been added to the South African squad for the second Test which will start in Durban on Boxing Day.         
	Although South Africa recorded a convincing victory in the first Test winning by an innings and 25 runs, Duminy who scored a double century in a domestic match was rewarded for his good show.         
	The squad: Graeme Smith (captain), Alviro Petersen, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Ashwell Prince, Mark Boucher, Paul Harris, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel, Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Ryan McLaren, JP Duminy and Wayne Parnell.

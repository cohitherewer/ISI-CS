The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Essien boost for Blues
                                                                                                                       7                                      Essien boost for Blues
            THE TIMES, LONDON                      
	Carlo Ancelotti received a boost on Wednesday when Michael Essien took part in a full training session in the snow at Chelseas training ground in Cobham, Surrey.         
	However, the manager will not be the immediate beneficiary of the midfield players return to fitness, because Essien will leave this weekend to report for international duty with Ghana at the African Nations Cup and could be away for the rest of the month.         
	Essien will be accompanied to Angola by a Chelsea doctor, because he has yet to regain full match fitness.

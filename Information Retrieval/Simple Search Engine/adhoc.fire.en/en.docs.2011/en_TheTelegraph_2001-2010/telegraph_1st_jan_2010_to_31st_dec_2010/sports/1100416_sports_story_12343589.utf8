                                                                                                                       7                                      Schumi sees no reason   to worry
                            
	Shanghai: Michael Schumacher has brushed off criticism of his performance since he came out of retirement, saying he is still in the Formula One title race.         
	The seven-time world champion Thursday said he had no reason to be disappointed with his first three outings with Mercedes and, if anything, he was making better progress than he expected.         
	If we have quick enough development speed theres no reason why we cannot fight for the championship, the German told a news conference ahead of Sundays Chinese Grand Prix.         
	There is such a long season ahead, development is so important, we all know how quickly the rate of development is. Im pretty sure we have potential to develop this car, added Schumacher, who trails championship leader Felipe Massa by 30 points.         
	Its far from thinking this season is over for (teammate) Nico (Rosberg) and even for myself.         
	Schumacher has been out-qualified and beaten in all three races by his compatriot.           (REUTERS)

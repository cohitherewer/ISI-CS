	Dublin (US): American Rickie Fowler fired a six-under-par 66 to grab a three-shot lead at the Memorial tournament on Friday, while world No. 1 Tiger Woods comfortably made the cut.         
	The 21-year-old PGA Tour rookie shot a bogey-free round that included four birdies and an eagle on the par-five 15th. His 13-under 131 through two rounds tied the 36-hole tournament record.         
	However, Indias Jeev Milkha Singhs poor run on the US PGA Tour continued as he missed the cut after carding a second successive two-over 74 in the second round. (Agencies)

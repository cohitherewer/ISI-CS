The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SA build lead over Pakistan
                                                                                                                       7                                      SA build lead over Pakistan
                      
	Abu Dhabi: South Africa took a lead of 323 runs with six second-innings wickets in hand Tuesday as they attempt to force a win in the second and final Test against Pakistan.         
	South Africa closed at 173 for four after dismissing Pakistan for 434 for a lead of 150.         
	Abdur Rehman (60) scored a maiden Test fifty as Pakistans tailend batsmen helped them avoided the follow-on. He then took three wickets to check South Africas pursuit of quick runs on a flat pitch.         
	It was a good day for me, batting and bowling, and the team needed this, Rehman said. My batting record is better in first-class so my coaches and captain told me last night to just stay at the wicket as long as possible and gave me the confidence.         
	Ashwell Prince and Mark Boucher were at the crease for South Africa at the close. Alviro Peterson and Hashim Amla began the innings confidently before Rehman trapped Peterson lbw for 35 with the last ball before tea.

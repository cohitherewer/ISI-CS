	Doha: French Open champion Francesca Schiavone beat Elena Dementieva at the WTA Championships, on Friday, in a match overshadowed by the Russians surprise announcement that she is retiring from tennis.         
	Dementieva, who has struggled with injuries in 2010 and was eliminated, on Thursday, from reaching the semi-finals, made her announcement in a tearful ceremony surrounded by other players.         
	The 29-year-old Russian ended her 12-year career, which included two Grand Slam final appearances and an Olympic gold in Beijing, with a 6-4, 6-2 loss to Schiavone.         
	It is so emotional. It is so hard to say goodbye. I am going to miss you so much, Dementieva said.         
	Looking at her mom Vera in the stands, Dementieva said: My mom was very supportive and inspiring. She was always there for me. It is emotional for her as well. I love you mom.         
	Schiavone was among the players on hand to watch the ceremony.         
	Dementieva, who beat Sam Stosur of Australia on Thursday, had no chance of advancing to the semi-finals because of earlier losses in her group.         
	Schiavones consistent returns and net play forced Dementieva into hitting returns long and wide, giving the Italian an early lead.         
	But unlike her two previous matches when she couldnt maintain early leads, Schiavone refused to let Dementieva back into the match.         
	She repeatedly broke the Russian in the second set and at one point won 10 of 15 games. Schiavone also forced Dementieva to commit 28 unforced errors in the match.         
	I played a little bit better and was little bit more focused and confident than Elena, Schiavone said after the match.         
	Fourth-ranked Kim Clijsters takes on second-ranked Vera Zvonareva in the next match which will determine the matchups for Saturdays semi-finals. The other semi-finalists are top-ranked Caroline Wozniacki and Stosur.

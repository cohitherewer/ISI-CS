The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Endless euphoria
                                                                                                                       7                                      Endless euphoria
  - Top honours for Rahul, Deepika, as India end with 3 gold in archery       SHARMISTHA CHAUDHURI                            
	New Delhi: It was an emotional moment for Indian archer Rahul Banerjee at the Comonwealth Games on Sunday. As Rahuls arrow hit the target closest to the centre in the gold-medal shoot-out tie, his elder sister Dola Banerjee leapt with joy in the stands.         
	It was a scene of unending euphoria as Rahul won the CWG gold in the mens individual recurve category and with it took Indias gold medal tally to 27 at the Delhi Games.         
	My sister always has encouraged me. She gave me a few tips, too, for my matches here, said a beaming Rahul, even though the 23-year-old was touch disappointed about her sister missing the gold earlier in the day. Dola settled for bronze beating Malaysian Anbarasi Subramaniam 6-2 in the womens individual recurve category.         
	In a very tight final, top-seeded Rahul defeated Canadian Jason Lyon 6-5 in a shoot-out tie after both their match totals came to 137.         
	His gold was like an icing on the cake after Cadet World champion Deepika Kumari outshone her English opponent, Alison Jane Williamson, 6-0 to win the CWG womens individual recurve gold earlier in the day.         
	I was under tremendous pressure to win. After we (Jayanta Talukdar, Tarundeep Rai and himself) had to settle for bronze in the mens team recurve event, the category in which everyone expected us to bring home the gold, I tried to go out today and give it my very best. I overcame the pressure by trying to block out from my mind the fact that I was playing a gold-medal match, Rahul told The Telegraph.         
	Opting to shoot second for the first time in his life, it was gamble that paid rich dividends. It was easier to watch my opponent shoot first and then try to do better. I think henceforth, I will always aim to shoot second! said Rahul, after winning his maiden international gold medal.         
	Earlier, I had won many silvers. So, I was really aiming for the gold. I had hoped to play the final against my close friend Jayanta. But in archery, nothing can be taken for granted, he said. For the record, Jayanta won bronze after defeating Australian Matthew Gray 6-4.         
	I dedicate my medal to my family, the Tata Archery Academy, my coaches and everyone who has supported me through out, an exhausted Rahul add-ed, the smile refusing to leave his face.         
	The most important shoot-out tie was in the quarter finals. Had I lost that, I would have been out of the tournament. Thankfully luck, which had deserted us in the team event, was here with me! claimed Rahul.         
	The brother-sister duo ended the CWG each with a bronze and gold. Dola had earlier won the gold in the womens team recurve event with Deepika and L. Bombayala Devi.         
	Sixteen-year-old Deepika, after winning the Cadet World championship last year, had only one aim -- the CWG gold. And she won it in style, scoring a perfect 30 in the final set, deemed world class by her opponent who is an Olympic bronze medallist.         
	I could not be more happier, said Deepika, who takes time out to study for college despite her archery camps. She has only been at this sport since 2007.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB may not have funds to hire John Buchanan

    - 2012 Olympics preparations lead to cash crunch           A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            John Buchanan                                 
	Calcutta/Sydney: Former Australia coach John Buchanans move to help England prepare for this years Ashes series in Australia may be scuppered by a cash crunch caused by Londons 2012 Olympics, according to reports on Thursday.         
	Buchanan, 57, was Englands consultant last year with Andrew Strausss side regaining the Ashes 2-1 at home and had been lined up by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to continue in the role.         
	But Buchanan said he has been has been told by ECB that the money to hire him as a coaching consultant might not be available.         
	One of things that was said, obviously the world economy is still not in great shape, the England economy is not in great shape, and with the Olympics in 2012, it is going to suck quite a bit of funds out, Buchanan told an Australian newspaper.         
	The ECB may not have the funds or the flexibility  that may impact their decision on whether to take me on.         
	Buchanan, who could be a major weapon for England as they attempt to win their first series in Australia since 1986-87, has just returned home from England where he met ECB officials and said he expected them to make a decision within two weeks.         
	Buchanan, who was at the helm for Australias 5-0 Ashes romp at home in 2006-07, predicted the November-January series would be closer. Both sides are pretty evenly matched. England have a confidence about themselves, he said.         
	The first Test starts at the Gabba on November 25.         
	A few days ago, Buchanan insisted that he had not been hired to tell people how to beat Australia.         
	I am Australian, and cherish the part I played in the ongoing development of Australian cricket, he said. However, I am loyal to my principles of always assisting those organisations or individuals who seek to be better.         
	Buchanan helped the ECB briefly last summer on a short-term consultancy basis, mainly overseeing development programmes and working with coaches at the National Academy in Loughborough.         
	However, this time his role was likely to be much wider  providing specific advice about, and insight into, the Australian senior team.         
	Buchanans involvement with the England management teams strategic planning caused considerable reaction in Australia, given his intimate understanding of Australian cricket in general and of some members of the Test team.         
	Buchanans inside knowledge of the preparation and tactics needed at the various Australian Test grounds, where England have not won an Ashes series since 1986-87, would be invaluable.         
	Last year Australian captain Ricky Ponting expressed his discomfort at Buchanans involvement, however small, with the England team.         
	That was hardly surprising given that Buchanan knew Ponting so well, having shared three Ashes victories out of four and two World Cup titles with him.         
	There were howls of indignation from many others in Australia, who could not understand how Buchanan could help the enemy.         
	Buchanan was also set to work with the England Under-19 side, as well as spending time with David Parsons, the ECBs performance director, at Loughborough.         
	Buchanan was used by the recruitment company Odgers Ray and Berndtson last year to help identify the necessary qualities in the search for Englands team director that produced Flower.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jaffer wants a good start 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jaffer wants a good start 
  - ranji trophy Captain to open Mumbai innings; Ishants presence bolsters Delhi                             
	Mumbai: New-ball pair of Dhawal Kulkarni and Ajit Agarkar are the doubtful starters for Mumbai, who will lock horns with Delhi in the Ranji Trophy semi-final, commencing at the Brabourne Stadium Sunday.         
	While Kulkarni had picked up a side strain during their quarter final tie against Haryana, Agarkar is down with fever. However, coach Pravin Amre will take a final call on their inclusion in the playing eleven on Sunday morning.         
	It would certainly be big blows if Kulkarni, Mumbais second-highest wicket-taker this season with 19 to his credit  behind left-arm slow bowler Iqbal Abdulla (26), and Agarkar, whose bowling has dipped a bit but batting can be relied upon lower in the order, are ruled out.         
	Mumbai, without the services of Sachin Tendulkar and pacer Zaheer Khan right through the season, will also be handicapped by the absence of attacking batsman Rohit Sharma and skipper Wasim Jaffer admitted as much.         
	Rohit Sharmas absence will be felt in the big game, but they (Delhi) are also missing four or five players, Jaffer said pointing out the absence of Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Virat Kohli and Ashish Nehra  all picked for the tri-series in Bangladesh, and Akash Chopra from the visitors line-up.         
	Jaffer, who has played one-down earlier in the season, has decided to open the innings with Sahil Kukreja to face a strong Delhi pace attack, spearheaded by Ishant Sharma.         
	I will open the innings with Sahil. We have not been getting the starts. I have to take the responsibility to see through the new ball and post a good total, Jaffer said.         
	Wary of the threat posed by gangling Ishant, who would be keen to get among the wickets and into the Indian team for the two-Test rubber in Bangladesh, Jaffer said his team would respect him but at the same time not be overawed.         
	He is an international bowler and we have to respect him but should not get pressurised. We will be watchful, he said.         
	Besides, Delhi will also have fit-again leg spinner Chetanya Nanda.         
	Chopra has been replaced by Mayank Tehlan, who is set to open the Delhi innings with Shikhar Dhawan.         
	The latter has come into the match with 367 runs under his belt at an impressive average of 91.75.         
	Playing against Mumbai anywhere is special, said Delhi coach Vijay Dahiya.         
	The wicket would be similar to the one prepared for the Test against Sri Lanka, according to the curator and both the teams feel it would be a good strip to play on.         
	While Delhi would depend upon captain Rajat Bhatia, Mithun Manhas and their highest run-getter Puneet Bisht (512 runs), other than Dhawan, to score bulk of runs, the hosts have Jaffer and Ajinkya Rahane as their main hopes.         
	The Delhi pace attack seems to hold a slight edge, especially with Kulkarni and Agarkar being doubtful for the four-day tie, while Mumbai  with Abdulla and Ramesh Powar at their disposal  have the upper hand in slow bowling.         
	Both Amre and Dahiya wanted the cricket board to schedule the matches in such a way that there are at least four days gap in between. (PTI)

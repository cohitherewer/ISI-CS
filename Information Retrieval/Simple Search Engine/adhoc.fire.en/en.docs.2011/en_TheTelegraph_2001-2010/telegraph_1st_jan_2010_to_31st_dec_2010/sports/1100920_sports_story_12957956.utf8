The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar strikes it rich
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumar strikes it rich
                      
	Gurgaon: Caddie-turned-pro Ashok Kumar lifted the DLF Masters title trophy riding on his overnight eight-stroke lead after rain washed out the final day of the PGTI event, on Sunday.         
	Ashok had carded a brilliant seven-under 65 for the second consecutive day to take a massive eight-stroke lead over compatriot Gaganjeet Bhullar after the penultimate round, on Saturday.         
	It would have taken nothing less than a miracle to upstage Ashok and with rain gods disrupting the proceedings, the final round was called off at the DLF golf and country club.         
	Defending champion Bhullar, who had carded one-over 73 yesterday to slip down after sharing the top spot with Ashok after the second round, finished runners-up.         
	Ashok, who finished with a total 16-under 200, pocketed Rs 15,35,675 for his effort.         
	Anirban Lahiri finished one stroke adrift of Bhullar with a total of seven-under 209, while C. Muniyappa and Ajeetesh Sandhu ended with a total of six-under 210 at tied fourth.         
	Two-time winner Jyoti Randhawa, who was leading after round one, and Himmat Singh Rai dropped down the leader-board after carding rounds of 73 and 74 in the third round to finish tied sixth along with four others.         
	I have never felt better, Ashok, who turned pro eight years ago, said.         
	I had a wrist injury during the Aamby Valley event in May and was out for four months. But I didnt rush, and gave myself time and started playing again in the Chandigarh tournament at the start of this month, Ashok said.         
	This is my careers biggest win in terms of prize money. I have regained my lost touch and it is time to look ahead and secure more wins, Ashok added.         
	Ashok topped the Order of Merit after Sundays win and qualified for the $6 million Barclays Singapore Open to be played in November.         
	Im feeling confident once again. I had peaked during the 2004-05 season and I feel the old days are back again. I have never hit 65 on consecutive days before and it feels great now. It will be an upward curve from now on. I have to keep winning, the golfer said.

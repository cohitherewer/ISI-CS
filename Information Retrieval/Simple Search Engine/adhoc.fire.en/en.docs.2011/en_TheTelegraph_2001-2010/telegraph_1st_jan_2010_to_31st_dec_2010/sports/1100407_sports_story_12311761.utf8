The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wake up time for KKR
                                                                                                                       7                                        Wake up time for KKR
            A STAFF REPORTER            Brendon McCullum                           
	Calcutta: The good news from the Kolkata Knight Riders camp on the eve of their clash against the Delhi DareDevils is that they have shaken off the disappointment of the loss to Kings XI Punjab on Sunday. The mood at practice and the players body language, at least, suggested so.         
	Sourav Ganguly and Co. firmly believe that their chances of making it to the semi-finals are still bright. Impossible is nothing, seems to be the buzzword.         
	Dav Whatmore put it down well. Its never easy to lose a game after you put 200 on the board. But these things happen... We really need to take the emotions out of it and just focus on the things we do better, the Knight Riders coach said on Tuesday.         
	The Knights seemed more bothered about the dilemma over Brendon McCullum  whether or not to include him in the playing XI as the fourth foreigner resting David Hussey or Angelo Mathews. Chris Gayle secured his place at the top with a stunning 88 in the last match, and Shane Bond is the only pacer to have made a mark for the Knights.         
	Dont forget Mathewss all-round abilities provide the balance to the side. That leaves out Hussey, the quintessential T20 specialist. Can Knight Riders do without him?         
	McCullum will certainly be considered for selection, the coach announced. This means they are thinking of further strengthening their batting. The question remains, how much will prove to be a defendable total in the circumstances?         
	The answer is, its never enough after the last match, Whatmore quipped.         
	That Wriddhiman Saha has recovered well from the thumb injury, brought relief in the home teams camp. All are available for selection, Whatmore said. But his form with the bat remains a concern.         
	Every match is a must-win for the Knights from here on, and the DareDevils are not an easy opposition. Gautam Gambhirs men have overcome the initial jitters and have been improving with every game.         
	The way David Warner and Dinesh Karthik have responded to the challenges at different times, speak volumes for the teams depth and determination.         
	The Delhi side is quite destructive, admitted Whatmore.         
	The DareDevils bowling will depend heavily on Fervez Mahroof, Daniel Vettori and Amit Mishra in the absence of Ashish Nehra and Dirk Nannes.         
	In contrast, the Knights inconsistency has been their biggest bane. The bowling, once supposed to be their strength has turned out to be their weakness midway through the tournament.         
	Working out the right bowling combination will be a challenge for Whatmore and consultant Wasim Akram. In fact, the Indian players failure has contributed significantly to the teams inconsistency. Mohnish Parmar and Jaydev Unadkats flop shows have only complicated matters.         
	Ishant Sharma, despite his woeful performance, may be tried out in place of Jaydev on Wednesday. Ashok Dindas name is also doing the rounds. In the middle-order, Ganapathy Vignesh is being considered for Cheteswar Pujara.         
	The fielding, too, hasnt been up to the mark. The dropping of crucial catches  Murali Kartik in particular  has contributed to their decline.         
	Despite the Knights drawbacks, the DareDevils, on a roll with four wins on the trot, are not taking them lightly.         
	Theres no complacencyWe expect a tough fight. That we won the last time at the Kotla has no relevance. Its a new game and, more importantly, their home match, said coach Greg Shipperd.         
	As Whatmore said, its important to have the momentum going your way. It remains to be seen who wrests the advantage after Wednesday.

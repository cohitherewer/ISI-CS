	New Delhi: The drama in Indian hockey continued on Wednesday when the entire support staff of the national team decided to step down owing moral responsibility for the shock semi-final loss in the Guangzhou Asian Games.         
	The support staff include Clarence Lobo (coach), Dr. BK Nayak (doctor), Shrikant Iyengar (physiotherapist) and Pra-deep Dutta (physical trainer).         
	The mass resignation came a day after national coach, Harendra Singh, quit his post a couple of hours after Malaysia pipped India for a place in the Asian Games final.

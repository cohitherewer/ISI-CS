The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bojans double in Barca win
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bojans double in Barca win
                  Bojan Krkic                     
	Madrid: Barcelonas Bojan Krkic scored twice in a 4-1 home win over Athletic Bilbao that put his side three points clear at the top of La Liga on Saturday.         
	Bojan was a late replacement for Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic who injured his calf in the warm-up but was not missed as a weakened Barca swept aside Bilbao.         
	Jeffren, 22, opened the scoring after 27 minutes and Bojan, 19, a fellow product of the clubs youth system, struck either side of halftime to put the European champions in control.         
	Lionel Messi netted his 26th league goal of the campaign in the 67th minute and although Markel Susaeta pulled one back for the visitors, the result at the Nou Camp was never in doubt.         
	I suppose you were shaken when you read the team sheet, Barca coach Pep Guardiola joked to reporters. But it is possible to go to the end of the world with these players.         
	Barca have 77 points from 30 matches but second-placed Real Madrid can return to the top on goal difference when they visit struggling Racing Santander on Sunday.         
	Sevilla ended a run of eight games without a win by beating lowly Tenerife 3-0 in the late match.         
	Frederic Kanoute set new coach Antonio Alvarez on course for his first victory after 22 minutes and Luis Fabiano doubled the lead, chesting down and swivelling to score a superb second just before the break.         
	Jose Carlos curled in a free kick near the end to leave Sevilla fourth on 48 points.         
	Real Zaragoza pulled away from the relegation zone with a 2-0 home win over Malaga thanks to goals from Leonardo Ponzio and Humberto Suazo.         
	In Italy, midfielder Thiago Motta scored twice to help suspension-hit Inter Milan maintain their slim lead in Serie A with a 3-0 home win over Bologna on Saturday.         
	The Brazilians goals were separated by a 52nd minute effort from 19-year-old forward Mario Balotelli, who returned to action after being frozen out for a month following a row with coach Jose Mourinho.         
	Second-placed AS Roma, who stayed in the hunt by beating Inter last week, remain just one point behind thanks to a 1-0 victory at Bari.         
	AC Milan remained third after snapping a three-match winless streak with a 3-2 victory at Cagliari. With six matches to go, Inter have 66 points, Roma are on 65 while Milan stayed in contention with 63.

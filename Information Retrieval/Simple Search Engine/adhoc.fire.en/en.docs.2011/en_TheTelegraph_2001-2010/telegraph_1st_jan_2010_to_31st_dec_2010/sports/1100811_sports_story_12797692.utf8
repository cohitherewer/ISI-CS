    - France, England hope to improve battered image; Mexico dream to dent Spanish pride                 German players during a training session in Copenhagen, on Tuesday, the eve of their friendly against Denmark. (Reuters)                           
	Mexico City: Mexico, who began their struggle for independence from Spain 200 years ago, dream of denting Spanish pride again when they meet the World Cup winners in a friendly at the Azteca on Wednesday.         
	The match, part of Mexicos Bicentennial celebrations, is Spains first outing since they beat Netherlands 1-0 in the World Cup final in South Africa a month ago.         
	Theyre coming with the best theyve got. We have to try to beat the world champions, imagine, Celtic defender Efrain Juarez told reporters on Monday.         
	Why not think and dream that we can beat the world champions and dent their crown?         
	In Dublin, Argentina will be desperate to take out their Cup anger on the Republic of Ireland in the friendly.         
	But Ireland manager Giovanni Trapattoni may not seen in the dug-out after suffering from food poisoning.         
	Trapattoni is currently under observation and undergoing tests at a Dublin hospital after being taken there at 3am following further bouts of vomiting.         
	The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) confirmed Trapattoni, who is now in a stable condition, had been feeling unwell upon his arrival in Ireland on Sunday night.         
	It is understood the illness was caused by shellfish the 71-year-old ate prior to leaving Italy.         
	FAI team doctor Alan Byrne said: Giovanni had been feeling unwell, suffering with nausea and vomitting. But later he started vomitting more. He called me well past midnight and it was clear things had changed. I wanted more comfort in terms of where we were, so we decided to take him to the hospital where we have launched an investigation.         
	He has had blood and urine tests, scans, x-rays and an ECG. Some tests are already known and they are already very good. But some are still pending and we may not know the results of those until later. We need to see how things go over the next 12 to 24 hours.         
	Its not a serious problem, but with shellfish-type food poisoning it can have a greater impact, so everything is just a precaution.         
	At the moment he is stable. He has spoken with his wife on a couple of occasions and we are making arrangements for her to come over if she requires.         
	Ireland will be counting on Robbie Keane to get the goals to down Argentina, and goalkeeper Shay Given paid tribute to his Ireland team mate, who will earn his 100th cap.         
	Meanwhile, France and England had South Africa campaigns to forget and, on Wednesday, both set out on what they hope is the first step in restoring their battered images in friendlies against Norway and Hungary respectively.         
	World runners-up The Netherlands have just one squad member from the team that was in South Africa travelling to meet Ukraine.         
	It is France, however, who have the most to make up after a catastrophic and farcical appearance in South Africa. Nicolas Anelka was sent home for a foul mouthed outburst at coach Raymond Domenech, players went on strike because of that punishment and then Domenechs sullen refusal to shake South African coach Carlos Alberto Parreiras hand after their final match.         
	Domenechs successor Laurent Blanc has the chance to erase memories of that hapless campaign and the iconic 1998 World Cup winning defender has moved quickly by leaving out all of that squad from the one to take on Norway in Oslo.         
	What happened in South Africa cannot be rubbed out, said Blanc. It is a scar. But if were going to sanction players, take disciplinary action against them, then I think you have to be very careful.         
	I became coach to achieve one objective and I hope I will have all the forces at my disposal. It is important that we dont shoot ourselves in the foot before trying to reach our objective, which is Euro 2012.         
	England at least scrambled out of their group only to be humiliated 4-1 by Germany and were not without dressing room discord but former captain John Terrys declaration that he would be leading a mutiny against coach Fabio Capello ended in ridicule for the Chelsea defender as he was left marooned by his so-called angry teammates.         
	Friendly matches usually count for little but for the French and the English they will feel like the most important matches of the year  a chance to start back on the road to redemption.

	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting Club managed to defeat Eastern Railway 1-0, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Sunday. This was Mohammedan Sportings third Calcutta Football League match and substitute Dipendu Biswas stepped up to the plate to deliver a victory in the 80th minute.         
	Though the first half seemed quite drab with the Railwaymen managing to break through the defence of the black and white brigade a few times, it was only after the break that Sporting got a few opportunities. It was only 11 minutes before close that the match came alive. From Salip Ali Mollas corner kick, Mumtaz Akhtar managed to side-volley the ball towards the goal but instead, it hit Railways Bapan Beras hand and then the cross bar. A penalty was immediately awarded to Sporting and Dipendu did not make any mistake.         
	On target, it was Dipendus third goal in three matches for the Syed Nayeemuddin-coached team. Sporting could have managed a few more goals but unfortunately the team could not capitalise on their chances. Sporting goalie, Priyant Singh was awarded the Man of the Match due to his two brilliant saves, once in the 36th minute and then again, in the 72nd.         
	In the league table, Aryan lead the pack with 10 points after four matches while BNR follow them closely with nine points after five ties. In other matches on Sunday, Calcutta Port Trust beat George Telegraph 1-0 at Kalyani, while Kalighat Club drew goalless with Kalighat MS at the Mohammedan Sporting Club ground. Asim Das scored the winner for Port Trust.

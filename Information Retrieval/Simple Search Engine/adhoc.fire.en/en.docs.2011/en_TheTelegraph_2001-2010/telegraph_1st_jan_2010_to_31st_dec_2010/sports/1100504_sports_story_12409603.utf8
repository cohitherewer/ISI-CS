	Pune/Margao: Hosts Pune FC defeated JCT 2-0 in a 24th round I-League match at the Shiv Chhatrapti sports complex, here, on Monday.         
	The three points gained from the first-half goals also lifted the Pune club a rung higher to fourth spot with 35 points. JCT remain at seventh spot after completing 24 matches.         
	Pune FC spun a well-knit maze of passes around JCT and their early strike by Brazilian Edmar Figuera in the 11th minute gave them the upper hand.         
	If JCT did not lose by a bigger margin they should thank their keeper Karanjit Singh.         
	Figuera produced a fine solo 15-yard run, dribbled past a couple of defenders in the goal box and unleashed a left-footer after setting himself for the shot with a 90-degree turn on the ball.         
	At the stroke of half-time, Arata did get his name on the scoresheet. His solo burst in the 45th minute from the left and a diagonal attempt along the ground beat Karanjit at the right post.         
	In Margao, on Tuesday, Sporting Clube de Goa face Mahindra United to keep their hopes of avoiding relegation alive.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Victim, not a crook: Karim
                                                                                                                       7                                      Victim, not a crook: Karim
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: On Friday, Karim Bencharifa will wake up a free man. No tension, no frills. Just feeling a tad awkward that I wont have to go to the ground, he told The Telegraph on Thursday evening.         
	There is bitterness by the way he has been treated by Mohun Bagan and he is not hiding that.         
	Its sad that I have been branded as a crook by one and all. I am just a victim. People doubted my integrity and that is not done. I swear by my children that I never met Salgaocar officials during the Goa trip. Too many vested interests are ruining Calcutta football, he said.         
	Karim said Mohun Bagan could have handled the Goa leg in a much more professional way. It was a nightmare of a trip for me, he said.         
	Karim in fact had a talk with senior club official Debasish Datta at the Mumbai airport and there he understood he was no longer wanted. There were two options. One a camp in Durgapur and the second was that I leave. Rest we all know, he said in a bitter way.         
	The Moroccan refused to believe that Jose Ramirez Barreto actually criticised his strategy after the Dempo loss. I doubt. I dont think he actually spoke against me. He must have been misquoted. Otherwise why would he call me, he said.         
	Yes, we differed on certain issues but it never spoilt our relationship. Even, Marcos, I heard said something but I dont believe any of those.         
	For the record, Bencharifa was the man instrumental in roping in Marcos last season even though JCT were hell bent on a transfer fee.         
	In fact, most of the players are calling him up to say they never said anything bad about him. Shilton Paul is the one who vociferously denied saying anything against the coach. There were calls from Kalia Kulothungan and Edeh Chidi and nobody felt good by the way Bencharifa was treated. And you thought I lost players faith!         
	The Moroccan said October 25ths 5-3 win over East Bengal will always be the highest point of his tenure. In fact he understood the significance of the win the day after when his mobile had 157 text messages congratulating him. I will be in the history books I suppose, he said with a wry smile.         
	So whats next for him? My parents are coming from Morocco and family from Singapore. I plan to spend some quality time with them. And I will not think of football. I have had enough of football in the last 20 months.         
	Will he come back to the city, which gave him loads of adulation and some brickbats. I will never come back. Thats for sure

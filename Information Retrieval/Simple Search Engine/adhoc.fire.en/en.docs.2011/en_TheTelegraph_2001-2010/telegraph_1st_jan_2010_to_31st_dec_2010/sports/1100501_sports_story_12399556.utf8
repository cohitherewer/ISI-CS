The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Will surprise India: Coach
                                                                                                                       7                                      Will surprise India: Coach
                                  Yuvraj Singh in   St Lucia, on Thursday          
	St Lucia: Afghanistan coach Kabir Khan has warned the Indians, saying his side were unperturbed by their reputation and will look to exploit the surprise element to dazzle Mahendra Singh Dhonis men in their World Twenty20 opener on Saturday.         
	On the technical side, it is good that they dont know us because when they know about you they will plan. We have seen all their IPL games.         
	We will give them a surprise which will make them remember us after the game, Kabir said.         
	Afghan all-rounder Karim Sadiq feels the fact that they dont depend on any individual gives them an edge over the mighty Indians.         
	They have all performed. We havent got a certain guy we bank on. We have got a batting line-up which runs down to No. 8. And we have got seven bowlers to choose from, Karim said.         
	Captain Nawroz Mangal also exuded confidence and said his side would give their everything and grab the opportunity of playing at such a high level.         
	We are very happy that we are here. We worked really hard for it for the last two years and that has put us among the top 12 teams in the competition.         
	 We know there is a lot of pressure back home. But we have already fought in pressure cooker conditions and we are used to it. We will give our 100 per cent in this pressure game, said Nawroz.         
	Nawroz was glad that cricket had unified the people of Afghanistan.         
	It is a great achievement. If we have qualified, it is because of the whole nations prayers.         
	If the whole nation is praying for you, it means that it is bringing the whole nation together. Cricket is already playing a role in Afghanistan and it can play a major role in the peace process in the region, emphasised the 28-year-old.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mohali has always been good to me, says Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                        Mohali has always been good to me, says Sourav
    - Top Knight feasts on biryani after devouring Kings XI           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Chandigarh/On board 9W 0734 to New Delhi: The top Knight was hungry even after he and his men devoured the Kings XI Punjab. And, so, mutton biryani was ordered on returning to the Mount View Hotel, around 12.30 am, on Sunday.         
	A good win gives a nice feeling... We needed it and were capable of doing it... Im happy that we got almost all the things right on Saturday, the Kolkata Knight Riders captain, Sourav Ganguly, told The Telegraph.         
	Tucking into the biryani, he added: People have asked me why I didnt get carried away, in Mohali... Well, fact is that this tournament (IPL III) is wide open and absolutely any team can cause an upset... Indeed, I wouldnt like the MC to ask me a different set of questions after the next match!         
	That will be against the Delhi DareDevils, in the capital, on Monday.         
	Sourav himself led from the front with a well-scripted 50, his best for the Knights in 22 months. I enjoyed batting... Mohali has always been good to me... Ive got runs in Tests, ODIs and, now, in the IPL... Captaincy, though, isnt easy, he pointed out, laughing.         
	An interesting comment that, coming from Indias most successful Test captain.         
	Praising MoM Manoj Tiwary, Sourav said: He played very well... Understood the situation nicely... At this stage, however, theres no point talking about Manoj not getting picked for India... He wasnt among the 30 probables for the World T20... Id say he just needs to continue doing well (and getting noticed)...         
	Sourav, clearly the Knights top attraction, was mobbed at the airport in the afternoon, while waiting to board the Jet flight to New Delhi.         
	So much so that two families comprising three generations each, insisted on being photographed with him more than once. The patriarchs didnt want to take a chance!         
	Also in the Sourav fan club was Saroj Khan, at one time the most-in-demand choreographer. Her body language suggested that the photograph with Sourav would find a special place in her album.         
	On board the aircraft, passengers had to be requested not to disturb Sourav and the other Knights, or else the mobbing act wouldve continued.         
	As for Tiwary, he was his calm self on the morning-after.         
	Having been dropped against the Mumbai Indians, I was under pressure... Whatever the level, one has to perform on making a comeback. Otherwise the captain and coach may lose faith... So, I had to get it right and did... Mere liye bahut satisfying din tha... That I batted in the middle-order, where Im used to, helped, Tiwary observed, speaking exclusively.         
	He added: Yes, I was disappointed when I didnt make the list of probables for the World T20, but a player cant do anything about such things... Im aware some of the other batsmen have been doing well and making headlines... At the end of the day, I do realise I need to perform. Mujhe consistent bhi hona hai...         
	Getting a touch emotional, Tiwary said he hoped to continue getting the blessings of well-wishers.         
	Its not that Tiwary hasnt played for India  he has featured in an ODI  but has lost ground to many in the past two years. The 24-year-old would, therefore, like to use this T20 tournament as a vehicle to get back on track.         
	Tiwary, incidentally, had been the MoM in the Knights first match at home this season  against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Footnote: The Knights mentor-consultant, Wasim Akram, has returned to India with younger son Akbar, who bears such a striking resemblance to his late mother, Huma. The elder son, Taimur, has gone on a school trip to China.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Vijender storms into quarters
                        
	Guangzhou: Star pugilist Vijender Singh saved the best for the last round to outpunch Yu Ting Yang of Chinese Taipei 9-4 and storm into the 75kg quarter finals of the boxing competition in the Asian Games here on Wednesday.         
	World No. 1 Vijender, who got a first round bye, was finding hard to break into his opponents defence initially and was trailing 1-2 at the end of the second round before running away winner with a flurry of punches. The lanky Indian, who won bronze in the 2006 edition in Doha, showed his class in the third round by taking eight points against two by his unheralded opponent.         
	There were some anxious moments in the Indian camp in the first two rounds when Vijender was finding it hard to break the tall Chinese Taipei boxers shell guard.         
	Vijender admitted he was finding it difficult to break his opponents defence initially and said he was under a bit of pressure after the second round.         
	My opponent tried to use his better height to his advantage by employing shell guard and I was finding a bit difficult to break it. Honestly, my heart beat was up after trailing in the second round, Vijender said after his bout.         
	But once I did break his defence in the third round I was able to score freely, said the Olympic and World Championships bronze-medallist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not a finalist, but Forlan is a champion all the way
                                                                                                                       7                                        Not a finalist, but Forlan is a champion all the way
  - Striker rsquo;s career and life have been extraordinary
            ROB HUGHES            Diego Forlan makes his frustration apparent on a night when the high of scoring a stunning goal gave way to despair, as the Uruguayans World Cup campaign came to an end, in the semi-final with a 2-3 loss versus the Netherlands. (AP)                           
	Johannesburg: The Dutch are back where their history and their two modern-day goal poachers, Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben, deserve to be. But in every semi-final, there is deep and piquant regret for a man who did not deserve to lose.         
	That man Tuesday was Diego Forlan. A leader, a striker, a man who very nearly lifted his team to the pinnacle of this World Cup.         
	But in defeat, what courage Forlan and his depleted Uruguayan team displayed in Cape Town! Without Diego Lugano, the teams injured captain and defensive organiser, the team was open at the back. Without Luis Suarez, the suspended running mate of Forlan in attack, it lacked a second striker of cunning and movement.         
	Yet still, in a 3-2 loss, Forlan looked technically and temperamentally among the best players on the field. He wore the captains armband for a reason.         
	Forlan had seen his opposite number, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, score from almost 30 yards with a searing left-footed shot that caught Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera flat-footed. But Forlan summoned his own remarkable technique to equalise.         
	The distance was not quite as far, but Forlans goal was better. He used a body swerve to shake off a marker and create space for himself. Then, with a marvellous disguise, with the merest of back lift from his left foot, he propelled the ball at startling velocity.         
	The Dutch goalkeeper, Maarten Stekelenburg, like Muslera, was taken by surprise. Stekelenburg is about 6 feet 5 inches tall, but Forlans curling shot passed over his head.         
	So it was 1-1, with a howitzer from one captain and a curveball from the other.         
	Not for the first time in this tournament, Uruguay took heart from their leader. Not for the first time in his life, the 31-year-old Forlan showed what a player and what a man he is.         
	His career and his life have been extraordinary. He follows in the footprints of his father, Pablo, who played for Uruguay in the 1974 World Cup. His maternal grandfather, Juan Carlos Corazo, played for the Argentine team Independiente in the 1930s and coached Uruguay in the early 1960s.         
	But it isnt merely as a player in the family trade that Forlan impresses. He was 13, and undecided about pursuing soccer or tennis as a career, when his elder sister, Alejandra, was paralysed in a car crash. The young Diego told her in the hospital that he would become an important soccer player and earn enough to ensure that she had a good quality of life.         
	True to his word, he began in Argentina at 17, moved to Manchester United, then on to Spain where, at Villarreal and now Atletico Madrid, he has been among the most productive goal scorers in Europe.         
	The Manchester period, from 2002 to 2004, was both the most difficult and the most revealing of his career. He played his heart out. His team won three consecutive Premier League titles, yet his scoring ratio was by far his lowest in professional soccer. Everywhere else he has gone, he has scored at least a goal every two games, but at United he managed just 17 in 98 matches.         
	Just why, nobody ever figured out. He tried, maybe too hard, to be a team player. He worked, maybe too unselfishly, and he cared too obviously for the team on which he played. For character, his coach, Alex Ferguson, would select Forlan every time, but in the end both men realised a move might help Forlan.         
	It did, and how. Ferguson is a veteran among European club managers, and he was not at all surprised to see Forlans class at this World Cup. Four goals in five games, all of them with quality, took Forlan further here than the disappointing icons Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, who between them scored a ton of goals for Manchester United.         
	Ferguson, forever chasing talented performers, is hoping to sign one of the Dutchmen who on Tuesday put Forlan out of this competition. He needs a player who can score goals from midfield, and Sneijder has proved at Real Madrid and Inter Milan, and with five goals at the World Cup, that he has an uncanny knack for working between the penalty boxes and scoring at the right end.         
	So Forlan, who didnt pull it off with United, is out of the final. Sneijder is very much in it. But if ever you wonder what motivates Forlan, it isnt just about playing and trying to conjure goals.         
	He works with dedication for his sisters foundation aimed at preventing road accidents in Uruguay, and he represents Unicef, also trying to improve life for the disabled.         
	A loser? On Tuesday, maybe, but not in this tournament, and surely not in life.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

                                                                                                                       7                                        Zaheer: Want to play all ties
  - Strategic breaks would be interesting, says Pace spearhead               Zaheer Khan in Mumbai on Wednesday                           
	Mumbai: The over-specific two-and-a-half minute strategic breaks for the batting as well as the fielding sides in the third season of the Indian Premier League (IPL), starting on March 12, would be interesting to watch, feels India pace spearhead Zaheer Khan.         
	It would be interesting as we have all seen in the last IPL that soon after the break, a wicket falls. Its good that the option to call it lies with the captain. It can definitely change the momentum, said Zaheer, who is to play for the Sachin Tendulkar-led Mumbai Indians outfit.         
	The IPL governing council has said the strategic breaks are mandatory for the fielding side between the sixth and the eighth over while for the batting side between the 11th and 16th over during the 45-day, eight-team T20 event.         
	The left arm pacer, who missed the three-match ODI home series against South Africa last month after picking an injury in the second Test at Calcutta, Wednesday said that early breakthroughs are very important.         
	Its important to get early breakthroughs during the Powerplay, between overs one and six, and thats the reason all the teams are opting for good fast bowlers, he said.         
	Zaheer, who said his injury was a minor one in comparison to what he picked up earlier in his career, was optimistic that the Mumbai side would go all the way this year after failing to make the semi-finals in 2008 and 2009.         
	Why only 14, I want to play all 16 matches (including the semi-final and final apart). I love playing cricket, Zaheer said, when asked about the heavy travelling involved, not only this year, but also in the next year of the T20 tournament when 10 teams are going to be in the fray.         
	On his injury, the speedster said it was frustrating as it prevented him from bowling in the second innings of the Calcutta Test against South Africa that India won to square the rubber.         
	I knew it was not serious It was just frustrating because I could not bowl in the second innings.         
	I had a few sessions with the NCA physios in Mumbai. My brother was getting married and he was happy that I was at home. It was not a serious injury. It was important that I did not aggravate it. It was probably Grade I muscle tear of the quadriceps, he elaborated.         
	I have dealt with bigger injuries. I was not worried about this. All I had to do was put in the required work and I will be okay, he added.         
	Looking ahead to the Mumbai Indians opener against inaugural edition champions the Rajasthan Royals, captained by Shane Warne, Zaheer said that the team was excited about the encounter. Its our first game So everyone is upbeat and excited, Zaheer said.         
	The 32-year-old was also happy to have Sri Lankan Lasith Malinga as his new ball partner. Indias pace spearhead was excited about new recruit West Indian Kieron Pollard, whom the franchise bought in the auction for $750,000.         
	I am looking forward to meet him in person and play with him. Hope he brings in lots of luck and help us win many matches, he remarked smiling.         
	Hes really developed. He is a hard hitter of the ball and a genuine talent.           (PTI)

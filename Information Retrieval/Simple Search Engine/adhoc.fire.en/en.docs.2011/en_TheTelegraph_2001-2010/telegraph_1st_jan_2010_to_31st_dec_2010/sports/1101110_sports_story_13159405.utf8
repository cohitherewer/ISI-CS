The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arthur: IPL distracted the Indians
                                                                                                                       7                                      Arthur: IPL distracted the Indians
                      
	Johannesburg: The glitz and glamour of the IPL had such a distracting effect on Indian cricketers in its inaugural season that they were simply awful and spineless in a Test loss to South Africa in 2008, former Proteas coach Mickey Arthur said.         
	Arthur said the Indian cricketers preoccupation with IPL photo shoots and public relations exercises resulted in South Africa scoring an unprecedented win, under three days, against the home side, in a Test in Ahmedabad.         
	The Indians were awful, and all the talk about their minds being elsewhere was obviously true. They were spineless and distracted, Arthur wrote in his book Taking the Mickey, released here Monday.         
	The second Test must rank among the most perfect ever played by a South African team, Arthur wrote.         
	To win inside three days, in India, is almost unprecedented, but the way we did it, was extraordinary. There had been so much media hype around the impending first season of the IPL and it was dominating column inches in most newspapers.         
	 Arthur said the IPLs off-field engagements took a lot of players time.           (PTI)

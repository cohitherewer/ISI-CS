The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal fined $2,000
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nadal fined $2,000
                      
	London: Rafael Nadal has been fined $2,000 by Wimbledon officials for receiving coaching during his third-round match.         
	Nadal was given a code violation by French umpire Cedric Mourier for allegedly receiving advice from his coach, uncle Toni Nadal, during his five-set win over Philipp Petzschener on Saturday.         
	Both Nadals said Toni had only been giving the player encouragement. The fine was announced Monday.         
	Nadal said: The rules are the rules.         
	Toni wasnt giving me any tips, he was only supporting me, Nadal had earlier said.         
	Sometimes in the past Toni would talk, maybe too much, and the referee or the umpire would give me advice and, if it continued, a warning, but he didnt talk too much this time in my opinion. I told the umpire that we will be talking to the supervisor and this is what we will be doing.         
	Nadals opponent also said that he had not heard any coaching, just a few cries of vamos from Toni, on Saturday. It was not the first time, though, that Toni has been accused of passing on encouragement to his nephew. During the final of the 2006 Rome tournament, Roger Federer said he had caught him at it.         
	Nadal won his fifth French Open title early this month beating Swede Robin Soderling.

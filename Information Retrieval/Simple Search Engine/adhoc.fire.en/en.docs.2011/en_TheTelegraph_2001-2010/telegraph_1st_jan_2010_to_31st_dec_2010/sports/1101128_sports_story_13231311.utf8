  - Not underestimating the young Indian team, says NZ captain       OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Guwahati: New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori believes that that their preparation for the upcoming World Cup, early next year, will start with the five-match one-day International (ODI) series against India.         
	Having done considerably well in the Test series against India, Vettori, at a media conference on the eve of the first ODI, said that the Black Caps would also look to rectify the mistakes that they made in the humiliating series loss against Bangladesh.         
	It (the series) is important in terms of our build-up for the World Cup. We know we had a disappointing series in Bangladesh. We will try to rectify them... We have made some changes and some experienced players have come into the team. So we will see how it goes, Vettori said.         
	The build-up to the World Cup is simply about playing every game I think both teams want to win... Both teams want to get their confidence going before the Cup. So, it starts here tomorrow (Sunday). It is an important game for us, he added.                     Daniel Vettori in Guwahati, on Saturday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh         
	Asked about the new-look Indian side, Vettori said: Some of them played in the IPL We know most of them pretty well. They are all good players and they must be in form to be selected for India. We know how dangerous they can be. We are not underestimating the young Indian team.         
	Speaking on the injured Jesse Ryder, who had an impressive run in the Test series, the captain said that the batsman was very much in the scheme for the World Cup and that in his absence, it will be a chance for the youngsters to prove themselves.         
	Jesse Ryder will definitely come into the picture (for the World Cup) with what he has done But he has an injury and so, this is a chance to have a look at others, he said.           
	He also informed that a final call on the injured Brendon McCullums availability will be taken on Sunday morning. We will take a call on him tomorrow. He has got a back problem... Occasionally, that results in back spasms. But that is something which is being looked after, he said.  
	Asked about comeback man Jamie How, Vettori said: Anyone coming back into the side means that he is in form at the domestic level. He is a quality player. We hope he performs well.         
	According to the New Zealand captain, the toss will not play a crucial role in Sundays game.         
	The last two times the team which won the toss here, have batted first and went on to lose the game. So it should not affect the game.         
	On the wicket, Vettori said: Traditionally, it has been pretty slow here. With such an early start, probably it will go slower and slower as the game progresses.

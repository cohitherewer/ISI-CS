	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders head coach Dav Whatmore is extremely hurt at the recent spot-fixing controversy that has rocked the cricket world. The former Australian batsman who has also been the coach of the World Cup winning Sri Lanka squad believes that the current controversy gives ICC a chance to clean up the mess.         
	I have always believed that in most negative situations, something positive emerges. Due to this controversy, the authorities should stress on educating the younger players. This is the time when you can tighten up the system and put things back in order. This can reduce the frequency if not eradicate the problem totally, Whatmore, who has been appointed the head of Cricket Association of Bengals junior cricket development program, said on Monday.         
	As per the strange diktat issued by CAB, the coach was not allowed to air his opinion on Bengal cricket.         
	When asked, whether International Cricket Council (ICC) is doing enough to counter the fixing menace, he said: Can someone explain what exactly does ICC mean? I have often heard people loosely opining ICC not doing anything. ICC is made up of all the member countries. They can only do as much.         
	The burly Australian also feels that one needs to have an independent arbitrator who will probe into the matter. Obviously, if the allegations are proved to be true and someone is found guilty, he should be handed out appropriate punishment, he said.         
	Whatmore feels that it is only a few who are involved in such activities. I have always felt that only a minority is associated with these kind of alleged activities.         
	Does he think that teams nowadays lack captains like Imran Khan or Arjuna Ranatunga, whom the players could look up to?         
	I think leadership matters a lot in cricket. A good strong leader who is a strong individual always makes a difference. He is someone who can earn respect from his teammates, he concluded.

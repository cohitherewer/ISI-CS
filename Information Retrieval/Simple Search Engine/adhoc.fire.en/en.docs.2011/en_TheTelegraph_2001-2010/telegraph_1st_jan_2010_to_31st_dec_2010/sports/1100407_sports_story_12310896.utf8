	Margao: Churchill Brothers stave off a strong second half challenge from Al Hilal to beat the Yemeni side by a solitary goal and qualify for the round of 16 knock-out stage in the AFC Cup, at the Nehru Stadium, here on Tuesday. Felix scored the winner in the 42nd minute.         
	Churchill Brothers, who had beaten the same opponents 2-1 in their away match on March 24, are leading the three-team group with seven points from three matches.         
	Churchill play at Kuwait SC (two points from two matches) in their last group match on April 28. The two sides had played out a 2-2 draw here on March 16.         
	Al Hilal, on the other hand, are at the bottom of the group with just one point from three matches. They had drawn 2-2 against Kuwait SC in their opening match.         
	Both the teams played cautiously in the first half with neither of the them showing any urgency in their attack.         
	Churchill failed to put up the same performance which they displayed against Kuwait SC and created few openings in the first half.           (PTI)

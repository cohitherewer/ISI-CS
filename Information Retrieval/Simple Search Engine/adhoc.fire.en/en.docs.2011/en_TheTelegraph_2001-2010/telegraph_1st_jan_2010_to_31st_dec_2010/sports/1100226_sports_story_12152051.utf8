	New Delhi: Arozepal Singh and Mairaj Ahmed Khan fetched Indias lone gold medal Thursday as they grabbed the top honours in the team skeet event for men, taking the hosts medal tally to 37, which includes 18 gold, at the end of day eight in the Commonwealth Shooting Championships here.         
	Arozepal and Mairaj combined for a score 185 (93+92) to clinch the gold ahead of Englands Rory Warlow and Craig Lakey, who were just a point behind the Indians. The bronze medal in this event went to Bangladeshs Iqbal Islam and Nooruddin Salin, who totalled 175 in the shotgun event.         
	In the womens competition, Arti Rao and Rashmee Rathore missed the gold by just a point and settled for the silver with a combined score of 83. The gold was clinched by Englands Nicki Brocklesby and Pinky Le Grelle.         
	Welshwomen Elena Allen and Cerys Evan had to be content with the bronze after shooting a score of 79.         
	However, there was disappointment for India in the 50m Rifle Prone Team event for women as Tejaswini Sawant and Lajja Gauswami finished fifth despite equalling the previous meet record of 1171.         
	Scotlands Jennifer McIntosh and Sheena Sharp shattered the five-year-old meet record to grab the gold medal in this event by scoring 1178. The silver in this event went to Englands Michele Smith and Sharon Lee, who finished a point behind the gold medallists. Welsh Johanne Brekke, who was part of the team that set the previous meet record in 2005, and Helen Warnes settled for silver after shooting 1174.         
	India continues to lead the medal tally and besides the 18 gold medals, the home shooters have also clinched 13 silver and six bronze medals. After adding the consolation badges given to the third member of a team, the hosts tally swells to 57.

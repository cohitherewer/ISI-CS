The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chawla aims to impress in WI
                                                                                                                       7                                        Chawla aims to impress in WI
                  Chawla                     
	New Delhi: Piyush Chawla did not take the Indian Premier League (IPL) by storm by taking 12 wickets from 14 matches but the young leg-spinner hopes to make a mark for the country in the World Twenty20 in the West Indies.         
	Chawla said World T20 will be a totally different tournament and his IPL performance will have no bearing on it. I dont think that IPL performance will matter in World T20. Both are very different tournaments. Playing for India is the ultimate inspiration and all of us will try to give our best shot, Chawla said.         
	A surprised inclusion in Indias squad for the World T20, Chawla would be touring the West Indies for the first time and he said that pitches there would suit his bowling.         
	I have never been to the West Indies, but I am confident of doing well there. Yuvraj Singh (his Kings XI Punjab teammate) has told me about Caribbean pitches. They will be slower and I am going to be among wickets for sure, said the 21-year-old.         
	Chawla also said that India would be a strong contender for the title in the tournament.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jeev ends tied 16th
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jeev ends tied 16th
                      
	Paris: Jeev Milka Singh carded a second successive three-under 68 to notch up the best finish among Indians, signing off tied 16th even as Jyoti Randhawa slumped after faltering in the final round of the Alstom Open de France here.         
	Jeev ended twith a total of five-under 279 after striking six birdies against three bogeys in the final round. His front nine was an eventful affair as he struck three birdies and stumbled to an equal number of bogeys to make the turn even-par. But he made amends later.         
	It was a final-round disaster for Randhawa who carded a 12-over 83 to finish tied 60th. The Delhi-pro dropped five bogeys, three double bogeys against just a lone birdie in a horrendous performance to total five-over 289.

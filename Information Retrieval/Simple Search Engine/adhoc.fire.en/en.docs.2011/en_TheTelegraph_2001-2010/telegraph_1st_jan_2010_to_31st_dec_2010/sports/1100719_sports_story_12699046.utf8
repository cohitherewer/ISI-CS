The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harbhajan is not fully fit: Kirsten
                                                                                                                       7                                        Harbhajan is not fully fit: Kirsten
                  Rahul Dravid shakes hands with Muttiah Muralidharan, in Galle, on Sunday                     
	Galle: India coach Gary Kirsten revealed at a media conference on Sunday that star off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was chosen for the first Test despite not being fully fit.         
	We had to play Harbhajan today (Monday) though he is still recovering from flu. He is not in full fitness yet but you know we need him in the team. If he had not played we would have been really inexperienced. He is a gutsy cricketer. He said he wanted to play, he said.         
	The seasoned spinner had also missed the only warm up game before the Test match.         
	Kirsten is hopeful that, despite Sri Lanka dominating the opening day, his team will be able to make a comeback.         
	The hosts reached an impressive 256 for two before rain and bad light combined to force early stumps.         
	However, Kirtsen said it was not all over for India and that weather will play an important role in the match.         
	Sri Lanka have not yet taken a stranglehold on the match. We will be looking to get a couple of early wickets tomorrow (Monday). And this match could be affected by rains, Kirsten said at a media conference.         
	Sri Lanka skipper Kumar Sangakkara (103) scored his 22nd Test century and Tharanga Paranavitana (110 unbeaten) his maiden hundred to lay the foundation of a big score.         
	Kirsten also backed Ishant Sharma despite an ordinary show by the paceman. He leaked 79 runs in the 14 overs he bowled in different spells and went wicketless.         
	Ishant was a bit unlucky. In the first session he bowled some good deliveries which went down to the third man for fours. That can happen to any bowler. We should not judge him in a warm-up game and in one innings of the Test match.         
	Let us give him a bit of run and let us see how it goes. We want to back him as much as we can. I think, may be, he has lost a little bit of confidence in the last season and that takes a bit of time to get back, he said adding that the team badly missed injured pacer Zaheen Khan.         
	Speaking on a different issue, Kirsten said the team wanted Irfan Pathan to play as an all rounder in the 2011 ODI World Cup but had to drop the plan because of his inability to take wickets consistently.         
	Pathan has been out of the team for more than a year now as he last played an ODI in February 2009 and it is more than two years that he figured in a Test.         
	Kirsten said since Pathan could not perform up to the expectations, the No. 6 spot in the ODI side was still up for grabs.         
	We are looking for an all rounder for the World Cup. We were looking at Irfan Pathan to fill that role. Probably he lacked a bit. We are looking for an all-rounder who can come in the top six of the batting order during the World Cup.         
	We cant have a guy who is bowling 115kms and holding up an end and getting one wicket every five matches. He should be able to make a positive contribution. Irfan was the person whom we had earmarked but probably he lacked on the bowling side, Kirsten said.

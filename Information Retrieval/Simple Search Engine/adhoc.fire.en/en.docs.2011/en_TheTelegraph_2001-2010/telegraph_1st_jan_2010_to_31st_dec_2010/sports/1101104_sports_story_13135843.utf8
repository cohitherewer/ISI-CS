The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bale is Spurs hero

	London: Tottenham beat defending champions Inter Milan 3-1 to record one of the greatest results in the clubs history and Barcelona were also made to wait before sealing qualification in the Champions Leagues knockout stage after drawing 1-1 at FC Copenhagen.         
	Rafael van der Vaart opened the scoring for Tottenham in the 18th minute before Man of the Match Gareth Bale set up Peter Crouch and Roman Pavlyuchenko for goals after the break.         
	Inter striker Samuel Eto had made it 2-1 with his seventh goal of the tournament but it could not stop Champions League debutants Spurs going above the Italian champions on goal difference in Group A.         
	Like Inter, Barcelona too would have reached the last 16 had they won but Copenhagens Claudemir cancelled out Lionel Messis goal to earn the Danish side a point in Group D.         
	Manchester United beat Bursaspor 3-0 to move to the brink of qualification from Group C while Lyons 100 percent record in Group B ended with a 3-4 defeat at Benfica, who came close to squandering a four-goal lead.         
	With Inter, Barcelona and Lyon all failing to win, no side is through to the knockout stage yet.         
	Bale terrorised Inters defense two weeks ago by scoring a stunning second-half hattrick when Spurs lost 4-3 at the San Siro. The Wales winger put in just as good a performance at White Hart Lane, with Inters Brazil right back Maicon undone time and again by Bales trickery and pace.         
	He was amazing. Theyre just doing some drug testing now  the dope testers are here, and I hope theyre testing him, Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp joked.         
	Van der Vaart ran onto Luka Modrics slipped through-ball to curl in a finish and maintain his run of scoring in every home game hes played for Tottenham since his deadline-day move.         
	Bale, who ran Maicon ragged in the first half, repeated the dose after the break and laid on perfect crosses for Crouch and Pavlyuchenko to apply almost identical finishes at the far post.         
	From the first to the last we played unbelievably. Pressed them, outworked them, outplayed them all night, quot; Redknapp said.         
	In the groups other match, Nacer Chadli and Luuk de Jong scored late goals to earn FC Twente a 2-0 win over 10-man Werder Bremen and put it on five points, two behind Spurs and Inter.         
	Messi scored his fifth goal in this seasons Champions League, and 15th in all competitions, when he lashed in a right-foot shot that went in off the post to put three-time winner Barcelona ahead in Denmark.         
	But Copenhagen equalised when Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes fumbled Jesper Gronkjaers cross from the left and Claudemir was on hand to volley in at the far post, keeping his side a point behind the Spanish champions.         
	I am really proud of the boys, Copenhagen coach Stale Solbakken said.         
	Rubin Kazan and Panathinaikos earlier played out a second successive 0-0 draw to reduce their hopes of a top-two finish. (Agencies)

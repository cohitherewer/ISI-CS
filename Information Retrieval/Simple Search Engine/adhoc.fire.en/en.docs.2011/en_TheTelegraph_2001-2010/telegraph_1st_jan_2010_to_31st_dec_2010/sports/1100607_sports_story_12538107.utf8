	The newly-built Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban will host one of the semi-finals of the 2010 World Cup. 
  The venue takes the inspiration for its design from the South African flag, with its grand arch representing the unity of this sport-loving nation. The 70,000-seater has been specifically designed as a multi-purpose venue and an amphitheatre complete with a cable car which ascends to a viewing platform at the top of the expansive 350m arch, 106m above the pitch. 
  It is a world-class and multifunctional arena located in the heart of the Kings Park Sporting Precinct and was built on the site of the old Kings Park Stadium. Moses Mabhida, for whom the ground is named,developed the African National Congress' armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Selection has been lopsided

	From the revelry and vibrant colours of Holi, the Indian Davis Cup team head for the grey and chilling challenge of the Russians in Moscow. The first round play-off against Russia in the 2010 World Group is a very tough call for any team in the world.         
	A low ranking ageing Indian team led by 25-year-old Somdev Dev Varman, who just this week moved up to a creditable (by Indian standards) 128 in the world rankings, has little, if any, chance against the highly ranked Russians on their home courts.         
	The other three members of the ageing Indian team are Leander Paes  36, Mahesh Bhupathi  35 and Rohan Bopanna  30! For many years now all three have been playing only doubles on the circuit and can be called doubles specialists.         
	Considering that a Davis Cup tie has only one doubles match and four singles matches, the selection seems lopsided. More so, when India have Yuki Bhambri, who was ranked as the No. 1 junior in the world. Bhambri opted out of the team to play in some nondescript tournament, but given the assurance of playing at the No. 2 spot in the singles, Bhambri would possibly not have refused.         
	Nobody in their right senses would advise Bhambri to miss an opportunity to play two Davis Cup matches against the likes of Mikhail Youzhny, the world No. 13 and world No. 38 Igor Andreev. The tension in a Davis Cup match would have helped Bhambri to toughen up and would have given him what he requires most at this time of his career  the experience of competing at the highest levels of the game. Furthermore a week of intense practice with a team full of Davis Cup experience would have taught him how to hone his game to its peak for important matches.         
	The difficult question is which one of the three doubles players should have been dropped. In my view one of the two, Bhupathi or Paes, should step down. I would keep Paes because of his recent good form in winning the mixed doubles at the Australian Open, followed by a good showing at Dubai, where he reached the doubles final.         
	Bhupathi, on the other hand, after his calf injury at the Australian Open and early loss in the mens doubles in Dubai, does not seem to be at his best. The other factor is that Paes aggression appears to be far more inspirational than the quiet laid back attitude of Bhupathi.         
	Another major plus in dropping one of the stalwarts is that it will stop the constant tension and infighting prevalent in the team.         
	The non-playing captain, SP Misra, was installed as a peacekeeper. He has managed to keep the lid on the simmering discontent. But the real job of a captain is to ensure discipline, look after the needs of the players, plan tactics, strategy and build team spirit. Placating prima donnas is not a captains job.         
	It is most unlikely that we can pull off an upset victory in Moscow. Considering the high rankings of the Russian team members, I feel shaky about our chances even in the doubles, which the team is banking on. Bhupathi and Paes, who have been the pivots of many of our Davis Cup victories, are ageing and are certainly not as good as they were in the past. How long can the so called chemistry, which suddenly appears on court, last?         
	Our chances rest squarely on Somdevs shoulders. His performances and statements are reassuring, but is he another Paes, who can bring down the top most stars of the game?         
	Somdev certainly has the resolve and is not cowed down, but I cannot visualise him matching the flair and aggression of an adrenaline pumped Paes. The odds are that after the weekend, India will be back in the zonal competition of the Davis Cup, where they truly belong.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Ravi Shastri is expected to retain his post but either Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi or Sunil Gavaskar is set to lose his place in the Indian Premier League (IPL) governing council, which would be revamped by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), at its Annual General Meeting (AGM) here on Wednesday.         
	Shastri would most probably be retained. The other position has to be decided between Gavaskar and Pataudi, a BCCI source said on the eve of the AGM, at the Wankhede stadium.         
	In the wake of massive irregularities in the first three seasons of the IPL under the chairmanship of Lalit Modi, the BCCI has decided to withdraw some of the special powers given to the governing council and bring it on par with its other subcommittees.         
	Accordingly, the tenure of the council would be reduced to just one year from the current five, which was made possible by an amendment to the Boards constitution, at the behest of Modi, three years ago.         
	The number of members was also expected to be pruned from the existing 13, to probably 11. The vice-chairmans post is set to be abolished and the number of former players trimmed down from three to two.         
	Another big name expected to be given the nudge is former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra, who has been the lone supporter of Modi. Farooq Abdullah, the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association president and a Union minister, could also be left out due to his political commitments.         
	According to another source, the reconstituted council is likely to be chaired by Chirayu Amin, interim chairman at present, and will include Arun Jaitley, Niranjan Shah, Rajeev Shukla and either Jyotiraditya Scindia or Anurag Thakur.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: India will tour England for four Tests, five one-day Internationals (ODI) and a Twenty20 International next year.         
	The Test series will begin at Lords on July 21 while the fourth and final Test, at The Oval, will be held from August 18, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced in a media release on Thursday.         
	The one-off Twenty20 is scheduled to take place on August 31 and would be followed by the ODI series between the two teams from September 3-16.         
	Sri Lanka would visit England prior to India.         
	They will play three Tests, five ODIs and a T20 International.         
	ECB chief executive David Collier said that the fans in England can expect two high quality series against India and Sri Lanka.         
	With India currently the No. 1 ranked Test side in the ICC Test rankings and Sri Lanka in the third place, England supporters can expect to see two exciting Test Series against high quality opposition, he said.         
	Both teams will also provide a tough challenge for England in the shorter forms of the game in what promises to be a highly competitive and entertaining summer of international cricket, he added.

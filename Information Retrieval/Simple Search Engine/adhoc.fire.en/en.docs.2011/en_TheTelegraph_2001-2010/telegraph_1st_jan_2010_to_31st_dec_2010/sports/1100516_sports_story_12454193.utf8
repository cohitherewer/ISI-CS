	Ipoh: Drag-flicker Dhananjay Mahadik scored a hattrick as defending champions India crushed Egypt 7-1 to enter the final of the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament here Saturday.         
	Mahadik (34th, 40th, 42nd minute), skipper Rajpal Singh (44th), Rupinder Pal Singh (48th), Tushar Khandekar (49th), Sarvanjit Singh (70th) scored for India in what was a must-win match, while Abd El Hakim Ahmed (68th) was the lone Egyptian goal-getter.         
	India will take on Korea in the summit clash Sunday.         
	India had earlier made six appearances in the final of the tournament and ended on the victorious side on four occasions in 1985, 1991, 1995 and 2009. They had lost to Argentina in the 2008 title clash by a golden goal.         
	Contrary to the result, India were made to struggle in the first half by the Egyptians and were denied the lead till the 34th minute when Mahadik flicked from their sixth penalty corner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I do things which come to me naturally: Gambhir
                                                                                                                       7                                      I do things which come to me naturally: Gambhir
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  No. 1 Test batsman says the Army is still his first love             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Calcutta: He doesnt like comparisons, isnt driven by awards and doesnt get weighed down by pressure. And, a few weeks ago, he came close to emulating Sir Don Bradman (hundreds in six consecutive Tests).         
	Meet Gautam Gambhir, the 28-year-old who has played a significant part in Team Indias rise to No.1 in the Test rankings. In fact, hes himself the top-ranked batsman in Tests.         
	Normally quite reticent, Gambhir spoke to The Telegraph, the other day, on just about everything.               
	The following are excerpts                     Gautam Gambhir        
	Q How would you describe yourself?         
	A (Grins) On the field, Im pretty intense and aggressive... Off it, Im quite a different person... I do play hard, but dont get personal... Its just that Im very passionate about playing for India and the passion drives me. I guess the country expects its cricketers to be very passionate.         
	Off the field...         
	Im definitely not aggressive! I try and be with people I want to be with... I dont like a lot of people around me, but do hang out with close friends in Delhi... You wont find me with people I cant be myself with... I need to feel comfortable... I dont really party, Id rather have a quiet dinner with a few of those I actually want to be with.         
	You have a distinct image, isnt it?         
	Look, thats the way I am... It has worked for me and I havent felt the need to change. What matters is being in my own zone, not how others may want to see me. I do things which come to me naturally.  
	Are you all that quiet with close friends as well?         
	There are times when I talk a lot, talk a lot of crap, really... But, then, that helps me to unwind... After all, one keeps talking cricket most of the time and its good to get away from it all. Its nice to have a bit of fun, joke around... One needs to relax. At times, when I open up, I end up being the only one talking.         
	The Army was your first love, it seems. What made you take to cricket?         
	Not was, is... Even now, Id love to join the Army... It was in Class XII that I was all ready to join the NDA, but thats when I made my Ranji debut and got a hundred in my second match, against Karnataka... After that, I got picked for India U-19 and my parents suggested I stick to cricket... They felt I was one step away from playing for India... I followed their advice, but till my Ranji debut, my mind had been elsewhere... Id, after all, reached a stage (Class XII) when you decide what career to choose.         
	You could, perhaps, now have been Major Gautam Gambhir...         
	(Laughs) Perhaps... You know, we get feted as stars, but the real stars are the defence personnel... Members of the Army, Air Force and the Navy. For me, they are the real heroes. The sacrifices they make dont have a parallel.         
	In the changed scenario, whats your first love?         
	I love to bat, bat and bat...         
	Are you, for example, more fired up against Pakistan?         
	Absolutely... You dont want to lose to Pakistan and want to do really well against them... Id felt gutted when my 57 went in vain in the last Champions Trophy... That had been my comeback match, after an injury, and Id been looking to help India win... In fact, I didnt sleep for three nights before that September 26 match... Id been so focused.         
	How did you calm yourself that morning?         
	I couldnt... Id been charged up, Id been nervous, too... Wanted India to win at any cost, but... That I got run out still hurts... Hasnt got out of my system... Getting run out, indeed, is difficult to accept.         
	You share a great relationship with Virender Sehwag...         
	I owe a part of my success to Viru... He has helped me get big runs and, for me, is the No.1, irrespective of the rankings... Hes amazing.         
	Having already led in the Ranji Trophy and in the Champions League, how do you intend approaching the Delhi DareDevils captaincy in the IPL?         
	Im looking forward to the experience... Ill be able to take the help of Viru, of Daniel Vettori, who captains New Zealand, and even Paul Collingwood, who has led England in ODIs and T20...         
	What, in your opinion, are the qualities a captain should have?         
	Among other things, he must allow his players to play their natural game... He shouldnt put them under pressure... He must have the ability to identify match-winners and to back them... Whenever I captain, I dont take the field with fixed ideas.         
	Youre fond of movies...         
	Oh, Im a big Aamir Khan fan and I loved his Taare Zameen Par...         
	Music?         
	Depends on my mood... I could listen to romantic songs, ghazals, devotional stuff... Would depend on my mood... Sometimes, I wake up wanting to listen to a particular type of music, the sort which would help me relax.         
	What about sport?         
	I played a bit of soccer and tennis in school... I may not watch a lot of those sport, but love watching hockey.         
	Favourites in soccer and tennis...         
	Im a Manchester United fan... In tennis, I like Andy Roddick.         
	Why has Roddick not been able to reach the next level?         
	(Grins) I expected this one from you... Could be because of nerves... Perhaps, he needs help from a psychologist... There was a time when my failure to convert 50s into 100s had begun to play on my mind... Had, for a while, become a psychological issue... Once a barrier is broken, then theres no looking back... The reality is that every sportsman goes through phases.         
	Are you fussy about food?         
	I love anything thats home-cooked... Like most North Indians, Im fond of butter chicken and daal makhni, especially when made by Mom... Its great to be pampered at home... (After a pause) That shes always there makes me feel secure.         
	Were you a naughty kid?         
	In school, yes... Very naughty... I did some crazy things and got into fights... But, then, I suppose thats part of growing up... One matures with age, matures with responsibility as well.         
	How is pressure best handled?         
	In a way, by unwinding... Frankly, Im still learning how not to get affected... Somehow, I always feel that Ill be the most nervous among the 22 playing a match. Fortunately, Ive been able to manage the high expectations... In fact, at times, I do shut myself off from external factors.         
	Everyone gets nervous... Even Sachin Tendulkar, who actually believes a bit of nervousness is required to compete well...         
	I wouldnt disagree.         
	Youve handled success well. Has your upbringing played a part?         
	It has... At the same time, Im a strong believer in that everything, including fame and adulation, comes to an end one day... Id like to be remembered both as a good human being and a good cricketer. Indeed, Id like to be respected even when Im through with my cricket... I realise I wont be playing forever.         
	Given that your freedom has been curtailed, is there something you miss?         
	I do.         
	Like what?         
	Not always being able to go for a movie or for a quiet dinner... But thats the price one pays for being a professional (in the news)... I dont shop much, though, but I cant be like my friends who can walk into malls at will.         
	The most satisfying moments...         
	When India won the inaugural World T20 (September 2007) and I finished the highest run-getter for the team... Our tri-series win in Australia (March 2008)... India becoming the No.1 Test team (December 2009)... That was like a dream come true.         
	Youve been around in international cricket for seven years. What would you tell emerging cricketers?         
	In Delhi, I practise a lot in the Bharatnagar Sports Complex and, very often, get to hear that theres too much politics at the junior level... Whenever a young batsman tells me that, my reply is nothing can stop him as long as the bat is in his hands... If a hundred isnt enough, get a double hundred... If even that isnt enough, look to get a triple... Its important not to get frustrated.         
	Lastly... Sister Ekta got married recently. What are your plans?         
	(Laughs) I first need to find the right person! Because one is on the move so much, she will have to be somebody who appreciates my profession and wholl be able to cope with the mood swings... My family is after me, but I need to find the time, too.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Arun Jaitley will conduct a hearing on Thursday to consider Rajasthan Royals all-rounder Ravindra Jadejas appeal against the one year ban that has been slapped on him for allegedly flouting the Indian Premier League guidelines.         
	The IPL governing council Tuesday said in a statement that Jaitley, who also heads the Delhi and District Cricket Association, will chair and conduct the hearing which is being convened following an appeal from the cricketer and the two franchises involved, the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians.         
	The IPL governing council has taken a decision to hear Ravindra Jadejas plea and will also listen to representations from the two franchises involved, namely the Rajasthan Royals and the Mumbai Indians, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi said.         
	Arun Jaitley will, at the behest of the IPL governing council, chair the hearing and arrive at a final decision on Ravindra Jadeja and the same shall be binding on all parties concerned.         
	Earlier in February, the IPL governing council had, based on a unanimous decision and on instructions from the president of the BCCI, banned Jadeja for one year.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Kochis request   for more time
            OUR BUREAU                            
	Mumbai: The Rendezvous Sports-led Kochi IPL franchise on Wednesday asked for another 10 days time from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to form a joint venture company as instructed by the latter in a showcause notice.         
	The discussions are at advanced stage and we have almost tied up the issues. However, certain technicalities are to be sorted out for which we have asked the BCCI to give us 10 more days, a source in the franchise told The Telegraph.         
	The development comes on a day when Kochi filed its reply to the showcause notice, issued on October 10, minutes before the Wednesday 6pm deadline ended.         
	The source said the technicalities concerned with the legal aspects of the agreement signed by the owners when forming the Unincorporated Joint Venture (UJV).         
	Its with our solicitors now. We need to take the BCCIs approval if we want to make certain changes, like in the percentage of equity held by each owner. The Board might need a minimum of eight days to look into the legal implication, so we have asked for 10 days, the source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rickys sorry, but insists KP was out
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rickys sorry, but insists KP was out
                                  Ricky Ponting is bowled by Tim Bresnan at the MCG, on Tuesday		    
	Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting Tuesday apologised for overstepping the mark in his prolonged arguments with on-field umpire following the rejected referral appeal for caught behind against Kevin Pietersen during the fourth Ashes Test against England.         
	Ponting was fined 40 per cent of his match fee by the International Cricket Council Monday, for his finger-pointing argument with umpires Aleem Dar and Tony Hill after video umpire Marais Erasmus gave Pietersen not out following a referral appeal.         
	Yesterday was me overstepping the mark and obviously I apologise for the way that looked, its certainly not the way I want to be looked upon as a captain, the 36-year-old was quoted as saying by the Australian media.         
	I think its really important that if you are a captain of a senior or junior side you dont look at what I did and think thats right. Its certainly not and I apologise for that. I understand that it didnt look good. The facts of the matter are that I was charged last night with having a prolonged discussion with the umpires. The umpires made it quite clear to the referee and myself that in no way was I aggressive ... I just went on a bit too long. I accept that I was wrong, he added.         
	Ponting, however, insisted that the video umpire Erasmus was wrong not to have given Pietersen out on Sunday.         
	I had a chance to look at it again last night. I still, in my heart and in my mind, believe that he inside-edged that ball, he said. I think if you look at the replay properly, in the way that it needs to be looked at, I think everyone will understand that Hot-Spot mark wasnt a long way away from where the ball passed the bat ... but thats irrelevant now. The decision was made and Ive got to get on with it now, the Aussie skipper said.         
	Ponting also criticised the policy of showing replays on the big screen before a decision is made.         
	I guess one flaw weve got in the system at the moment is that all the replays are being shown on the big screen. From what we could see on the big screen you could see a pretty obvious Hot-Spot mark on the inside-edge of his bat.         
	What I wanted to do was clarify how the third umpire had got to making the decision that he made, and thats what started the discussion with Aleem and I, he said. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No cheers for Pawar
                                                                                                                       7                                      No cheers for Pawar
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Mumbai: Its not exactly a secret that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) head, Shashank Manohar, and president-elect Narayanswamy Srinivasan, who is also the secretary, have distanced themselves from Sharad Pawar.         
	Apparently, that has much to do with Pawar having had a soft corner for one Lalit Kumar Modi.         
	What came as somewhat of a surprise is that the others, too, in the BCCI arent exactly enamoured by their former chief, who is currently heading the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	Indeed, according to The Telegraphs sources, nobody cheered or clapped when Manohar read out that Pawar had become the second former president of the BCCI (after Jagmohan Dalmiya) to head the world body.         
	Usually, such references, seen as an achievement, are applauded... Nothing of that sort happened today (Wednesday, at the AGM), one of the sources said.         
	Pawar, who took charge a few months ago, will be at the helm of the ICC till June 2012. Dalmiya, who made history, had been its president from 1997-2000.         
	Within the BCCI, Union minister Pawar continues to head the Mumbai Cricket Association.

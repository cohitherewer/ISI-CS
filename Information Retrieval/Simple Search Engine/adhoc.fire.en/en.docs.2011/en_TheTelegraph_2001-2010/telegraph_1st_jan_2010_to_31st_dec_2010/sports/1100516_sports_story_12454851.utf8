The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Derby of little value
                                                                                                                       7                                      Derby of little value
  - Bhaichung not certain to start; Masih doubtful       A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta: This will be a derby without any relevance. Mohun Bagan and East Bengal square off, once again, in a space of three weeks, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday, this time in an I-League match. And, as usual, they have nothing to play for except some silly pride they keep bragging about.         
	Dempo have already won the title, Churchill Brothers and Mahindra United are fighting for the second spot. And the Big Two of Calcutta? Bagan are fifth on the points table with 33 points from 24 matches while East Bengal are ninth with 29 points from 23 outings.         
	And, like every year, they will once again be counting the head-to-head record. This season they have played thrice with a win each for the archrivals and a drawn tie. Whoever wins on Sunday will have the honour of saying We beat them two-one. Not bad for a team worth more than Rs 6 crore, isnt it?         
	The players, however, refuse to believe that the derby was losing its relevance. Look, we may not have been able to perform like the fans would want us to, but theres no denying the fact that this match evokes passion, says Mehrajuddin Wadoo, a veteran of seven seasons in the Maidan cauldron.         
	Fellow Kashmiri and Mohun Bagan rival Ishfaq Ahmed echoes Mehrajuddin: You think if we lose the match, there wont be any taunting? You may say this is the dullest derby, but for the players its a grudge match.         
	Well, the players might have a different take but the fans are slowly, but surely, turning their backs. Or how else do you explain only eight supporters turning up at the Bagan ground on match eve?         
	The first-leg clash was a historic one. Bagan exorcised the ghost of the 5-0 thrashing of 1975 with a 5-3 win. And Edeh Chidi had scored four goals.         
	East Bengals Yusif Yakubu may not start as he is nursing an ankle injury.         
	If Yakubu doesnt play then the onus of scoring will be on Bhaichung Bhutia and Abel Hammond. But its not certain whether Phillippe de Ridder would start with Bhaichung, who hasnt been in good form and injury too has hampered his chances.         
	Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya might have to leave out Rakesh Masih who took a nasty knock during the practice session. He is doubtful, the coach said.

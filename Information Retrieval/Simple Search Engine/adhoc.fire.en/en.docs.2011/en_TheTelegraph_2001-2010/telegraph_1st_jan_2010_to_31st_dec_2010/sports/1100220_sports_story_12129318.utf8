	Dubai: Kevin Pietersen produced arguably his most composed innings since his return from Achilles surgery, while Eoin Morgan continued his good form, as Pakistan were overwhelmed by an unbeaten 112-run partnership in the first Twenty20.         
	According to Cricinfo, the stand was Englands highest for any wicket in Twenty20s, and fittingly it was Morgan who sealed the match with a six  a monstrous hoist over deep backward square  as England rattled to victory with nine balls to spare.         
	It was an impressive way to bounce back after the disappointment of losing to the England Lions in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, and the victory was on the cards from the moment that Pakistan were restricted to 129 for 8 despite winning the toss and batting first.         
	England being England, they made heavy weather of their run-chase at first, slumping to 18 for 3 in 4.2 overs before Pietersen and Morgan turned the tide to impressive effect. Jonathan Trott and Joe Denly strode out to form their countrys 15th opening partnership in 24 Twenty20 matches, but between them they mustered five runs from 13 balls.         
	Denly, whose first two appearances in the format had both resulted in first-ball ducks, this time made it to his third delivery before spooning a high-elbowed drive to mid on for 1, shortly before Trott was cramped for room by Abdul Razzaq and bowled off an inside-edge for 4.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB have task cut out
                                                                                                                       7                                      EB have task cut out
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal have their task cut out when they square off against Dempo Sports Club in an I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Sunday.         
	East Bengal, who Friday managed to end their 64-day winless streak with a 6-1 win over a CFL side, are not in the best of forms in the I-League. With a side as settled and organised as Dempo waiting to go for the kill, it will be interesting to see how Phillippe de Ridders men respond to the challenge.         
	Unlike the first leg, when Dempo were without Brazilian Beto and Nigerian Ranty Martins, this time the Goans are at full strength. However, Climax Lawrence has not travelled with the team due to a double booking while Mahesh Gawli is nursing a niggle.         
	East Bengal will be missing Bhaichung Bhutia, a long-term injury casualty, while Syed Rahim Nabi is doubtful. Yusif Yakubu has recovered from a stomach bug and should start.         
	It will be a tough match. Not just because we are playing Dempo, we also have to fight our own problems, De Ridder said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gambhir, Nehra may play
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gambhir, Nehra may play
                      
	Bangalore: On a roll after four successive victories, the Royal Challengers Bangalore would look to continue their winning momentum against a struggling Delhi DareDevils when the two sides cross swords in the Indian Premier League (IPL) here Thursday.         
	There are indications that Gautam Gambhir and Ashish Nehra, back from Sri Lanka after getting treatment for their injuries, will play. That would be a huge boost for the side.         
	The Royal Challengers, who had started their campaign on a losing note, going down to the Kolkata Knight Riders in their first match, but after that, things started falling in place for the Anil Kumble-led side who won four matches back-to-back and are now placed on top of the points table.         
	On the other hand, the Delhi side impressed all and sundry in their first two matches  against the Kings XI Punjab and the Rajasthan Royals, but since then victory has eluded them. The Bangalore side now have eight points in their kitty, while the DareDevils are languishing in the sixth place on the table, with just four points.         
	Kumble and Co. have been consistent in all departments of the game. Jacques Kallis, who is wearing the orange cap (for the highest scorer) at the moment, and Manish Pandey have produced a couple of good opening partnerships for the team.         
	Royal Challengers bowling boasts of speedster Dale Steyn, who can bowl express deliveries to unsettle rival batsmen, and also R. Vinay Kumar, whose change of pace has troubled everyone. Captain Kumble and Kallis can also give the side some timely breakthroughs.         
	For the DareDevils, Virender Sehwag is the second highest run-getter in IPL III, but his form has not helped the side avert three defeats on the trot.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | HI threatens ban
                                                                                                                       7                                        HI threatens ban
  - Efforts are on to influence players employers       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Prabhjot Singh                                 
	New Delhi: The crisis in India hockey deepened on Monday with Hockey India (HI) threatening to suspend all the 22 campers if they do not resume training in the Pune camp immediately.         
	Though HI interim president Ashok Kumar Mattoo said a final decision would only be taken on Tuesday, sources revealed a 24-hour notice is set to be served on Tuesday to the players asking them to back off or to face strict disciplinary action.         
	On Tuesday, Mattoo and four other senior officials are rushing to Pune to have another round of dialogue with the players. Ikram Khan, an HI representative, who arrived in Pune on Monday, has failed in his attempt to break the deadlock.         
	There is little point in talking to Ikram Khan, said one of the players from Pune. He has no authority to take any decision. We would rather talk to people who really matter in the HI.         
	Insiders in the HI revealed that efforts are even on to influence the employers of the players to issue directive to the rebel stars to resume practice. The officials are talking to institutions like IOC and Punjab Police, where the majority of the players are employed, sources said.         
	If the employers put pressure on the players then they are bound to listen. This would enable HI to break the players unity. Some of the institutions have been requested to tell the players that their salaries could be stopped if they dont come down from their present position, sources claimed.         
	However, unperturbed players in the Pune camp stayed away from the practice for the third consecutive day on Monday and said their dues should be paid immediately. Mattoo said that HI, if required, would discard the present lot and select a fresh bunch of players for the World Cup.         
	I am extremely disappointed by the latest development, Mattoo told The Telegraph. Everything was settled on Saturday, yet the players decided not to resume training. We can suspend them and select a new lot of players but that should be the last resort. I am not in favour of taking extreme measures, he said.         
	Asked whether the players have been slapped with a 24-hour notice to resume training, the HI chief said: We have communicated our stand to the players. I am sure the problem would be sorted out soon.         
	A majority of the HI members are believed to be in favour of suspending the players. No decision, however, could be taken as Mattoo himself and Jagbir Singh, a former international, have reportedly asked the members to wait for a day before taking the extreme step.         
	Asked about the HI ultimatum to return to practice, senior player Prabhjot Singh said: We have no idea about any kind of ultimatum. Let the HI officials come. Then we will talk to them and see what could be done.         
	The international hockey federation (FIH) vice president, Antonio von Ondarza, who is currently in Delhi to oversee the preparations of the HI elections on February 7, said: What the players are doing is completely unheard of hockey. Hockey is not like Fifa or FIBA. Our game has little money. The players should play for the national jersey.

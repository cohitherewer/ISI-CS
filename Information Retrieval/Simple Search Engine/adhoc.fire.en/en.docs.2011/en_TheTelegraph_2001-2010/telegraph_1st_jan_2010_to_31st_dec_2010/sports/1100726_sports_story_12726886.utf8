The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pawar: No question of protecting Lalit Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pawar: No question of protecting Lalit Modi
                      
	New Delhi: Suspended IPL commissioner Lalit Modi will have to face the music if he is found guilty of corruption, said Sharad Pawar. The ICC president made it clear on Sunday that there was no question of protecting his one-time protege.         
	But he also clarified that though there has been a dent to IPLs image following the allegations of financial irregularities against Modi, the mega events overall position has not been damaged.         
	Pawar said the recent corruption scandal has tarnished the image of IPL to some extent and Modi was paying the price for his controversial style of functioning which had not gone down well with the BCCIs top brass.         
	Asked specifically if he would protect Modi in case he is found guilty of financial irregularities in running the IPL, Pawar said: No question of protecting anybody. Not only Modi, but anybody. If somebody has committed some mistake he will have to face the music.         
	Pawar, who took over as ICC president from Englishman David Morgan earlier this month, said Modi should be given credit for making IPL a global brand but his style of functioning was the problem.         
	IPL, the product has been a success in this country. It has established that India can also organise such things and there he (Modi) has taken a lot of pain  there are no two opinions on this. If somebody has contributed one has also to accept that contribution, Pawar told the media.         
	Pawar, who is also the union agriculture minister, added, also admitted that allegations of financial irregularities against Modi have sullied the image of IPL to some extent.         
	I dont think IPLs overall position will be damaged. But definitely in the mind of cricket-loving people within India and outside they have started thinking in a different way that there seems to be some wrong things happening, he said.         
	Pawar also refused to admit that the current controversy is scandal and said the BCCI will get to the bottom of it.         
	Pawar also termed media reports stating that either he or his family members own stakes in the companies whose bids for two new IPL teams failed early this year, as efforts to malign him.         
	That was a publicity campaign to malign me. Beyond that there is nothing, he asserted. (PTI)

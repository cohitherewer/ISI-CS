	 It will be a local cricket derby on Monday when defending champions Mohun Bagan face arch-rivals East Bengal in the final of the JC Mukherjee Trophy at the Eden.      
	With an ugly brawl marring last years encounter (in a semi-final of the CAB two-day league) between the two sides, the atmosphere is even further charged up this year.       
	It will also be a battle between two brothers as siblings Pranab Nandy and Palash Nandy are the coaches of Mohun Bagan and East Bengal respectively.      
	While East Bengal, captained by Ranadeb Bose, will be having the services of their full squad, the Debabrata Das-led Mohun Bagan are unlikely to get Eklakh Ahmed for selection as the left-arm seamer might be busy for an office match.       
	The Cricket Association of Bengal, meanwhile, informed that proper security has been arranged for the tie to ensure safety.                 
	Cricket: JC Mukherjee Trophy final  Mohun Bagan vs East Bengal, at the Eden, from 1pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Who is Ian Chappell, asks an infuriated Harbhajan
                                                                                                                       7                                        Who is Ian Chappell, asks an infuriated Harbhajan
    - Staying at the top can be tough but not impossible, says Dhoni           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh                                 
	Chittagong: A day-and-a-half after captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni questioned Ian Chappells logic in arguing that Team India wouldnt remain No.1 in Test cricket for long, senior pro Harbhajan Singh tore into the Australian legend, asking who is Ian Chappell?         
	Its after quite a while that the Sardar has got so garam.         
	Test matches are won by taking 20 wickets... Sure, the batsmen play their role, but the bowlers alone take wickets... So, what is he saying? Just who is Ian Chappell? Thats all I wish to say, Harbhajan, who has been playing for India from 1998, told The Telegraph at the Peninsula Hotel on Friday.         
	Clearly, the star off-spinner has reason to be infuriated. He has, after all, been a significant performer (343 wickets in Tests, 239 in ODIs) for over a decade.         
	The other day, Chappell made the point that India didnt have champion bowlers to keep the No.1 position for any length of time. Theyve got some good bowlers... Sure, theyve got a very good batting line-up, but the bowling is really not good enough to see them win consistently all around the world...         
	I dont see two champion bowlers... In fact, Im struggling to find one champion bowler in that line-up...         
	Dhoni had countered: It is not a fair statement. I agree that our bowlers are struggling now, but weve become No.1 because of our bowlers also, not only due to our batting.         
	Speaking exclusively, on Friday, Dhoni said: I cant understand why, once youve reached the summit, you cant stay there... Of course, it can be tough, but its not that you cant remain at the top...         
	Those words confirm that Dhoni is the positive sort.         
	Come Sunday and, for the first time, Team India will be starting a Test series ranked No.1. Indeed, its going to be a special moment when Dhoni goes for the toss with Shakib-al Hasan.         
	Well, yes, theres some excitement... Theres a sense of pride, but a Test match is a Test match, whether youre No.1 or No.10... You look to improve, try to get better, Dhoni observed.         
	Typical, perhaps, of somebody who is very particular about his feet staying on the ground.

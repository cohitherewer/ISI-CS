The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rajpal: Have to improve
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rajpal: Have to improve
                      
	New Delhi: The Indian team need to improve the short corner conversion rate and sort out their minor defensive lapses to produce a commendable performance in the Asian Games, feels skipper Rajpal Singh.         
	India finished second in the Commonwealth Games after losing 0-8 to Australia in the final of the event but Rajpal refused to blame any individual or any particular aspect of the game for conceding too many goals as hockey is a team sport.         
	You cannot blame only defence for failure. Hockey is a collective sport and everyone needs to chip-in, Rajpal said today on the sidelines of a promotional.         
	The team is in good shape and will look to present a commendable performance in China. Every team intends to win and we will take it as one game at a time. However, China and Japan will pose good competition, the Indian forward added.         
	Interestingly, India have not won a gold medal in the Asian Games since 1998.         
	Our main intention is to qualify for the London Olympics to be held in 2012. The team would look to reduce the errors. Also penalty corner conversion needs to be improved. We have been doing well in converting our short corners, but it needs to be further improved, he said.         
	Asked whether the team morale is down after an 8-0 drubbing at the hands of Australia in the finals of recently concluded CWG, Rajpal said, It was just an off day and we are not looking at that.         
	Asked if the Indian hockey team requires the services of a sports psychologist, the forward said, Nobody can do any magic in such a short span of time. Asian Games will be held in Guangzhou, China from November 12 to 27. (PTI)

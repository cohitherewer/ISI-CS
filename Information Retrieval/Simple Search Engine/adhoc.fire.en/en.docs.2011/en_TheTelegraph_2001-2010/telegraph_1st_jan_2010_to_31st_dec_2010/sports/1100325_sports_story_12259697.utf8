The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We showed character, says Warne
                                                                                                                       7                                      We showed character, says Warne
                      
	Mohali: The Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne said that his team showed a lot of character during their 31-run victory over the Kings XI Punjab in an Indian Premier League encounter Wednesday.         
	One of those days where everybody contributed when they had to. Sahun (Tait) bowled fantastically. (Manvinder) Bisla was smashing us all over the place, it was handy to get him out. We were a little bit sloppy in the field, but we showed a lot of character, said Warne.         
	His counterpart Kumar Sangakkara said: We got off to a flourish and then (Manvinder) Bisla also batted well. But despite getting a good start and a good foundation, we kept losing wickets. We should have won comfortably but we simply committed suicide in the middle overs.         
	Man of the Match Adam Voges of the Royals, who scored an unbeaten 24-ball 45, said: Im very happy that the guys played very well We got a platform today (Wednesday), and it gave me the opportunity to play with freedom.

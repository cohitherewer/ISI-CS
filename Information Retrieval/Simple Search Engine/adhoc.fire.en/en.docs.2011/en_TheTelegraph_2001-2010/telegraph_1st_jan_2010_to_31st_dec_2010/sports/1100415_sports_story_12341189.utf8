The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tollygunge toy with Md. Sp.
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tollygunge toy with Md. Sp.
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting should count themselves lucky that they are still considered an integral part of the famed Big Three of soccer in this part of the country.         
	The overall disintegration of the club was once again highlighted on Wednesday as they were humbled 0-2 by Tollygunge Agragami in a CFL Premier division match at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	The match, however, was played in a lively pace. Both the sides managed some early penetration though it finally culminated in weak finishing.         
	In the 33rd minute, Tollygunges Nuruddin Olawales weak goal-bound shot was cleared from the goalline by Sarfaraz Khan. Soon after, in the 40 th minute, Tollygunge skipper Sudip Das did well to fox a host of rival defenders but shot at the near post, though the far post would have been an easier and better option. The result - failure.         
	Tollygunge took the lead in the 58th minute when Mohammed Rafique connected a low cross from Shanku Guha.         
	They doubled the margin in the 65th minute.         
	Bijoy Das needlessly tripped Ashesh Das inside the box and referee Prabir Dhar promptly pointed at the spot. Nuruddin took the spotkick but his shot rebounded off the vertical. And this time, Nuruddin made no mistake.

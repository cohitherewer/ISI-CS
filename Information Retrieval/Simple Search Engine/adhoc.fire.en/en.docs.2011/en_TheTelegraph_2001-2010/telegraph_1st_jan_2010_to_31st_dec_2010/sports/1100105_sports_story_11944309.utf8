The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Delhi on the back foot

  Ranji Trophy Former India captain hits fifth double century; Nayar scores 156 
          
	Mumbai: Abhishek Nayars 156 coupled with a sedate 69 by Iqbal Abdulla to give holders Mumbai firm control of their Ranji Trophy semi-final match against long-time rivals Delhi on the second day Monday.         
	Resuming at their overnight 329 for four, the hosts boosted their first innings tally to a huge 500 and then reduced the visitors to 85 for three at stumps.         
	Delhi should have been four wickets down had not Mumbai captain Wasim Jaffer dropped Rajat Bhatia when the Delhi skipper was just one in a team score of 37 for three.         
	Bhatia (27 batting) remained unconquered along with opener Shikhar Dhawan (36 batting) when the days play was called off at the Brabourne Stadium.         
	Delhi looked down the barrel at close, trailing Mumbai by a whopping 415 runs with not many top-level batsmen left to do the tough job Tuesday.         
	Usman Malvi, Ajit Agarkar and Avishkar Salvi accounted for the wickets of opener Mayank Tehlan (5), Aditya Jain (11) and the experienced Mithun Manhas (5) respectively to reduce Delhi to 35 for three.         
	The left-handed Dhawan, who has struck six fours in his 78-ball unbeaten knock and Bhatia stemmed the rot with an unfinished stand of 50 runs.         
	Mumbais total was built mainly around Abhishek Nayars fine 156. Besides, Mumbai batsmen, including Nayar who batted freely last evening, decided Monday morning to wear down the Delhi bowlers and kept the visitors on the field for the first two sessions.         
	Agarkar, unbeaten on 57 at stumps Sunday, could add only six runs and then Ramesh Powar (16) was also prised out quite cheaply to give Delhi hopes before they were frustrated by left-hander Iqbal Abdulla who batted for more than three hours while making 69 before being out.         
	Abdulla, who faced 117 balls and struck eight fours, put on 80 runs with Nayar to take the score close to the 450 mark after the two came together when Mumbai were 367 for six at the fall of Powar, who was bowled by Vikash Mishra.         
	Neither Ishant Sharma, who got rid off Agarkar early in the morning, nor the other bowlers could make much impression on this seventh wicket duo before Nayar gave the charge to left-arm spinner Mishra and was caught at wide long on after lunch.         
	Delhi sent back Vinayak Samant cheaply but were then denied another wicket till the end of second session by Abdulla and Usman Malvi (20) who ensured the score neared 500 with a half-century stand.         
	Malvi was dismissed by Mishra who also accounted for the wicket of Abdulla to finish with four for 89. Sharma was the other impressive performer with three for 77 while Parwinder Awana (2/92) and Bhatia (1/53) also got among the wickets.         
	Delhi were a tired lot when their turn came to bat and the pressure of chasing the huge Mumbai total undid their top order batsmen.

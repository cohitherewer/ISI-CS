	Harare: Tillekaratne Dilshan led from the front with an unbeaten century as Sri Lanka lifted the ODI cricket tri-series title on Wednesday, halting Zimbabwes fairytale run in a lop-sided final.         
	Dilshan struck an unbeaten 108 off 102 balls and featured in an 160-run opening stand with Upul Tharanga (72) to script a facile nine-wicket victory that also avenged Sri Lankas eight-wicket defeat against the hosts on Monday.         
	Put into bat, Zimbabwe had earlier managed a below-par 199, courtesy Tatenda Taibus defiant 71, before folding in 49 overs at the Harare Sports Club.         
	The Lankans completed the modest chase with minimum fuss, cruising to 203 for one to complete a comprehensive win with 15.2 overs to spare.         
	Their chase got off to a flier with Dilshan wasting no time in imposing himself.         
	He made his intention clear when he sent the first ball he faced, from Chris Mpofu, for a four. The otherwise disciplined Zimbabwean attack failed to stem the regular flow of boundaries from Dilshans blade while Tharanga, too, helped himself to the occasional hit to the fence. He eventually ran himself out in the 26th over but by then, Sri Lanka had the match in the bag.         
	Earlier, Taibus 93-ball knock was the piece de resistance in an otherwise ordinary performance by the African minnows who came into the match after stunning wins over India and Sri Lanka in the round-robin stage.         
	The Zimbabweans started slowly and their pace of scoring didnt pick up at all.         
	The giant-killers, who beat India twice in the tournament, received an early blow when in-form opener Hamilton Masakadza departed in the fifth over after playing out 23 deliveries for a mere four runs.         
	Dilhara Fernando then dealt a rude jolt by removing batting mainstay Brendan Taylor (19) in the 10th over, leaving the home team at a precarious 29 for two.         
	Taibu rebuilt the innings but he just didnt get enough support at the other end.         
	The diminutive wicketkeeper-batsman struck four boundaries and ran hard between the wickets before eventually being dismissed by Dilhara (3/36), who was the pick of the Lankan bowlers.         
	Charles Coventry provided some late flashes with his 12-ball 18 but the Zimbabwean innings had been so sluggish that the slight acceleration did not add up to much.         
	This final match was South African umpire Rudi Koertzens last one day International.           (PTI)

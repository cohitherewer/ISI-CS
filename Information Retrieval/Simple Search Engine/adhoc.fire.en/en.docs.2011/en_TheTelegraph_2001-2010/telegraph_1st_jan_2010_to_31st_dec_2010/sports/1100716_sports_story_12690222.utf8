The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lalit Modi to stay away
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lalit Modi to stay away
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Bombay high court might have directed Lalit Modi to submit himself before the disciplinary committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), but the suspended IPL chairman would not be making his much-expected first appearance here on Friday when proceedings are initiated against him.         
	Modi is abroad and he would be represented by his authorised representative, his legal counsel Mehmood Abdi said on Thursday, soon after a two-member division bench dismissed the petition seeking the overturning of the suspension and all disciplinary charges against him.         
	Ratnakar Shetty, the BCCIs chief administrative officer, suggested a fresh date might be set if Modi chose to send an emissary.         
	If he (Modi) doesnt turn up tomorrow, then the disciplinary committee will probably look at fixing a fresh date (for Modis appearance), Shetty said.         
	Justices B.H. Marlapalle and Roshan Dalvi, while hearing Modis petition, had on Wednesday rejected his appeal for staying the disciplinary proceedings but reserved their verdict on his demand for an independent panel.         
	Modis lawyer, Viraf Tulzhapurkar, had argued that two of the committee members, Chirayu Amin and Arun Jaitley, were biased against his client and that the final decision of the committee was a foregone conclusion.         
	Jyotiraditya Scindia completes the three-member committee. Dismissing Modis claims, the bench said there was no need for it to intervene since he had already written to the BCCI demanding the removal of Amin and Jaitley with the Board saying that the disciplinary committee would look into the matter were he to present himself before them.         
	It would not be proper for the court to interfere at this stage. We are leaving the decision to these two persons as to whether they should withdraw from the panel on moral grounds, the judges said.         
	The disciplinary committee has limited powers. It is only required to inquire into the charges and submit its report to the BCCI. The Board is the final decision-making body.         
	The court also said that Modi could always challenge the final decision of the BCCI and question the composition of the committee once the verdict was out.         
	Shetty suggested it would be entirely up to the members of the disciplinary committee to recuse themselves from the inquiry.         
	This has nothing to do with the rules of the BCCI, he said.         
	He refused to read in the courts verdict a victory for BCCI.         
	We are not looking at it as a victory or defeat. We followed the proper procedures when referring the matter to the committee. Modi challenged it in the court, and the court has given its verdict.         
	But Abdi sought to put a positive spin on the court ruling.         
	The court has recorded the BCCIs word on recusal (of Amin and Jaitley). So they (BCCI) have to be serious about it now, he told reporters.

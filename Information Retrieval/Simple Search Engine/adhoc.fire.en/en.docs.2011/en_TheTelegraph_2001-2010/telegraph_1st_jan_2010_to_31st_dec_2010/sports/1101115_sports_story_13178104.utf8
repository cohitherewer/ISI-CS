            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                           
	Calcutta: For the second time in less than a year, Sachin Tendulkar made an exception for The Telegraph and gave an interview in the midst of a Test  occasion No.1 was when he spoke (from Kanpur) on the first anniversary of 26/11.         
	Sachin, who completes 21 years of international cricket on Monday, took some questions on Sunday evening, soon after returning to the team hotel in Hyderabad.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	His thoughts on being hours away from completing 21 years at the highest level         
	To be honest, I hadnt been thinking of November 15... Now that youve reminded me, well, some memories are bound to come back.         
	The 21-year journey         
	When one starts playing, one doesnt look at playing for X number of years... The years go by and I consider myself fortunate to have played for so long... Its not that I set myself five-year targets or so.         
	Those hes most grateful to         
	My immediate family, the uncle and aunt with whom I stayed for some years... My coach (Ramakant Achrekar)... Everybody, in fact, who supported me.         
	Memories of his Test debut (National Stadium in Karachi)         
	Very vague, except my walk to the wicket, to take strike for the first time in Test cricket... I didnt last for long (bowled by Waqar Younis, another debutant, for 15), but that nerves-filled walk is definitely etched in memory.         
	2010 having been a phenomenal year         
	Id say it has been an eventful one... The teams target (to become No.1 in Tests) got achieved last December itself, but a few personal milestones have been reached in 2010... Eventful would be the best way to describe the year.         
	Whether hes conscious of being just one short of 50 Test hundreds         
	How can it be otherwise when everybody is only talking about the 50th hundred... Wherever I go, thats the sole topic... I dont like it, but what to do? As I see it, theres more to cricket than 50 Test hundreds... As you know, I believe in destiny... Whatever is to happen, will.         
	The focus also being on the 2011 World Cup...         
	Its everybodys dream to be a member of a World Cup-winning team... Today, however, my focus is on the current series (against New Zealand)... Ill be focusing on the World Cup when were closer to the (February 19-April 2) tournament.         
	Message for youngsters         
	Be sincere... Be honest, with yourself and with others... Ive said this before, but its important to have a dream and to chase it... Challenge yourself, raise the bar.         
	Finally, on buddy Harbhajan Singh being in terrific form with the bat in the ongoing series         
	(Laughs) Yes, Bhajjis been making such an impact... Its good for the team and, sure, Im happy for him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We are stronger now: Strauss
                                                                                                                       7                                        We are stronger now: Strauss
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            England players celebrate their 121-run win over Pakistan in the fifth one-day International, in Southampton, on Wednesday. England won the series 3-2. (AFP)                           
	Andrew Strauss believes England have emerged stronger from a match-fixing scandal which has taken his team to some pretty unpleasant places over the past few days.         
	Englands victory sealed a sixth successive series win this summer in all forms of cricket but in reality meant so much more to a team that has been dragged into crickets biggest corruption crisis.         
	It has been a tough series and a long summer, said Strauss. We have been to some pretty unpleasant places in the last couple of days and we have had to show unity and togetherness. We were determined to go out there and end the series on a high. You could see how much it meant to us when the final wicket went down.         
	England thrashed Pakistan by 121 runs in the fifth and final one-dayer at the Rose Bowl for a 3-2 series win after Pakistan had fought back to 2-2 from 2-0 down. Eoin Morgan, Strausss Middlesex teammate, was named Man-of-the-Match for his unbeaten 107 in a total of 256 for six.         
	Strauss admitted the vision of Shahid Afridi and his Pakistan team celebrating a series win at the Rose Bowl gave England all the motivation they required to pull off one of a one-sided victory that ensures they travel to Australia next month with winning momentum behind them.         
	Motivation was not a problem and we were absolutely determined to win this game, said Strauss.         
	We have gained a hell of a lot out of what has gone on in last few weeks in terms of bringing us closer together and fighting our corner. That can only stand us in good stead for Australia.         
	Both sides have been put under a lot of stress and pressure and we dont want to be doing that. It is important ICC take a strong lead and dont take a breather now the series has finished.         
	Disappointed Pakistan one-day captain Shahid Afridi said: I was thinking about a happy ending but it hasnt happened. There were some controversies on this tour but my team was very united and I think this will give us some good results in the future.

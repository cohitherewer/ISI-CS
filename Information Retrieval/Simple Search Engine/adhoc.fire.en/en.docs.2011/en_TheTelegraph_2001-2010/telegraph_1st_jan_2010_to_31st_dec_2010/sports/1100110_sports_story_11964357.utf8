The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India look to ensure place in the final
                                                                                                                       7                                        India look to ensure place in the final

	Dhaka: Indias campaign is back on track after the win over Bangladesh, but they will have to address top-order batting woes and inconsistent bowling if they are to upstage a rampaging Sri Lanka here Sunday.         
	India will aim to book a place in the January 13 final, by beating the Lankans. Kumar Sangakkara amp; Co. have already qualified for the final after crushing Bangladesh by nine wickets Friday. The hosts are yet to open their account.         
	With dew playing an important role despite the early start, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said that a big total is a must if the team is forced to defend. The Indians could not defend successfully against Sri Lanka in the first match, after Sangakkara won the toss.         
	In the next game against Bangladesh, the opening pair of Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir did not fire and India were in trouble at 51 for three before Dhoni and Virat Kohli. India need a strong start from Sehwag and Gambhir in order to score big. Sehwag is yet to score a century in Bangladesh, and Sunday would be a good day to score the first.         
	But bowling is the most worrying factor by Dhonis own admission. Zaheer Khan, the No.1 pacer, has leaked runs in the two matches so far and the usually consistent Ashish Nehra has also been expensive, not to mention Sreesanth. Even Harbhajan Singh was off-colour in the last match, after picking up three wickets against Sri Lanka.         
	Dhoni has not minced words in asking his frontline bowlers to improve themselves.         
	Not a single frontline bowler was up to the mark. Only Yuvraj Singh bowled well. We cannot count Ravindra Jadeja as a frontline bowler, but he bowled well, he had said, after Indias five-wicket win over Bangladesh. But in spite of the problems, it is unlikely that Dhoni will change the XI which won against Bangladesh.         
	On the other hand, Sri Lanka, on a roll after winning three matches on the trot, have been been strengthened by the return of Mahela Jayawardene, who hit a century against Bangladesh just a day after reaching here. In-form Tillekaratne Dilshan is also likely to make it to the playing XI having almost recovered from the groin strain.         
	Thilan Samaraweera played a crucial knock against India, Upul Tharanga smashed a century against Bangladesh Friay and captain Kumar Sangakkara has also been in good touch. The form of the Sri Lankan top order will be a huge test for the struggling Indian bowlers.         
	Teams         
	India (likely): Gautam Gambhir, Virender Sehwag, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra, Sreesanth.         
	Sri Lanka (from): Kumar Sangakkara, Tillekaratne Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Upul Tharanga, Thilan Samaraweera, Thilina Kandamby, Lahiru Thirimanne, Thissara Perera, Malinga Bandara, Nuwan Kulasekera, Thilan Thushara, Suraj Randiv, Suranga Lakmal, Chanaka Welegedara, Mahela Udwatte, Dinesh Chandimal.         
	Match starts: 1.30pm (IST).           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Jayawardene, 2 others flown in
                                                                                                                       7                                      Jayawardene, 2 others flown in
                      
	Dhaka: Three players, including former captain Mahela Jayawardene, were flown in Wednesday to prop up a Sri Lankan side who are struggling to put 11 fit men together in the ongoing tri-series in Bangladesh.         
	Sri Lanka team manager Brendon Kuruppu said besides Jayawardene, who was part of the Sri Lankan team that played the ODI series in India last month, the other two players are uncapped wicketkeeper-batsman Lokuge Dinesh Chandimal and left-handed batsman Mahela Udawatte.         
	Kuruppu said Chamara Silva and Muthumudalige Pushpakumara, who were injured during Sri Lankas opening match against Bangladesh, would return home while in-form opener Tillekaratne Dilshan would stay back despite the groin strain he suffered during his match-winning knock of 104 against the hosts.         
	Jayawardene, Chandimal and Udawatte have arrived here, while Silva and Pushpakumara will return home.         
	We are hoping that Dilshan will be okay and will play a part in some point of time in the tournament, which is why we have kept him here, Kuruppu said.         
	Dilshan though is unlikely for our next game (against Bangladesh on Friday), he added.         
	The 20-year-old Chandimal is a promising right-handed wicketkeeper-batsman who was the vice-captain of the Sri Lankan team in the under-19 World Cup in Malaysia in 2008.         
	In August last year, he scored a century for Sri Lanka Development XI in a first class match against the visiting New Zealand side.         
	Twenty three-year-old Udawatte, on the other hand, has played nine ODIs, the last against Zimbabwe in Harare in 2008.         
	Sri Lanka have won both their first two matches in the tri-series against Bangladesh and India respectively.

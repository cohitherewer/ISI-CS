            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            A lot will depend on Subrata Paul                           
	New Delhi: Bob Houghtons India will take on Asian Cup champions Iraq in an international friendly at the Al Shaab Stadium in Sharjah on Thursday.         
	This is going to be one of the toughest challenges for India in recent years, said an official of the All India Football Federation (AIFF). Iraq are at full strength and the same team will participate in the Gulf Cup of Nations in Aden later this month.         
	Iraq are enjoying a good run at the moment and won four out of last five games they played, the last being a 2-1 win over Qatar last month.         
	Currently ranked 94 in the world, Iraq have signed Wolfgang Sidka as their chief coach. The German coach has rich experience in Asia having coached clubs like Al Gharafa and Al-Arabi. He has also been the national coach of Bahrain in the past.         
	India, on the other hand, are a depleted side. While captain Bhaichung Bhutia has once again been ruled out, other striker Sunil Chetri remains a doubtful starter. Apart from these two, Mahesh Gawli, Samir Naik, NP Pradeep and Arindram Bhattacharya are also recuperating from injuries.         
	Bhaichung, who has been suffering from thyroid problems for the past few months, is yet to regain full fitness.         
	Bhutia did not play in the three international friendlies in Pune last month after suffering an injury against Namibia in New Delhi on September 15.         
	Chetri, who struck a hattrick against Vietnam in Pune recently, injured his ankle during a training session in Dubai, team sources said. Chetri immediately underwent MRI but it did not reveal any major injury.         
	Assistant coach Savio Medeira, however, said a final decision on Chetri would be taken on the day of the match. As the Asia Cup is fast approaching, we dont want to take any risk, Medeira said.         
	We will play two more matches against Kuwait (November 14) and United Arab Emirates (November 18) in the next one week. Unless he is fully fit, Chetri wont be fielded, Houghtons deputy said.         
	In the absence of Chhetri, Sushil Kumar Singh will pair up with Abhishek Yadav upfront, while Rakesh Masih will replace injured Pradeep.         
	A lot will however, depend on goalkeeper Subrata Paul, who has displayed tremendous form in recent months. He has been a pillar of strength and can stall the rampaging Iraq players with his positioning and anticipation.         
	Against Namibia in September, Paul brought off some incredible saves to help India register a 2-0 triumph over the strong African side. It remains to be seen if he can replicate that form for the good of Indian football.

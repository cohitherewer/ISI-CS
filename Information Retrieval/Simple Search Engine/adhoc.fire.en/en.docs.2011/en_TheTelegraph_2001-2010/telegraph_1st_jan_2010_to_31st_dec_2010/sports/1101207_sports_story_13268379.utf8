The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | KKR unlikely to retain players
                                                                                                                             KKR unlikely to retain players
  - City-based franchise is mulling to start afresh in the upcoming auction       A STAFF REPORTER                                        Sourav Ganguly        
	Calcutta: Its not official, but it appears that the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are looking to start afresh and, if that does happen, then none of the players are going to be retained from the Indian Premier Leagues (IPL) fourth edition onwards.         
	That, in turn, means that players like Sourav Ganguly, Chris Gayle, Brendon McCullum, Shane Bond and David Hussey would not be seen in the Knights uniform from the next year.         
	With the players auction coming up in January 8 and 9 next year, the talks of KKR not retaining their players have been doing the rounds.         
	The decision to drop someone like Sourav, an icon player, is going to be a tricky one for the Calcutta-based franchise. Given the popularity that the former India captain commands in this part of the country, it would be a crucial decision for the KKR management.         
	The Knight Riders have a strong fan base in and around Calcutta and theres no doubt that most of that comprises Souravs die-hard fans.         
	However, one has to remember that KKR have performed very poorly in the last three editions of the IPL. In the first edition of the T20 event, the Sourav Ganguly-led side finished sixth as they managed six wins out of 14 matches.         
	The next year, when the captains cap was taken away from Sourav, thanks to John Buchanan, KKR slumped lower as they finished last with just three victories in the tournament.         
	Sourav returned as the leader in the following year, but the team couldnt improve much, ending sixth again.         
	Another important fact regarding the player retention is that if a franchise decides not to retain their players, then they will be able to spend the entire amount allotted to a franchise in the players auction. The Board of Control for cricket in India (BCCI), on November 28, had specified the base price of the respective players for the auction.         
	The Board had split the Indian players eligible for auction into five separate categories. While the lowest base price for the inaugural IPL was Rs 45,73,000, the minimum for IPL IV will be Rs 23 lakh.

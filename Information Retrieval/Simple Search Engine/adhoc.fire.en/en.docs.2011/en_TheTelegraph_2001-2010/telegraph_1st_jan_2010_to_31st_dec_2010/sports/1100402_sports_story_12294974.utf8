The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shiv Kapur in joint lead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Shiv Kapur in joint lead
                      
	New Delhi: Shiv Kapur wielded a red-hot putter en route to a sizzling nine-under 63 to share the third round lead with Swede rookie Richard Karlberg in the SAIL Open golf tournament here Thursday.         
	Kapur, who needed only 22 putts, posted a flawless round highlighted by an eagle and seven birdies to join Karlberg, who carded a 68, at the top with a three-day total of 14-under 202 at the Delhi Golf Club.         
	Shamim Khan of India shot a 69 for third place, three back, while Jyoti Randhawa is a further stroke behind following a 68 in the $300,000 Asian Tour event.         
	SSP Chowrasia (69), who won his first Asian Tour title on this venue in 2008, is tied fifth with Gaganjeet Bhullar (68) on 208 as the home stars dominated the leaderboard.Shiv Kapur, who grew up playing at the DGC, turned in 29, thanks to five birdies in his opening six holes.         
	The 2005 Asian Tour Rookie of the Year, who finished second in the South African Open in December, sweetened his round with an eagle on the eighth hole after his three iron approach landed 10 feet from the pin.         
	I have been in decent form. Most parts of my game have been good but I havent had four good rounds. I had good starts but havent capitalised on that, said Kapur, who is searching for his second Asian Tour victory following the 2005 Volvo Masters of Asia.         
	I dont really play 18 holes here very often. I usually come out and play about five holes on the front nine and thats one reason why I did so well, added the Indian, who was one shot shy of his best score on the course.

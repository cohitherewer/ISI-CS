	New Delhi: After hockey and weightlifting, wrestling was the latest sport to be embroiled with allegations of sexual harassment. Woman wrestler Sonika Kaliraman levelled shocking charges against the selection committee and coaching staff.         
	Daughter of legendary wrestler Master Chandgi Ram and winner of 16 national titles, Sonika moved Delhi high court over selection in Commonwealth Games. She was also quoted saying that she had been the victim of sexual advances from the corrupt federation officials.         
	However, other women wrestlers turned against Sonika, describing her allegations as baseless and malicious.         
	This was unlike the case that shook the hockey fraternity, wherein the teammates backed Ranjitha Devi, who alleged sexual harassment against the national coach, M.K. Kaushik.         
	Women wrestlers in the national camp in Patiala, issued a statement, on Monday, saying, We, the women wrestlers, undergoing training in the coaching camp at NIS, Patiala, strongly condemn the false, baseless and malicious statements being made by Sonika Kaliraman against the Wrestling Federation India (WFI), the selection committee and the coaching staff.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bob Houghton                           
	New Delhi: National coach Bob Houghton once against had his way when he forced All India Football Federation (AIFF) to cancel an international friendly against Qatar at Doha on Friday.         
	According to AIFF sources, the British coach did not want to play against the 2006 Asian Games champions on their home ground and persuaded the federation officials to call off the tie.         
	Houghton felt that playing a strong team like Qatar in front of their home crowd would not be a wise decision, an AIFF official said. Qatar was believed to be taking the match against India as a celebration tie for being allotted the 2022 World Cup.         
	The Indian team management felt that the host team, had India played the match, would have gone for a big victory margin. And it would have done no good to the Indian morale on the eve of the Asian Cup.         
	Houghton said he was ready to play the match at Dubai, a neutral venue.         
	The cancellation of the tie, however, left the AIFF red faced as Qatar had already made all arrangements and was apparently upset after India refused to play at the last moment.         
	AIFF is certainly facing embarrassment for calling off the tie, said a federation official. The AFC president Mohammed bin Hammam, who is from Qatar, has been helping India in many ways in preparing for the Asian Cup. The cancellation has done no good to Indian prestige at the international level, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Anthony Pereira is the latest to join the list of injured players and the Goan has been ruled out for the Asian Cup. Pereira has a knee ligament tear.         
	The nippy player, who can play on both left and right wing, will return to his hometown Goa, on Friday.         
	Officials of Pereiras club, Dempo, said that the injury is serious and he is also likely to miss I-League matches till January.         
	 quot;It is a serious injury and we dont know how long it will take to recover.

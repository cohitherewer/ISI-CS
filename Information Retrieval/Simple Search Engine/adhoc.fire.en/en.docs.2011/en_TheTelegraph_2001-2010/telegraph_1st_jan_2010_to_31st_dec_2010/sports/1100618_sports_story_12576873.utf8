The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Slovenian test for US
                                                                                                                       7                                        Slovenian test for US
          
	Irene: The United States will be favourites to beat Slovenia on Friday and believe they can handle the pressure at Ellis Park.         
	A 1-1 draw with England was a creditable opening result for Bob Bradleys team in Group C but will be forgotten if they slip up against a Slovenia side who beat Algeria in their opener. Going into a game as possible favourites would be different for us, especially in this World Cup, and that does pose a challenge to know that youre under pressure to get three points, or get a good result, said defender Jay DeMerit.         
	Bradley is expected to stick with the same starting line-up as that which featured against England with goalkeeper Tim Howard having recovered from his bruised ribs.         
	With Slovenia likely to play a patient game and wait to break on the counter-attack, the match is likely to be, as Bradley himself noted, something of a chess match.         
	Were comfortable no matter what. Were going to go out and play hard, said Clint Dempsey, whose equaliser earned a point against England thanks to a howler by keeper Robert Green.

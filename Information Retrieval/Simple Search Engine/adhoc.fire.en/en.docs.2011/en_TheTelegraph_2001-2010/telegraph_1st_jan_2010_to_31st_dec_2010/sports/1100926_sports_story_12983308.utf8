The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Alonso claims pole
                                                                                                                       7                                      Alonso claims pole
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Fernando Alonso has made it back-to-back poles after clinching top spot on the grid for Sundays Singapore Grand Prix. Ferrari went into the Italian Grand Prix a fortnight ago without a pole for 29 races, but have suddenly come alive in qualifying with Alonso outgunning Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel, who will start second, by 0.067 seconds.         
	The second row of the grid at the Marina Bay street circuit will be an all-British, all-McLaren affair, with Lewis Hamilton edging out team mate Jenson Button for third place.         
	Crucially for those four drivers they are all ahead of championship leader Mark Webber in his Red Bull as the top five in the title fight are the top five on the grid for the race. Behind Webber will be Williams Rubens Barrichello in a seasons high of sixth, followed by Mercedes duo Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher in seventh and ninth.         
	The German pair sandwich Renaults Robert Kubica in eighth, with Saubers Kamui Kobayashi completing the top 10.         
	Force India will be bitterly disappointed with their performance as Adrian Sutil and Vitantonio Liuzzi will be 15th and 16th.         
	After the initial 20-minute Q1, as has predominantly been the way this season, Lotus, Virgin and Hispania Racings drivers occupied six of the bottom seven places, with the other spot going to one of the big names.         
	Felipe Massa, who started on pole in the inaugural Singapore race in 2008, will be at the back of the grid for this years event due to an apparent issue with the electronic management of the gearbox.         
	The Brazilians Ferrari ground to a halt at turn eight, bringing out the red flags with 10 minutes and 35 seconds of the session remaining.         
	Massa had yet to set a time, so he now faces a fight to claim at least a point from 24th, whilst more significantly Alonso has lost his wingman, with Ferrari now favouring the Spaniard.

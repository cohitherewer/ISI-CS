	Calcutta: As the final whistle blew, East Bengal fans rushed on to the ground and could not stop congratulating coach Trevor Morgan and his wards.         
	After all, East Bengal defeated Railway FC 3-0 to win their 11th consecutive Calcutta Football League, Premier Division match, on their home ground, Monday afternoon.         
	For the Federation Cup winners, this victory helped consolidate their position on top of the standings with 33 points.         
	Tolgay Ozebe started it all in the third minute after receiving a long pass from Harmanjot Singh Khabra.         
	Though it seemed to the spectators that East Bengals first goal came via an own goal scored by Railway FCs Avijit Dutta, the referee, Sunanda Bose, awarded it to Ozebe because he thought the ball had touched the Australians foot before crossing the goalline.         
	The second half witnessed Man of the Match Penn Orji and youngster Budiram Tudu score for the red and gold brigade.         
	In the 48th minute, Avijit again helped in scoring East Bengals second goal. The Railway defender helped set up the ball beautifully for Orji to score. The Nigerian did not waste the opportunity, striking with a powerful right footer.         
	Youngster Tudu made up for missing a scoring opportunity in the 58th minute when, six minutes later, he slotted the ball home after receiving it from Ozebe.             
	There was a chance for the red and gold brigade to go up by another goal but substitute Bikash Narjinarys attempt was denied by the referee.         
	However, Railway FC did manage to impress in certain spurts.         
	In the 33rd minute, Ravinder Singh tried to score East Bengals second goal from the centre but Gour Sankar Dutta managed a spectacular goalline save.         
	In the first half, we missed a lot of chances, said coach Morgan. However, we played better in the second. In fact, the boys too enjoyed the second half more. Our choice of passes in the first half were not that good.         
	Now, after winning the Federation Cup and 11 CFL matches in a row, we need to take our game up a few notches in the Durand Cup. Were looking forward to the challenge in Delhi, he added.

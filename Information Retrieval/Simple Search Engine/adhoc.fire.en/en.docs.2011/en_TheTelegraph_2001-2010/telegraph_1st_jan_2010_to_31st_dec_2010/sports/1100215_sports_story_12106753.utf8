  - Sreevats Goswami sparkles with his second century on the trot       A STAFF REPORTER            Sreevats Goswami                                 
	Calcutta: Sreevats Goswamis 133 off 114 balls along with Abhishek Jhunjhunwalas unbeaten 83 and Sourav Gangulys 64 helped Bengal register a convincing seven wicket victory over Assam in the East Zone one-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy, in Cuttack, on Sunday.         
	Batting first, Assam rode Dheeraj Jadhavs 148 and Parvez Azizs 83 to reach 299 in their 50 overs. Chasing, Bengal took 42.3 overs to reach the target. This was Sreevatss second century of the tournament after the one against Jharkhand in the last match.         
	Bengal were off to a disastrous start, losing opener Subhomoy Das off only the third ball of the innings.         
	Sreevats later said it was difficult to pick any one hundred for special mention. Batting with dadi was a pleasure. He guided me perfectly. The main idea was to utilise the Powerplays That did the trick for us, he explained.         
	Before the start, Match Referee Sanjay Raul summoned Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla and assistant coach Gautam Shome (Jr) and cautioned them for their comments in the media over the Manoj Tiwary incident.         
	The Orissa Cricket Association secretary has written to the BCCI on the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kings XI face a tall order vs MI
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kings XI face a tall order vs MI
                      
	Mohali: With only pride to play for from here on, the bruised and battered Kings XI Punjab would be banking on home advantage when they take on table-toppers the Mumbai Indians in an Indian Premier League match here Friday.         
	With no hopes of making the semi-finals, the outcome of the tie is inconsequential for the Kumar Sangakkara-led side, who have managed just two victories from 10 outings, but Sachin Tendulkars men would like to have another win under their belt to stamp their authority at the top.         
	The Mumbai Indians are currently at the top with 14 points, having won seven of their nine games and are virtually assured of a semi-final berth. Their only reversals came against the Royal Challengers Bangalore and the Chennai Super Kings.         
	With evening temperatures at Mohali settling around 18-20 degree Celsius these days and humidity levels quite low, Friday should provide perfect batting conditions at the PCA stadium.         
	Tendulkar is the second highest run-scorer in the tournament having made 394 runs from nine matches, and is believed to be fit for Fridays match. He had suffered from dehydration in the last match against the Chennai Super Kings.         
	He is a champion player. We missed him when he had to take a break the other day (due to dehydration). He is in such terrific formBy the grace of God, the team as a whole is playing good cricket and hope our good run continues, Mumbai Indians Harbhajan Singh said after the teams arrival here.         
	On the other hand, the Kings XI have failed to click as a unit and have failed to rise to the occasion. Having played 10 matches, the team has registered only one convincing win against the Kolkata Knight Riders.

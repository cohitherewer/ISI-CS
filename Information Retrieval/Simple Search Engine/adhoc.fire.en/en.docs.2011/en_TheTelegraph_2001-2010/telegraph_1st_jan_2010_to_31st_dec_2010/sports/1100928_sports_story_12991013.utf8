	New Delhi: Complaints about leaking roofs, stinking toilets and dirty rooms finally took a backseat on Monday when the Commonwealth Games Village witnessed a turnaround in perceptions, with the athletes and officials praising the facilities for the first time.         
	According to Organising Committee (OC) sources, around 550 athletes and officials arrived on Monday. While the largest contingent was from South Africa, with 113 athletes and officials, they were followed by Scotland (77), England (61), Australia (59) and Canada (30).         
	Officials and athletes from New Zealand, Wales, Namibia, Jamaica, Botswana, Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Kiribati and others have also arrived and have checked into the Games Village, the OC sources added.         
	The rooms are the best ever, provided in any other Commonwealth Games. The food is also great.         
	The international zone is a great place, said Nigerian chef de mission Elias Usman Gora, even as he pointed to the need for better co-ordination in the respect of security for the Games.         
	While several teams praised the arrangements at the Village, the OC was in for a pleasant surprise when South Africa high commissioner Harris Mbulelo Sithembile Majeke said he was hopeful of witnessing a memorable Games in Delhi.         
	In a remarkable U-turn, Majeke, who created a stir on Sunday, saying that a snake had been found in an apartment allotted to his countrys athletes, said: With only five days to go before the Commonwealth Games begin, we remain optimistic that India will deliver memorable Games.         
	The first batch from Scotland, who had initially delayed their arrival, moved into the Village and they looked pleased with the facilities. We are really happy with all the facilities. We are having a good time here.         
	We went to the archery venue and we found lush green field. It was really nice. The facility is up there with some of the best fields I have seen at the World championships, Scottish archer Claudine Jennings said.         
	I am not concerned at all, because once people get here they will want to be a part of the Commonwealth Games experience, Australian chef de mission Steve Moneghetti said.         
	[Agencies add from Islamabad: Pakistan complained about the filthy state of the accommodation at the Games village and has given organisers a 24-hour deadline to improve conditions or its athletes will instead stay at a hotel.         
	The rooms at the village were shown to Pakistans three-member delegation on Monday, and Pakistan Olympic Association chief Arif Hasan said theyre not fit enough to live in.]         
	Meanwhile, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit toured the Village in a golf cart to inspect the progress of the cleaning up operation.

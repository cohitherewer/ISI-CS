The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mahindra held by Mumbai FC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mahindra held by Mumbai FC

	Mumbai: Title contenders Mahindra United dropped crucial points after a spirited Mumbai FC Wednesday held them to a goalless draw in the I-League.         
	Despite missing the services of key forward Abhishek Nayar and Evans Quao at the back, Khalid Jamils team did well to thwart Mahindra who were keen to build on their one point lead over Dempo in the standings.         
	We were missing Abhishek. Without him, we didnt have that final punch, Jamil said.         
	Three points would have been a big boost for Mumbai FC as well since they were seeking to get away from the relegation zone. They are now placed 10th with 21 points but East Bengal, Salgaocar and Lajong FC, all with the same number of points, have played one game less.         
	Similarly, Dempo could overtake Mahindra at the top when they meet a beleaguered East Bengal in an away game on Thursday. But coach David Booth was less concerned.         
	No team is going to win seven games on the trot. So I am okay we got one point today. I somewhat expected this result, he said.         
	Mumbai FC did well to soak up the pressure in the first half with Kamaljeet Kumar and Bernard Achaw manning the defence.         
	Muritala Ali, the leagues joint top goal-scorer with 15 strikes, entered the Mumbai FC box in the 33rd minute. Having outmuscled Kamaljeet, Ali had only Nidhinlal AC to beat but fired straight towards the goalkeeper.         
	Meanwhile, in Margao, Sporting Clube de Goa kept alive their hopes of avoiding relegation after beating JCT by a solitary goal to notch up their third win in the I-League.

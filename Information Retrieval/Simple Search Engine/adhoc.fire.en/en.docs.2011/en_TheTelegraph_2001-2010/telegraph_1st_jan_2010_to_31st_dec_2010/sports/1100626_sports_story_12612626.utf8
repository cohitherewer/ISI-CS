The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We will have the edge, says Lahm
                                                                                                                       7                                      We will have the edge, says Lahm
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                       
	Germany captain Philipp Lahm believes his team will be far more confident than England if their World Cup last 16 clash is to be decided by penalties.         
	The sides look evenly matched, which presents the possibility of another penalty shoot-out following on from the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup and Euro 96.         
	Germany won both of those encounters to knock England out, and Lahm is confident his team would have the fortitude to step up again if the game goes the full distance.         
	Maybe it will go to penalties  that could suit us. I think we are mentally good, we will be prepared for it. We practice penalties sometimes, not every player, but sometimes, said Lahm.         
	I hope the English wont be so confident. There is a big history (between the teams), they are always big games, interesting games. We will see, we are ready to fight. Then we will see who is in the next round.         
	Joachim Loew identified Wayne Rooney as Englands biggest threat despite his lacklustre form at the tournament so far and Lahm agrees he is a man to keep a close eye on.         
	Asked if the Manchester United man was the biggest threat to Germany, Lahm said: Yes, really, hes a good striker, he has scored many goals this year. Hes a big player, and big players score goals in big matches.

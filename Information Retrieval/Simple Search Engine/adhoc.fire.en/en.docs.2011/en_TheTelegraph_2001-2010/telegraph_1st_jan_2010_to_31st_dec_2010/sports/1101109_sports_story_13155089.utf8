The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxman, Bhajji save the Test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Laxman, Bhajji save the Test
            BIVABASU KUMAR                      
	Ahmedabad: A lot of my teammates keep saying that I am capable of getting a Test hundred. But, so far, I have always disappointed them. Hopefully, Ill get it next time. These were Harbhajan Singhs words after his breezy 69 last Friday.         
	It was the second day of the Test match, but Harbhajan seemed to have predicted his destiny already. On the fifth day at Motera, the Turbanator did the inevitable  romped to his maiden Test hundred and prevented an upset against a depleted New Zealand squad.         
	Indias valiant resistance saw them accumulate 266 invaluable runs in their second innings. Chasing an improbable 294 for victory, the visitors were 22 for one at the close of the fifth and final days play.         
	Harbhajans moment arrived roughly 22 minutes before tea. Daniel Vettori sent back VVS Laxman (91) and Zaheer Khan (0) in consecutive deliveries. Pragyan Ojha (9 not out) somehow negotiated Chris Martin.         
	Harbhajan looked restless, and even before Vettori could land another sucker punch, the offie (115) smote him for a six to bring up his maiden Test hundred.         
	In a cute celebration that followed, Harbhajan removed his helmet and crouched like Sachin Tendulkar  his mentor, friend, guide and, idol.         
	The Little Master clapped in acknowledgement, and, Bhajjis actions revealed how much the batting maestro has influenced Harbhajan as a cricketer.         
	In a wider reference, Harbhajans achievement, on Monday, was not only about an individual record. In many ways it was an attribute of the No.1 Test side, fuelled by ambition and seeking to be defined by success.         
	After Chris Martins five-wicket haul on Sunday, India were in the pits and were probably staring at defeat. But the hosts defied the odds to force the visitors for a draw.         
	A lead of 110 runs was insufficient against the visiting Black Caps squad.         
	Laxman was the last distinguished batsman at the crease and the situation demanded Harbhajan to stay as long as possible. But call it a farce or what you may, the roles changed quickly. Bhajji started playing his shots and India scored 70 runs in the first session.         
	Martin failed to replicate his razor-sharp bowling and Harbhajan was in no mood to give the pacer any lee way. He stonewalled anything served up and threw his bat at anything short of length.         
	Harbhajan deployed every manifestation of the sweep shot. He used the paddle sweep, the reverse sweep and the slog sweep against spinners, while Martin was hoicked ruthlessly over his head at the slightest opportunity.         
	A battle between a tailender and a fast bowler has rarely been so one-sided like the one on Monday. Harbhajan often walked down to Martin and slapped him down the track.         
	But he ensured never to hit a half-hearted shot. He brought up his 50 with the help of two consecutive fours in Martins fifth over.         
	Laxman tried to calm Harbhajan down, but there was no stopping Bhajji. New Zealand showed first sign of being done in when an edge of Harbhajan fell short of Ross Taylor at first slip.         
	Martin thought the ball had carried, and his shoulders drooped in disappointment.         
	Laxman, on the other hand, piled on the runs silently. He played another stoical knock after his match-saving innings in Mohali. A rather dubious decision debarred him of his 17th Test hundred, but his163-run partnership with Harbhajan steered India out of crisis.         
	Opponent teams often succumb to the Laxman conundrum. Ricky Ponting accepted that in the Aussies last tour of India, and Daniel Vettori corroborated it on Monday when he said: Laxman did what he always does, he scores runs.         
	Harbhajan refused to take credit for the days dramatic turnaround, and thanked Laxman for his support. I may have scored my first Test hundred, but he is the real saviour. Because of him, I think, I got my first century, Harbhajan said.

	New Delhi: Australian swimmers stole the limelight on the opening day of the Commonwealth Games when they claimed three of the five medals up for grabs at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee pool. The golds for Kylie Palmer in the 200m freestyle, Alicia Coutts in the 200m medley and for the mens 4x100m freestyle relay team put Australia firmly in charge on Day One.         
	Their mens gymnastics team later added another gold medal in the team competition to leave Australia top of the medals table, a position they have occupied after 10 of the previous 18 Games.         
	Ryan Napoleon came so close to making it five golds out of eight for Australia on day one but lost by 0.11 seconds to Canadas Ryan Cochrane in the mens 400 freestyle.         
	Ryan is a great swimmer and he just got me in the end, said Napoleon, whose preparation for the Games was disrupted after an ultimately overturned ban for taking a banned substance.         
	The first gold of the Commonwealth Games, however, went to Nigerian schoolgirl weightlifter Augustina Nwakolo, who pipped home team favourite Soniya Chanu.         
	It was a dream come true for me, said the Nigerian girl with a shy smile.         
	I wanted to win the gold and that I could win it by beating a reputed Indian competitor is a huge bonus.         
	Malyasias Hamizan Amirul won the final gold of the day in the mens in the mens 56kg weightlifting with Indians again winning silver and bronze.         
	Englands double Olympic champion Rebecca Adlington hit out at the organisers for the crazy scheduling of swimming events after managing to win only a bronze medal in the womens 200m freestyle.         
	It was all crazy. Its nothing like Ive ever done before. We had to get up before 4am to leave the Village in time, Adlington said.         
	On her performance Adlington said, When I finished I looked up and saw that I finished third. If I didnt I would have been embarrassed, Adlington, who is looking to win four medals here, said.

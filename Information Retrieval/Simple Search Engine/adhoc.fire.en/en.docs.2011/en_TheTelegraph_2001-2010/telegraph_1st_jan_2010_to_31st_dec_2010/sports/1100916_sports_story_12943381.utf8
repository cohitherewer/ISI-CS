The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies warned of terror at CWG
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies warned of terror at CWG
                      
	Melbourne: Australian track and field athletes are having a second thought about participating in next months Commonwealth Games after receiving an e-mail from the national federation, warning them of a high risk of terrorist attack at the mega-event in Delhi.         
	There is a high risk of terrorist attack in New Delhi. Since 2000, there have been at least 14 major terrorist attacks in New Delhi on locations such as markets, train stations and other public places, Athletics Australia stated in the mail.         
	These attacks have caused hundreds of deaths and injuries. Australians in New Delhi should be aware that the Commonwealth Games will be held in a security environment where there is a high risk of terrorism.         
	We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in India at this time because of the high risk of terrorist activity by militant groups, an Australian daily quoted the mail.         
	This development came to light just two days after Commonwealth Games Association chief Perry Crosswhites statement that they were not thinking about skipping the October 3-14 event.         
	We are still planning to go and we have been told there is an acceptable level of risk, Crosswhite had told a television channel.         
	His comment, however, could not satisfy the CWG-bound athletes.         
	If thats the case, then what is acceptable? Its definitely weighing on my mind, an anonymous athlete was quoted as saying by a daily.         
	Its quite scary. This is my fifth Games and Ive never had emails like this before, said relay runner Tamsyn Lewis.           (PTI)

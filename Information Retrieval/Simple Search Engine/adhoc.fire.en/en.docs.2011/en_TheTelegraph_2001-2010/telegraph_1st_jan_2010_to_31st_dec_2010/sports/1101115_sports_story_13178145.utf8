The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Proteas in control
                                                                                                                       7                                        Proteas in control
                  Hashim Amla in action on the third day of the first Test, against Pakistan, in Dubai, on Sunday                     
	Dubai: South Africas Morne Morkel and Johan Botha ran through Pakistans brittle line-up to bowl them out for 248 on the third day of the first Test at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, on Sunday. The Proteas were 139 for two in their second innings after taking a first-innings lead of 132.         
	Morkel polished off the tail to end with five wickets after Bothas three started the slide.         
	At stumps, Hashim Amla on 44 and Jacques Kallis on 32 were at the crease.         
	Earlier, resuming at 144 for two, Azhar Ali (56) and Younis Khan (35) took their third-wicket partnership to 65 runs but once Younis left, others followed in playing rash shots. Younis departed playing a shot to midwicket where AB de Villiers took a brilliant catch.         
	Stand-in captain Misbah-ul-Haq failed to keep a ball down and was caught by Hashim Amla at short leg. Umar Akmal, who only got a chance to play because captain Mohammed Yousuf sustained a groin injury, also did not show the inclination to stay at the wicket. He came down the wicket but managed to get a thick edge that carried to Dale Steyn at point.

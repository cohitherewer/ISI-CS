                                                                                                                       7                                      Kirsten   enjoys a day away from Eden
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Everyone expected Gary Kirsten to land up at the Eden some time on Thursday. However, the mediapersons waited for close to six hours, but there was no sign of Kirsten at the venue.         
	The India coach decided to stay away from the hullabaloo of Eden Gardens and spend time with his wife and little sons. It was a day he went shopping with his wife at a city mall, had a quiet lunch before he was again confined to his hotel room.         
	Gary had clearly told us that he doesnt want to be disturbed today. He also said that if he needs a car, he will arrange it on his own. Therefore, we didnt get back to him throughout the day, one of the local managers informed.         
	Now, about the Eden Gardens pitch. Although there is a lot of grass on the strip where the match will be played, curator Prabir Mukherjee assured that it will be mowed down in due course of time.         
	Also the manner in which the groundsmen were seen watering the pitch, for sure it wouldnt be a rank turner even if the team management wants one.         
	Dont get misled by the grass. In the next couple of days, we will mow it down. Even on the day of the match, we will mow down the grass. I am expecting there will be good carry. The reason for keeping the grass on the wicket for so long and watering it is because I wanted the surface to have a hard bind, Mukherjee said after an evening round of inspection.         
	CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya also stood by his curator, stating its not possible to prepare a turning track overnight. I dont know if anyone from the board has called up with some instruction. Its not possible for someone to change the character of a pitch overnight, Dalmiya said.         
	The teams, meanwhile, arrived on Thursday evening. While the likes of skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, S. Badrinath, Murali Vijay, Ishant Sharma, Pragyan Ojha and Amit Mishra arrived early in the evening, Dinesh Karthik arrived from Chennai later. Late at night, Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag, along with new entrant Suresh Raina, arrived from Delhi.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth will arrive from Mumbai on Friday morning.         
	With the stars touching down, the security was at its stifling best. The number of policemen in uniform and plainclothes deputed in and around the team hotel was unimaginable.         
	But that didnt deter the curious onlookers from catching a glimpse of their favourite stars. A burqa-clad lady in the South African contingent was the topic of discussion. Who is she? asked someone. Well, she was none other than South African batsman Hashim Amlas wife.         
	One can only hope that CAB bosses will be have a smile on their faces once the Indian team arrives for practice session on Friday afternoon.         
	The fans curiosity, however, did not lift the ticket sales. Season tickets worth only Rs 1.80 lakh were sold on the day and CAB officials are hoping that sales will pick up once the real action begins.

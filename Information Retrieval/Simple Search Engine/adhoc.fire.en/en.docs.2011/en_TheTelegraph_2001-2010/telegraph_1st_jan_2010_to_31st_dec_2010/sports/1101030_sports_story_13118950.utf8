The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Waugh warns the Aussies
                                                                                                                       7                                      Waugh warns the Aussies
                      
	Sydney: Former Test captain Steve Waugh Friday warned Australias under-performing senior players that they could not count on experience alone to keep their places in the Ashes team to play England next month.         
	Ricky Pontings Australians are feeling the heat, after a 2-0 Test series defeat in India this month left them languishing at five on the world rankings, below fourth-listed England and on their worst losing streak in more than 20 years.         
	Waugh, who led Australia to 41 Test victories  including eight out of nine Ashes Tests  said inexperience should not rule out players when the team is selected for the November 25 first Test at Brisbanes Gabba ground.         
	I dont see why not, the hard-bitten warrior of 168 Test matches told reporters. Just because its an Ashes series it doesnt make it any different from any other series. Youve got to put your best 11 players on the park irrespective of age or experience.         
	Im never a big believer of picking players by age, its more the passion, your form and whether youre the right person for the job.         
	Australias bowlers failed to take all 20 wickets in either Test against India, but Waugh said he had no concerns about the pace bowling depth as the team returns to home pitches.         
	Waugh said under-fire skipper Ponting may be able to turn the criticism he has received to his advantage this summer as he bids to reclaim the Ashes urn lost last year in England. With criticism, youve just got to look at it and see whether you can get something constructive from those comments, he said.         
	Waugh believes Australia will win a tightly contested Ashes series 3-2 due to superior knowledge of the home conditions.         
	Meanwhile, Adam Gilchrist claims England are favourites to win the forthcoming Ashes series.         
	Gilchrist believes England are in the perfect frame of mind to triumph on Australian soil for the first time since 1986-87. He said: I see a very confident, compact England unit about to arrive.

            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder accepted that his defenders were at fault in their AFC Cup match against Syrias Al Ittihad Wednesday.         
	We should have concentrated better on our defence But its a team game and one shouldnt just blame the defenders, he said after his teams 1-4 loss.         
	We lost the game in the first half itself. We played better football in the second half Created a few opportunities but couldnt convert them.         
	But, at the same time, the result doesnt really represent the reality. We didnt play that bad, De Ridder summed it up.

	Calcutta: Whether the funds are there or not, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) continues to negotiate with one-time enemy John Buchanan.         
	In a bid to retain the Ashes, the ECB, clearly, wants to tap the best.         
	Negotiations are on. However, as details have to be confidential, I cant divulge anything, ECB spokesman James Avery told The Telegraph on Saturday evening.         
	Earlier in the week, Buchanan strongly suggested that the ECB may not have the funds to hire him as a consultant during the 2010-11 Ashes in Australia.         
	Avery, for his part, declined to comment on the funds bit. Look, all aspects of negotiations are confidential, he insisted, ducking a question on whether the ECB had been left embarrassed by Buchanan.         
	Whether a contract is eventually signed or not, well-placed sources in the UK have pointed out that Buchanan has already had sessions with the team director, Andy Flower, batting mentor Graham Gooch and the fast bowling coach, David Saker.         
	Buchanan, who coached Australia from late 1999 till mid 2007, and achieved phenomenal results, had worked with Andrew Strauss and Co. before the 2009 Ashes campaign, which saw England emerging triumphant and Australia falling from the No.1 position.         
	Ricky Ponting wasnt amused then. Its unlikely that the Australia captains feelings are going to be different this time.         
	Aware of the sensitivities involved, Buchanan has gone on record to say he isnt in the business of selling state secrets.         
	Granted, but little things not recorded by the analysts can still make a difference. Which is why the sharp reaction from Ponting a year ago.

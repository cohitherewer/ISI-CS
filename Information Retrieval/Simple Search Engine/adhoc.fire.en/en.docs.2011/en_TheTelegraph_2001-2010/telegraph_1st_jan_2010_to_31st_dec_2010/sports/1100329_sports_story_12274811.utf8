The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer wins, Murray bites the dust
                                                                                                                       7                                      Federer wins, Murray bites the dust
                      
	Miami: Unseeded American Mardy Fish recorded a shock 6-4, 6-4 win over World No. 3 and defending champion Andy Murray in front of a packed crowd in the Miami Open second round on Saturday.         
	Top seed Roger Federer then avoided Murrays fate with a 6-3, 6-3 victory in just over an hour over Ecuadors Nicolas Lapentti in the late match.         
	Florida resident Fish took control by seizing the opening set against the Briton and the writing was on the wall for Murray when he surrendered his serve in the first game of the second.         
	I just wasnt very good and Im going to need to get a lot better, Murray told reporters.         
	Mardy served well when he needed to especially in the second set, added the Scot who will be replaced at No. 3 in the next rankings by Spains Rafa Nadal.         
	You can kind of get away with playing badly. I dont really mind that but mentally the last few weeks Ive been really poor and its unacceptable.         
	Murray was again outplayed and hit two aces against his opponents eight.         
	Fish sported a wide grin as he celebrated his victory by pumping both fists close to his chest. He then signed the courtside television camera Hi dad.         
	My dad wasnt able to be here today but my mum was, said the American. Its really nice to have them come down.         
	They dont get to watch much, said Fish, who last beat a top-five opponent when he knocked out Federer at Indian Wells in 2008.         
	Fifth-seeded Swede Robin Soderling went through with a 7-6, 6-0 win over Australian Peter Luczak.         
	In the womens event, third seed Venus Williams defeated Italys Roberta Vinci 6-1, 6-4 in a third-round match.         
	Venus is the hottest player on the womens Tour  not necessarily because of the red corset she unveiled this week, but because she has won 12 consecutive matches.         
	Venus is also the only American who reached the final 32 in the womens draw. She and sister Serena are the lone US women in the top 40.         
	Its just definitely strange because of the unbelievable tradition weve had with tennis for Americans since the beginning, (Agencies)

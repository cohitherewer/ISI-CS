                                                                                                                       7                                      Rio boost for United
                      
	London: Manchester United can capitalise on their absence from the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time in 26 years by going back to the top of the Premier League on Saturday.         
	And the team can look forward to some help for their mission on the weekend in the form of Rio Ferdinand who will return from a three-month injury lay-off against Hull.         
	The centre back has been sidelined with a back injury since playing against Liverpool on October 25.         
	Rio will play tomorrow which is good news, manager Alex Ferguson, who has had to deal with a lengthy injury list in recent weeks, told a news conference on Friday.         
	He has been training very well the last few weeks and this is the time to bring him back now.         
	While most of the Premier League clubs are playing in the FA Cup, the champions meet relegation-threatened Hull City at Old Trafford in the weekends only scheduled Premier League game with United eyeing first place for the first time since mid-October.

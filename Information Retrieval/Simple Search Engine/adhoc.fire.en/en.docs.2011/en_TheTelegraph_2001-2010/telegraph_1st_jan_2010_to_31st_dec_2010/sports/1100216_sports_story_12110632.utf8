	Vancouver: Embroiled in a uniform controversy, Shiva Keshavan faired poorly on the field as he finished a disappointing 29th in the mens luge event of the Winter Olympics here.         
	Keshavan clocked overall 3:18.473 after four runs to finish 29th out of the 38 athletes at the Whistler Sliding Centre.         
	The Indian, who finished 25th in the last edition in Turin, was 31st after the first run.         
	He improved to 28th after the second but slipped to 29th after the third.         
	Felix Loach of Germany won in an overall time of 2:24.914.         
	He led the field in all the four runs of the event that was held in the backdrop of the tragic death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili during practice.         
	Keshavans campaign was too marred by controversy as he and his father, here as a coach, had appeared in attires different from the other Indian members in the opening ceremony, claiming that the countrys contingent in the Winter Olympics did not have co-ordinated uniform.

	Guangzhou: Fired-up Pakistan annexed the Asian Games mens hockey gold medal after 20 years with a convincing 2-0 win over Malaysia in the final, on Thursday.         
	It was Pakistans eighth Asian Games hockey gold, ending a drought that stretched back to Beijing in 1990, and handed them their first major title since winning the World Cup in Sydney in 1994. With this Pakistan has qualified for the 2012 London Olympics.         
	Afghanistan knocked out gold-medal favourite Pakistan in a stunning 22-run upset victory today to set up a final against Bangladesh in the Asian Games T20 cricket competition.         
	World No. 1 Nicol David led Malaysia past Hong Kong to win the womens team squash gold, as her country moved closer to a title clean-sweep.         
	David, who had already defended her singles crown, defeated Annie Au 11-8, 11-7, 11-6 in a repeat of the womens final after Low Wee Wern had seen off Rebecca Chiu, the individual gold medallist at the 2002 Busan Asiad, 11-4, 7-11, 11-6, 11-9 in the first match.         
	Japan finished their Asian Games mens football campaign in near-perfect form, winning its seventh straight match while conceding just one goal in the tournament and clinching gold with a 1-0 win over the UAE.         
	Vietnam, after winning 15 silver and 13 bronze medals, finally got its first gold of the Asian Games.

	In mens basketball, China, the defending champions, and South Korea will play for the gold medal on Friday.

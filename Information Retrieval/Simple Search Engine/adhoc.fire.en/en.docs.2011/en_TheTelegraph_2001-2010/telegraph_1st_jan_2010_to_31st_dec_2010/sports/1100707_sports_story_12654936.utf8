                  Tiger Woods                     
	Adare (Ireland): After another warm welcome from the Irish public, Tiger Woods was far less impressed with the line of questioning on Tuesday about his state of mind since the sex scandal thats wrecked his marriage.         
	Following his 3-under-par 69 in his final round of the charity J.P. McManus Invitational Pro-Am, his first foreign appearance since the scandal, he met probing media questions with a show of tense, taciturn discipline.         
	When asked whether his liaisons with other women had been worth it since it cost him his marriage and commercial endorsements, Woods replied, I think youre looking too deep into this. He torpedoed the follow-up question with an icily firm Thank you.         
	Faced with questions about why he was returning immediately to his Florida home rather than heading to Scotland to prepare for next weeks British Open at St. Andrews, one of his favourite courses where hes won two previous Opens in 2000 and 2005, the previously easy-speaking Woods flipped a switch into staccato half-sentences.         
	How will you prepare? Practising.         
	Where? Home.         
	Why not try and play some links golf in Scotland beforehand? I need to get home. Silence.         
	Why? See my kids. Silence.         
	Throughout the 15-minute press conference journalists attempted various angles to coax and comment on how Woods marital implosion was affecting his game.         
	There are times in ones life when things get put in perspective, one being when my father passed, and obviously what Ive been going through lately, he said in his most expansive reply.         
	But when asked again whether he was finding personal worries overshadowing his game, Woods had clearly had enough. Everythings working itself out, was all he would say.         
	When asked if that meant his troubles were still undermining his golf, Woods descended into glum-eyed silence, offering only an expression somewhere between a grimace and a frown.         
	Out on the Adare Manor Golf Course, Woods felt nothing but love and admiration from the more than 20,000 fans who lined the 7,453-yard course five-deep to watch his every drive, approach shot and putt.         
	Armed with a full nights sleep, Woods breezed through a course that had befuddled him on Monday, when he shot a 7-over-par 79 to fall near the bottom of the field of 54 professionals.         
	Woods Irish caddie, silver-haired Tipperary car dealer Arthur Pierse, said Woods was exhausted on Monday after flying overnight from the conclusion of the AT amp;T National in Pennsylvania, where he finished a distant 46th.         
	He climbed back into the middle of the pack with Tuesdays performance, though the score didnt matter because the pros at the McManus Invitational typically give their prize money to Irish charities, and the event is not US PGA-ranked.

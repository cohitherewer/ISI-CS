The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC: India, SA must decide on UDRS
                                                                                                                       7                                      ICC: India, SA must decide on UDRS
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The International Cricket Council on Wednesday refused to prevail upon the BCCI to have the Umpire Decision Referral System (UDRS) for the upcoming Test and ODI series in South Africa.         
	We would leave it to the BCCI and Cricket South Africa to come to an understanding, ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said at a promotional here.         
	The BCCI has so far refused to use the UDRS in its home series, arguing that the ball tracking technology used by the Hawkeye, used while reviewing LBW decisions, lacked accuracy.         
	Technically, the host nation could decide on whether to have UDRS, and the CSA has expressed its desire to have it when India visit them for a full-fledged series in December-January.         
	Lorgat said that the games world governing body would prefer the BCCI to decide rather than force them to agree on the merits of the UDRS.         
	In an effort to bring the BCCI on board, the ICC has invited its officials to come to Australia and assess for itself the technology in use during the upcoming Ashes series.         
	Like all other issues that we try to sort out through engagement, we are trying to convince rather than instruct the BCCI on having the UDRS, he said.         
	I am confident that the BCCI will join us on the visit to the Ashes and will see the merits of the system. They have concerns about reliability but I hope to convince them.         
	Lorgat did not believe that Indias decision to rest key players for the recent ODI series against Australia and the one coming against New Zealand next month meant that the 50-over format was losing popularity.         
	As a former selector of South Africa, I support Indias rotation policy. Its been done with the World Cup in mind, he said.

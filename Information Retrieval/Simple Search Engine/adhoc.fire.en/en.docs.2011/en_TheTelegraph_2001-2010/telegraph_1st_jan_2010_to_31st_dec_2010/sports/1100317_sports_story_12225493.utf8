            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                Matthew Hayden and A.R. Rahman                             
	Calcutta: Matthew Hayden, who was involved in the recent Festival of Sydney, where A.R. Rahman presented his Jai Ho concert, has described the Oscar-winning composer as inspirational.         
	Over 50,000 fans thronged the Parramatta Park at the height of the turmoil (over the attacks on Indians)... Rahmans message was one of love and everybody embraced it... The power of love won, Hayden told The Telegraph.         
	Hayden added: I went backstage and met Rahman... I found him very graceful, very humble... It became clear why hes such an inspirational figure...         
	Commenting on the attacks on Indians in Australia, Hayden said: Crimes against humanity happen across the world and every incident is disappointing... Its a multi-cultural society in Australia and we pride ourselves on that...         
	Our cultures are strong and cricket is a bond... Thats a common link as is education and travel... The way forward is to encourage love, not hate... We need to build on the Jai Ho concert...

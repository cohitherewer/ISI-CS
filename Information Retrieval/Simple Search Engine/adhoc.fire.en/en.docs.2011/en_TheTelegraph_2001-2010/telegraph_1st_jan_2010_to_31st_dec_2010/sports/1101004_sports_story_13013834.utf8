The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians bank on Jwala 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indians bank on Jwala 
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: It seems India have bungled big time while scheduling the badminton team event.         
	Being hosts, the Indians should be having the final say but actually it did not happen like coach Pullela Gopichand would have liked to.         
	How can you justify players like Jwala Gutta would have to end up playing four matches on the day before the quarter finals and four more a day before the final.         
	Gopichand though made light of the situation and said that a podium finish was quite possible.         
	Yeah, it will be a little tough but we are not worried. We have a rather easy opener, the 2001 All-England badminton champion said.         
	There is more bad news as Jwalas mixed doubles partner Valiyaveetil Diju is nursing a back injury. Of the five matches India play  mens singles and doubles, womens singles and doubles and mixed doubles  they should win three to go past England.         
	Thats one reason why the hosts are heavily banking on Jwala. Jwala, who will be featuring in womens doubles and the mixed event, needs to be at the top of her game in the semi-finals.         
	Placed in Group D, India will open against Kenya.         
	Two teams from each of the four groups make it to the quarters.         
	With Scotland, Wales and Barbados being the other opponents in the group, the hosts are expected to coast into the quarters without much difficulty.         
	The real test comes in the semi-finals where India are expected to run into England. But for Saina Nehwal in the womens singles, others will struggle to get past their English opponents.         
	England are likely to field Rajiv Ouseph in the mens singles and though Chetan Anand had beaten him twice, Gopichand is mulling fielingd 24-year-old Parupalli Kashyap.         
	Is it because of Anands off court problems that Gopichand is thinking of throwing Kashyap into the cauldron? Its a tricky choice for the coach as Chetan is the best Indian player in mens singles although Kashyap has produced some great results recently.         
	World No. 1 Lee Chong Wei will spearhead Malaysias challenge at the Games.         
	Incidentally, the Malaysians are on the verge of equalling the longest medal streak in badminton in the Games.         
	They have won gold in both, mens singles and doubles, in the last five Games.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Bombay High Court, on Friday, extended the deadline for IPL franchises to submit the list of their marquee players to December 8 and that of uncapped players to December 10.         
	Justice S J Vazifdar granted the extension sought by Kings XI Punjab while hearing the latters petition against the termination of their franchise rights by the BCCI.         
	The original deadline for submitting the list of marquee players, those whom the franchises want to retain from their respective squad for the 2010 season, was December 6.         
	The judge also said that he would hear the cases of KXIP and Rajasthan Royals, the two franchises who have been scrapped from the IPL, together although both were at different stages.         
	Royals have been granted a stay against their termination by the arbitrator, who termed the BCCIs decision as prima facie illegal. The BCCI had appealed against the stay.         
	The arbitrator, however, recused himself from hearing the KXIP case on Wednesday. With KXIP seeking the matter to be heard by the court itself, Justice Vazifdar decided to hear the two cases simultaneously.

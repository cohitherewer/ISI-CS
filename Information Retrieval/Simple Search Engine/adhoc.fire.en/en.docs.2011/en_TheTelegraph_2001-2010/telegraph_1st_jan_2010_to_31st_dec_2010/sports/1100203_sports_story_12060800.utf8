	Calcutta: Kalighat MS created a flutter when they defeated a profligate Mohammedan Sporting 1-0 in a CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. The all-important goal came in the 31 st minute when Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Naseem Akhtar let in Chizoba Christophers harmless shot. It was a howler of highest order and coach Shabbir Ali must have given the goalkeeper a piece of his mind.         
	But even conceding the goal, Mohammedan Sporting got enough opportunities to log full points on the day. The missed chances after chances and had only themselves to blame for the loss. Theodore Sunday, Eduardo Escobar and Jyothi Kumar muffed chances which they would have any other day.         
	Six minutes into the match, Theodore played it to Amritpal Singh who headed wide from close. Then Sovan Chakraborty freed Theodore in the middle, and the Liberian made a solo run into the Kalighat MS box. But his shot was saved by an advancing goalkeeper Sourav Chakraborty. Off the rebound Jyothi Kumar volleyed out.         
	Then the Brazilian Eduardo unleashed a booming 30-yard free-kick and once again Chakraborty denied Mohammedan Sporting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji not among top-10 bowlers
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bhajji not among top-10 bowlers
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Gautam Gambhir was clinging on to his top spot but teammate Harbhajan Singh was not all that lucky and although the opener retains his No.1 in the Test rankings for batsmen despite managing just 13 runs in the first Test versus South Africa, the offie finds himself dropping four spots and out of the top 10 on the bowlers chart after a disastrous start by the hosts in Nagpur.         
	It is unsurprisingly the Proteas who have made all the significant gains in the individual rankings.         
	Jacques Kallis, who scored his 34th Test century in the match, has returned to the top five by gaining four places to sit in fourth position. Hashim Amla has broken into the top 10 in the rankings for the first time following his unbeaten 253 in the first innings, which helped set up his teams victory by an innings and six runs.         
	Amla is now just three ratings points behind Sachin Tendulkar, who was also successful with the bat during the match as he notched up his record 46th Test century in the second innings.         
	In the rankings for Test bowlers, South African slow left-armer Paul Harris has moved up three places to ninth with Harbhajan now at No.12.         
	Pacer Dale Steyn increased his lead at the top of the rankings with the fourth 10-wicket haul of his career.         
	Ishant Sharma went wicketless in the match and, as a result, drops seven places to the 22nd position.         
	Steyns first-innings figures of seven for 51 are his career-best. The 26-year-old is fast approaching the best points rating of his career, which he enjoyed following the Ahmedabad Test against the same opposition in 2008.         
	There are no changes in the top five of the rankings for all-rounders with Kallis still out in front, followed in second place by New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori and Englands Graeme Swann in third position.

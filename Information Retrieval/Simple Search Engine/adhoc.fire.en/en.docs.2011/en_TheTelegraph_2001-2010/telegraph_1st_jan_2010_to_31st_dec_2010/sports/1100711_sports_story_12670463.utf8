                                                                                                                       7                                      Zaheer is off to SA for therapy
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Team India pacer Zaheer Khan will get his injured shoulder treated in South Africa and, if possible, watch Sundays Fifa World Cup final in Johannesburg.         
	Leaving for Jo-burg today, visiting Rosebank sports injury rehab clinic, the place where I did my shoulder rehab last year after surgery, he wrote on Twitter Saturday.         
	Trying to catch the World Cup final as well in Jo-burg, very last minute though, tweeted the left-arm seamer who would be rooting for Spain in Sundays final against the Netherlands.         
	Zaheer has been ruled out of Indias tour of Sri Lanka starting on July 18.

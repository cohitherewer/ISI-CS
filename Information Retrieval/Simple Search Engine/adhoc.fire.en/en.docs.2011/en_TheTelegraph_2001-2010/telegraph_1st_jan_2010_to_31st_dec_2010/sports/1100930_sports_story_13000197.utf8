            OUR CORRESPONDENT            East Bengal striker Tolgay Ozebe is having a fantastic Federation Cup                           
	Cuttack: Defending champions East Bengal made their 14th entry into the final of the Federation Cup, prevailing over Goas Churchill Brothers 1-0, in a hard-fought semi-final, at Barabati Stadium, here on Wednesday.         
	Striker Tolgay Ozebe again turned out to be the star, scoring the all-important goal in the 10th minute with an angular shot from the top right corner of the box. After receiving a pass from Penn Orji, the Australian recruit booted home with a perfect right-footer, giving no chance to opposition goalkeeper Lalit Thapa.         
	Ozebe found a fine opportunity to score his second goal in the match, and fifth in the tournament, off a penalty kick in the 20th minute, but wasted it by shooting straight into the hands of Thapa, who saved it on second attempt.         
	Churchill Brothers were more aggressive and got the first scoring opportunity in the sixth minute. But East Bengal custodian Sandip Nandi saved his side by punching away a pile driver from Churchill captain Okolie Odafe.         
	Churchills dream of making their maiden entry into the Federation Cup final continued to elude them even though they made commendable efforts, giving the opposition a good run for their money.         
	The Goa outfit came close to scoring the equaliser at least four times, but they could not convert those.         
	In the 27th minute, Odafe right-footer went out after hitting the far post with Nandi hopelessly out of position. Though the rebound came to an onrushing Koko Sakibo, he could not connect it.         
	Uga Okpara saved a sure goal after Nandy was beaten by a Sakibo shot in the 72nd minute.         
	In the 46th minute East Bengal missed an opportunity to increase their lead as Robin Singhs powerful grounder missed the target by a whisker.

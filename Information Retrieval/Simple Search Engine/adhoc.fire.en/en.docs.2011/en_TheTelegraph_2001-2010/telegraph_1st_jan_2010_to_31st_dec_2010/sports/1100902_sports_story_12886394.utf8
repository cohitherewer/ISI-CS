  - If ICC doesnt act fast, people may turn away from game: Watson       A STAFF REPORTER            Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson                                 
	Calcutta: Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson rebuffed approaches from the same Indian, who targeted Shane Watson and Brad Haddin, for information during Australias tour of England last year, an Australian newspaper reported, on Wednesday.         
	Watson and Haddin on Tuesday confirmed that the Indian, who security sources have linked to illegal Indian bookmakers, made approaches to them during the Ashes and World Twenty20 tournament  all of which were reported to the team management and, in turn, the Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU).         
	And it has since emerged that Lee and Johnson were also confronted in the bar of their west London hotel, the Royal Garden, in Kensington, while touring England last year. Their names were included in reports submitted by Steve Bernard, the Australian team manager, to the International Cricket Council (ICC)s anti-corruption and security unit.         
	The dubious Indian, who has not been seen by the Australian team since, was known to have boasted of relationships with players within the West Indian team and was seen approaching Pakistani and Sri Lankan players before the World Twenty20 final, at Lords.         
	Lee and Johnson rejected the mans offer to buy them drinks in the bar of the Royal Garden. The trouble in this case was that the gentleman was staying in the same hotel, Bernard told the paper.         
	The guys werent approached about spot-fixing or anything like that, he was asking if he could buy them drinks. quot;         
	Watson, meanwhile, on Wednesday, blamed the ICC for the spot-fixing scandal, saying the world bodys anti-corruption unit is not really working.         
	Watson said it was disappointing to see a newspaper sting expose what should have actually been handled by the ICC. The ACSU is not really working, he said.         
	Thats totally to do with the ICC, so they really need to step in and really get to the bottom of it. Maybe they dont want to get to the bottom of it because it might run too deep, he added.         
	Watson said if the ICC does not act as soon as possible, credibility of the game may be lost forever as far as the fans are concerned.         
	People might turn away from cricket because they dont know (whether) what they are seeing are actually the true facts of cricket, he said.

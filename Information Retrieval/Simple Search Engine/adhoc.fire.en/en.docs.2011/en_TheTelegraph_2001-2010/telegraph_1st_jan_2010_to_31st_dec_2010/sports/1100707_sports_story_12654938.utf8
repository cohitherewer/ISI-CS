                                                                                                                       7                                      Clean sweep by Pakistan

	Birmingham: Kamran Akmal struck 33 as Pakistan made 162/9 against Australia on Tuesday in the second Twenty20 international at Edgbaston.         
	The wicket-keeper hit four fours and a six in his 25-ball innings, while Salman Butt (31) and Umar Akmal (25) also chipped in with decent knocks.               
	Dirk Nannes claimed figures of 3-30, including the wickets of Umar Akmal (25) and captain Shahid Afridi (18) in the space of two balls. Steve Keefe, making his international debut as one of two changes made by Australia, had 3/29 as a late onslaught by Pakistan failed to materialise.               
	Pakistan won the the first match in the two-game series by 23 runs Monday.         
	Just as in the opener, Pakistan lost their opening wicket on the fourth ball of the innings when Shahzaib Hasan (0) was trapped lbw by David Hussey.         
	Kamran Akmal came to the crease to join Butt and the pair put on a second-wicket stand of 61 to place Pakistan back in the drivers seat.         
	Butt had hit six fours in his 21-ball knock by the time he top-edged a sweep to Cameron White at short fine leg off the bowling of Keefe.         
	Kamran Akmal, who hit 23 in the first match, was the next to go after mistiming a pull shot off Mitchell Johnson, the ball looping to mid-wicket where captain Michael Clarke took an impressive catch.         
	The dismissal of Shoaib Malik (12) brought Afridi to the middle alongside Mondays hero Umar Akmal, and they put on 30 off 20 balls before they were dismissed one after the other by Nannes.  
	Pakistan defeated Australia by 11 runs in the second T20 International, at Edgbaston, to win the series 2-0. Chasing a target of 163, the Australians were all out for 151 in 19.4 overs. Mohammed Aamer took three for 27.      (AGENCIES)

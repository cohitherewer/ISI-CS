The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zhirkov, Anelka do it for Chelsea 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zhirkov, Anelka do it for Chelsea 
                      
	Moscow: Chelsea made a triumphant return to the scene of their most painful Champions League defeat, when they beat Spartak Moscow 2-0 in a top-of-the-table group F match on Tuesday.         
	Russia leftback Yuri Zhirkov put the London club, beaten by Manchester United in the 2008 final after a penalty shootout at the same Luzhniki Stadium, ahead before French striker Nicolas Anelka doubled the lead just before the break.         
	Zhirkov, familiar with the artificial pitch, after spending five seasons with Spartaks bitter Moscow rivals CSKA, pounced on a loose ball in the 23rd minute and volleyed spectacularly into the top corner of the net from 20 metres.         
	Anelka, who wasted a good chance to make it 2-0 when he lost control of the ball with the goal at his mercy, made amends in the 43rd minute when he raced through the defence before driving low past keeper Andriy Dykan.         
	Chelsea maintained their 100 percent record in the section with a third successive victory, while Spartak remained on six points.         
	Carlo Ancelottis Chelsea, missing several key players including Didier Drogba and Frank Lampard, started cautiously but Zhirkovs stunning strike changed things.         
	Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien spurned an opportunity late in the game when he missed from close range.           (REUTERS)

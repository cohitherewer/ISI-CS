                                                                                                                       7                                        Jayasuriya, too, takes the plunge in politics
                  Jayasuriya                     
	Colombo: His cricket career on the wane, former captain Sanath Jayasuriya has taken the political plunge and will have a face off against former teammate Arjuna Ranatunga during election campaigns for their respective alliances for the April 8 Sri Lankan Parliamentary polls.         
	Jayasuriya is expected to contest the upcoming General Elections under the ruling coalition United People Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket from the Southern Coastal Matara District.         
	Jayasuriya, however, ruled out giving up cricket just yet.         
	Though I am coming into politics, I will not give up cricket. I was pushed to this decision after an exhaustive study, the opener said.         
	I have nothing to earn from politics. But I can work for the people who loved me a lot. It is the duty to serve the people, in return, for what they did for me to come to this position, he added.         
	When the UPFA invited me to contest the General Elections, I accepted it since this is a golden opportunity to work for the people, Jayasuriya told a Sri Lankan newspaper.         
	The 40-year-old cricketer also said that he got the permission from the Sri Lanka Cricket Board to contest the elections.         
	Ranatunga, who left the UPFA and sided with the defeated opposition Presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka, had recently said that Jayasuriya and other active cricket players should not join politics.         
	While one of Ranatungas brother, Prasanna, is the chief minister of the UPFA-led Western Provincial Council, his another sibling Nishantha Ranatunga is the secretary of the interim committee of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).         
	Jayasuriya, Muttaiah Muralidharan and Lasith Malinga had spoken in favour of the Mahinda Rajapaksa government in the advertisements during the Presidential polls that took place on January 26.         
	Ranatunga, on the other hand, had claimed that, along with him, the opposition parties were backing Fonseka.The 1996 World cup-winning captain also accused sports minister Gamini Lokuge of promoting his stooges to run cricket to the ground.         
	He had called Lokuge and Jaysuriya for a public television debate.           (PTI)

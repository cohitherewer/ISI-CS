The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A statue of Warne   at MCG
                                                                                                                       7                                      A statue of Warne   at MCG
                            
	Melbourne: Australian spin legend Shane Warne will be honoured with a statue by the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) for his achievements and contribution to the nation.         
	Warne, whose last Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was in 2006, will be the latest to be honoured with a statue outside the venue, an Australian daily reported.         
	There are already 10 statues erected around the ground, honouring famous figures such as Sir Donald Bradman, Ron Barassi and Betty Cuthbert.         
	The MCC have decided that they will now start an avenue of legends, running along the path from their members entrance to Wellington Pde.         
	Warnes statue is expected to be unveiled near the end of next year. The 41-year-old Melbourne native enjoyed some of the greatest moments of his cricketing career at the MCG, including his only Test hattrick.         
	Shanes playing record is unparalleled and he will sit comfortably alongside the 10 sporting greats already outside the MCG, said MCC president David Meiklejohn.           (AGENCIES)

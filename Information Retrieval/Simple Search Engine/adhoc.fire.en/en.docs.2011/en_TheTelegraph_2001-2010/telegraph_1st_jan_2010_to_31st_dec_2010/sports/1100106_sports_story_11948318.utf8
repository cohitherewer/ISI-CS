The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | South Africa in full control
                                                                                                                       7                                      South Africa in full control
                      
	Cape Town: South Africa captain Graeme Smith hit a superb 19th Test century to put the hosts 330 runs ahead of England and in full control of the third Test after the third day at Newlands on Tuesday.         
	Smith hammered 162 not out as he steered South Africa, 1-0 down in the four-match series, to 312 for two in their second innings, batting with impressive power as he struck 22 fours.         
	Hashim Amla added a ground record 230 for the second wicket with Smith, but could not manage to score a century himself, being caught bat/pad at short-leg for 95 off Graeme Swann to give England their only wicket of the afternoon.

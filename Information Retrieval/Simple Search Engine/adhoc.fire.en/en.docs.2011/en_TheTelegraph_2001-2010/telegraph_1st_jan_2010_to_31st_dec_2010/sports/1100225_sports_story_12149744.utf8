    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Kepler Wessels takes guard             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              Kepler Wessels        
	Gwalior: Former South Africa captain and opener Kepler Wessels (who actually began his international career in the Australia colours) spoke to The Telegraph on captaincy and on opening the innings.         
	Wessels, 52, is on tour as the Proteas batting coach. Hes also a member of the interim selection panel.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q You got the South Africa captaincy in the early 1990s. Has the role of captains changed since?         
	A The demands at the international level have always been huge. In South Africas case, anyway, I got the job at quite a difficult time, straight after the period of isolation. It was tough, with expectations being very high. I dont think thats ever going to change. What has changed is that theres more cricket now... The T20 stuff is there, too... The role of the captain, if youre captaining in all three variations, has got more diverse... Has got more diverse for the players as well... Pressure, however, is the same.         
	Would you prefer two captains  one for Tests and the other for both forms of limited overs cricket?         
	No, its much better to have continuity in the dressing room. The ideal scenario is to have one guy for all three forms.         
	The captains who, in your opinion, stand out today...         
	Youve got to look at (Ricky) Ponting... Then, theres (Graeme) Smith...         
	Whats special about Ponting?         
	Ponting, arguably, is the best batsman in the world and a lot of his captaincy is based on his really leading from the front... He has captained a strong Australian side and is captaining a weaker side, with some success... Tactically, hes probably not the best, though.         
	Smith got the job as a 22-year-old after the 2003 World Cup. Whats your take on his captaincy?         
	Smith, too, leads from the front. Hes improving with the bat all the time and has been having a bigger impact as time has gone on... Id say his captaincy has got better and better.         
	Where could Smith improve?         
	Im involved with the team, so wouldnt like to answer that.         
	How about a Mahendra Singh Dhoni?         
	Hes taken India to No.1 in Tests, thats it.         
	Many rate Daniel Vettori quite highly         
	Vettori hasnt got a great team and isnt getting good results... Looking from the outside, his style seems to be the same as Stephen Fleming... Hes quite powerful in the set-up, possibly more powerful than any other New Zealand captain ever.         
	What makes a good captain?         
	The main thing is that a captain has to understand the personalities in his team and treat each one individually. A captain must know which button to press and when. Also, he has to be one of the best players of his time.         
	You were seen as one of the more conventional captains, somewhat bookish. Was it a fair assessment?         
	(Grins) I was guided by the circumstances and by the players I had at my disposal... I had to play a more conservative role to absolutely maximise the strengths that we had, so that we would be able to compete, which we did, because we never lost too many in my reign as captain. I couldnt, however, really step out of plan... When I retired, Hansie (Cronje) took over and had a more experienced side... He could, therefore, be more flamboyant.         
	How much of intuition should come into play?         
	Gut feeling is important... Good captains always have that gut feeling.         
	Some questions on openers... Whore the toppers?         
	Smiths there... Has good powers of concentration and, so, has the ability to make big scores... Has a great physical presence on the field and has done well in all conditions. His ability to dominate an attack stands out.         
	How about a Chris Gayle?         
	No, hes not for me... Is too up and down, not consistent. (After a pause) I wouldnt call even Andrew Strauss a stand-out opener, Id call him steady... He plays to the best of his ability, yes, but isnt someone who can dominate and take the game away from you.         
	Virender Sehwag?         
	Yes, hes there (at the top)... Hes not only very dangerous in the subcontinent, but has got runs in, say, Australia as well.         
	What do you look for in an opener?         
	Hes got to be technically sound... Got to be tactically pretty aware... Hes got to be brave and got to have the ability to dominate the new-ball bowlers.         
	Must one be born an opener?         
	Look, usually, its very difficult for guys who come from the middle-order to an opening slot... Its easier for an opener to drop down the order because opening batsmen have very special qualities... You may not be born an opener, but youve got to have the want to open... Indeed, an opener has to have the want to take on the new ball... Theres got to be absolutely no doubt in your mind thats what you want to do... Opening the innings, remember, is one of the toughest jobs in the game and thats why you need to be good... Thats why good openers are so valuable.         
	Sehwag started off in the middle-order. Would you, then, give him higher marks?         
	Yeah, hes adapted exceedingly well and has done it his own way... Hes definitely not your traditional opening batsman.         
	Finally, your advice for both young openers and captains-in-the-making?         
	To the openers, Id say be brave... Be physically tough and mentally strong and, then, look at the technical and tactical aspects... Temperament, too, is a factor... For to-be-captains, my message is simple: Lead from the front through your performance, your approach and your attitude... Be in control of the situation... You need to be there when the pressure is on.

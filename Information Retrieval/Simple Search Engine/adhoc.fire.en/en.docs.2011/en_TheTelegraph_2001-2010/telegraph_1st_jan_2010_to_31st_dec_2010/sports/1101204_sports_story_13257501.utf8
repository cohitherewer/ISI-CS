	Belgrade: Novak Djokovic brought Serbia back into the Davis Cup final against France by beating Gilles Simon 6-3, 6-1, 7-5 to tie the opening singles 1-1 on Friday.         
	Gael Monfils cruised past Janko Tipsarevic 6-1, 7-6 (4), 6-0 to give France the opening match.         
	Djokovic impressed as he won his sixth straight singles in Davis Cup to remain unbeaten this year.         
	Already under hyped expectations at home to lead Serbia to their first Cup title in their first final, Djokovic responded to Tipsarevics defeat by wrapping up the first two sets, including winning nine of 10 games from 3-3.         
	Former top-6 player Simon made Djokovic work to polish off the victory, finally succumbing on a fourth match point by sending a backhand wide.         
	This is the Davis Cup final ... you have to play each point and each match fully focused and the best you can, Djokovic. I played great, although I had a little trouble in the end which helped get him back into the game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United have lost aura, says Nasri
                                                                                                                       7                                        United have lost aura, says Nasri
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Samir Nasri                           
	Samir Nasri has turned up the heat ahead of Arsenals trip to Manchester United on Monday by claiming Alex Fergusons side have gone backwards and that Old Trafford has lost its capacity to frighten opponents.         
	For me, United is not the same team as before, he said. With Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez, it was a little bit scary to play at Old Trafford. Now I dont think offensively they are the same as before.         
	Senior players in the Arsenal dressing room are furious with Patrice Evras dismissal of the club on French television as a training centre and will seek retribution on the pitch.         
	Arsene Wenger said that those sort of below the belt remarks were based on fear and that big players always respect their opponent.         
	There is history between Evra and Arsenal. After winning at the Emirates in the Champions League semi-final in 2009 he said it had been like men against children.         
	In the following league game at Old Trafford, Nasri, Robin van Persie and Cesc Fabregas all went after Evra with aggressive fouls, Fabregas getting booked.         
	Asked about Evras dismissal of the team as immature, Nasri said: We will see on Monday. We will show him that we have grown up.         
	 Arsenal, who went into the weekend top of the league, have not won at Old Trafford since September 2006, losing four and drawing once since, but Nasri is confident that the Gunners have overcome their timidity against big teams.         
	They are a good team and when theyre 1-0 up it is very hard to beat them, but were really confident to get a result, he said.         
	Nasri has been Arsenals key man in recent weeks. He scored both goals in the 2-1 win over Fulham and another in the 3-1 win over Partizan Belgrade. Wenger is delighted with his contribution.         
	He has become more efficient and is maturing but he is only 23 and at that age you develop, he said.         
	United are a point behind Arsenal with a game in hand and though they have struggled on the road this year with six draws they have been superb at home where they have won seven and drawn one of their eight games.         
	Alex Ferguson, meanwhile, has pleaded with supporters not to take part in abusive chanting aimed at Wenger. I plead to our fans. They have got to stop that kind of thing, he said.         
	I have faced it myself in the past. It is not a nice thing. We have a great rivalry with Arsenal. But it shouldnt extend to those levels, not for Manchester United.

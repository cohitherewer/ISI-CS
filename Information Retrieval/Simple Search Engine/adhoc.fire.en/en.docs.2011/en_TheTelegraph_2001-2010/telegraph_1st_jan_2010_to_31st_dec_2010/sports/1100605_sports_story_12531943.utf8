            A STAFF REPORTER            Bhaichung Bhutia on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Indian football captain Bhaichung Bhutia feels that Spain and Argentina are the two teams to watch out for in the World Cup. He also hoped that the Asian nations will join the party.         
	I hope Asian countries like Japan, South Korea do well this time round. It will be foolish to predict the four semi-finalists as the ball havent yet started rolling.         
	I hope the Asian nations will join the party in South Africa this time. On personal front, I will keenly follow the performance of Spain and Argentina. In my opinion, these are the two teams to watch out for, Bhaichung told mediapersons on the sidelines of a promotional organised by the Football Players Association of India (FPAI) on Friday.         
	On the field or off it, Bhaichung has always set an example for his fellow sportspersons. On Thursday, the national football team captain and one of the most recognisable sporting icons of the country met Union home minister P. Chidambaram and other senior ministers of the UPA government in New Delhi to express his concerns over the tension in the countrys Northeast, especially Manipur.         
	I met Chidambaram, I amp;B minister Ambika Soni in New Delhi. We spoke about the current tension in the Northeast region, especially in Manipur, and Nagaland.         
	It is really painful to find so many innocent people losing their lives. There were discussions about having a peace rally with prominent personalities from the region, He added: I also feel that my teammates from Manipur, like Surkumar Singh and Rennedy Singh should take part in the peace rally.         
	Bhaichung said the Indian cricket boards decision to not send a team to the Asian Games was an unfortunate one.         
	Bhaichung was very optimistic about FPAIs tie-up with energy drinks company Lucozade as the money earned from the sponsorship will be spent in the development of the game at the grassroots level.

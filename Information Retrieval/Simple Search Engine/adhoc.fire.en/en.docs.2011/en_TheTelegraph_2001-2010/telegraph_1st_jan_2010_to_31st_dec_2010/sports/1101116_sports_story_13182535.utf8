The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Baby Schumi comes of age 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Baby Schumi comes of age

	After a race in which Michael Schumacher was almost decapitated and Sebastian Vettel became Germanys second Formula One world champion, you could almost picture the headlines: The king is dead. Long live the king.         
	Here, after all, is a young man, already dubbed Baby Schumi by Germanys tabloid press, winning the first of what will presumably be multiple world championships, and all at the tender age of 23.         
	Plenty of time yet to match Schumachers incredible haul of seven world titles. And yet, their phenomenal ability to drive racing cars apart, there is little similarity between the two men.         
	Vettel is careful always to compliment his elder compatriot, crediting him with having been the inspiration behind his entry into the sport.         
	But from the moment he first raced for BMW at Indianapolis in 2007, becoming F1s youngest points scorer in the process, he has rejected the obvious link to the Red Baron.         
	Schumacher is serious, intense and made his name as the most ruthless and aggressive driver F1 has known. Famous for his win-at-all-costs attitude, the 41 year-old returned to the sport this year after a three-year hiatus.         
	Despite appearing to have mellowed, he nearly put former Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello into a wall in Budapest. He said sorry in a prepared statement the next day.         
	Vettel is laid-back, engaging and likes Little Britain. Picked up by Red Bulls junior driver programme at a tender age, he has more in common with Lewis Hamilton than Schumacher.         
	Like McLarens starlet  the man he has replaced as F1s youngest champion  he was groomed, protected and arrived in F1 a ready-made race winner.         
	Vettel can be petulant  his reaction to Webbers purple patch in the early summer was a concern  and former F1 world champion Jacques Villeneuve recently called him spoilt.         
	There is no point denying that he is Red Bulls golden boy, which is why he came off badly in the intra-team battle with Mark Webber. Not much he can do about that.         
	But he is fast maturing. After crashing into Jenson Button at Spa, McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh labelled Vettel the crash kid. He knuckled down and hardly put a foot wrong from then on.         
	There are still lingering doubts over his racing ability but with such blistering qualifying pace he is nearly always leading from the front anyway.         
	Vettel is set for multiple world championships. Just dont call him Baby Schumi.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

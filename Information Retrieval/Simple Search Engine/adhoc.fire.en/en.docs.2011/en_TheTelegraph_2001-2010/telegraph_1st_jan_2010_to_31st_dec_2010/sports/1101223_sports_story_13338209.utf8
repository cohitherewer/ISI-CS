	Karachi: Pakistan have yet again missed out on hosting a Davis Cup tie as the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has shifted their upcoming rubber against Hong Kong out of the country due to security concerns.         
	Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) secretary Mumtaz Yousaf said the Asia Oceania Group II tie, scheduled for March 2011, would now be played in Hong Kong instead of Pakistan.         
	The ITF has shifted the tie to Hong Kong after the security officer Ian Todd was not satisfied with the security arrangements and feared for players safety, Yousaf was quoted as saying by a newspaper.         
	Todd visited Lahore in October to assess the security arrangements and visited different clubs and met various sports officials during the tour.         
	Its the fourth year in succession that Pakistan have been forced to play their home matches away due to security threats. Earlier, Pakistans home ties against Oman and Philippines in 2009 were also shifted while this year the country was forced to play in Hong Kong and New Zealand after teams refused to visit.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | PCB action evokes mixed reactions
                                                                                                                       7                                        PCB action evokes mixed reactions
  - This has come as a shock and surprise to me: Waqar Younis                        Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf                       
	Karachi: Former Pakistan captains and cricketers Wednesday reacted with surprise, anger and content to severe punishment handed out by the Board to half-a-dozen current players on disciplinary counts.         
	The Board banned seniors Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan for life and handed one-year bans to Shoaib Malik and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan in the wake of their flop show Down Under.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically):         
	ZAHEER ABBAS: Obviously it is very disappointing and sad that senior players like Yousuf and Younis have been banned for life but the fact is this action of the board will help in improving the Pakistan cricket teams culture and performances. The players must realise whatever they are today are because of their country and the team.         
	INZAMAM-UL HAQ: How can you treat senior players Yousuf and Younus like this? How can you ban them for life? If they were doing something wrong the board should have spoken and warned them first. You dont take such harsh decision at once... Why were Kamran and Umar not sent back from Australia? Why was Afridi not penalised in Australia by the team management? Why come out with such harsh decisions in one go which could badly damage the image of Pakistan cricket?         
	RANA NAVED-UL HASAN: Let me first get details, the board has done its job and now I will do what is necessary and right. But one thing is clear I have always given my best for Pakistan cricket.         
	RASHID LATIF: Younis I think has been treated unfairly for long now, what was his fault and yet he is banned for life. This is not the way to improve things in Pakistan cricket.         
	WAQAR YOUNIS: This announcement has come as a shock and surprise to me They were tough decisions but I think the board had a valid reason for taking them. These are big decisions that are initially hard to digest. I think the players, their fans and public have a right to know what were the reasons for taking these strong decisions. It will also clear any controversy and issues.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sir Rod clinches it for ex-Prime Minister
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sir Rod clinches it for ex-Prime Minister
    - Tendulkar fan Howard to succeed Pawar             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            John Howard                                 
	Calcutta: Eventually, it was left to an Australian to score for Cricket Australia (CA) in the tie-breaker stage of its face-off with New Zealand.         
	Had Sir Rod Eddington, an Australian who was once the British Airways CEO, not thrown his weight behind former Prime Minister John Howard, CA and New Zealand Cricket (NZC) would have continued the big stakes fight.         
	With Sir Rod, independent member of the five-man joint Nominations Committee, backing Howard, NZC nominee Sir John Anderson, an experienced administrator, lost out.         
	So, it is Howard who will first succeed Indias Sharad Pawar as the International Cricket Council (ICC) vice-president in June/July and, two years later, take over from him as its president.         
	Howard is an old Sachin Tendulkar fan.         
	By rotation, it fell on Australia and New Zealand to make a joint recommendation. They did, on Tuesday morning, after months of very hard negotiations.         
	Despite Big Brothers interest in the top position, NZC had not backed off, largely because Australias Malcolm Gray had been the ICC president till as recently as 2003 and, therefore, a New Zealander should have got the nod this time.         
	A joint statement issued by CA and NZC read: We are pleased that an eminent candidate in John Howard has agreed, after an exhaustive process, to take the role of joint Australia-New Zealand nominee for the ICC presidency. It was an extremely difficult decision and ultimately (we) relied on the input of Sir Rod Eddington, whom both cricket Boards respect enormously...         
	The statement made no mention of Sir John, a former chairman of NZC, described as a solid candidate by The Telegraphs sources.         
	As one put it: Having agreed to a process, NZC found itself stuck... It had no choice but to go along with the independent members views... Howard will definitely bring special skills, but strictly cricket-wise, Sir John was the solid candidate.         
	Howards nomination would have disappointed those within the ICC opposed to its continuing politicisation. Pawar, incidentally, has been a politician all his life.         
	At the same time, some feel that somebody of Howards stature is needed to push things on fronts such as India-Pakistan and England-Zimbabwe.         
	However, Howard will not be in the chair till the summer of 2012 and, by then, the wicket may get even more dicey.         
	For the record, Howard said: It is a great honour to be nominated by Cricket Australia and New Zealand Cricket for the vice-presidency of the International Cricket Council... Cricket has been one of my life-long passions and, if the ICC accepts my nomination, it will be a privilege to serve this great game.         
	The if bit is just a formality and the ICCs Executive Board should give its approval, without a debate, next month. No obstacles are foreseen at the next step, the annual conference in June/July, too.         
	It is learnt that chairman Alan Issacs was one of NZCs representatives on the Nominations Committee, the other being Chris Moller.         
	Former Test opener Wally Edwards and Geoff Tamblyn, who kept wickets for Victoria, represented CA. Both are on its board.         
	Meanwhile, the buzz in some quarters is that Sir John could be invited to play a role in the ICC. It is to be seen whether anything actually works out.

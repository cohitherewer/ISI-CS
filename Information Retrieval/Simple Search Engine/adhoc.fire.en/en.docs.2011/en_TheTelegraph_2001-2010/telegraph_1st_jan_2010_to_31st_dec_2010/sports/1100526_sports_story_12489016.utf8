	Javi and I were the only ones left to choose a number as we were the last to arrive and the truth is that neither of us were particularly excited about wearing the No. 2, Pedro told a news conference on Tuesday. So we drew lots and I got it, he added. In any case, it doesnt matter and it wont be a problem.

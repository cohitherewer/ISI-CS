                                                                                                                       7                                        Ill be fine for World Cup, says Rooney
            HENRY WINTER JOHN LEY            Rooney after being named the Player of the Year by PFA, in London, on Sunday                           
	Wayne Rooney, who was last night named PFA Player of the Year, has allayed fears over his fitness for the World Cup by declaring he will return for Manchester Uniteds potentially decisive final Premier League game of the season against Stoke City.         
	The Manchester United striker was rushed back from his recent ankle injury, caused by what the club describe as fatigue, and tweaked his groin in training. He missed Saturdays victory over Tottenham, with manager Sir Alex Ferguson suggesting that he would be missing for two or three weeks.         
	But those fears have now been allayed, with Rooney confirming last night that he expects to have recovered in time for the meeting with Stoke at Old Trafford on May 9, a game that could yet determine the outcome of this seasons Premier League title race.         
	The striker has also reassured Englands general manager, Franco Baldini, that he will be fully fit for South Africa. The groin will be fine for the World Cup, there are no worries about that, he said. Im hoping to play for United in the last game of the season.         
	That news will be a relief both to Ferguson and Fabio Capello, who has been anxiously monitoring his strikers fitness ever since he suffered the ankle injury in the Champions League tie against Bayern Munich earlier this month.         
	Englands first group game is not until June 12, when they face the United States in Rustenburg, but the squad is due to leave for a training camp in Austria on May 17 and to play Mexico in a friendly at Wembley on May 24.         
	Another layer of gloss was applied to Rooneys season on Sunday night when he was confirmed as the runaway winner of the PFA Award, beating off competition from Cesc Fabregas, Didier Drogba and Carlos Tevez.         
	Rooney, who helped United win the Carling Cup, has scored 34 goals for the club this season, his best-ever tally, and this is the fourth successive season that an Old Trafford player has received the accolade after Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo (twice).

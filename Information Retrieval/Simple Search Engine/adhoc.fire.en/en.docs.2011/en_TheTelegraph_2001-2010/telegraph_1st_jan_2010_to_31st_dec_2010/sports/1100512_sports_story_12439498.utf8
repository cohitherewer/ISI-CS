            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Indian batting, led by skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, flattered to deceive yet again in their crucial Super Eight match against Sri Lanka at the Beausejour Stadium in Gros Islet on Tuesday.         
	After having scored 90 for the loss of one wicket in the first 10 overs, the Indians managed only 73 in the next 10, thereby finishing on 163 for five in the stipulated 20 overs. But India came into the match knowing exactly what they had to do in order to keep their chances for a semi-final berth alive  win by 20 or more runs. Which means they have to restrict the Lankans within 143.         
	The Indian bowlers made early inroads as Ashish Nehra and debutant Ranganath Vinay Kumar removed openers Mahela Jayawardene (4) and Sanath Jayasuriya (0), respectively, in the first two overs. However, Tillekaratne Dilshan hit a flurry of boundaries. Lankans were 41 for two after six overs.         
	Dinesh Karthik started off brilliantly, dispatching Angelo Mathews very first delivery of the match to the boundary with a fierce square cut.         
	Another boundary off Mathews over mid-on showed that the Tamil Nadu captain was intent upon justifying his selection over statemate Murali Vijay who failed to perform in three consecutive matches.         
	However, just when he was looking dangerous, Lasith Malinga, brought on in the fifth over, got Karthik caught and bowled.         
	Indias only centurion in Twenty20 Internationals, Suresh Raina, who has inarguably looked the best among the Indian batsmen, announced his arrival with three boundaries in a single Thilan Tushara over.         
	He started with a glance that went for a boundary through the short fine-leg region. The second one was over the bowlers head while the third was clipped through mid-wicket.         
	Gambhir is passing through a rough patch but the opener showed glimpses of his old self with some sweetly timed drives. Gambhir was dropped by Sangakkara in Mathews second and the teams third over and, having been gifted a life, looked in a mood to punish the Lankans for the costly miss.         
	The duo added 66 runs for the second wicket before Malinga accounted for the Delhi southpaw. Trying to guide one down the third-man region, Gambhir edged it to Sangakkara after having scored 41 (32 balls, 3x4).         
	Dhoni, who promoted himself up the order, danced down the track to hit Sanath Jayasuriya for a big six over the widish mid-on.         
	Raina, who hit offie Suraj Randiv for a majestic six over deep mid-wicket, reached his half-century off 37 deliveries.         
	However, both Raina and Dhonis big hits suddenly went missing. Credit should also be given to the Lanka bowlers as they varied the length and used the slower deliveries and slow bouncers to good effect.         
	Raina could manage only 13 runs in the 10 deliveries before he holing out at deep mid-wicket off Thusaras bowling. Yuvraj Singh (1), who is going through a terrible phase that began with IPL III, couldnt clear the deep square-leg boundary.         
	The most disappointing performance was from Dhoni who managed an unbeaten 23 but not before consuming 19 deliveries, certainly poor by his standards.         
	The Indian captain clearly struggled as he failed to connect the big hits so much so that he couldnt hit a single boundary after that initial six off Jayasuriya.         
	Even Yusuf Pathan managed 13 off nine deliveries before falling on the last ball of the innings.

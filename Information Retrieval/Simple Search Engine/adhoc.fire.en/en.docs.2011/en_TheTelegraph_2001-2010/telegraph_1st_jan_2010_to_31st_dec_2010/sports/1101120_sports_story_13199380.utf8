The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Not worried with form, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Not worried with form, says Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hopes that he and Suresh Raina will be back among runs in the final Test, against New Zealand.         
	At a media conference, on Friday, Dhoni also hinted that he would welcome a break during the one-day International series against the Black Caps.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Missing practice before the final Test         
	As far as practice is concerned, at times its better not to practice With the amount of cricket we play, it might help us It might just be a blessing in disguise. Players get rest and they might play better. Anyway, its not in our hands, so no point discussing....         
	On his and Rainas form         
	As far as Raina is concerned, hes not got runs in just a couple of games He is a positive guy, and at times, he will get out playing the big shots. Its not a big concern, especially since the top five guys are scoring really well We are hoping that in this game, both of us will get good scores. I am batting quite well in the nets. At times you get out because you choose to play a wrong shot. I am not too much bothered about it.         
	If there are plans of playing an extra bowler         
	It will be difficult to go with an extra fast bowler... Thats out of the picture now. You might get some reverse swing but not enough to go with three seamers...         
	Harbhajan Singhs bowling         
	There is always a bit of pressure on him since Anilbhai retired. He has been our strike bowler since then... I think he is doing pretty well, but has been unlucky because quite a few catches have gone down.         
	On Pragyan Ojhas role         
	Ojha is bowling really well. His role among the four bowlers is to contain the batsmen.         
	Zaheers injury         
	First of all, we are hopeful that he will be fit for the first Test in South Africa. We have been playing considerable amount of cricket in the last few years and it has been the same bowling attack. They have been in and out because of injuries.         
	Bench strength in bowling         
	The fact of the matter is that they are the best we have got. Unless they get experience in international cricket, we wont know how good they are.         
	The wicket         
	If the spinners get a bit of bounce it will be good. Indias known more for turning tracks but I havent seen one in the past few Tests. This wicket looks a bit dry, there is some grass I am hoping there will be spin and bounce.         
	Rotation policy         
	We are trying to discuss this issue with the BCCI, but at the same time every series is important. If the seniors are available, we might get some time off from the ODIs Still, we have to feature with the best squad that is available.

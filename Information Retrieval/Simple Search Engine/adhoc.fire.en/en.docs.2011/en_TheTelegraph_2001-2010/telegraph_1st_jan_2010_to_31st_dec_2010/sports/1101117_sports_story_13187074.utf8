            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Suresh Raina (right) with teammate Sreesanth, in Hyderabad, on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	Hyderabad: In a veiled criticism of the Ahmedabad and Hyderabad wickets, which failed to produce a result, MS Dhoni quipped it would require a 10-day Test to produce a result on such strips.         
	Speaking at a media conference after yet another draw, on Tuesday, the Indian skipper said Zaheer Khans injury made it tough for India to force a result.               
	The following are excerpts         
	His views on the Test         
	Well, both the departments  batting and bowling  did well. The wicket supported the batsmen and didnt help the bowlers. So, everyone did as well as they could.         
	If Zaheers absence became decisive         
	You cant say that the others are also good. You can say that he has been our spearheadWhatever has been the track, he has got us wickets. So, it became a little tough without him. Also the fact that the wicket didnt help the bowlers made it difficult for us.         
	On what could have produced a result         
	A 10-day Test may be I believe if the wickets dont have much for the bowlers, then it is very difficult to force a result.         
	Whether Harbhajans batting form will help India field five bowlers in the future         
	That will be a tough call. We have always been happy playing four bowlers. Putting an added responsibility (of scoring runs) on Harbhajan will create more pressure for him. We dont want to look at him as an all-rounder. He is just a specialist bowler who can bat. But yes, his good form with the bat gives us an option to think about the matter of playing five bowlers.         
	Which Harbhajan would he prefer: as a batsman or a bowler         
	If the situation is like the one in Ahmedabad (first Test), then I would like runs from Harbhajan If it is a flat track, I would like wickets from him.         
	If Ishant Sharma could have been preferred to Pragyan Ojha         
	But Ojha has been doing well He is one bowler who can bowl long spells and can contain runs too At the same time, he picks up wickets.         
	On where India lost the plot         
	The first hour-and-a-half was crucial. We needed wickets and Zaheer felt he was fit to bowl. But after the new ball was taken, Zaheer had to leave the field because he wasnt feeling comfortable. So, we were left with Sreesanth and two spinners. Having a bowler short makes things difficult. If you cant get early wickets, the target shoots up and then it is difficult to force a result.         
	Whether the Indian bowlers leaked too many runs         
	The New Zealanders batted really well and waited for the lose balls. On these kind of tracks, when you are not getting wickets, the bowlers tend to try too much That is when a few extra runs are given away.         
	On New Zealands impressive show in India         
	Nowadays, the foreign teams do not have to think much about facing a turning track in India, because they are a rare phenomenon now. We usually get flat wickets. So, its not like the past and that is why the overseas teams find it easier. Except for the Kanpur and CCI (Brabourne) wickets, I dont remember any track, which has produced turn in recent times.

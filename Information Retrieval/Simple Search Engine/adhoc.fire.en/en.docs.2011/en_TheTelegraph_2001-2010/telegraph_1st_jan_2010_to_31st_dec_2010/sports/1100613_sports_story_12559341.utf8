The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Serbs face Ghana challenge

	It has always been fascinating to watch the African nations in action. Whether it be Roger Millas Cameroon of 1990 or the Senegal of 2002, players from the continent have never failed to leave behind an indelible impression on the minds of football lovers. As a keen follower of the game, I am bracing up for the intriguing meeting between the Black Stars of Ghana and the determined Serbia in Group D on Sunday.         
	For me, the Germans are undoubtedly the favourites from this group but if their fans dismiss Ghana or Serbia as also-rans, they do so at their own peril.         
	For me, both teams will start on an even keel on Sunday. The main reason will be the nerves associated with the first match of a tournament. Most teams are psyched for a point in the opener and plan their subsequent campaign accordingly to ensure passage into the second round.         
	Therefore, neither Ghana nor Serbia would like to lose their first match. I expect both to opt for a safe start. However, things can radically change if one of the teams gets a goal early on. Maybe we will then get to watch more creative build-ups.         
	It will be a match in which the fans can expect to see completely distinct styles of play. One is the African style combining power, agility, stamina and a never-say-die spirit. On the other hand, the Serbians with their distinctly eastern European flair will be slightly different from the top continental teams like Germany, Italy and England.         
	However, the absence of Michael Essien will definitely have an effect on the Ghanaian side. Essien has been the fulcrum in the star studded Chelsea line-up and would lent more solidity to the African side. The manner in which he helps out the defence and assists the forwards makes him a player very hard to replace.         
	But one cant discount Inter Milan midfielder Sulley Muntari who will have to double up as scorer alongside the experienced Gyan Asamoah. Winning the Champions League with the Italians would have given Muntari the confidence a player needs before a big tournament.         
	It was really sad that Ghanas journey in the last World Cup was cut short by Brazil in a 3-0 second round loss. But they have retained the core of that team, which is always an advantage. That coach Milovan Rajevac is a Serbian means there will be a few special tips for the Black Stars. Rajevac certainly would know more than anyone else about the Serbian style of play and would make his boys aware about what to expect.         
	As to Serbia, all eyes will be on heavyweight defender Nemanja Vidic. Vidic, rock solid in the heart of the Manchester United back-four, is considered one of the best central defenders in the world. A tough tackler who is equally good in aerial duels, Vidic will surely make life difficult for the Ghanaians.         
	Neither can one ignore skipper Dejan Stankovic who has been a regular fixture in the Inter line-up. Ditto Valencia forward Nicola Zigic who has had a good season in La Liga.         
	On Sunday, there will be no Rooney, Kaka or Messi to change the complexion of the game with individual brilliance. But the absence of megastars doesnt mean we wont get to see entertaining football. There are a few who are stars but these are matches where one would vouch for collective effort producing great results.         
	As of now it is 55-45 in favour of Ghana but the best thing about the beautiful game is its unpredictability.         
	Likely teams         
	Serbia (4-4-2): 1-Vladimir Stojkovic, 6-Branislav Ivanovic, 5-Nemanja Vidic, 13-Aleksandar Lukovic, 16-Ivan Obradovic, 17-Milos Krasic, 10-Dejan Stankovic, 11-Nenad Milijas, 14-Milan Jovanovic, 15-Nikola Zigic, 9-Marko Pantelic         
	Ghana (4-4-2): 22-Richard Kingson, 4-John Pantsil, 5-John Mensah, 15-Isaac Vorsah, 19-Lee Addy, 6-Anthony Annan, 21-Kwadwo Asamoah, 10-Stephen Appiah, 23-Kevin-Prince Boateng, 3-Asamoah Gyan, 12-Prince Tagoe         
	Referee: Hector Baldassi (Argentina)

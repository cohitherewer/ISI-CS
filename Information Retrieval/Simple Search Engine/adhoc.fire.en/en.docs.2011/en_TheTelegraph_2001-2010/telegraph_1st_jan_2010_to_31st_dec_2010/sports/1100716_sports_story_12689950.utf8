            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Syed Nayeemuddin will make a return to active coaching after a hiatus of almost three years when he replaces Shabbir Ali at the helm at Mohammedan Sporting.         
	Nayeemuddin, who last coached the Bangladesh national side, in 2007, will be officially unveiled as the coach on Friday evening. He will be meeting his players on Saturday morning.         
	Its a great honour to coach a club like Mohammedan Sporting. I am hopeful that all of us, the players, myself, the officials will put in loads of hard work.         
	We have set high standards. Obviously, the primary target will be to qualify for the elite division of the I-League, Nayeemuddin told The Telegraph on Thursday.

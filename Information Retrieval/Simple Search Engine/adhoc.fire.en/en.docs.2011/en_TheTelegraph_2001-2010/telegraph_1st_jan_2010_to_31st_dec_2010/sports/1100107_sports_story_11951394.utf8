The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | After hue and cry, brothers in arms
                                                                                                                       7                                        After hue and cry, brothers in arms
            A STAFF REPORTER            Arindam Bhattacharya. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: It was one hell of a night for them, Churchill Brothers coach Carlos Pareira admitted Wednesday, recollecting Tuesdays events.         
	The incidents have been so exhausting, that Odafe Okolie and his mates were simply not in a mood to oblige the waiting mediapersons when the reigning I-League champions checked in at the team hotel on Wednesday.         
	That lady (the airhostess) wanted cheap publicity. No one knew her and everyone knows who is Odafe. She and her colleagues tried to malign the image of an innocent man. But we all knew that the Almighty will do justice. These people couldnt prove the allegations levelled against Odafe or the others. Truth always prevails, and it was proved again. If one talks about Odafe being dangerous, its on the field. Off it, he is one of the most well-mannered, polite man one would ever come across, the Brazilian said, fuming.         
	Odafe sneaked into his room and Im innocent was all he was willing to say.         
	When we spoke to the police authorities, the lady who alleged Odafe tried to molest her, could not substantiate her claim. I was sitting just a couple of rows behind Odafe. He was talking to Felix when his hand accidentally touched the airhostess, and he immediately apologised. She accepted the apology then, but later things went out of hand, Pareira said.         
	Kalu and Arindam were not even involved in the incident. Kalu was in fact sleeping. However, when the crew members started making false allegations against Odafe, the two protested as any teammate would do. Suddenly, they detained three for questioning after landing. Then we decided were not going to travel without our players, the coach added.         
	Tuesdays incidents showed Arindam how bad things can get. Only a month back, the goalkeeper saw how good things can get when his hands ensured India won the SAFF Cup final. He was the hero back then. The 21-year-old Sodepur lad was turned into a villain on Tuesday. However, he does not repent his decision to defend Odafe.         
	If a similar situation arises again, Ill again protest against this kind of injustice. Since she (the airhostess) was a woman, no one was willing to listen to Odafe. I stood by him and tried to explain his side of the story. They suddenly tried to implicate me. I have no complaints against the police authorities. They were very co-operative and also offered us food when we were detained, Arindam said.         
	What hurt the India international more was the fact that nobody at the airport supported them till Alemao arrived.         
	Here was Indias champion team and no one was listening to us. Odafe is a devoted family man. What will his family go through after seeing his name flashed across the news channels, newspapers and websites for something which he hasnt done, the goalie said.

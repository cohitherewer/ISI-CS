The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB-Chirag clash now on Friday
                                                                                                                       7                                      EB-Chirag clash now on Friday
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengals I-League match against Chirag United, scheduled for Thursday, has been deferred by a day. The Federation Cup champions had requested the organisers to defer the match due to injury problems as well as the fatigue factor.         
	The red and gold brigade played six matches within a fortnight during the Federation Cup and the players got hardly any time to recover.         
	Although the match had been originally scheduled for Friday, the organisers had changed the dates as police authorities cited inability to provide security.         
	Ultimately, as it turns out, East Bengal had their way and the match was re-scheduled according to their preference.         
	Meanwhile, the club registered Budhiram Tudu and Saikat Saha Roy.

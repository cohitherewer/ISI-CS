	New Delhi: An injury ridden Indian football team Friday left for Dubai for a three-week training camp in the desert city. The Indians will also play a couple of friendlies against local clubs as part of the preparations for the Asian Cup final rounds in January 2011.         
	At least half-a-dozen players in the 23-strong team are injured and five of them have hardly participated in the I-League this year. While Mahesh Gawli is not travelling with the team due to a hamstring injury, the worst affected is the goalkeepers slot. With an injured Subrata Paul ruled out of action for at least one week, coach Bob Houghton is left with only one fit goalie, Subhasis Roychowdhury.         
	Sources in the All India Football Federation (AIFF) said Houghton might ask for either Gurupreet Singh or Arindam Bhattacharya to replace Paul for the Dubai camp.

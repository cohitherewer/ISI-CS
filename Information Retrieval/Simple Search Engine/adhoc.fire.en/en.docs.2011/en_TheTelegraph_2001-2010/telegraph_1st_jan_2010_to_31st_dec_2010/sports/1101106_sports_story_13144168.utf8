                                                                                                                       7                                      Favourites Italy are not complacent
                      
	San Diego: Holders Italy are striving to avoid any hint of complacency, as they prepare to face an under-strength United States in this weekends Fed Cup final.         
	The Italians are heavy favourites to win the title for the third time in five years against a US lineup deprived of their top two players, Serena and Venus Williams, because of injury.         
	On paper, were favourites but thats the big trap, Italy captain Corrado Barazzutti said during practice at the San Diego Sports Arena on Thursday. We must be very careful.         
	Barazzutti said he was not concerned that the Williams sisters would miss the showpiece womens event.         
	Its not our problem the Williams dont play against us in this Fed Cup, he added.         
	Serena pulled out of the Fed Cup final earlier this month after re-injuring her right foot from over-training just 13 days after Venus ended her season due to a nagging knee injury.         
	In their absence, the US will field three singles players ranked outside the top 55  Bethanie Mattek-Sands (58th), Melanie Oudin 67th and Coco Vandeweghe 114th.         
	The Italians will be represented by French Open champion Francesca Schiavone, the world No. 7, 23rd-ranked Flavia Pennetta, Roberta Vinci (38th) and Sara Errani (42nd).         
	The final begins with the opening singles on Saturday. The reverse singles and concluding doubles are scheduled for Sunday. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan hit by injuries
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bagan hit by injuries
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: An injury-hit Mohun Bagan, currently lying in the fifth position, would be aiming to capture full points when they take on Air India in an I-League encounter here Sunday.         
	Ours is a club with rich history and in any tournament we have always been at the top. We badly need three points, coach Karim Bencharifa said on the eve of the tie.         
	We have four away matches on the trot. So, its psychologically important to start with a win, he added.         
	A host of Bagan players  Deepak Mondal, Rakesh Masih, Manish Maithani and Edeh Chidi, Nallappan Mohanraj, NS Manju  have either been already ruled out or are unlikely to start because of injuries.         
	Also, Snehashis Chakraborty was also yet to recover from an injury.         
	With so many of them out, you should be asking me whom I am going to play, Bencharifa said, trying to make light of his predicament.         
	Bagan, on 14 points, are behind Mahindra United, Dempo SC, Chirag United and Churchill Brothers in the league table. Air India would be without Vijith Shetty, due to suspension, and Soccor Velho, who was down with malarial fever.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sangakkara regrets the no ball incident
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sangakkara regrets the no ball incident
            A CORRESPONDENT            Suraj Randiv and Tillekaratne Dilshan during a practice session in Dambulla, on Wednesday                           
	Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara, on Wednesday, regretted the Suraj Randiv no ball incident that robbed Virender Sehwag a chance to score his 13th ODI century.         
	Sangakkaras interaction with the media was some hours before Sri Lanka Crickets decision to ban Randiv and fine Tillekaratne Dilshan.               
	The following are excerpts               
	His take on the no ball episode         
	I regret what happened overall. We need to take up the responsibility as a team and we need to get back to the right mindset ahead for Thursdays game. Its up to the board to take a decision. The board has said they will take action. I had a talk with my teammates on the whole episode and I poured my heart out. I had a chat with the team manager as well. Now, its up to the board to decide on the matter.         
	Impact of the incident on Randiv         
	At anytime, we stand up for what is right and try to protect the players who are not at fault. If something happens due to lack of experience or due to influence, and we feel that the player needs to be supported, we support. But at the same time, we hope all players will support the team as well. At the end of the day, what matters is the team. No one can win matches alone.         
	Measures he took once the match was over         
	I addressed the team immediately after the game. The board has now taken the matter out of the team, they have instructed the manager to have an inquiry done. I have made my views known to the board and the manager. The manager has done everything according to instructions he has received.         
	If it was a deliberate no ball         
	That is also going to be a part of the inquiry. When that comes out, the board will act accordingly.         
	A forgettable experience         
	Its a grey area. At the end of the day, everything is not in black and white, I think everyone realises that. I think all teams have gone through similar experiences.         
	Impact of the incident on upcoming matches         
	First of all, as professionals, whatever happens before or after any game doesnt matter when you go out there in the field the next day. There the focus is to win the game and try things out. Secondly, you just need to make sure that you keep trying to impress upon players that the responsibility of playing cricket is not all the time about runs and wickets and wining Winning and losing is part of the game, the manner in which you play the game and the manner in which you present yourself on and off the field is also important. Its not just about the Sri Lankan cricketers, its the responsibility of all international cricketers. This incident was unfortunate. Its not that Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has to take the sole proprietorship of all unsavoury on-field incidents.         
	Reputation and goodwill of Lankan cricket         
	Theres been some damage done to the reputation. But that reputation cant be taken away from us completely, because over the years, we have done well. Its not the first time an incident like this has happened in the world. There have been incidents similar to this.         
	Any message for Sehwag         
	I dont think theres anything special to say to Sehwag. You know he said one thing at the presentation ceremony and something else at the post-match press conference. We have taken the necessary steps. I have spoken to Dhoni and Gary Kirsten. Its the responsibility of all the players to be within that spirit. We cant expect just one side to keep making the advances and holding out the hand while it has been sensationalised by other players. I think everyone should move on from this incident.         
	If he was unaware about the rules         
	As a side, we were under the impression that even under normal circumstances a no-ball fetches you runs. I was under the impression that Sehwag was on 105. We werent aware that he has been denied a 100. It was Tony Greig who informed me at the post-match presentation that Sehwag was denied a hundred. That was a surprise to me I dont think anyone understood the intricacies of the law in first place. It doesnt matter whether the law is right or not. The laws are made with certain things in mind. We had no idea that Sehwag was denied a hundred.         
	Changes in the side because of that incident         
	If there are changes going to happen, it should be because our board wants them. We choose the team according to the track and the opposition. There will be some changes in the spin department We might bring some changes in the batting department as well. But we will decide about that later since we have a few things to consider before coming to a conclusion.

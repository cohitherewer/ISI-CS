            A STAFF REPORTER            Poulami Ghatak makes her point, during a felicitation, in the city, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                             
	Calcutta: Bengal paddlers got a voice in Delhi Commonwealth Games (CWG) silver medallist Poulami Ghatak when the latter, on Thursday, created a stir by slamming the states apathy towards table tennis players.         
	Poulami, who won silver in the womens team event with Mouma Das and grabbed a bronze in the womens doubles at the Delhi CWG, raised a storm by asking state minister of sports and youth affairs Kanti Ganguly to stop neglecting the states paddlers.         
	The West Bengal Table Tennis Association (WBTTA) organised a programme to felicitate Subhajit Saha, Poulami Ghatak, Mouma Das and Soumyadip Roy, all members of the Indian CWG medal-winning squad on Thursday. The sports minister, who was one of the invitees, was caught off-guard by Poulamis grievance in public.         
	After Ganguly announced the state governments decision to felicitate 10 CWG medallists from the state with cash awards (Rs 5 lakh for gold, Rs 3 lakh for silver and Rs 2 lakh for bronze) on November 2, Ghatak urged the sports minister to be more considerate.         
	We have been performing well consistently. We feel bad when we see other states awarding their athletes, but hardly anything happens here. If we are awarded with a flat or a land, we can proudly say that we have earned it for our Commonwealth performance, she said.         
	In a damage control, Ganguly said: We always implement any recommendation made by the state government or the Bengal Olympic Association and if any message comes to us to this effect, we will definitely implement them.         
	For now, I shall definitely ask the sports department to look into the matter.         
	Poulamis womens doubles partner, Mouma Das, seconded the paddlers grievance. This is the first time we are being awarded by the state government.         
	There have been times when different states, hosting the nationals, have invited us to represent them. But we have always declined such offers saying that we are Bengalis and we will only play for Bengal. But despite our loyalty and love, the state has never bothered to congratulate us, forget even sending a bouquet.         
	Its unfair to gift flats to just three medal winners because they are not financially sound. When we started, we werent rich. Now, we have jobs, sponsors, but its our parents who bled themselves to get us here. So, there should be some parity, Mouma said.         
	For the record, the state government has decided to give flats to weightlifter Sukhen Dey, para-swimmer Prasanta Karmakar and athlete Rahamatullah.         
	While WBTTA president and former Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee denounced such materialistic comparison in a felicitation ceremony, Poulami said her emotional outburst was absolutely unintended.         
	Later speaking to The Telegraph, she said: The outburst was an expression of pent up emotions. It was in store for the past 15 years. I have been waiting for, at least, a pat on the back, but I got nothing from them.         
	We hardly get to see or meet people like the sports minister in person. Today, I met him and I was too emotional to control myself. It was like a request that they should also think about us. Why are we left out and for what reason?         
	Incidentally, the Bengal paddlers are not the only ones complaining. Karmakar, who won bronze in the 50m freestyle in the CWG, had shifted base from Bengal to Haryana after he was allegedly ignored and ill-treated by the home state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pakistan make final
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pakistan make final
                      
	Wellington: All-rounder Hammad Azam inspired Pakistan to a four-wicket win over the West Indies at Christchurch on Monday to book their place in the final of the under-19 World Cup.         
	The second finalist will be determined in the other semi-final between Sri Lanka and Australia on Wednesday.         
	Pakistan won the toss and struck early with two wickets in the first four overs before West Indies opener Kraigg Brathwaite led the fightback as the Caribbean side posted 212 for eight in their 50 overs.         
	The West Indies appeared to be in command when they tied the Pakistan openers down and had them at 49-4 after 20 overs.         
	But Man-of-the-Match Azam turned the innings around with a whirlwind 92 off 93 balls, including 10 boundaries, as Pakistan reached their target with 16 balls to spare.         
	Meanwhile, Indian colts earned a consolation victory when they beat their English counterparts by seven wickets in a fifth place play-off semi-final match on Monday.         
	Opting to bat, England were all out for 176 in 49.2 overs.         
	The Indian colts comfortably reached the target in 36.4 overs losing only three wickets.

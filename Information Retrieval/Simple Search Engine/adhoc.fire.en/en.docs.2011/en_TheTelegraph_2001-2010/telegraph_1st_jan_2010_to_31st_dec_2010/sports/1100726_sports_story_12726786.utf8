The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Finn and Shahzad recalled
                                                                                                                       7                                      Finn and Shahzad recalled
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The England selectors, on Sunday, named a 12-man squad for the first Test Match against Pakistan starting Thursday at Trent Bridge, according to a press release.         
	Middlesex seamer Steven Finn returns to the squad following a successful Test series against Bangladesh as does Yorkshires Ajmal Shahzad, who is looking to build on his Test debut from the same series.         
	National selector Geoff Miller said: We have picked a very strong squad for the first Test against a Pakistan side that will be high on confidence following their recent win against Australia.         
	Weve been encouraged by the form shown by a number of our players involved in the county championship matches this week. Also, those that are coming back from injury or rest, such as Kevin Pietersen, have been working very hard ahead of the first Test next week.         
	Ian Bells untimely foot injury during the NatWest series was obviously a disappointing blow but he is now focused on his rehabilitation and should make a full recovery in due course. Ians absence provides other batsmen with the chance to impress against a world class Pakistan bowling attack.         
	The squad         
	Andrew Strauss (captain), James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Matt Prior, Ajmal Shahzad, Graeme Swann, Jonathon Trott

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I will work harder, says Dev Varman 
                                                                                                                       7                                        I will work harder, says Dev Varman 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Indias Somdev Dev Varman hits a return to Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia in Chennai on Wednesday.                           
	Chennai: The defeat against Janko Tipsarevic would cost Somdev Dev Varman 130 points and a huge dip in the rankings but the Indian youngster is not too bothered at the moment.         
	Frankly, I am not too concerned, said Somdev after the match. Points do come and go. I will work harder and move up in the ladder, he said confidently.         
	To improve the quality of his game is Somdevs top priority. Today (Wednesday), I didnt hit too poorly. I wasnt really bad. Perhaps there were a host of things that I didnt do. Those are the areas I am focussing at the moment. Hopefully, I shall be able to do that, he said.         
	Asked what exactly went wrong against Tipsarevic, the Indian said: I cant answer that. Janko is a fine player and there is no question he played well. He simply played great tennis in the middle. He was definitely the better player.         
	Despite being outclassed against Tipsarevic, Somdev is confident of having a good run in 2010.         
	I started here with a good singles win. I am sure I will be able to keep up the momentum.         
	For the next few days, Somdev said, he would focus on doubles.         
	I want to do well in the doubles here. After that I am going to Melbourne to play the Australian Open. I have to improve tactically. To start the match, I was hitting pretty well. Probably I pushed too much on my own serve. That could be one of the reasons why I lost on serves, said Somdev.         
	Meanwhile, defending champion Marin Cilic, who survived a scare before beating Marcel Granollers 6-7(3), 6-3, 6-4 to move into the quarters, said at a press conference that he was luck to win the match.         
	I think he also played well today (Wednesday). I was lucky to make a comeback, after being a break down in the second set, and win. I played to my level, Cilic said.         
	His tactics worked well in the beginning and then I found my rhythm easily in the next two sets.         
	Earlier, I had two break points in the third set but he came back with some offensive play and saved two good points. He was returning good and I was not keeping many aces. I was getting my first serves so well that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kohli angers the crowd
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kohli angers the crowd
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The match between the Delhi DareDevils and the Royal Challengers Bangalore had to be stopped for a couple of minutes during the DareDevils innings because of crowd trouble.         
	It happened in the 10th over when Royal Challengers Virat Kohli, a local boy, ran to take a catch of David Warner. While the spectators at the north stands kept on urging him to drop the catch, Kohli made no mistake and then turned around to gesticulate at the crowd.         
	A section of the crowd, obviously irked by Kohlis behaviour, threw some missiles on the ground forcing the umpires to call for security. The situation, however, was quickly brought under control by the securitymen and the play resumed.         
	Meanwhile, Anil Kumble was clearly unhappy with the wicket.         
	It wasnt the right wicket for T20, remarked the former India captain after the match. Toss proved to be a crucial factor. We expected to keep them under 160. That was a gettable total, but 180 was big.         
	DareDevils captain Gautam Gambhir agreed that winning the toss helped his team.

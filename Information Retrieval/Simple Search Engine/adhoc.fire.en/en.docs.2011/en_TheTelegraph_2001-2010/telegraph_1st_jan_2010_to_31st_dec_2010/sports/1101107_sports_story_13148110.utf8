The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need early wickets: Sreesanth
                                                                                                                       7                                        Need early wickets: Sreesanth
            OUR CORRESPONDENT    
	Ahmedabad: Sreesanth was pleased as punch after he trapped the days centurion, Jesse Ryder, towards the fag end of the day on Saturday.         
	Striving to make an impact after spending a long time in wilderness, it was a stern test for the Kerala seamer to perform in a dead track like Motera. But Sreesanth showed courage and bowled his heart out. He almost had Ryder after lunch after the all-rounder sliced at a widish delivery, but Dravid failed to hold on to it at first slip.         
	But Sreesanth walked back, to run in with more steam and ferocity. I should have got Ryder earlier. It would have been good if that catch had not gone down. But by Gods grace, I got the lbw, Sreesanth said after the days play on Saturday.         
	Even though he (Ryder) got a hundred, we are still in the game. If we can pick up a few wickets in the first session tomorrow, the game is still on. Its a flat track, but even on flat tracks, results do come. But, you all know what Ahmedabad behaves like, he said.         
	Even Sreesanth couldnt stop from praising Williamson. Very honestly, he looked very solid in defence, but it is a very flat track. You cant judge a player on a flat track. But theres no doubt that both of them played well At the end of the day, it was good to break the partnership, he said.         
	The India seamer said there was no assistance for pacers or spinners alike from the wicket, but he was happy with the overall performance.

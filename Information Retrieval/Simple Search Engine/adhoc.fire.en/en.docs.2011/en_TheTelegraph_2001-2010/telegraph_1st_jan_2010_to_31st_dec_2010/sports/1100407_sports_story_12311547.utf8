	Kuwait City: Kuwaits Al Qadsia scored three goals in seven minutes as they had little trouble defeating East Bengal 4-1 in a Group D match of the AFC Cup at Mohammed Al Hamad stadium, here on Tuesday.         
	Al Qadsia opened the scoring after 30 minutes through Soud Al Mejmed before Abdulaziz Al Meshan netted his sides second six minutes later.         
	East Bengal were stunned further when Ahmad Ajab made it 3-0 just one minute later and though they pulled a goal back after 59 minutes through Mehtab Hossain, substitute striker Bader Al Motawaa gabbed a fourth for the home side five minutes before the end.         
	Al Qadsia were the better side in the early stages of the game and had their first chance after 15 minutes when Al Meshans effort went over the crossbar.         
	But the pressure from the hosts paid off after 30 minutes when Al Meshan crossed into the area for Ajab, who knocked the ball on for Al Mejmed to score. Things got even better for Al Qadsia when Al Meshan struck six minutes later, stepping up to curl a powerful free kick into the top right corner past East Bengal goalkeeper Priyant Singh.         
	The game was over as a contest one minute later when Jehad Al Hussien sent a long cross from the back to Ajab who broke the offside trap and edged past the goalkeeper before scoring into the empty net.         
	East Bengal started the second half brightly and should have pulled a goal back in the 58th minute when Yusif Yakubu hit a rasping free kick that was tipped over the crossbar by Al Qadsia goalkeeper Ali Al Rasheed.         
	However, the Indians did score one minute later when Alvito DCunha sent a neat pass back to Mehtab, who drove a shot into the top corner past Al Rasheed. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hockey India to go ahead with elections
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hockey India to go ahead with elections
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: It turned out to be a day of dramatic developments with Delhi High Court and sports ministry in the thick of things, but nothing can stop Hockey India (HI) from going ahead with its much-awaited elections on Wednesday.         
	After three postponements, incumbent HI president Vidya Stokes and secretary Narinder Batra were hoping for an easy victory before the Delhi High Court came out with a verdict on Tuesday, calling HI a private body and recognising the KPS Gill-led Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) as the lone authorised body.         
	The court ordered HI and sports ministry to issue clarification, saying HI was a private body. The ministry responded by withdrawing S Mendiratta, who had been appointed as government observer for elections.         
	In deference to Honourable Courts directive, the government has decided not to depute an election observer, the ministry said in a statement.         
	The sports ministry said it would comply with the court order but since HI enjoys the support of the international hockey federation (FIH), the government will seek co-operation of IHF and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA), as well, to resolve the crisis.         
	HI officials, meanwhile, are adamant to go ahead with the election. We will go ahead. All state federation officials are here for the elections and, as directed by the High Court, we have given them the clarification on HIs status, a HI official said.         
	Besides, FIH observer Antonio von Ondarza has also arrived, he said.         
	Former India captain Pargat Singh has also thrown his hat in the fray but not many think he stands any real chance on Wednesday. He is believed to have the blessings of the sports ministry but the Stokes-Batra combination is backed by the all powerful IOA president Suresh Kalmadi.

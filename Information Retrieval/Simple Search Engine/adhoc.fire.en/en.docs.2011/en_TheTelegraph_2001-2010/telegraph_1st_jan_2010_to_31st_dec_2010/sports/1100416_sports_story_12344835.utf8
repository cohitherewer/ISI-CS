            A STAFF REPORTER            Yuvraj Singh                           
	Calcutta: New Zealand wicketkeeper-batsman Brendon McCullum considers Yuvraj Singh as one of the stars to watch out for in the upcoming World Twenty20 in the West Indies.         
	Apart from Yuvraj, McCullum picked Sri Lankas Tillekaratne Dilshan and West Indies Chris Gayle as ones who can make a big impact in the T20 event.         
	I think Yuvraj Singh is a guy who will entertain a lot of audiences. Chris Gayle and Tillekaratne Dilshan are pretty amazing for West Indies and Sri Lanka, McCullum said.         
	Talking about the bowlers, he said: I think on the bowling front, guys like Shaun Tait are ones to watch There are any number of guys round the world who can do well in the West Indies.         
	Speaking on his own teams chances in the event, the right-handed batsman said that much depended on how they perform on the day. He also added that though they are not in the hardest of groups in the World T20, their work wouldnt be easy as they would still they have to win matches progress in the tournament.         
	It will depend on how we do on the day In Twenty20 cricket, it really does depend on how any side does on any given day. While our group is probably not the hardest group going round, theres no direct entry into the next round, said McCullum.

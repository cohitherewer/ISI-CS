                                                                                                                       7                                      Injured Saina pulls out
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: Junior world champion and Olympian Saina Nehwal has withdrawn from the 74th Senior National Badminton tournament due to pain in the knee.         
	The world No. 8 shuttler from Hyderabad said that she was yet to recover from a knee injury and was going to skip the Nationals as well as other Super Series tournaments.         
	The knee still hurts. So, I have pulled out of the Korean Open recently.         
	I was here to play in the team event, which too, I had to skip due to pain in the knee.         
	I need to recover fully from the pain before the Malaysian Open later this month, she said.         
	She was supposed to represent Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) in the team event, but the team management had not named her in the entry saying she was invited to the tournament as a special guest and had not confirmed her availability for the matches.         
	I am now focused on the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, the World Championship and, of course, the Olympics which is my main aim, she said.         
	I will work very hard in the coming days to be in the reckoning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Parnell idolises Zaheer, Nehra
                                                                                                                       7                                          Parnell idolises Zaheer, Nehra
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      Zaheer Khan and Ashish Nehra                            
	Nagpur: Wayne Parnell grew up watching, among others, Allan Donald. Yet, when asked if he had a role model, South Africas most promising all-rounder (hes a quick first) chose Ashish Nehra and Zaheer Khan.         
	I saw Nehra bowl in the 2003 World Cup and was very impressed... Ive admired Zaheer, too... Hes a very skilful bowler, both with the new and old ball... Like me, they bowl left-handed and theyve been role models, the 20-year-old Parnell said, on Thursday afternoon.         
	While Nehra is now picked only for the ODIs, Zaheer is leading the Team India attack in Tests as well.         
	Its nice of Parnell, but it goes to show that Ive been around for a long time, Zaheer quipped, when The Telegraph sought his reaction, at the Pride Hotel.         
	Zaheer, for the record, is in his 10th year of international cricket.         
	Parnell, by the way, will be playing alongside Nehra in this years edition of the IPL. The all-rounder was bought by the Delhi DareDevils during last months controversial auction.         
	Clearly, hes looking forward to that experience.

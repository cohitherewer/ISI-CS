The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag are ready for Mahindra
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag are ready for Mahindra
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chirag United assistant coach Anjan Nath made an interesting statement at the end of the teams training session at the Bidhannagar Municipal Sports Complex on Saturday, ahead of their I-League encounter against Mahindra United on Sunday.         
	What he said sums up a home truth for the club but really, perhaps has more to do with the general ebb in interest than any peculiarity in the demographics of the Chirag United fan base.         
	For us, it hardly makes a difference whether we are playing at home or away. When we play in Goa or Mumbai, we dont get any crowd support. Ditto in Calcutta, where we play in a near-empty stadium, said the man who has seen it all at the club, right from the time they played in the fifth division of the local league (the outfit were known as Ever-Ready then).         
	A look at Chirag Uniteds training session on the eve of the 18th round I-League encounter against Mahindra United will give you an idea that what works to the teams advantage is also their biggest disadvantage.         
	A quiet session. No partisan supporters asking Joshimar or Ashim Biswas to score on Sunday, a few mediapersons asking inane questions. Its an advantage being the least glamorous club of Calcutta of whom no one expects much.         
	The result is steady performance from some gritty juniors like Arnab Mondal, Denson Devadas, Kingshuk Debnath, Dhanrajan to name a few along with big club rejects like Jayanta Sen, Sandip Nandy and others who have passed their sell-by date. Being in the top-three after 17 matches is no mean achievement after all.         
	Their disadvantage though is that same lack of expectation. Coach Nath tried to put things in perspective.         
	Agreed that the lack of supporter base is a problem but these players are professionals. They know if they have to raise their performance, this is the best time to do so. A good performance during the last phase of the league will help fetch them better deals in next seasons transfers, said Nath who has recently taken his AFC C licence examination.         
	On Sunday, it will be a match where much will depend on how well the defensive duo of Debnath and Eduardo Chacon deal with the incisive crosses from Steven Dias.         
	Having won back-to-back away matches in Mumbai and Goa, Chirag definitely are on a high save the injuries to Subhasish Roy Chowdhury and Rahul Kumar  the first two choices for right back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zvonareva thrashes Jankovic
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zvonareva thrashes Jankovic
                      
	Doha: Vera Zvonareva beat a struggling Jelena Jankovic 6-3, 6-0 in the opening match of the White Group of the WTA championships here on Tuesday. In the opening match of the Maroon Group, Caroline Wozniacki swept aside Elena Dementieva 6-1, 6-1, putting her one win away from ensuring she will remain the worlds top-ranked player for 2010.         
	Jankovic said later she became ill during match, suffering dizziness. She told organisers she was too ill to attend a post-match news conference, but would continue in the tournament.         
	I am still suffering from an illness that affected me last week and I had medical treatment after the match today (Tuesday) when I received an IV, she said in a statement. I had difficulty breathing during the match, felt dizzy and felt like I didnt have any power. I finished the match but I had a real hard time.         
	The loss for Jankovic, who held the No.1 spot in 2008, continues a run of poor form. She has now dropped to eighth in the world and was beaten at this months Kremlin Cup by No.248 Zarina Diyas. She has struggled for much of the year with injuries  including ankle, back and, more recently, sinus problems.         
	Jankovic looked fatigued after the first set and never recovered. Zvonareva left Jankovic flat-footed with several well-placed forehands on her way to winning six straight games in the second set. Zvonareva said she didnt play her best tennis and made too many unforced errors. But she stepped up her game in the second set and was satisfied to come away with the victory.         
	Wozniacki was never threatened, racing out to a 3-0 lead in the first set on her way to thrashing Dementieva, who often had no answer to her strong serves and well-placed ground strokes. The Dane now needs to win two of her matches in the Maroon Group to fend off a challenge for her top ranking from No. 2 Vera Zvonareva of Russia.         
	The eight-player tournament features the worlds top performers in 2010, although the Williams sisters are absent due to injury. The top two players from the two groups will advance to the semi-finals.         
	Zvonareva, meanwhile, has risen to No.2 in the rankings this year after reaching the finals of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, but even after beating Jankovic, she faces a long road to overhaul Wozniacki. She must win all three matches in the group stage and then make it to the final and hope Wozniacki stumbles in her next two matches.         
	Zvonareva started slowly but was able take advantage of several double-faults and unforced errors by her Serbian opponent to lead 4-2 and 5-3 in the first set.           AGENCIES

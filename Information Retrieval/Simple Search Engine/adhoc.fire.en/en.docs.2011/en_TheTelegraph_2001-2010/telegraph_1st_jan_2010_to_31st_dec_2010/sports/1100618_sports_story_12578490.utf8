	Calcutta: Skipper Cheteshwar Pujara cracked an unbeaten century to guide India A to 329 for five at stumps on the first day against West Indies A in a tour match being played at Croydon, on Thursday. Pujara (111 batting) was supported by his deputy Wriddhiman Saha (32 batting) at the close of play.         
	After Indian openers Abhinav Mukund (39) and Shikhar Dhawan (43) started off well, it was Pujara who held the centrestage after loss of openers and in-form Ajinkya Rahane (13). However Manish Pandey (36, 7x4) and Manoj Tiwary (36, 5x4) gave their skipper required support as they consolidated the team total. Pujara played 185-balls during his knock and hit 19 boundaries in the process.         
	Among the West Indies A bowlers, Andre Russell (3/51) and Gavin Tonge (2/81) shared the spoils between them.

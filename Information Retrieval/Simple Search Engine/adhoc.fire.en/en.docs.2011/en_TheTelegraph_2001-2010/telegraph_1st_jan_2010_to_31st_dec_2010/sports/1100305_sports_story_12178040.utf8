	Moscow: Returning to the elite World Group of the Davis Cup after 11 years, an acid test awaits India when they take on formidable Russia in their first round tie here Friday.         
	Even with the absence of world No. 6 Nikolay Davydenko, the hosts would be hard to beat as India have to deal with the in-form Mikhail Youzhny.         
	World No. 13 Youzhny is coming into the tie after finishing runners-up at Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) events in Dubai and Rotterdam. He will be a tough nut to crack for Indias numero uno singles player Somdev Dev Varman.         
	The gritty Somdev has been making waves on the ATP Tour but its a whole different ball game altogether when the opponents are the likes of Youzhny. World No. 38 Igor Andreev has been named as injured Davydenkos replacement and he too is no easy meat.         
	Somdev will open the first days proceedings against Andreev while Rohan Bopanna will take on Youzhny in the second singles.         
	Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi will play the doubles on Saturday against Igor Kunitsyn and Teimuraz Gabashvili while the reverse singles on Sunday will see Somdev take on Youzhny and Bopanna play Andreev.         
	For India to have any chance in the tie, Somdev will have to play out of his skin to pull off an upset win on the first day itself.         
	That will give Paes and Bhupathi a chance to consolidate Indias position but it will again boil down to the reverse singles where Somdev would be under tremendous pressure to pull off a victory.         
	Bopanna has been doing well in doubles on the Tour off late but his form in singles is not much to talk about against top-notch opponents.         
	India captain SP Misra knows the job is tough but said India would fight very hard. We will put up a good fight and we have a history of doing well in the Davis Cup, Misra said.         
	He believes that Davydenkos absence will provide a chance for India. Of course, it is a plus point for us. He is the world No. 6 and Russias top singles player. His absence gives us a good chance now.         
	If Somdev can pull off a rubber on day one, India will be in contention. The courts are slow and will suit his style of play. On faster courts he has to play serve and volley but here, he can play his natural game of putting up rallies, he said.         
	Theyre all going to be tough opponents. I am focussing on my preparations rather than worrying about the other guys right now. I feel like if I am playing well Ill be a tough guy to beat, so Im trying to get the best preparations for the tie, Somdev said.         
	Were obviously here to win it. Theres no doubt that theyre the favourites but weve all seen upsets in Davis Cup before and our team is very capable of making that happen, said the wiry youngster with a penchant for stunning top players with his never-say-die spirit.         
	The tie will be played on slow indoor courts and Somdev feels the team is comfortable with the conditions.         
	Its quite cold but the tie is being played indoors where its really nice. Were all quite used to playing indoors on Tour and weve also had a few really good days of practice so were ready for some good matches, he said.         
	The winner of the tie will qualify for the quarter finals while the loser will go back to the World Group playoffs.         
	Statistically, India are leading 2-1 in the head-to-head series but it would be quite a task to maintain that lead.         
	The Indians, who last appeared in the World Group in 1998, booked their place in the elite 16 with victories over Chinese Taipei and then South Africa in the playoffs last year.         
	India have never won the title although they have finished runners-up on three occasions  in 1966, 1974 and 1987.         
	Russia have been champions in 2002 and 2006 and on both occasions, the now-retired Marat Safin had played a crucial role.         
	In 2009, Russia defeated Romania 4-1 but, playing in Tel Aviv, lost by the same scoreline to Israel in the quarter finals.           (AGENCIES)

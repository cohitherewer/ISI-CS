  - Barcelona clinch Spanish league in grand style       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Barcelona players celebrate after winning the Spanish league at Nou Camp, on Sunday. (AP)                                 
	Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola saluted his players for retaining the La Liga title, but admitted he felt his team should also be in Saturdays Champions League final at the Santiago Bernabeu.         
	Barcelona crushed Valladolid 4-0 on Sunday at Camp Nou to lift their fourth league title in six seasons and celebrate their title triumph with their jubilant fans.         
	Barcelona followed up last seasons historic treble with four trophies with the league, the Spanish and European Super Cups and World Club Championship but Guardiola felt the absence of the Champions League left a bitter taste.         
	Any hopes Real had had of sneaking the title on the last day of the season disappeared when they were held to a 1-1 draw at Malaga.         
	This is a day for great celebration and after winning three titles last season we have won four more, said Guardiola.         
	It was a really tough season and small details stopped us getting through to the Champions League final in Madrid. We owe the fans. We had to be in the final on Saturday but we arent and we will try to win it next season.         
	Holders Barcelona were eliminated 3-2 over two legs by Inter Milan at the Champions League semi-final stage to miss out on a dream final at the Santiago Bernabeu, the home of bitter rivals Real Madrid.         
	As the coach said we owe you (the fans) one and we hope to celebrate a Champions League win again in Wembley (the venue for the 2011 final) next season, said midfielder Xavi. Guardiola praised the fans for picking the team up after that setback as they went on to notch a league record 99 points to finish three points ahead of Real Madrid in the league title race.         
	I would like to thank the fans for how they helped us after we lost that tie, added Guardiola. Real had an exceptional season with a lot of points and we had to get 99 points to win the title.         
	I would like to congratulate Real for a great season. They have a great squad and are capable of reinforcing the team for next season so it will be difficult for us.         
	Guardola also reserved some special words for European Golden Shoe winner Lionel Messi who netted 47 goals in all competitions this season and scored twice on the final day.         
	Messi is the best I have ever seen, of this there is no doubt, Guardiola said. As well as being a winner he has great ambition. At 3-0 up, with the league in the bag, he continued chasing as hard as anyone else. Hes impossible to emulate.         
	Captain Carles Puyol also praised archrivals Real for their own league record of 96 points.         
	We have to congratulate Real for a great season but there can only be one team that can be champions, said Puyol. Real made life tough for us but we fought hard to win this title with a huge points tally.         
	It is really nice to celebrate this title in front of our fans. We have had some difficult moments and they really helped us get through them.         
	Guardiola has now won two league titles in his two seasons in charge but there will be change in the summer with president Joan Laporta, the man that hired him, leaving after seven years at the helm.         
	Laporta has put the emphasis on bringing players through the youth system and called on the club to follow the blueprint for future success.         
	This is the model that works and has been proven, said Laporta. I hope it is followed for many more years.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Ahmedabad: India hadnt imagined their nemesis in Chris Martin. The New Zealand seamer didnt look threatening in the first innings, but when he got the ball to talk in the second, the hosts were in for some surprise.         
	None had imagined, perhaps, that India would crumble to 82 for six on the penultimate day. The match looked headed for a draw or, may be, there was a slender chance for India to clinch it. But Martins five-wicket haul changed the tide in the Black Caps favour.         
	Commenting on the hosts disastrous second innings start, left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha said: It was a great spell by Chris Martin, but we have still some batting to come. I think he bowled a good line, and it was hard for us in the session. Bhajji is there (at the crease with VVS Laxman). Zak (Zaheer Khan), Sree (Sreesanth) and Im there Its important to bat as long as we can.         
	I think theres a little bit of grass on the wicket, but not much. Its bad luck for us that we lost so many wickets, but I dont think theres a situation where we should be panicking.         
	India have already taken a 110-run lead and Ojha felt a score of 170 will be a fighting total. Were confident that were going to bowl a good line and length. If we can score 150 or 170, we can make a match of it, he said.

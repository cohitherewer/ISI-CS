            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Dhoni                           
	Chittagong: The weather, I guess, holds the key... Also, much may depend on just how quickly we get the runs on the fourth day... If theres no interruption, we should win...         
	Those words came from regular Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who had to miss the ongoing first Test owing to back spasms.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Tuesday evening, Dhoni added: I get restless sitting in the dressing room and doing nothing... But, if theres an injury, theres nothing that I can do...         
	Dhoni, who is taking precautions to protect himself from the cold here, is recovering well.         
	According to manager Arshad Ayub, senior pro Harbhajan Singh is now 80-85 per cent fit. Hes not playing owing to a stiff neck.         
	Both are expected to be available for the second Test, from Sunday.

  - I-League Phillippe de Ridders boys remain at seventh spot       OUR CORRESPONDENT            Bhaichung Bhutia tries to make his way past the Mumbai FC players at the Cooperage on Saturday. (PTI)                                 
	Mumbai: After losing against Chirag in their last I-League encounter, East Bengal settled for a goalless draw against Mumbai FC at the Cooperage here on Saturday. After the barren draw, East Bengal remained seventh with 13 points from 10 games while Mumbai FC were a rung above with 14 points from encounters.         
	Despite a few early moves, Phillippe de Ridders team took time to adjust to the conditions and it was only in the second half that they consistently exerted pressure on the hosts.         
	Playing Yusif Yakubu as withdrawn forward and Abel Hammond as the lone striker in the first-half, the Calcuttans could penetrate the Mumbai FC citadel only to some extent.         
	Hammond combined with Alvito DCunho to make an inroad into opposition territory but the latters left-foot drive went just wide off the far post.         
	Then Hammond sent Budiram Tudu sprinting through with another accurate release, but the finishing left a lot to be desired.         
	Khalid Jamils side could have been reduced to 10 men but Noel Wilson got away with a yellow card for a tackle from behind on Yakubu in the 28th minute.         
	The hosts then seemed to wake up from their slumber and Abhishek Yadavs dangerous header was punched away by an alert Abhra Mondal.         
	But apart from those few occasions, there was little of note from either side. The introduction of Sanju Pradhan and Yakubu being given the freedom to move up provided the much needed impetus for the visitors after resumption. A Mehtab Hussain pass saw Hammond break the off-side trap but the latter was intercepted by Anas Edathodika.         
	Then, Tudu was a fraction late to meet an incisive cross from Pradhan. Bhaichung Bhutia, coming on for Yakubu in the 69th minute, was also not in his element. His header off a Pradhan cross sailed over the horizontal. The Mumbai FC boys defended gutsily to log home a point.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Dunga hints   he may quit
                            
	Port Elizabeth: Dunga may be done with Brazil.         
	The Brazil coach hinted he will not stay on after his team squandered a half-time lead in a stunning 2-1 loss to the Netherlands in the World Cup quarter finals Friday.         
	Dunga took over on a four-year contract from Carlos Alberto Parreira after Brazil lost to France at the same stage in 2006, and even before this loss he had indicated that he wasnt expected to continue no matter the outcome at the tournament.         
	Everybody knew from the start that my contract was for four years, Dunga said in the post-match news conference.         
	He immediately accepted blame for the defeat.         
	Without a shadow of a doubt, I am the coach of the Brazilian team, Dunga said. I have the greatest responsibility.         
	Wesley Sneijder, who scored the winner in the 68th minute with a header following a corner kick, said: It just slipped through from my bald head and it was a great feeling.         
	It was the Netherlands first win over Brazil since the 1974 World Cup, when Johan Cruyff was the teams star and total football reigned.         
	It was an amazing game. I think we showed the whole world how we can play, Sneijder said. Finally we won, we beat Brazil.         
	Robinho had given Brazil the lead in the 10th, but the Netherlands equalised in the 53rd with an own goal from Felipe Melo. We had two players going for the same ball and what happened, happened, Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar said of the equaliser, his eyes filled with tears.         
	Im devastated. It was hard to see the players crying back there, Melo said after emerging from the changing room. I have to apologise to the Brazilian fans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bedi: Sack useless officials
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bedi: Sack useless officials
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The pitch controversy at the Kotla continued to haunt Delhi cricket for the fourth consecutive day when former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi demanded strict action against those who prepared the wicket for the India-Sri Lanka one-day International last Sunday.         
	Addressing a press conference jointly with former Test cricketer Kirti Azad, Bedi said it would be a huge loss for the local cricketers and fans if the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) was banned from hosting international matches.         
	I dont want to name people, but what happened at the Kotla last Sunday was no less than a rape, said Bedi. The sports committee of the DDCA should be dismissed immediately. It is a superfluous committee and is the root cause of all problems, he added.         
	Bedi, who led Delhi to their first Ranji Trophy triumph, said he had a meeting with the DDCA president, Arun Jaitley. I am meeting him again on January 2. He is likely to set up a cricket improvement committee, where several former cricketers would be involved.         
	When pointed out that DDCA had made similar promises when some top Delhi players, including Virender Sehwag, protested against the sports committees misrule but nothing happened after that, Bedi said: In this case, we should hope for the best.         
	I have never compromised in my life and would not do so this time also. Two things have to be eliminated from the DDCA. One is proxy voting and then the sports committee, he said.         
	Azad said he was in no mood to discontinue the crusade against the DDCA. We will see what comes out after Bedis meeting with Jaitley. In the second week of January, around 10,000 people will assemble at the India Gate lawns for a protest rally against the DDCA, Azad said.

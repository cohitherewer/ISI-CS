	New Delhi: With Pakistan on their mind, India will take on Scotland in the hockey event of the Commonwealth Games at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium, here on Saturday.         
	Jose Brasas boys will look to win by a handsome margin so that, if the Sunday clash against Pakistan ends in a draw, they can make the grade by a better goal difference.         
	India have conceded seven goals and scored five, while Pakistan are in a better position having scored seven and conceding only one.         
	Indias campaign so far in the tournament has been a scratchy affair as after scampering home against a spirited Malaysia 3-2 in their opener, the home team was handed out a reality check by the mighty Australians, on Thursday.         
	World champions Australia and Pakistan are in a comfortable position in Pool A having registered wins in their first pool two matches.         
	Against Australia, India played well in the first half, but they could not convert seven penalty corners that came their way.         
	So much so, that foreign coach Jose Brasa had said that the Indian hockey team need a sports psychologist who could help the players grow in confidence, focus on the game and understand their roles much better.         
	But captain Rajpal Singh said that the team have no need for any such person.         
	The Indian defence once again had a dismal day in office and despite Brasas promise, that the team will sort it out, there hasnt been any improvement. Scotland will be easy meat, no doubt about that but against Pakistan the Indian defence need to perform.

                                                                                                                       7                                        8-wicket win for England
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Andrew Strauss at Lords, on Monday                           
	England beat Bangladesh at Lords by eight wickets this afternoon to take a 1-0 lead in the two match Test series.         
	Andrew Strauss scored 82 and Jonathan Trott an unbeaten 36 as England eased to a seventh successive Test victory over Bangladesh on the stroke of tea. But despite the comprehensive nature of the result, Bangladesh made England work hard for their win, taking the match into the final day. England were set 160 for victory after Bangladesh were dismissed in their second innings for 382.         
	England got off to a flyer as they chased their small target bringing up their 50 in only the sixth over.         
	Strauss milked some very ordinary bowling but England lost Alastair Cook when he was given out lbw to spinner Shakib-al Hasan. Strauss reached his half century off only 50 balls with five fours and Englands hundred was clocked up in the 22nd over.         
	Strauss fell with victory only 10 runs away when he got a small outside edge on an attempted cut off Mahmudullah but Kevin Pietersen stroked successive boundaries before Trott hit the winning runs.         
	England finally ended Bangladesh resistance in the morning session. Steven Finn took the first three wickets to fall and Tim Bresnan the final two.         
	Junaid Siddiques disciplined effort set the tone for Bangladesh who have fought back admirably after following on yesterday.         
	Siddique made 74 off 162 deliveries before becoming the first of Finns victims. Finn bowled fast and accurately from the Pavilion end to take a five wicket haul in his first Lords Test. He finished with five for 87 and match figures of nine for 187.         
	The Bangladesh captain, Shakib-al Hasan was the first wicket to fall steering Finns worst ball of the day  short and wide outside off stump  to Eoin Morgan at gully.         
	In Finns next over Siddique was deceived by a slower ball and drove to extra cover where Bresnan took a two handed catch above his head. Mushfiqur Rahim became Finns fifth wicket when he played at an excellent delivery on off stump.         
	It took England another ten overs to claim the next wicket when Rubel Hossain could not get his bat out of the way of a shorter ball from Bresnan and two overs later Mahmudullah got a thick edge on a pull which was caught by Matt Prior.

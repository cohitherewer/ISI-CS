  - I cannot wait for the competition to get underway: Schumi       Tom Cary            Michael Schumacher during the presentation of the Mercedes GP Petronas Formula 1 team, in Stuttgart, on Monday. (AFP)                                 
	Stuttgart: Michael Schumacher has said he is convinced that Mercedes GP will be fighting for both world titles this season as the rebranded German team, whose new owners took over Brawn, pulled the covers off a model of their 2010 challenger at a star-spangled launch in Stuttgart.         
	The seven-time world champion has been lured back into the sport at the age of 41 by the opportunity of working once again with Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn, who oversaw all of his titles at Benetton and Ferrari.         
	Schumacher is also the face of Mercedes re-branding as a full works team for the first time since the 1950s.         
	His return alongside Nico Rosberg to tackle, amongst others, the all-British team of Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button at McLaren, has generated unprecedented interest in the new season.         
	Schumacher, looking lean and fit after his aborted comeback last year when he was forced to pull out of a return for Ferrari due to an injured neck, left his audience in no doubt that the hunger was back.         
	Finally the 2010 Formula One season is firing up. I have to say that I am totally committed to this new challenge, he said. This season feels like a re-start for me and I am so motivated. We have a very exciting combination at Mercedes GP Petronas.         
	We have a World Champion team and I cannot wait to get into the car for the first time in Valencia. I am convinced that Mercedes GP Petronas will be in a very good position to fight for the championships this season and I will definitely give it a go.         
	Driving for Mercedes-Benz again is like the closing of a circle for me as I started my racing driver career with the three-pointed star on my helmet. This is another reason why I cannot wait for the competition to get underway.         
	The car presented to the media at a lively launch was the 2009 Brawn GP that took Britains Button to the drivers title, repainted in the evocative Silver Arrows colours of the teams new owners.         
	The Mercedes-Benz museum was a fitting backdrop for a Mercedes-powered car, albeit largely designed by Honda, that carved its place in Formula One history by winning Brawn the constructors crown at the first attempt.         
	 The new Mercedes will be make its debut when testing starts at Spains Valencia circuit on February 1.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

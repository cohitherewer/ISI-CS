	Miami: Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi entered the Miami Open mens doubles final with a straight-set win, setting up an exciting clash with Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy here Sunday.         
	Fourth-seeded Bhupathi and Belarussian Mirnyi defeated eighth seeds Poles, Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 Friday.         
	Bhupathy-Mirnyi will take on third seeds, Paes and Czech Dlouhy, who won their semi-final Thursday.         
	Meanwhile, Rafael Nadals 11-month title drought continued after American Andy Roddick beat the Spaniard 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 to reach the Miami Open final on Friday. Sixth seed Roddick will face Tomas Berdych in the final.         
	Nadal had won five of their previous seven meetings in the last six years and that looked a good guide to the outcome of this encounter after he broke Roddicks serve in the third game  a magnificent crosscourt forehand securing the break.         
	The Spaniard went on to win the set but it was a different story in the second where Roddick broke in the eighth game with a pair of outstanding forehands taking him to another level.         
	Belgian Kim Clijsters crushed Venus Williams 6-2, 6-1 in a one-sided womens final on Saturday.           (AGENCIES)

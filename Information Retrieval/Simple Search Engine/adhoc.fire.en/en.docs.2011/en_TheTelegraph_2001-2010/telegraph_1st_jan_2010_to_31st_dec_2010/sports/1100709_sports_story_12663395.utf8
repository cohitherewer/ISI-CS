The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Playing for Barcelona and for Spain

	Durban: The names and the numbers on the backs of the red-and-blue jerseys could fool anyone not paying close attention. Did Spain score in the 73rd minute against Germany in the semi-final of the World Cup on Wednesday night, or was it Barcelona, maybe, against Bayern Munich?         
	Andreas Iniesta earned the corner kick that was whipped in from the left side by Xavi and met by a rampaging Carles Puyol, who headed home a dramatic goal, for Spain. Yes, it was Spain.         
	You can tell because for the national team, Xavi wears No. 8 and Iniesta No. 6, and it is the other way around at their club team, F.C. Barcelona. But it almost does not matter because both La Furia Roja (the Red Fury, as Spain is known) and La Blaugrana (the blue and red, as Barcelona is known) use the same core of talented players to win championships.         
	Spain will rely on six Barcelona players, and a seventh set to join the club next month, when it tries to win the countrys first World Cup title Sunday against the Netherlands in Johannesburg.         
	Puyol, who scored in the 1-0 victory over Germany, is the Barcelona captain. Xavi and Iniesta are the creative midfielders who orchestrate the attack. They are joined by midfielder Sergio Busquets, defender Gerard Piqu and forward Pedro.         
	David Villa, the Spanish striker who is tied for top scorer in the tournament, will join Barcelona in a $50 million transfer agreed to before the World Cup.         
	Since national teams draw the countrys best players, their rosters often consist of players from the national leagues best team. All but three of the Spanish players compete in the countrys domestic league. (Germanys team includes seven players under contract to Bayern Munich.) But Barcelonas imprint on the Spanish team is uncommonly strong.         
	In 2006, Italy, the World Cup champion, had six AC Milan players and five from Juventus. But the team played a different style of play than either club, and the players were much older than those in the current Spanish team.         
	Barcelonas success has been built on its extensive youth development programme, which has fed the senior club and the national team, where their style of play and the training techniques have been duplicated. Both Barcelona and Spain dominate opponents by controlling the ball and stringing together intricate passing sequences. That requires precision, patience and a preternatural understanding between the players.         
	It is the same style that helped Barcelona win four Spanish championships in the past six seasons, and two Champions League titles, in 2006 and 2009. It is the same approach that helped Spain win the 2008 European Championship, and the one that has Spain in their first World Cup final. Xavi is the longest-serving player, with more than 90 appearances for Spain and 352 games for Barcelona since 1998. Puyol has played more than 300 games for Barcelona since 1999 and 90 for Spain.         
	Iniesta became a regular first-team player at Barcelona in 2002 and has played more than 200 games for the club. Pique, 23, Busquets, 21, and Pedro, 22, already play important roles for both teams. All could be World Cup champions next month when they return to Barcelona for preseason training.         
	They are masters of the game, Germany Coach Joachim Loew said Wednesday. That confidence and calm is born of familiarity. Each player seems to know where the ball is going to go when his teammate plays it because he has seen it go there thousands of times before in practice, or during 40 or 50 club games and a dozen national team games each year. This has been our responsibility since Day 1 in South Africa, Xavi said. As a team, more or less, we made it. We felt good, calm. We played like we have the past three years, very well.

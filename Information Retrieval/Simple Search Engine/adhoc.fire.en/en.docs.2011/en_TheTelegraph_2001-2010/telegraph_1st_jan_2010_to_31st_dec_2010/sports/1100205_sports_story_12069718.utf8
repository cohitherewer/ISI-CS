The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians   begin with a bang
                                                                                                                       7                                      Indians   begin with a bang
                            
	Kuala Lumpur: Sania Mirza and Poojashree Venkatesha notched up easy wins as India blanked Singapore 3-0 in a Group A rubber to get off to a flying start in the Asia/Oceania Group II competition of the Fed Cup tennis tournament here Thursday.         
	The Indians won all their three matches  two singles and doubles  without dropping a set or breaking into sweat.         
	In the first singles, Indias No. 2 singles player Poojashree, who made her debut in the Fed Cup, thrashed Si Ying Julienne Keong 6-1, 6-1 to give India a 1-0 lead.         
	Seasoned campaigner Sania then clinched the tie thrashing Li Yun Stefanie Tan 6-2, 6-3 in the second singles. It was a good warm up for Sania, who played a match after losing in the first round of the Australian Open two weeks back.         
	Veteran Rushmi Chakravathy and Sanaa Bhambri combined to beat Clare Fong and Stefanie 6-0, 6-2 in the inconsequential doubles rubber, to complete the formalities.         
	The biggest test for India would be on Friday when they take on hosts Malaysia to top Group A and qualify for the play-off tie with the winner of Group B. India, at 43, is the highest-ranked team currently. A win in the play-off would catapult them back to Group I. India were relegated to Group II last year, in a tie where India were without the services of Sania.         
	Malaysia have a few good players, especially veteran Chin Bee Khoo. 19-year-old Poojashree has drawn against the veteran and it will be a tough test for the Indian. Chin, who had quit the national team a few years back, played a crucial role in Malaysias 2-1 victory over Singapore on Wednesday.         
	Meanwhile, Australia are pinning their hopes on Samantha Stosur to lead her team to the brink of a Fed Cup World Group berth with victory over Spain this weekend.         
	The world No. 11 has been named along with Casey Dellacqua, Alicia Molik and doubles specialist Rennae Stubbs for the first-round Group II tie in Adelaide.         
	Spain have named Anabel Medina Garrigues, Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez, Carla Suarez Navarro and Nuria Llagostera Vives.           (AGENCIES)

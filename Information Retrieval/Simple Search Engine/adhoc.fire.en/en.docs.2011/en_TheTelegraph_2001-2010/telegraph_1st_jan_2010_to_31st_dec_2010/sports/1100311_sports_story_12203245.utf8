The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ray for IPL window
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ray for IPL window
                      
	Bangalore: The Royal Challengers Bangalore coach Ray Jennings has called for a window for the IPL, saying that missing players due to international matches makes it tougher to build team spirit.         
	Bangalore will be without their most expensive player, Kevin Pietersen, for the first couple of weeks of the IPL. New Zealands Ross Taylor will be busy with the Tests against Australia till the end of March, and Australian allrounder Steven Smiths selection in the Test squad also deprives them of his services till early April.         
	With so much international cricket being played in between the IPL, it becomes difficult for any franchise to gel as a team, Jennings wrote on the teams official website.         
	As a result, it is difficult to target all the players together at the start of the tournament. I think there should be some window for the IPL for all the players to meet and gel as a unit before the start of such an important tournament.         
	Jennings felt that the coming IPL season will see larger totals. Par score is beginning to grow because of the knowledge of how to play the game, he said. (Agencies)

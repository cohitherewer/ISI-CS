                                                                                                                       7                                      Subratas dig at Bhaichung
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya in a veiled manner took a dig at India captain Bhaichung Bhutia after his team beat East Bengal in a ninth round I-League encounter on Saturday.         
	How many times in his career have you seen Bhaichung deliver a forward pass? Its always been back passes, one couldnt avoid the sarcasm in Bhattacharyas voice when asked whether Bhaichung has started becoming less effective post injury.         
	Bhaichung is only effective in the 18-yard box. He has never been a playmaker, Bhattacharya said. Then suddenly without naming the star player, Bhattacharya said: Today, the difference of standard between Indian clubs are so less that each and every team is capable of beating each other.         
	Remember that someone who was playing in 2000 is still playing although that individuals pace and mobility has decreased...         
	Also, no good junior players are coming up to challenge these seniors. So there is a definite drop in the standard. You will see more results like these, the Chirag coach said.         
	East Bengal coach Phillipe de Ridder, on his part, said that Chirag were not deserving winners. Congratulations to Chirag but the best team didnt win on the day. There are days when you play well but it doesnt reflect in the end result.         
	We dominated the first half and played better football in the second half. We should have got a penalty, the Belgian said.         
	Mewanhile, Dempo Sports Club notched up a fantastic 3-1 win over Air India in an away encounter on Saturday. N.D. Opara gave them home team lead in the 15th minute but within three minutes Climax Lawrence equalised.         
	In the 35th minute Sunil Chetris powerful header found the net. Joaquim Abranches scored the third goal in the 79th minute.         
	In Ludhiana, Pune FC (PFC) stunned hosts JCT 2-1. S. Venkatesh and Edmar Figuera scored for Pune while Peen Orji scored for JCT.

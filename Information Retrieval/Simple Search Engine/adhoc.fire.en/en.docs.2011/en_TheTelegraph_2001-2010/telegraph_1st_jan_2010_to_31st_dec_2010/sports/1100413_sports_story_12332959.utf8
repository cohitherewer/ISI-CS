                                                                                                                       7                                      Data indicate Tiger image is improving
            [+uc('Stuart Elliott   NEW YORK TIMES News Service')+]                      
	Zeta Interactive, a company that monitors message boards, blogs and social media posts, is finding an improvement in public perceptions of Tiger Woods, although he is nowhere near his pre-scandal levels of approval.         
	The data, released on Friday, also included findings about the Nike commercial featuring Woods and the voice of his father, Earl, who died in 2006.         
	The data showed that the first day of the Masters golf tournament  Woodss first day of public golf since the scandal  significantly helped his online reputation.         
	On Wednesday, the day before the Masters began, Woodss online reputation stood at 51 per cent positive and 49 per cent negative, Zeta reported. On Friday, the positive figure had soared to 69 per cent and the negative had fallen to 31 per cent.         
	The 69 per cent is still a far cry from the 91 per cent positive rating that Woods enjoyed in the Zeta data before the scandal. Looking at words or terms used online to describe Woods, Zeta found that those in use a month ago, like lie/lied/liar, cheat and scandal, had given way by Friday to win, performance and dominant/dominate.         
	As for the Nike commercial, it helped the Nike brand online, the Zeta data indicated. The companys positive ratings, which had recently hovered in the range of 68 to 73 per cent, soared to 83 per cent after the spot began running.         
	And as of Friday morning, the volume of posts online about Nike had increased by more than 270 per cent, the data showed, making Nike more buzzed-about than any retailer.

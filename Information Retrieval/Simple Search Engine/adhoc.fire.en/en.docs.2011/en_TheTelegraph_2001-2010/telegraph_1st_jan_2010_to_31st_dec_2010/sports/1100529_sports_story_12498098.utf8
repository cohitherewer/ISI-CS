	Johannesburg: Kaka practised normally Friday and looked injury-free in Brazils first full training session in South Africa ahead of the World Cup.         
	Kaka had been practising separately from the rest of the team because of a left thigh muscle injury, but went through all the drills on Friday and appeared unaffected by the ailment.         
	Coach Dunga had said Kaka would take it slowly in the teams first days in South Africa but would eventually be ready for Brazils World Cup debut against North Korea on June 15.         
	Brazil arrived Thursday in South Africa and are aiming for a sixth World Cup title. The team underwent physical conditioning at the hotel shortly after arriving, but Friday was their first field session.         
	Kaka played sparingly with Real Madrid this year because of a groin injury and the muscle ailment. Brazil and Kaka had been downplaying the injuries, but the players lack of action had raised concerns ahead of the World Cup.         
	Kaka himself knows what he can do and he will feel when he is fully ready, Dunga said.         
	The playmaker is one of the leaders in this Brazilian squad which is missing stars such as Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Adriano. Striker Luis Fabiano also arrived in South Africa, nursing a leg muscle injury that had kept him from playing with Sevilla when they won the Copa del Rey title last week in Spain.         
	Fabiano also joined Kaka and the rest of the players in a practice session with ball drills and tactical exercises. Dunga wants to the players to spend as much time together so they can work better as a team.         
	We have to gain a group aspect again, Dunga said. Its been a long time since we played together, so there are many details that we have to adjust before the World Cup begins.         
	Brazils last match was a friendly against Ireland in March.         
	The coach said the teams two upcoming warmup matches will be very helpful. Brazil will play Zimbabwe in Harare on June 2 and Tanzania in Dar es Salaam on June 7.         
	We will try to use these matches to make adjustments and test our options, Dunga said.         
	The five-time world champions are practising at a school in Randburg. The session was opened to journalists but closed to fans, although several school employees and some students sneaked in to watch the players.         
	Its just fantastic to have these guys here in our school, said 28-year-old teacher Xander Vandyk.         
	Brazil will play their first match against North Korea at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. They then face the Ivory Coast on June 20 at Soccer City Stadium and close Group G playing against Portugal five days later in Durban.

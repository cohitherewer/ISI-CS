The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cant stain nations honour: Yuvi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cant stain nations honour: Yuvi
                      
	New Delhi: Yuvraj Singh said that his body language while playing for India is such that no bookie would dare approach him for match-fixing.         
	World cricket has been rocked by some serious fixing allegations against Pakistani players and both, the Scotland Yard and the International Cricket Council, are investigating the matter.         
	Yuvraj said that no bookie can approach him for fixing.         
	Nobody can ever approach me for match-fixing. My body language is so strong for my country that nobody can lay a hand on me. For me, playing for India is a matter of pride. I will never want to stain my nations honour, the dashing left-hander said.         
	Speaking on the match-fixing controversy Yuvraj said, It is shameful for both, the country as well as the individual. People get into wrong doings when they are young, but one must be honest. A good nights sleep is more important than money.         
	The youngsters must look up to their seniors for advice like we used to take help from Sachin (Tendulkar), (Rahul) Dravid and (Sourav) Ganguly, he told an Indian news channel.         
	Yuvraj, whose lack of form over the past one year saw him lose his place in the one-day squad, said, I suffered too many injuries in the last one year... I will be back very soon.

	Karachi: Pakistans isolation in international cricket continues with India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh refusing to support the countrys bid to secure hosting rights for the 2012 Asia Cup at a recent meeting of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) in Dhaka.         
	According to sources, PCB chairman Ijaz Butt and Sultan Rana, who represented Pakistan at the ACC executive council meeting, had offered to host the 2012 event at a neutral venue and suggested Dubai.         
	But they met with stiff resistance from particularly the Indians who made it clear they were not willing to play at a venue which had in the past had suspicions raised about it, a source said.         
	The Indian contention was that in the past, cricket in the UAE had been linked to fixing and gambling and they could not accept it as a neutral venue, the source added.         
	He said Sri Lanka and Bangladesh had also not backed Pakistans plea and eventually it was decided that Bangladesh would host the event in Mirpur in 2012.         
	Apparently China was never seriously discussed as a possible venue as the PCB representatives insisted that it didnt have the required international facilities to host such a major event so soon, the source said.

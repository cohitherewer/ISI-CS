The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina not looking at the past
                                                                                                                       7                                      Saina not looking at the past
                      
	Paris: Saina Nehwal might be in great form after her recent title wins, but the ace Indian shuttler feels past record will not matter when she begins her campaign in the World Badminton Championship, on Tuesday.         
	In a World Championship, all the games are close. The atmosphere is electric and it really doesnt matter how many tournaments you win in the run-up, every player wants to win. And as you climb the rankings, each and every player wants to beat you, the Indian world No.2 said.         
	Saina will meet Chinese Taipeis Hsiao Huan Chen in the second round, after both the players were awarded a bye in the opening round at the Pierre de Coubertin Stadium here.         
	Its been an envious graph for Saina since she broke into the world Top-10. In 2010, she has played 34 matches and won 29. Her five losses have come against a major of Chinese opponents.         
	Meanwhile, Aditi Mutatkar became a first-round casualty but Indian mens and mixed doubles pairs kept the tri-colour fluttering as India wrapped up a mixed day.         
	Ninth seeds mixed doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and V. Diju struggled past English combo of Chris Adcock and Gabriella White 21-6, 14-21, 21-8 to enter the second round.         
	In mens doubles, 15th seeded pair of Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas thrashed Nigerian pair of Ola Fagbemi and Jinkan Ifraimu 21-18, 21-10 to advance to the next round.         
	However, it was end of road for Mutatkar in the womens singles after she lost 12-21 16-21 to 10th seed Eriko Hirose of Japan in a 32-minute match.         
	Hirose was too strong today. I tried mixing up my shots in the second game but it just wasnt my day, Mutatkar said after the match.           (PTI)

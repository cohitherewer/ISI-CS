  - Nigerian striker scores his third hattrick of the season       A STAFF REPORTER            Subair Murithala Ali gets past Mohammedan ACs Sanjit Mali during their Premier Division match, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan, and in particular Subair Murithala Ali, did not disappoint the fans who came to watch them win on Wednesday afternoon. The green and maroon brigade thrashed Mohammedan AC 3-1, at home, in their eighth match of the CFL Premier Division.         
	It was not only Murithalas hattrick, but also the teams overall performance which ensured the fans that Bagans lacklustre show, last Sunday, when Eastern Railway gifted them three points, was an one off affair.         
	Murithala, who had missed the last match due to card suspension, hit his first in the 11th minute. Snehasish Chakrabortys corner kick was headed by Edeh Chidi towards Murithala, who then made no mistake in slotting the ball past Mohammedan AC goalkeeper Satyabrata Paul.         
	The opponents, not to be outdone, drew parity five minutes later when captain Olowndi Saheed broke through the Bagan defence to put the ball into the net, past custodian Shilton Paul.         
	Locked at 1-1, it was Man of the Match Murithala who bailed Bagan out with his second strike, in the 23rd minute. Chidi, his partner up front, passed the ball from the centre and Murithala didnt waste the opportunity as he side-volleyed it home.         
	But there was more in store for the Bagan fans, courtesy Murithala, who was on target again in the second half to make it 3-1 in home teams favour.         
	In the 68th minute, the Nigerian received a pass from Jose Ramirez Barreto and flicked the ball into the net to record his third hattrick of the season!         
	I am yet to reach my peak this season. It doesnt matter how many goals I score, but the team should do well, said Murithala modestly after the match.         
	In fact, he could have scored a few more goals had he not bungled up the opportunities that came his way. In fact, one of Murithalas goals was deemed offside by the referee, in the 74th minute.         
	We should have won 6-0 and not missed the opportunities. Yes, we did concede a goal, but that happens in football Its nothing to worry about, claimed coach Stanley Rozario. Murithala should have scored a double hattrick today! But, we won and now must look forward to the other matches in the league.         
	Mohun Bagan are aiming to catch up with table toppers East Bengal, who have 33 points from 11 matches. Bagan now have 19 points from eight outings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | My focus never wavers: Sachin
                                                                                                                       7                                        My focus never wavers: Sachin

	Dhaka: Sachin Tendulkar on Monday said he never gets complacent and focuses hard irrespective of the might of his opponents.         
	It is the same in every match, you have to still go out and score, Tendulkar told reporters after the second days play of the second Test against Bangladesh.         
	For me, no attack can be underestimated. I always apply the same way whether we play Australia, South Africa, England, Zimbabwe or Bangladesh. I just focus on what needs to be done from my side, said the batsman, who recorded his 45th Test hundred on Monday.         
	I dont count my centuries, I just want to score runs, Tendulkar said when asked whether he would be looking ahead to score 100 international tons.         
	Asked about his 45th ton coming on the eve of Indias Republic Day, he said: I hope something good comes out for the team. Tomorrow is a very important day for the country.         
	Tendulkar said the wicket was two-paced, not easy to bat and it was a good toss to lose.         
	We can say it was a good toss to lose. There was some dampness on the first morning pitch but not as much as in Chittagong. We thought our bowlers could take early wickets and they did as Bangladesh were five down on the first morning, said Tendulkar.         
	It is not an easy track to bat on. It is two-paced and the bounce was uneven and it is going to deteriorate a lot later also. So we have to be patient and put up a big score on board, Tendulkar added.

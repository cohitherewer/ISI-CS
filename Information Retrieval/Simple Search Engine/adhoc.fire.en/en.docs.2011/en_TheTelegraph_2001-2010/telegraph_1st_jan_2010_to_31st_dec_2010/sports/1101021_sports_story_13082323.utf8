The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Krish Srikkanths nudge helped

	Calcutta: A nudge from chief selector Krishnamachari Srikkanth appears to have helped young Saurabh Tiwary make his India debut, against Australia, on Wednesday.         
	According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph, Srikkanth had a word with captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni after the October 12 meeting in Bangalore, when the squad for the three-match ODI series was picked.         
	Srikkanth, as far as I know, reminded Dhoni that Tiwary was being selected to play and that the opportunity was ripe to blood him... Obviously, the nudge came at the right time, the source said.         
	Tiwary, it may be recalled, did only drinks duty in successive tournaments in Sri Lanka earlier this year. First in the Asia Cup and, then, the tri-series.         
	Asked to bat at No.7, Tiwary didnt have too much to do, in Vizag. He did get the winning runs, though.         
	Some could whisper that Tiwary seemed a bit edgy at times, but who wouldnt be on his debut? Credit to the Jamshedpur lad for finishing it off with boundaries, one on each side of the wicket.         
	Clearly, with the experienced Rohit Sharma, a mega flop in the tri-series, having to sit out, a message has been sent.         
	For his part, the 20-year-old Tiwary has also sent a message. Basically, that he should be given a reasonable run to prove himself.         
	Meanwhile, even as Big Brother Bengal goes unrepresented, Jharkhand now has two players (including the captain) wearing the India colours. Its a massive achievement for a state which came into being as recently as 2000.

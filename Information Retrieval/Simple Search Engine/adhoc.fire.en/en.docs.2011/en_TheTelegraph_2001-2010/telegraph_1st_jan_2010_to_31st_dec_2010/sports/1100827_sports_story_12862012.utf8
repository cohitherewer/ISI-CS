	Spa-Francorchamps: Michael Schumachers Belgian Grand Prix homecoming began with a message of congratulations and apology to his former Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello.         
	Schumacher recorded six Formula One victories in Spa  including the first of a record total 91  and the seven-time champion said Thursday he felt like he was returning to his own house as he prepared to race in Spa for the first time in three years.         
	Ive often called it my living room and theres lots of fantastic memories from the past and even some to look forward with the mixed weather prediction this weekend, the German driver said.         
	But Schumacher will start 10 places below his qualifying place on Saturday for illegally impeding Barrichello at the Hungarian GP, when he nearly forced the Williams driver into a concrete wall at high speed.         
	Schumacher said he sent Barrichello an SMS again apologising for his actions and celebrating the Brazilian drivers record 300th GP.         
	We have quite a history together, so I thought it was appropriate to congratulate him and clarify the point, Schumacher said. He sort of felt that I wanted to push him against the wall and, very clearly, this was not my ambition. I wanted to race very tightly but without any wall contact. And to clarify this point, if he felt this was the case then I was sorry for that.         
	Barrichello, who has won 11 times since his debut in 1993, accepted Schumachers explanation.         
	Somebody said to him that I was under the impression he had pushed me onto the wall, and he said it wasnt the case and he apologised for that, the Brazilian driver said. I just said thank you, no problem. I accepted it, wished him a good weekend  life goes on.

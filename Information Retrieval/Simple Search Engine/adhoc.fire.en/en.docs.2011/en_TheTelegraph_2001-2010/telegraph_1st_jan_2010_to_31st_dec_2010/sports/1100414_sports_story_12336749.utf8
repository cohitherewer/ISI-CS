The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Focus will be on Indians 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Focus will be on Indians 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT             Saina Nehwal                           
	New Delhi: Saina Nehwal and the mixed doubles pair of Valiyaveetil Diju and Jwala Gutta are expected to hog the limelight when the main rounds of the Badminton Asia Championship begin at the Siri Fort Sports Complex, here on Wednesday.         
	For the first time, Indians have been given the top billing in more than one event in a major international meet. While the absence of leading Chinese players has made Saina the top seed in singles, the honour has gone to Jwala and Diju in mixed doubles.         
	Its good to know we are considered crowd pullers, but that doesnt really solve our problems, said Jwala, who paired with Diju to become the first Indian mixed doubles duo to win a Grand Prix gold in Chinese Taipei last year and currently ranked ninth in the world.         
	We also won back to back titles in Bitburger Grand Prix and Belgian Grand Prix, yet no sponsor came forward to help our cause, Jwala rued. On several occasions we had to spend our prize money to go for the next outstation trip, she added.         
	Jwala and Diju, however, would remain comfortable till the Commonwealth Games as they have been included in the core group of sportspersons by the sports ministry. Now the Government takes care of our major expenses. Once the Commonwealth Games are over, it will be back to square one, Jwala said.         
	Nevertheless, the national coach Pullela Gopichand is pinning more hopes on the Jwala-Diju combination than Saina. He called the draw a bit tricky for Saina but said the Indians should win the mixed doubles title.         
	On the opening day of the main rounds, Jwala-Diju take on the Hong Kong pair of Wai Hong Wong and Hoi Wan Chau and Saina plays Porntip Buranaprasertsuk of Thailand in the first round.         
	Though the womens singles and the mixed doubles will remain the point of interest for the local crowd, the best competition could be seen in the mens singles with an array of top players lining up for the title.

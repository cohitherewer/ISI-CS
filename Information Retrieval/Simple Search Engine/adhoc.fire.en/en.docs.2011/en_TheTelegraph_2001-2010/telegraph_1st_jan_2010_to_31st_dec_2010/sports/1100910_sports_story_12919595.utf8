The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aisam praises Bopanna
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aisam praises Bopanna
                      
	New York: Flood-ravaged and shamed by a betting scam involving its cricketers, Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi knows Pakistan have little to cheer about right now. But he is confident of changing the mood back home by lifting the US Open mens doubles trophy with Rohan Bopanna.         
	I cant thank Rohan enough for playing with me. I really am very lucky to have a partner and a friend like him. Pakistans been going through a lot for the past two or three years. The terrorist attacks, now the floods and the cricket scandal... Im glad that I can send some positive news back home, Qureshi said after he and Bopanna entered the final of the seasons last Grand Slam.         
	Bopanna and Qureshi, play wearing T-shirts with the message Stop War, Start Tennis, and the Pakistani said becoming a part of the movement has changed their lives.         
	I think what changed our careers was when we became ambassadors of peace. The first time we initiated our campaign about Stop War and Start Tennis, I think, was the time everybody started to taking notice of it, Qureshi said.         
	Qureshi thanked Bopanna for helping him promote the game in his trouble-torn country. I think people have realised that Rohan is helping me promote this game in Pakistan. He probably doesnt know, but hes very, very popular in Pakistan., he said.         
	Qureshi said he would also like to clear some misconceptions about Muslims in America. I feel the western world has a very wrong perception about Pakistan. We do have terrorist groups but it doesnt mean that the whole nation is full of terrorists, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ECB may take Butt to court
                                                                                                                       7                                      ECB may take Butt to court
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the England team said on Monday, that they will consider legal and disciplinary action against Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt, for alleging that the English players deliberately lost a match.         
	The decision to continue with the fixing-tainted series against Pakistan was also taken, unanimously, by the ECB following a meeting with chairman Giles Clarke, CEO David Collier, managing director Hugh Morris, captain Andrew Strauss and coach Andrew Flower.         
	The ECB and the England players rejected the remarks made by Butt on Sunday about the England teams conduct in the third one-day International, at the Oval, on Friday.         
	They felt Butts comments were wholly irresponsible and completely without foundation.         
	Butt had accused the England players of throwing the match which Pakistan won by 23 runs.         
	We would like to express our surprise, dismay and outrage at the comments made by Butt. We are deeply concerned and disappointed that our integrity as cricketers has been brought into question.         
	We refute these allegations completely and will be working closely with the ECB to explore all legal options open to us, captain Strauss said on behalf of the team.         
	Under the circumstances, we have strong misgivings about continuing to play the last two games of the current series and urge the Pakistan team and management to distance themselves from Butts allegations.         
	We do, however, recognise our responsibilities to the game of cricket, and in particular to the cricket-loving public in this country, and will therefore endeavour to fulfil these fixtures to the best of our ability, the statement added.         
	Both, the Board and team, felt that it would set a dangerous precedent to call off a tour based on the misguided and inaccurate remarks made by one individual.         
	ECB will continue to offer the International Cricket Council its full support in taking the strongest possible action against all areas of corruption and is pledged to offering the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) its full support at all times.         
	The players appreciate the difficult position the ECB finds itself in, and is fully supportive of the actions taken by the Board, along with the ICC, to ensure all allegations of wrong-doing are properly investigated and acted upon.         
	We will continue to co-operate closely with the ECB, with the aim of ensuring that the work to root out corruption is not derailed by mischievous attempts to detract attention from the real issues, said Angus Porter, chief executive of the Professional Cricketers Association, on Monday.         
	The minister for sport and the Olympics, Hugh Robertson welcomed ECBs decision. I welcome the decision by England to play the last two games of this tour. It is a pragmatic decision that is in the best interests of world cricket, he said.

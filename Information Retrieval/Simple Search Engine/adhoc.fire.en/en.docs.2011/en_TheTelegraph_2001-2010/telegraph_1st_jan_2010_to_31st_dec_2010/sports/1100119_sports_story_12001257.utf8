The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Weather may play truant in Duleep tie
                                                                                                                       7                                      Weather may play truant in Duleep tie
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Duleep Trophy opener between East Zone and Central Zone, which is scheduled to start from Tuesday in Amritsar, may not begin on time due to foggy conditions. Such has been the weather in Amritsar that the teams couldnt practice on Sunday. Even on Monday, they could train for only an hour!         
	The visibility is zero in the morning. And during afternoons, its like an early morning in Calcutta. I will be very surprised if the play starts on time. In fact we would be lucky if there is any play at all, opener Arindam Das said over telephone from Amritsar.         
	The good news for East Zone is that skipper Saurabh Tiwary, who was nursing a hamstring injury, had a few knocks at the nets. Tiwary couldnt take part in the training sessions at the zonal camp at the JU (Salt Lake) ground last week.         
	With Arindam Das and Assams Dhiraj Jadhav likely to open the innings, the No. 3 slot will go to Jharkhands Ishank Jaggi.         
	Jaggis selection has been a debatable one as the batsman had an average of only 12 in the three Ranji Trophy matches he played.         
	Manoj Tiwary, skipper Saurabh and Wriddhiman Saha will bat at No.4, 5 and 6 respectively. The No. 7 slot may feature Alok Sahoo of Orissa.         
	With Ranadeb Bose, Ashok Dinda and Sourashish Lahiri having sealed their berths, the choice for the third seamer will be between Assams Dhiraj Goswami and Abu Nechim Ahmed.

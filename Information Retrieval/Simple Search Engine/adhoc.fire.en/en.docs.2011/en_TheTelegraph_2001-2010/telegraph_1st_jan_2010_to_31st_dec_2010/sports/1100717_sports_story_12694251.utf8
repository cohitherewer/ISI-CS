                                                                                                                       7                                      Chandhok is to sit out at Hockenheim
                            
	London: Indias Karun Chandhok was confident his Formula One career remained on track on Friday despite being dropped by his Hispania (HRT) team for next weeks German Grand Prix.         
	The F1 newcomers said in a race preview that Japanese test driver Sakon Yamamoto would retain his place on the starting grid for the second Grand Prix in a row, partnering Brazilian Bruno Senna.         
	Senna, nephew of the late triple champion Ayrton, had to sit out last weekends British Grand Prix at Silverstone while Yamamoto raced with Chandhok.         
	You want to drive every weekend so its not ideal, Chandhok, who will still travel to Hockenheim as planned, said when asked about the situation. But its hardly the end of the world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Azhar, Misbah give hope
                                                                                                                       7                                      Azhar, Misbah give hope
                      
	Abu Dhabi: Azhar Ali fell 10 runs short of a maiden Test century as Pakistan reached 317 for six at the close on the third day of the second Test, against South Africa, at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Monday.         
	Azhar, who scored 56 and 63 in the drawn first Test, in Dubai, drove Dale Steyn to Graeme Smith at mid-off.         
	Captain Misbah-ul Haq continued Azhars good work with an unbeaten 77 to give his side hope of passing the follow-on target of 384. South Africa declared their first innings on 584 for nine.         
	Misbah came to the crease in the middle of a mini-collapse after Steyn had also removed Younis Khan. Mixing defence with attack, he batted through to the close which came two overs early due to bad light.         
	Misbah and debutant Asad Shafiq (61) shared a stand of 107 for the fifth wicket before left-arm spinner Paul Harris induced an edge from Shafiq, which was taken by Jacques Kallis at slip. Harris then claimed a second wicket shortly before the close when he had Adnan Akmal caught at forward short-leg for 17.         
	Azhar scored his fifth half-century in eight Tests and second score in the 90s, before driving Steyn on the up.         
	South Africa picked up one wicket in the first session, Taufeeq Umar, who scored 43 in three hours at the crease, top-edging a hook off Kallis into the hands of Hashim Amla at mid-wicket.

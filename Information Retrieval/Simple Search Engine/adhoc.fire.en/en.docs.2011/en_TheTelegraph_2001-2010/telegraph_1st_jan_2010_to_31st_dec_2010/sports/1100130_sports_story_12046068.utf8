The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Numbers no longer matter: Leander
                                                                                                                       7                                      Numbers no longer matter: Leander

	Calcutta/ Melbourne: When Leander Paes steps onto the court in Melbourne Park on Sunday to play his 10th Grand Slam mixed doubles final, the fourth with partner Cara Black, he will also be playing his 21st career Slam final.         
	On paper, he will be aiming for his 11th Slam victory, but, according to the 36-year-old, these numbers no longer make a mark on him.         
	Numbers have ceased to matter long back. Only the first few Slams really counted. Of course, its great to win another, but now its more about enjoying the whole process rather than just the win, Paes said on Friday from Melbourne.         
	The top-seeded Indo-Zimbabwean duo came from a set down to defeat seventh seeds, Lisa Raymond of America and South African Wesley Moodie 6-7(6), 7-6(5), 10-7 in the semi-finals of the Australian Open.         
	It was deja vu out there as we were 5-2 up in the first before the set ran away from us. It was almost becoming a replay of the Wimbledon final (the duo had lost to Anna-Lena Groenefeld and Mark Knowles 5-7, 3-6 last year). We were two breaks up and had a set point at 5-3 when I went for a bit too much and instead of putting away the backhand volley, I tried to lob it. The ball missed the line by the proverbial whisker.         
	However, Paes heaped praise on his partner. I am glad we turned it around. Cara played solidly but it did get rough out there. But then, thats the beauty of playing with Cara. She and I both complement each other as neither of us will give up till the very end.         
	The only obstacles in their path are Ekaterina Makarova of Russia and Jaroslav Levinsky of the Czech Republic. The Russian-Czech pair have had a great run up to the final, defeating Flavia Pennetta of Italy and Brazils Marcelo Melo of Brazil 6-0, 4-6, 10-8 in their semi-final tie.         
	It will be tough as Makarova is playing extraordinarily well. But then Cara and I have more big match experience. Also, as a pair, we do have a good record. Out of the six Slams that we have been partners, we have made four finals. In tight matches, the experience becomes a crucial factor, said Paes before signing off.

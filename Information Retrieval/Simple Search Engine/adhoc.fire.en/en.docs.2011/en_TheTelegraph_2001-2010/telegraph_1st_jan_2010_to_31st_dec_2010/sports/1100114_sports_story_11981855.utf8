	India goalkeeper Adrian DSouza said the players can now give their undivided attention to the preparations for the World Cup, to be held in Delhi from February 28-March 13.         
	We are relieved today. We are happy that everything is settled and now we can concentrate on our preparations for the World Cup, DSouza said from Pune.         
	Our unity was our main weapon in this fight... I hope we can carry forward this unity on the field.         
	The World Cup is a battle and unity is necessary to win any battle. You will definitely witness this unity during the World Cup, he said.         
	DSouza said the IOA chiefs word was assurance enough for the players to call off the strike and resume training from Thursday.         
	The IOA president coming to meet us and giving his assurance, in front of the entire nation was enough for us.         
	He assured us that he will put all our other demands, including the gradation system, before the new HI officials once the elections are completed on February 7. He also assured us that the gradation system will be worked out before the World Cup, DSouza added.

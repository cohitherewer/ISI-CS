The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Aboline fancied
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Aboline fancied
            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: All eyes will be on Aboline in Sundays mega event, the 2,400m Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes. (Grade I). In his last outing  as a quarter-money favourite in the 2,000 Guineas  the Arjun Mangalorkar-trained colt had made a heavy weather of his victory over Fair Option. But that was another story. Aboline was rested for four months after his Bangalore sojourn.           
	Abolines post-Guineas workouts, indicate that the Burden Of Proof-Super Fan son is close to the form that had helped him score, by a head, over Jacqueline in the Bangalore (summer) Derby. The fact that Jacqueline went on to win the two Indian Guineas, it speaks highly of Abolines class. The question-mark about his stamina does not hold much ground. A horse needs plenty of stamina to win a 2,000m race over the Bangalore course.          
	However, the outstations late entries  Sans Pareil and Bruckner  boast of having better credentials to topple the likes of Fair Options and Abolines. Whatever their their tactics, Aboline seems to be in a different league.          
	The 1,200m Alokananda Stakes may witness a three-cornered contest between Art Excellence, Secret Fire and Strike A Deal. The first named horse, however, has marginal edge over the two.          
	The Telegraph Cup may see another close fight among the likely favourite, Absolutely Royal, the luckless Rising Hero and Aamar Kaku  an unbeaten horse in his last four starts . The Kaku may take both by a surprise.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Watson to make amends
                                                                                                                       7                                      Watson to make amends

	Melbourne: Stung by criticism of his behaviour during the recently-concluded Test series against the West Indies, Australian all-rounder Shane Watson has vowed never to repeat the silly actions in future.         
	Watson was widely criticised for his manic celebration after dismissing West Indies captain Chris Gayle during the Perth Test. He had defended himself immediately after the match but in hindsight, Watson said he would not repeat the behaviour again.         
	I never wanted anything like that to happen, Watson told a daily. It was just raw emotion that came out of me. It was nothing that was planned. For me, I had to sit back and think, well, that was raw emotion and how am I going to control it next time? The last thing I want is for it to happen again. Never again.         
	Meanwhile, India is set to make Watson a multi-milliona ire as he is poised to land lucrative sponsorship deals in the country besides getting a massive hike in his central contract.         
	Watsons agent David Flaskas said his client is set to land a $500,000-a-season sponsorship deal with a major Indian company. (PTI)

	New Delhi: The Indian mens team Thursday qualified for the finals of the Thomas Cup badminton championship to be held in Malaysia after reaching the semi-finals of the Asia Zone qualifiers. The womens team also kept their hopes alive in the Uber Cup in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.         
	Arvind Bhat, P. Kashyap and Anup Sridhar led the challenge as India registered a thumping 3-0 win over Vietnam to enter the last four stage of the Asia Zone preliminary stage which ensured them a place in the finals of the Thomas Cup to be held in Kuala Lumpur from May 9-16.         
	Kashyap set the ball rolling for India when he bounced back to beat Nguyen Hoang Nam 20-22, 21-10, 21-18 in the first singles match.         
	Arvind then put India 2-0 ahead, beating Hieu Pham Cao 16-21, 21-7, 21-10 in the second singles.         
	Sridhar sealed the issue in Indias favour when he brushed aside Huynh Vinh 21-13, 21-6 in the next singles match, thereby making the last two doubles matches redundant.         
	India will next play Korea in the semi-final Friday.         
	The Saina Nehwal-led Indian womens team whitewashed the Philippines 5-0 to keep their Uber Cup finals hopes afloat.         
	Saina spanked Alcala Malvinne Ann Venice 21-9, 21-13 to start the proceedings for India and then Sayali Ghokale made it 2-0 with an emphatic 21-9, 21-16 win over Castilo Gelita.         
	Trupti Murgunde trounced Nicole Magno Dia 21-4, 21-8 in just 17 minutes to continue the carnage.         
	Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa then beat Alcala Malvinne Ann Venice and Castilo Gelita 21-15, 21-11 in the first doubles match and then Saina teamed up with Aparna Balan to beat Magno Dia Nicole and Cruz Jamila Fatima 21-9, 21-13.

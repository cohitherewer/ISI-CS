The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Curator passes test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Curator passes test
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Prabir Mukherjee has been in the news for the past week regarding his unwillingness to shave off the grass the Eden Gardens strip. Well, after the end of the first days play, the veteran curator was all smiles.         
	And why not? India after all made a splendid comeback in the final session, courtesy Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan.         
	However, from the look of the pitch it was evident that he had mellowed down from his earlier stand and decided to get rid of the greenish look of the pitch that has raised quite a few eyebrows in the Indian team management.         
	Yes, I did instruct the groundsmen to trim a fair bit of grass. At the end of the day, your skill matters more than the pitch. Hashim Amla and the new boy (Alviro Petersen) knew the art of scoring runs and they did well. Zaheer and Harbhajan are good bowlers thats why they got wickets, Mukherjee told The Telegraph on Sunday evening.         
	Did anyone congratulate him on India finishing off the day on a brilliant note? No, I didnt get any feedback from the players.         
	But the two on-field umpires (Ian Gould and Steve Davis) complimented me by saying that it was one of the best 22-yard strips that they have seen during recent times. For a groundsman (he believes in calling himself one), it couldnt have been a bigger honour to be praised by the match officials, he added.         
	In fact, Mukherjee has shaved off the grass at the wicket on the Club House end in the areas outside off-stump. A reputed CAB umpire told on the eve of the match that Harbhajan should be brought from the High Court End.         
	Meanwhile, the on-field umpires verbally cautioned South Africas Paul Harris and Indias Ishant Sharma who were engaged in an altercation.         
	It started at the last drinks break (after tea) when Harris and Ishant were seen exchanging heated words. The umpires calmed both the players. However, after dismissing Harris, Ishant did a namaste act to give the South African a send-off.

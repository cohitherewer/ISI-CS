                                                                                                                       7                                      Chinese interest in Reds bid
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Kenneth Huang, a Chinese billionaire, has made a direct offer to the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) to buy Liverpools 237 million debt and oust the clubs current owners, George Gillett and Tom Hicks.         
	However, the RBS, late on Monday denied they were in talks. An RBS spokesman said: We are not in talks with any bidder about the sale of Liverpool Football Club.         
	Huang, a Wall Street stockbroker and chairman of the Hong Kong-based QSL Sports group, is backed by one of the wealthiest investment funds in the Far East.         
	It is believed he has already approached a number of senior figures at the club to prove his determination to force Hicks and Gillett out, while he will also ask Fernando Torres to delay a decision on his future.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gods been kind, says Sreesanth
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gods been kind, says Sreesanth
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  Sreesanth      
	Durban: On the morning after having bowled the ball of the series, which sent Jacques Kallis to hospital for an X-ray, Sreesanth simply said: Gods been kind.         
	Speaking briefly to The Telegraph, Sreesanth added: Id been trying inswingers and outswingers, inswingers and outswingers... The last effort (at the point of delivery) probably made the difference... All thanks to God.         
	Clearly, a much changed Sreesanth. Nobody is, of course, complaining.         
	Gautam Gambhir, meanwhile, has recovered from his hand injury and is available for selection. Hes fit... Hes in the clear, informed the manager, Ranjib Biswal, on Thursday evening.         
	With Gambhir fit, Murali Vijay will have to return to the reserves bench. No other change in the XI is anticipated.         
	Vice-captain Virender Sehwag has been withdrawn from the ODI squad, because of a nagging shoulder problem, but Biswal insisted there was no question mark over his playing in the final Test, in Cape Town, from Sunday.         
	The series is tied 1-1.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh, coach Gary Kirsten and a couple of other members of the support staff left for Cape Town in the morning. The rest of the squad flies out on Friday afternoon.         
	The well-earned break saw different players spend the day differently.         
	For example, former captain Rahul Dravid first took elder son Samit to the beach and, in the afternoon, the entire family went out.         
	Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha chose to play pool in the team room at the hotel. Saha was on the verge of beating Pujara. Both, by the way, have also shared the Knights dressing room.         
	Then, V.V.S. Laxman spent quite a bit of his time listening to shlokas, an exercise which probably strengthens his mind.         
	Cricket isnt only about being at a 100 per cent physically.         
	Footnote: One spotted Biswals wife, Anita, sans any jewellery. Just a precaution, she pointed out, smiling. A sensible move, really, given that its better to be safe than sorry in these parts.

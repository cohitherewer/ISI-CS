The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Heat is on Bangladesh
                                                                                                                       7                                      Heat is on Bangladesh
    - Gambhir 4th batsman to register hundreds in five consecutive Tests           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Chittagong: After a show of bravado (if we bat through the day, then we will win), Bangladesh captain Shakib-al Hasan admitted he actually was nervous.         
	Understandable, given that Indias stand-in captain Virender Sehwag set the hosts a target of 415. By stumps on Day IV, 67 of those runs had been knocked off, but for the loss of two wickets.         
	To say the task is daunting would be an understatement.         
	Actually, even though the wicket at the Z.A. Chowdhury Stadium has eased considerably, it would be difficult for Bangladesh to survive the concluding day of the first Test for the Idea Cup.         
	Its a two-match series.         
	Three results are possible... We could win, we may lose or it could be a draw... Obviously, everybody in my team will have to accept responsibility and play accordingly, Shakib pointed out.         
	Of the four days, Wednesday was the least affected by fog and insufficient light. If the weather gets even better, then it may just get tougher for Bangladesh.         
	Not that there wont be pressure on the visitors, the No.1-ranked Test team.         
	Pressure to hai... Thats always there in international cricket... The wicket has become slower and, so, we bowlers will have to work harder... Aur mehnat karni pade gi, sole specialist spinner Amit Mishra said.         
	Mishra, who played only because Harbhajan Singh had a stiff neck, has already had a good match  three wickets and a career-best 50, as nightwatchman, in innings No.2.         
	The likes of Tony Mann have, as nightwatchmen, tormented Indian teams. Its a nice change when one of our tailenders frustrates the opposition in exactly that role.         
	Mishra, believe it or not, was the senior partner in the 98-run stand for the second wicket. A feature of his partnership with Gautam Gambhir was the Bangladesh players poor body language.         
	It seemed they were out to prove Sehwag right on the ordinary side bit. Moreover, both Gambhir and Mishra were dropped once each.         
	Resuming on 122 for one, India batted till 28 minutes after tea, when the declaration was effected, at 413 for eight. That denied Bangladesh the chance to take all 20 wickets, something an arrogant Sehwag had insisted wouldnt happen.         
	At the declaration, veteran V.V.S.Laxman was unbeaten on a classy 69, but Gambhir was the cynosure. He became the fourth batsman (after Sir Donald Bradman, Jacques Kallis and Mohammed Yousuf) to register hundreds in five consecutive Tests.         
	Sir Don, in fact, heads that list with six.         
	Asked by The Telegraph, at the Peninsula Hotel, whether hed been aware of where he stood, Gambhir replied: I was, yes... I knew that I was within sight of five in five. However, I didnt know that Bradman tops with six...         
	Gambhir doesnt play for records, but hes setting them. Indeed, on the way to his ninth hundred (116), Gambhir also joined the select club whose members have scored at least a 50 in each of their last 10 Tests.         
	Awesome really.         
	Whats especially pleasing is that his feet are firmly on the ground.         
	Gambhir does use them well, though, like when he stepped out, on 97, to send Shakib over the rope. What a way to reach a hundred!         
	The Bangladesh team is still in the stage of development and the Tamim Iqbals should try and learn from Gambhir.         
	Tamim, by the way, has begun the second innings in uncharacteristic fashion: 23 not out from 56 balls.         
	Its to be seen just how long the stroke-maker keeps his natural instincts in check. A good many, including uncle Mohammed Akram Khan (former captain and now selector), would be keeping fingers crossed.         
	Play is scheduled to begin at 8.30 am (IST).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City beat Villa 4-0
                                                                                                                       7                                      City beat Villa 4-0
                      
	London: Mario Balotelli gave Manchester City fans something to smile about  and even cracked a grin himself  as his hattrick helped City to a comfortable 4-0 win, which put them provisionally at the top of the Premier League table.         
	This victory moved City a point clear of rival Manchester United. They play Birmingham later on Tuesday.         
	City have 38 points from 20 games, but have played three games more than United and two more than third-place Arsenal.         
	Meanwhile, Nikola Kalinic scored two goals before being sent off, on Tuesday, as Blackburn beat West Bromwich Albion 3-1 to give new manager Steve Kean his first victory in the Premier League.         
	Kalinic twice gave Blackburn the lead at The Hawthorns before being dismissed for a robust challenge on Paul Scharner shortly after Mame Biram Diouf added a third goal.

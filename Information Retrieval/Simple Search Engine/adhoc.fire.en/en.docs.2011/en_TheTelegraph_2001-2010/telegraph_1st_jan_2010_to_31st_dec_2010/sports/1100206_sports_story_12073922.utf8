The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Shroff holds key
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Shroff holds key
            PRAVESH GUPTA      
	Mumbai: Trainer Pesi Shroff is keeping his fingers crossed. Set Alight eluded him the Indian Derby honours last year. The jockey-turned-trainer, who has a record seven Indian Derby wins to his name while donning silks, is craving for this Derby, since stepping in to the new role. Pesi has five runners in a field of dozen hopefuls lined up for the richest ever Indian classic.           
	The winner takes home a whopping purse of Rs 1.27 crore. Speaking to The Telegraph, on Friday, Pesi dismissed the popular belief that the runaway Calcutta Derby winner, Bruckner, and the wonder filly Jacqueline will spearhead his stables challenge.           
	He made a statement that all five runners from his stables are champions in their own right. In fact, he emphasized that Onassis and Astral Flash are no pushovers. I would be happy if any of them wins the Derby, though Jacqueline is expected to be the favourite as her classic-kitty is the richest than the rest in the field, added Pesi.          
	Almost the entire Mahalaxmi racecourse is, however, rooting for Jacqueline despite the fact that very few fillies in this edition of the Derby have managed to score since the first Indian Derby was run in the year 1943, which was, incidentally, won by Princess Beautiful - a filly. However, another filly, Her Majesty, won every classic in Mumbai but the Indian Derby.          
	The veteran trainer Imtiaz Sait has been much impressed by Jacquelines victory in the Indian Oaks. Her victory left me amazed. She is in a different league altogether, said Sait who has two Indian Derbys to his name.          
	Performance chart grossly favours Jacqueline but what also matters in these races is the L (luck) facto, said trainer Vinayak who has saddled three Indian Derby winners.          
	For horseowners K.N. Dhunjibhoy, Mr and Mrs Vijay Shirke this Derby is going to be a very special one. Each of them has stakes in the three prime contenders- Jacqueline, Bruckner and Onassis.           
	The South India challenger Becket also has his followers. The Bangalore Derby winner is yet to taste defeat since his debut run. He is going from strength-to-strength. S. Padmanabhan was not available for comment but sources close to the trainer are confident that the horse would maintain his winning streak. The horse has had some problems in the past but he is fully fit now to take on the best, said the source.

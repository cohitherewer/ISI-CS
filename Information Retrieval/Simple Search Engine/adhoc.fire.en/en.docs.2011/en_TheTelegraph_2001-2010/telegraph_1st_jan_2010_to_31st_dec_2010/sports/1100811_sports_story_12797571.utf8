The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India deserve to be No.1 in Tests: Murali
                                                                                                                       7                                        India deserve to be No.1 in Tests: Murali
                              
	Johannesburg: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara might find the ICC rankings system flawed, but recently retired spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharan feels, that India are a deserving No. 1 Test nation.         
	Sangakkara, last month questioned the system and said it was not fair as the ICC didnt devise a proper home-and-away format in its Future Tour Programme (FTP), hinting that Mahendra Singh Dhonis men had not won series abroad against Sri Lanka, Australia and South Africa.         
	Muralidharan, who retired last month as Test crickets highest wicket-taker, had a completely different view on the system and said it was not necessary for a team to beat all other sides on tours before becoming No. 1.         
	India deserve to be the number one Test side because they won a lot of matches. They won against Australia in Australia, they won against England in England and they drew the recent series in Sri Lanka 1-1, he told reporters on the eve of the launch of Champions League Twenty20 here.         
	You cant criticise by saying that the point system is not good. That means you are trying to find fault with everyone. When some team deserves credit, it should be given and you have got to be honest, Muralidharan said.         
	I think you cant justify by saying that you have to win home and away and then only you can be the No. 1. When Australia were the No. 1 Test side, they had lost a series against us in Sri Lanka. Only in 2004, Australia won a series against us in Sri Lanka, he added.         
	I think the ICC have got a system in place and they have done it to the best of their ability. It is fair enough and whichever nation is No. 1, according to this system, they deserve it. No system is perfect. There are nine Test playing countries and if you try to play on home-and-away basis, it will take five-six years to rotate and it is impractical, he said.

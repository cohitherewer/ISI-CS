The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gagan wants to skip CWG
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gagan wants to skip CWG
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Gagan Narang has followed in the footsteps of Usain Bolt, Lleyton Hewitt and Samantha Stosur and turned his back on the Commonwealth Games.         
	Denied the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna for a third consecutive year, the world No.2 in 10-metre air rifle has made his hurt obvious, insisting that he is simply not motivated enough for the event to be held here in October.         
	I just dont feel motivated enough to pick up my gun and participate in the Commonwealth Games. I am completely demotivated and see no reason to compete, Narang told The Telegraph after arriving in the capital on Friday.         
	Narang, it should be noted, became the first Indian to seal a berth in the 2012 London Olympics, thanks to a top-notch show at the world championships in Munich.         
	This is a decision I am not going to take alone. I am going to talk to my coach (Stanislav Lapidus), my sponsors and family members.         
	I am sure they are going to support me. For the moment, I am in no mood to take part in the Commonwealth Games, said Narang.         
	Narang, who had bagged four gold medals at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, is already being counted among the favourites for the 10-m air rifle gold at the 2012 Games. He also has a world record and two World Cup gold medals under his belt.         
	My performance has been continuously ignored by the authorities, and that is what pains me the most, Narang said.         
	Not surprisingly, Narangs announcement created a stir in sporting circles and Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi even said he would personally speak to the 27-year-old ace.         
	I know Gagan has threatened to skip the Commonwealth Games, Kalmadi said. I am going to speak to him. He should participate and win gold medals for India. I am sure he will get the Khel Ratna, the IOA boss said.

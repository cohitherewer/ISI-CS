                                                                                                                       7                                      CSK can still make last four
                      
	Chennai: Chennai Super Kings have won just three out of eight matches in the Indian Premier League, but one of their key foreign recruit Michael Hussey said the arrival of him and pacer Doug Bollinger has strengthened his sides chances of making it to the semi-finals.         
	The race for the four berths is close. Though we have lost five matches including four in a row, it is not end of the world for us and we can turn it around. Now coach Stephen (Fleming) and captain (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) have more options, he said ahead of his sides match against Rajasthan Royals at the M A Chidambaram Stadium here on Saturday.         
	It is a great feeling to be back to CSK. Doug Bollinger and I joining the Super Kings should be a boost to the team. We are in good spirits and awaiting the matches. We will be positive in our approach, he added.         
	Hussey, though was not sure whether he will find a place in the playing eleven on Saturday. Tomorrow is a crucial match for us. We have to get the momentum going. We have four home matches and have the home advantage. I am looking forward to it.         
	But neither coach nor captain had spoken to me. We should be flexible. There will be changes in the playing eleven. The eleven would always be based on the opposition and ground conditions, he said. (PTI)

            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Paddy Upton                           
	Calcutta: Buoyed by the amazing response to a pep talk by Mike Horn, regarded as a legend among adventurers, Team Indias mental conditioning expert Paddy Upton is likely to involve him in a bigger way.         
	From what I could make out, the players response has been amazing... And, so, I wouldnt say Fridays interaction is going to remain a one-off... Of course, nothing has been finalised, Upton told The Telegraph on Sunday, after the first days play at the Eden.         
	As reported in these columns, the South Africa-born Horn gave the pep talk during the team dinner (at Taj Bengal) that day.         
	Upton added: What happened that evening was definitely special, for Mike hadnt engaged that way for a couple of years... Hes just too busy.         
	The 43-year-old Horns adventures have taken him across the globe. Of late, he has also been championing environmental causes.         
	Incidentally, some of the players, too, are now big on the environment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Henry fears come true
                                                                                                                       7                                        Henry fears come true
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                  A giant screen shows the Champions League quarter final line-up at the Uefa headquarters, in Nyon, on Friday. (Reuters)                            
	Thierry Henry will make an emotional return to Arsenal in the Champions League quarter finals after Barcelona, the reigning champions, were pitted against his former club in Fridays draw.         
	It will be the first time the Barcelona forward, Arsenals all-time leading scorer, has faced Arsene Wengers side since he left them for Spain in 2007. The first leg of the tie will take place at Emirates Stadium.         
	Should Arsene Wengers side find a way past the Spanish giants, who beat them in the 2006 final in Paris, they face the possibility of a tough semi-final against Jose Mourinhos Inter Milan.         
	I believe we will not be favourites but for me it will be a 50-50 game, Wenger said. Thats how we have to take it. Of course they are a good side, so are we. It will be an interesting, exciting game. We have to make sure we have the belief and focus right.         
	In the other half of the draw, Manchester United will renew their rivalry with Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals, before facing either Lyons or Bordeaux in the last four.         
	In an interview with this paper earlier this month, Henry admitted the idea of playing his former club was difficult to stomach. Ill be an Arsenal fan until I die and if you ask me how that makes me feel about the possibility that Barcelona might meet Arsenal in the next round of the Champions League should we both qualify, I have to say I find the idea unthinkable, he said.         
	Its always the same on the day of a Champions League draw. Until I see that Arsenal have been paired with another team, I cant breathe. Proud though I am to be a Barcelona player, I dread the thought of having to oppose Arsenal. I would hate it. I pray for it not to happen.         
	In contrast to Arsenal, Manchester United appear to have a more straightforward path to the final, having avoided Barcelona and Inter. United will meet Bayern Munich, led by Franck Ribery, in a repeat of the 1999 final, which Fergusons side snatched in the dying minutes at the Nou Camp. United will be at home in the second leg.         
	The history of playing Bayern in past European ties tells you its going to be a very difficult tie for us, Ferguson said. Itll be a fantastic atmosphere in both games. They have a great stadium and good pitch and were up against a good, experienced team. Hopefully well have everyone we need for the game and weve got a good chance.         
	In the other quarter finals, France is guaranteed a side in the last four after Lyons and Bordeaux were drawn together, while Inter will play CSKA Moscow.

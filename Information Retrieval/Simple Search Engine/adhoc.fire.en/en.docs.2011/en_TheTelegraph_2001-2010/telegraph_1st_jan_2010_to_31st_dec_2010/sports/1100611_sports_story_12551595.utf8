The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tricky opener for Les Bleus
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tricky opener for Les Bleus
                      
	Cape Town: World beaters or first-round flops? France have been at both ends of the tournament spectrum in recent years and go into Fridays Group A opener against Uruguay with fans still unsure which is this years likely path.         
	Followers of the French national team have long given up trying to predict how they will fare having seen them gravitate wildly and though the players are sounding upbeat, there is an underlying nervousness about their opener.         
	After lifting the trophy in 1998 and following up with the European Championship two years later, they suffered ignominious defeat by Senegal in their first match of the 2002 World Cup and went out .         
	They bounced back to reach the World Cup final in 2006 but were abject in Euro 2008 where they managed just one point.         
	Having struggled to qualify via a fortunate play-off win over Ireland, France were then presented with what looked a favourable draw alongside Uruguay, South Africa and Mexico.         
	However, an unimpressive warm-up campaign culminating in a 1-0 defeat by China, combined with signs of upward development from their three rivals, has left the country torn about the teams prospects. The good thing in a way is that we are used to doing it the hard way because thats what we did in qualifying, said midfielder Jeremy Toulalan. We know it will not be easy but were used to that and ready for it.         
	Coach Raymond Domenech, who has long laboured under a cloud of fan and media doubt, has sprung something of a surprise for his farewell party by introducing an attacking 4-3-3 system in recent games. While the new approach has succeeded in shaking off some of his sides reputation for dull play it has also exposed them defensively.         
	It hardly seems the ideal time to start experimenting and Domenech, with little time to hone the new tactics, picked the same outfield starters in all three friendlies in an effort to speed up the process. The three front runners are effectively two wingers and a striker  with Nicolas Anelka being preferred to Thierry Henry  but even the players seem unconvinced.         
	We cant really say we have improved during the warm-up games, said midfielder Alou Diarra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Close to writing history, says Kuyt
                                                                                                                       7                                        Close to writing history, says Kuyt
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                 
	Cape Town: Dirk Kuyt is confident Holland are finally about to reach the end of their long journey to World Cup glory.         
	Beaten World Cup finalists in 1974 and 1978, the Dutch get their third shot at footballs greatest prize on Sunday when they tackle either Germany or Spain, following Tuesday nights 3-2 defeat of Uruguay.         
	And Kuyt is determined to ensure it is third time lucky for the Oranje.         
	After a long journey we are in the final, he said. We are so close to writing history. This is the third time we have reached the final. Now we have to win it.         
	Kuyt admitted it was difficult to put his emotions into words at the final whistle. Holland had gone in front thanks to a long-range strike from captain Giovanni van Bronckhorst, only to be pegged back by Diego Forlan just before half-time.         
	For a decent period in the second half, the South Americans looked the more likely winners.         
	However, just as it appeared there was no way through for the Dutch, Wesley Sneijders incredible year took another twist when he threaded a shot through a crowd of bodies and into the Uruguay net.         
	Three minutes later, Kuyt crossed for Arjen Robben, whose precise header also went in off the post, and Holland were through.         
	What has happened is unbelievable. It is a bit unreal, said Kuyt. We felt before the tournament we had the quality in the team to win it but now it is an incredible feeling.         
	Holland coach Bert van Marwijk expressed his delighted at seeing the hard work of two years near fruition.         
	Van Marwijk said, Im so very proud that such a small country is in the final of a World Cup. Its difficult to get your head around.         
	This is something we started working on two years ago. You really have to believe in something, and live it, to achieve something like this.         
	We cultivated this mentality in the team. We have banished complacency. I just said to them: Dont let this chance slip away. They didnt.         
	Kuyt was singled out as the epitome of the Holland team that won through to the World Cup final.         
	Van Marwijk said the Liverpool player displayed the selflessness which has allowed the Dutch to reach their first world final in 32 years.         
	He said, In the Netherlands there were quite a few debates about which players I should play. Dirk Kuyt, par excellence, is a team player.         
	He is the example of a true and genuine team player. Hes so focused, hes working so hard for the team and gives such a positive signal to the rest of the players. Im so pleased with him.

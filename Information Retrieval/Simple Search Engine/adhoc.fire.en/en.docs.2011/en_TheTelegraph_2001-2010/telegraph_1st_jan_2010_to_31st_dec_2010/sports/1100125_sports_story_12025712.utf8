	Colombo: Cash-strapped Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is negotiating with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to host a tri-nation tournament, also featuring New Zealand, and a Test series involving India later this year.         
	According to a report in a Sri Lankan newspaper, discussion is on between the SLC and the BCCI for the tri-series in July, followed by a three-match Test series.         
	The Test series is almost certain of coming through, SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga was quoted as saying. We are awaiting confirmation from India and New Zealand on the tri-nation series.According to the report, the tri-series is tentatively scheduled from July 9-24, followed by the Test matches from July 28-August 15.         
	India recently hosted Sri Lanka for a full series, featuring three Tests and five one-day Internationals before they met again in the tri-series in Bangladesh.         
	India-Sri Lanka encounters have become so frequent of late that they have eclipsed the 121-match record between Australia and West Indies. (PTI)

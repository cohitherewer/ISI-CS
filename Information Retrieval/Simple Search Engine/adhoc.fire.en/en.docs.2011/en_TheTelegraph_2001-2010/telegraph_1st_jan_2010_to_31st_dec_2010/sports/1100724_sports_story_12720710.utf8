The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali tougher to face than Warne: Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                        Murali tougher to face than Warne: Sourav
                  Muralidharan                     
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has the experience of tackling two of the greatest spinners of all times  Muttiah Muralidharan and Shane Warne.         
	On Friday, he chose the Sri Lankan ahead of the Australian as a tougher customer to face on the 22-yard strip.         
	Paying glowing tributes to Muralidharan, who retired from Test cricket on Thursday with a tally of 800 Test wickets, Sourav said: I dont want to get into a comparison, but I would prefer Warne. Murali is more accurate, has more variations and so is tougher to face.         
	Sourav termed Muralidharans Test retirement as the end of an era.         
	Warne and (Anil) Kumble had already retired and now (Muttiah) Muralidharan... It is the end of an era, the 38-year-old said. His (Muralis) record will be very hard to break He has been a great chapter in Sri Lankan cricket, having reigned supreme for more than 15 years. He is hard to be compared with anybody, he added.         
	Speaking about Muralis retirement, Sourav said that he chose, like many other greats, to retire when he was at the peak of his career.         
	All great players leave when they are at the peak. Its really a nice way to bid goodbye to Test cricket after taking 800 wickets. (Sunil) Gavaskar, Shane (Warne), Glenn (McGrath) all called it quits in prime of their respective careers. I am sure when Sachin Tendulkar decides to leave, he too will do a similar thing, said Sourav.         
	Sourav said Muralidharan still has a lot of cricket left in him and hoped he would continue to play in shorter formats of the game.         
	I am sure he will play in ODIs, IPL, he said.           (PTI)

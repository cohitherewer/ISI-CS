The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Suresh deserves it, says Kirsten
                                                                                                                       7                                        Suresh deserves it, says Kirsten
  - Mahendra Singh Dhoni happy that seniors have been given a break       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Suresh Raina in Bridgetown, on Sunday                                 
	Bridgetown: Suresh Raina was boarding the team bus at the Hilton, on Sunday morning, when he learnt of his appointment as captain for Indias short tour of Zimbabwe.         
	Besides featuring in a tri-series, with Sri Lanka being the third team, India will play two T20 Internationals against the hosts.         
	Main khush hoon... But, right now, Im focused on todays match... Its such an important game that I cant think of anything else, Raina told The Telegraph.         
	That the top guns would be rested and Raina was a top contender for the No.1 job had been reported in these columns on Thursday.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the regular captain, was pleased that the seniors had been given a break. Yes, Im happy, he said, speaking exclusively, while boarding the bus for the Kensington Oval.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten was curious to know the composition of the squad. When shown on a BlackBerry, he commented: Good... Its good...         
	Asked if he was pleased with the choice of the captain, Kirsten replied: Oh, absolutely... Suresh deserves it... I see fine leadership qualities in him.         
	Raina, it may be recalled, had been the Chennai Super Kings stand-in captain in IPL III when an injury forced Dhoni to miss a few matches.         
	In placing Raina in the hot seat, albeit for a limited period, the national selectors have broken with tradition as the 23-year-old left-hander is yet to play Test cricket.

	Karachi: Pakistan team manager Intikhab Alam was in for a rude shock when the voice recorder of his mobile phone in New Zealand attributed him to be an Indian.         
	The Pakistani media and others were stunned when they called Intikhab in New Zealand after the voice recorder of his phone kept on saying that the manager of the Indian team was not available at the moment and will try to return the call later.         
	Irked by the mistake, the Pakistan team management had to remind the host Board  New Zealand Cricket  that Intikhab was not an Indian.         
	The telephone numbers are provided by the host countrys Board, a source in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said. In Intihkabs case, the telephone company was mistakenly informed that he is manager of the Indian team, he added.

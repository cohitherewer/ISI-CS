	Guangzhou: Feng Lanlans karate title, on Friday, gave China its 184th gold medal at Guangzhou, ensuring the record for most golds at an Asian Games and keeping them well on course to reach 200.         
	Bangladesh collected its first gold medal ever at an Asian Games, and finished off the feel-good story of the games when Mohammad Shabbir clobbered consecutive sixes off Karim Khan Sadeq to lead his team to a narrow win over Afghanistan in the cricket final.         
	Japan has lost hope of overhauling South Korea for second place. Two upset defeats dented Japans reputation as the powerhouse in womens wrestling, with world champions Kyoko Hamaguchi and Mio Nishimaki out of contention after being pinned in the second-round.         
	Soari Yoshida restored some order, claiming the 55kg class for her unprecedented third straight Asian Games title.

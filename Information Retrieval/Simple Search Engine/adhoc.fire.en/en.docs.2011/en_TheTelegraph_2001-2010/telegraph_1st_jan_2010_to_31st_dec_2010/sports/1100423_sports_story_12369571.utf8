The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | AFC may spell CFLs doom
                                                                                                                       7                                      AFC may spell CFLs doom
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) committee for Indian professional football will have its crucial meeting in Doha on Saturday which may sound the death knell for Calcutta football.         
	The committee, chaired by AFC president Mohammed Bin Hammam, has several Indian members including the AIFF president Praful Patel and general secretary Alberto Colaco. According to sources, the committees main agenda would be to push through a ruling that would prevent all the I-League clubs from participating in their respective local leagues.         
	It would be a big blow for Calcutta football if Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are not allowed to play in the local league. I am certainly not in favour of it, said IFA secretary Utpal Ganguly.         
	The move will completely ruin the very charm of Calcutta league which is being played for more than hundred years now, he added.         
	The Calcutta league is not only the nursery of football for the state but it also generates revenue that is being used for the development of the game. Who is going to compensate for our financial loss, Ganguly asked.         
	There is a feeling around that though the idea was actually mooted by the AFC president in the meeting held in Kuala Lumpur on March 19, a section of people in the AIFF want it to be implemented as soon as possible.         
	Bengal and Goa would be the worst affected, and the association secretaries of these two states have been carefully kept out of the committee to get the required agenda passed, alleged an AIFF executive committee member.         
	A senior official of the AIFF, who is close to AFC bosses, wants to undermine the state leagues for the benefit of the I-League, the member said.         
	East Bengal president Pronab Dasgupta, incidentally, is the only official from Calcutta to be accommodated in the committee.         
	The Goa Football Association (GFA) honorary secretary, Savio Messias said he wasnt still convinced with the idea. There are several ifs and buts attached to it. I have already written to AFC on this issue, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Going to be real close, says Brasa 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Going to be real close, says Brasa 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT          Brasa                           
	New Delhi: A month away from starting their campaign in the World Cup hockey in the capital, national coach Jose Brasa said he would be delighted to find India in the semi-finals of the 12-team competition.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Sunday, Brasa, known for his plain talking, said: Reaching the semi-finals would not be an easy task. We are in a tough group that has Australia, Spain, England and Pakistan. The fight for the top two spots from this group is going to be real close.         
	Please dont get me wrong, said the Spanish coach, believed to be one of the best in the business. I am only trying to make you aware of the reality. It doesnt mean I have no faith in my boys.         
	After six months of intense training at Pune, they are in good shape, capable of challenging any team. If we manage to make the last four, then the trophy could be ours, he added.         
	On Sunday, the Indian team has shifted its base to the capital and will start practising at the Major Dhyanchand Sports Complex from Monday, the venue for the World Cup.         
	The coach is happy with the arrangement but said he would have loved to play a few more friendly matches against top teams this month.         
	All other teams are playing practice matches. Its good that we would be able to make use of the turf that will host the World Cup, but with a few more friendlies things could have been better, Brasa commented.         
	Striker Prabhjot Singh, according to Brasa, would be leading the Indian attack in the World Cup, being hosted in India for the first time in 26 years. He is affectionately called Jyoti in the camp. It means light, I was told. Prabhjot should really show the light to others in the team, said the coach.         
	Apart from Prabhjot, the coach also singled out forward Arjun Halappa, centre half Sardara Singh and goalkeeper Adrian DSouza for special praise. All these boys have to come good for Indias success, he said.         
	Brasas team would play a mixture of modern and traditional Indian style of hockey in the World Cup.         
	In the last six months, I have given my boys full freedom to play typical Indian style of hockey where they play close to each other in the opponents area. Let them explore the game in their own way but at the same time I have made them go through drills where they will have to be clear and fast with the ball.         
	My defenders are yet not perfect but I have asked them to concentrate on tackling and challenging the opponent.

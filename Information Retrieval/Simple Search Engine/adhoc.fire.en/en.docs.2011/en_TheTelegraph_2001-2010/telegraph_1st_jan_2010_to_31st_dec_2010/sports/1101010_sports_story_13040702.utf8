	Ishita Tibrewal beat Deeya Banerjee to win the girls U-14 singles final at the BTA Ranking Junior Tennis Tournament, in Calcutta, on Saturday.       
	Tibrewal took a 3-0 lead in the first set, but Banerjee bounced back with attacking forehands to level it to 3-3. But Tibrewal showed composure to clinch it 6-3 and wrap the second set up 6-2. In another match, Sanjib Kerketta lifted the boys U-18 singles final beating second seed Prem Singh 6-1, 6-1.                
	 The decision to close down the Maidan from October 1 to 15 does not seem to have gone down well with members of the IFA governing body. Though the decision was taken in keeping with a pre-independence rule, IFA governing council members who met on Saturday have decided to take up the matter with the Army.       
	A committee has been formed to deal with the issue comprising secretaries of Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting clubs. The panel is also mulling legal action if necessary.

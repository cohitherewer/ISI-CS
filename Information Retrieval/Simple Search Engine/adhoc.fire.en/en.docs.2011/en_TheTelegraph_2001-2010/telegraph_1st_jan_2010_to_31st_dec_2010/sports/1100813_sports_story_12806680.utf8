The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | In-form NZ hold the edge vs SL
                                                                                                                       7                                        In-form NZ hold the edge vs SL
  - Ross Taylors men need to beat the hosts to stay at No. 2 position             Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara in Dambulla, on Thursday                           
	Dambulla: A confident New Zealand, with a spectacular win against India under their belt, would look to continue their sparkling show when they clash with hosts Sri Lanka in the second match of the tri-series here on Friday.         
	Beating the Lankans at home is a tough prospect. But the way New Zealand crushed India in the series-opener, the hosts must have re-worked their strategy against the Black Caps.         
	The Black Caps, who moved to the No.2 position in the ICC rankings after defeating India, will have to continue their winning streak against Sri Lanka to maintain their rank. If New Zealand lose, they will drop down the ladder.         
	Both the teams have some exciting pacers in their ranks and if the conditions favour them again, it promises to be a cracking contest between bat and ball.         
	A second consecutive win will enhance New Zealands chances of making the summit clash but an in-form Sri Lanka would rely on home conditions to make a winning start.         
	The New Zealand top-order was rocked by the Indian pacers and considering that Sri Lanka have a more lethal attack in Lasith Malinga, Chamara Kapugedara and Nuwan Kulasekara, the New Zealand batsmen have a tough task at hand.         
	All-rounder Angelo Mathews, with his effective medium pace, is likely to make the cut and the hosts may prefer impressive Suraj Randiv over Ajantha Mendis for the spinners slot.         
	The Lankan batting line-up, led by skipper Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and Thilan Samaraweera, also looks solid.         
	However, Sri Lanka, fresh from their three-Test series against India, will have to make a swift switch to the ODI mode to pose any trouble before the Black Caps.         
	That New Zealand are in a better shape for the limited overs format was evident from their superb display in the last match.         
	Thrust into captaincy in the absence of Daniel Vettori, Ross Taylor led the side from front with a classy 95 against India. However, seniors like Martin Guptill and Jacob Oram will have to contribute too.         
	New Zealands bowling department looks to be in good nick as they skittled out the Indians for a paltry 88. Daryll Tuffey, Kyle Mills and Oram demolished the strong Indian line-up and if the trio can repeat their show, New Zealand would be placed comfortably in the series.         
	Teams         
	Sri Lanka (from): Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene, Tillekaratne Dilshan, Dilhara Fernando, Rangana Herath, Suraj Randiv, Chamara Kapugedera, Nuwan Kulasekara, Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews, Ajantha Mendis, Thisara Perera, Thilan Samaraweera, Chamara Silva, Upul Tharanga.         
	New Zealand (from): Ross Taylor, Kyle Mills, Grant Elliott, Martin Guptill, Gareth Hopkins, Nathan McCullum, Andy McKay, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Peter Ingram, Tim Southee, Scott Styris, Daryl Tuffey, BJ Watling, Kane Williamson.         
	Match starts: 2.30pm (IST).

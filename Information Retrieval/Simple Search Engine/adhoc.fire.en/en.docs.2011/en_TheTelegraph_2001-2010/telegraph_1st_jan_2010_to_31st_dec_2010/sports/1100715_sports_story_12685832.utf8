The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I expected to go far, says Messi
                                                                                                                       7                                        I expected to go far, says Messi
                  Lionel Messi during a news conference in Panama City, on Tuesday                     
	Panama City: Lionel Messi says Argentinas 4-0 defeat to Germany in the World Cup quarter finals left him with a bad feeling that lingers almost two weeks later.         
	Messi is playing an exhibition game in the Panama capital on Wednesday, which will feature Messi and a few Argentine players against a team led by former German international Kevin Kuranyi. Messi arrived after spending a holiday on the beach in Brazil. It left me with a bad feeling, Messi said of the World Cup loss. I expected to go far. Now there is nothing we can do.         
	Messi was reluctant to be drawn on the national teams immediate future, saying it was up to Diego Maradona to decide if he wants to continue as coach.         
	Maradona could decide his future late on Wednesday when he is expected to meet Argentine Football Association (AFA) president Julio Grondona.         
	As he walked off the pitch after Argentinas crushing quarter-final World Cup exit, Maradona hinted that it was time for him to quit as national coach. His jubilant welcome home might have made him think twice.         
	AFA spokesman Ernesto Cherquis Bialo, who helped to write Maradonas autobiography, said the decision was down to Maradona.         
	If Maradona wants to...he will continue. People have unconditional support for Maradona; other coaches who made the same mistake as him (losing in the quarter-finals), have had to resign.         
	A close friend said Maradona has been feeling down since the defeat despite receiving the support of players including Gabriel Heinze, captain Javier Mascherano and Messi.         
	Hes dealing with the blow in his own way, the friend said, asking not to be named. Hes always said he wanted to be the teams coach for the rest of his life, but you always have to consider whether it makes sense.

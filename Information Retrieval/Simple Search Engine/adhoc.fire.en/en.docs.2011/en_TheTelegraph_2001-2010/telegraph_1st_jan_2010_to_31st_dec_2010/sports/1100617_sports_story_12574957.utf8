The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal is king if injury-free
                                                                                                                       7                                        Nadal is king if injury-free

	With a stunning display Rafael Nadal stormed back to the summit at Roland Garros. He defeated the 6ft 4inch Swede Robin Soderling in three straight sets in the finals of the French Championships.         
	Now, with his ranking at No.1, Nadal is the monarch of the tennis world. He rampaged through the opposition without losing a single set in any of his seven matches.         
	Nadal was at his very best in the finals. After one of the long rallies in the final when he brought off a winner from a hopeless position, the television commentator said: I cant believe it. It must be an illusion.         
	I found the transformation in Nadals game unbelievable. He has greatly improved his service and it is not rare to see him thump down an ace at a crucial point. Whats more, is that he chalked up an amazing seventy-seven percent strike rate on his first serve, enabling him to dominate the rallies.         
	One is told that Nadals racket strings have now been tailored to reduce the spin on his shots, giving him greater depth on his ground strokes  a very important factor.         
	The problem of tendinitis in his knees was handled wisely with a long lay-off which forced him to miss Wimbledon last year. Reducing the number of tournaments is another wise step since Nadals style of play is intensely physical. One must pay tribute to Nadal and his supporting team to come out of last years trough with greater resolve and patient long term planning. Nadal now seems unassailable at the top of the tennis world, provided he can keep free from injuries.         
	At Queens Club Nadal asked by the Press if he had improved and was a better player now, replied: Sometimes in my last matches it seems that I am playing better and then I watch a video of me playing against Andy Murray in the Wimbledon quarterfinals and Roger Federer in the finals in 2008. It is difficult to play much better than that.         
	After 23 consecutive semi-final appearances in the Grand Slams it was sad to see Federer losing to Soderling in the quarters.         
	Federers game brought out the best in the giant Swede who has improved since last year. Soderlings crushing power and experience at the highest levels will make him a live contender for the Grand Slams.         
	I would certainly not write-off Federers chances at Wimbledon, even though he seems to have lost confidence and his majestic gait between points. It was depressing to see him scrambling to retrieve Soderlings powerful shots. But the Wimbledon grass is very different and suits Federers smooth game. If Federer gets a good draw he may pull out a record seventh title from his hat.         
	The womens singles teaming with as many as six former Grand Slam champions proved to be a lacklustre event. The winner, 30 year old Francesca Schiavone from Italy broke away from the chorus line, stole the lead role and grabbed the title.         
	The victory was not a fairy tale. No magic transformation took place. The 17th seeds success was built brick by brick by insatiable perseverance, a big fighting heart and brilliant tactical play.               Rafael Nadal   
	After a mighty effort at the moment of victory she lay spread eagled on the red clay, then clambered up the stands to be buried under a horde of wildly cheering delirious Italian fans. Schiavones victory was a gust of fresh air in the stale scene of womens tennis.         
	Venus Williams with the fastest service in womens tennis will be a major threat for the Wimbledon title.         
	Tennis is at the crossroads and in an interesting phase.         
	The next two Grand Slams will signal if Federer is in the decline.         
	Also, one wonders if Nadal will stay injury free when he puts his foot down flat on the accelerator. Any one  Soderling, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray or Tomas Berdych  could effectively challenge Nadal at Wimbledon and the hard courts of the US Open. Wimbledon and time will give us all the answers.

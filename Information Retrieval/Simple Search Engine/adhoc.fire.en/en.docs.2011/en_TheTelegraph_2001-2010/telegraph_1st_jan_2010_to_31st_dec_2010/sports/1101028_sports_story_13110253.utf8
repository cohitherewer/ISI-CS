The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kochi gets 30-day notice
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kochi gets 30-day notice
    - Franchise to be terminated if dispute is not resolved within deadline           OUR BUREAU AGENCIES                            
	Calcutta/Nagpur: In a respite for the squabbling Kochi Indian Premier League (IPL) consortium, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday gave the franchise 30 more days to resolve its dispute or risk termination from the high-profile league.         
	The IPL governing council, after an emergency meeting to discuss the issue, served a 30-day termination notice to the franchise to sort out its differences failing which it would stand cancelled.         
	The governing council received replies from two parties, the Rendezvous group and the other co-owners, and they both felt that the dispute still exists, BCCI president Shashank Manohar told reporters after the meeting.         
	The governing council has invoked clause 12 (1) and given them a 30-day notice. In case they dont settle these disputes in the 30 days, the franchise would stand cancelled on the 31st day, he said.         
	The meeting was convened by Manohar due to the lingering dispute over who will run the affairs of the franchise, bought from the Board for $333 million, once the joint venture was formed.         
	The investors in the Kochi consortium include corporate firms Anchor Earth, Parinee Developers, Rosy Blue and Film Wave  who hold 75 per cent of the equity. The remaining 25 per cent has been given to the family of Gaikwads  Shailendra, his brother Ravi and their parents plus a few others, all part of the group of promoters, Rendezvous Sports World  as free equity for services rendered in successfully bidding for the franchise.         
	Asked why Kochi had been given more time after two other franchises  Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab  were terminated over ownership issues, Manohar said both the cases were different from Kochi.         
	This is not an irremediable breach that has been committed like in the case of the Rajasthan Royals and the Kings XI Punjab, and so, that is why they have been given 30 days time, he explained.         
	The two cases are altogether different. As far as Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab are concerned, there was transfer of ownership... But as far as Kochi is concerned there is no transfer of ownership Therefore, 30 days time has been given for the agreement, he said.         
	The BCCIs action was being interpreted as a reprieve for Kochi, which has been courting controversies ever since they won the bid. There was speculation ahead of the meeting that the team could be scrapped.         
	Welcoming the BCCI decision, Satyajit Gaikwad, Rendezvous Group CEO said the matter would be resolved at the earliest.         
	BCCI has given us enough time. I think, our investment partners also appreciate this. I hope the issue would be sorted out in the shortest possible time, he said.         
	We are very sure that we will definitely come up with a rapprochement. Either way I am thankful to Shashank Manohar, the governing council and the BCCI for giving us an opportunity to sort out the differences or come out with a solution which would be conducive to the Kochi team to conduct its business in a structure laid out by the IPL, he added.         
	A couple of weeks ago, the glamour-laden Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab were terminated without any notice by the BCCI, setting off a storm of protests by owners who have taken legal recourse.         
	Gaikwad said the group will not back down from its 25 per cent holding in the franchise but is in the process of buying 12.5 per cent of it to placate the other investors who are against free holding.         
	Rendezvous is, in uncertain terms, clear that we will never come down from 25 per cent equity. But in case of the free equity, we are ready to bring in the money and review it from 25 per cent to 12.5 per cent as agreed by investors and the Board. We have requested the Board to give us permission to make such structural changes, Gaikwad said.         
	On the basis of permission given to us, we would proceed to put in the investment for 12.5 per cent. We have already given a cheque in those financial terms to the consortium and are sure that since we have 30 days of grace period, we should come down to an understanding and close up the differences, he added.

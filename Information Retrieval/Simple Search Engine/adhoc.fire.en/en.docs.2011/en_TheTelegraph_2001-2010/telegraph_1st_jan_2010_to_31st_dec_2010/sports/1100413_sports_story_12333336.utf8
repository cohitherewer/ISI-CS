The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Incredible win, says Gilchrist
                                                                                                                       7                                      Incredible win, says Gilchrist
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Deccan Chargers captain Adam Gilchrist was ecstatic at the post-match presentation ceremony and felt that 151 was always defendable on a slow wicket like the one in Nagpur. The Chargers who are now at fifth position in the table remain in the hunt for a place in the semi-final.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Adam Gilchrist: It was an incredible win. Its nice that even after getting out of the very first ball of the match, I can still laugh at the end of the match. I always felt that we can defend a 150-plus total on this wicket. I felt as we had twice chased on this track and never felt comfortable doing so. Also the ground is big. So when we were put into bat, I wasnt disappointed at all. Pragyan Ojha has been outstanding for us in the tournament. He has delivered whenever he has got the ball in hand. I am also proud of Harmeets performance. It was a superb 19th over. The crowd support was also fantastic. Especially in Nagpur and Cuttack, we have got great support.         
	Anil Kumble: I am very disappointed about the fact that we couldnt chase down a target of 150 odd. Dale Steyn bowled brilliantly upfront and took three quick wickets. The pitch was on the slower side but 152 was certainly gettable. The Deccan Chargers bowled well, but we also let them bowl that well. Robin was playing brilliantly but you cant expect Robin to win you each and every game.         
	Harmeet Singh: I would like to thank my mom and dad for putting me into cricket. Also my childhood coach Bhupindersir. The turning point was definitely getting a big-hitter like Robin Uthappa out. I have been practising the slower deliveries for a long time. I have practised the variations like bringing it from the back of the hand and under the fingers.

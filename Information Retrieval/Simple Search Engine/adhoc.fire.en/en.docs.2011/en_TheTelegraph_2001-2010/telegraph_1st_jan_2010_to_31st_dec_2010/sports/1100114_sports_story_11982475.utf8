The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Scholarship in memory of Raj Singh

	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has only decided to name its corporate trophy after Raj Singh Dungarpur, who passed away four months ago, but a well-wisher has chosen to institute a scholarship in his memory.         
	Sachin Bajaj, managing director of the Mumbai-headquartered Global Cricket School (GCS), is the one who has taken the initiative. He has the support of Raj Singhs family.         
	A student from Cambridge University will be the first recipient, with a formal letter being handed over to the Universitys representative, former MCC secretary Roger Knight, by a member of the family.         
	Fittingly, that will be done at the Cricket Club of India, which was the former BCCI presidents second home for decades, on Thursday evening.         
	The scholarship will include 10 days of coaching, courtesy the GCS, which runs camps in India, Sri Lanka and in Australia.         
	Were starting in a small way... This scholarship will be rotated... So, next year, it may go to a student from Oxford, Bajaj told The Telegraph.         
	Cambridge got preference owing to Raj Singhs close association with former England captain Tony Lewis, who is involved with cricket at the University, and with Knight himself.         
	Details havent been finalised, but Bajaj and Raj Singhs family also intend sending an U-19 Indian cricketer to the UK this summer. That, too, would be covered by the scholarship.         
	Exposure is going to be either at one of the Counties, possibly second XI-level, or through a private academy.         
	This should also be an annual feature, but it could take some time for the modalities to be worked out... The GCS will again be in the picture, Bajaj added.         
	Whats certain is that the BCCI wont be associated with the exercise. Nobody from the BCCI, it may be recalled, had bothered to attend Raj Singhs funeral in his native Dungarpur.

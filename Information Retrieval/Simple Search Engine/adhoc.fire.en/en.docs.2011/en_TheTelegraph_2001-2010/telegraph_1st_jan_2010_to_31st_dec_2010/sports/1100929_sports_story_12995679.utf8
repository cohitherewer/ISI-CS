                                                                                                                       7                                        Smooth drive for Srinivasan
 - Will an olive branch be extended to Dalmiya?            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shashank Manohar (from left), Jagmohan Dalmiya and N. Srinivasan                           
	Mumbai: The line of succession mapped out during Sharad Pawars tenure as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president, from November 2005 till September 2008, continues to have an obstacle-free run.         
	Clearly, everything has gone according to script, which was written with a one-point agenda: End Jagmohan Dalmiyas hold over the BCCI.         
	With that now complete, theres actually talk that the ruling group may extend an olive branch to Dalmiya, who has, in the past, headed both the International Cricket Council and the BCCI.         
	Its learnt that Dalmiya had a somewhat lengthy conversation with president Shashank Manohar and the man who is going to suceeed him, Narayanswamy Srinivasan, at the Cricket Centre on Tuesday afternoon, but details werent available.         
	Everybody, in fact, kept mum.         
	Getting back to the line of succession... Manohar faced no opposition when he became the president-elect in 2007. Srinivasan sailed through on Tuesday, when nobody else filed his nomination for that very post.         
	Approval, at the AGM on Wednesday, is an absolute formality.         
	Srinivasan, who is the BCCI secretary, will take over from Manohar in September 2011. Till then, hes going to continue in the position he has been in for two years.         
	By rotation, after Central, it is Souths turn to get the presidency. After that, it will be East, in 2014.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, Goa politician Dayanand Narvekar was lobbying to succeed Manohar, but couldnt muster support even in his zone, as required by the rules.         
	Narvekar, perhaps, was banking on his party (Congress) to help him... Nothing happened... Hed probably also been hoping for backing from Karnataka, but his calculations had no basis, explained one of the sources.         
	Within the BCCI, Narvekar is best remembered for the tickets scam during the India-Australia ODI in Margao, back in April 2001.         
	All the principal office-bearers are going to continue for another year, but there will be two new vice-presidents. Rajeev Shukla is Lalit Kumar Modis replacement from Central, while Niranjan Shah takes over from Chirayu Amin in West.         
	That Shukla, a member of the Rajya Sabha, was tipped to take Modis seat was reported in these columns on September 18.         
	Already suspended, Modi wont figure in any of the subcommittees, too. He wont be on the IPLs governing council either. From the BCCI, then, its bye-bye Modi.         
	While Shukla has twice been a vice-president, from East, Shah is a former secretary.         
	Incidentally, among the proposers/seconders for Srinivasan were three affiliates from East  Orissa, Tripura and Jharkhand.         
	The three presidents (Ranjib Biswal, BCCI vice-president Arindam Ganguly and Amitabh Choudhary, respectively), were there in person. All could be aspiring to one day head the BCCI.         
	Meanwhile, its gathered that the associations are set to get a higher subsidy.         
	THE 2010-11 LINE-UP         
	President: Shashank Manohar; President-elect: Narayanswamy Srinivasan; Vice-presidents: Arun Jaitley (North), Shivlal Yadav (South), Arindam Ganguly (East), Niranjan Shah (West), Rajeev Shukla (Central); Secretary: Srinivasan; Joint-secretary: Sanjay Jagdale; Treasurer: Mohinder Pandove.         
	Footnote: Amin is expected to continue as the IPL chairman. However, theres pressure on the iconic former captain, Mansur Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi. He may not be there on the reconstituted governing council.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Waqar worried over probables
                                                                                                                       7                                      Waqar worried over probables
                      
	Karachi: Waqar Younis, Pakistan teams coach, Friday called for a quick decision on the spot-fixing allegations surrounding some leading Pakistani players.         
	The former Test captain said that he would like to have a clear picture as far as the availability of the players were concerned for the 2011 World Cup.         
	We need a clear picture as to the players who are eligible to play. Then, they can just focus on the job ahead, Waqar said.         
	He also added that the spot-fixing allegations surrounding Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer were a distraction to the World Cup preparations.         
	Other senior players like Kamran Akmal, Shoaib Malik, Rana Naved-ul Hasan and Danish Kaneria are also in doubt for the World Cup with reports suggesting that the International Cricket Council has not yet given the Pakistan Cricket Board clearance to consider them for Cup selections.         
	However, Waqar refused to agree with Imran Khans assessment that Pakistan required the services of Aamer and Asif next February.         
	I hope they are available but in cricket no one is irreplaceable. Players come and go and that is the way the sport goes on. We have a lot of talent and even if these players are not available, it will not affect our World Cup preparations or campaign, he said.         
	The former fast bowler said that he had lot of confidence in the available lot of players and also didnt agree with one-day captain Shahid Afridis view that Pakistans preparations were not on track.         
	No, I think our preparations are going well. I feel we should be well prepared for the mega-event. I think our tour to New Zealand will be very important in our preparations as it will allow us to settle on a combination, he said.         
	Waqar also supported the PCBs decision to induct former captain Javed Miandad into the training camp in Lahore to work with the batsmen. I think Miandads greatness as a player is undisputed and his presence will help the players a lot. He can help us prepare for the New Zealand tour very well.         
	In another development, despite meeting some PCB officials, Akmal and Kaneria are still uncertain about Cup berths. To make matters worse, Akmal and Shoaib were also refused permission by PCB to go and play league cricket in Bangladesh .

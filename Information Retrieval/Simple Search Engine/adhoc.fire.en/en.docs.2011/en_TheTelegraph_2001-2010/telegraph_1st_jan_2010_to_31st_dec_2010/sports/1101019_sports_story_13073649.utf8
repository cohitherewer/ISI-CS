	Harrington ends 2-year drought   
	Johor Bahru: Indian golfer Rahil Gangjee played out a flawless front-nine as he returned a four-under 68 in the final round to sign off the highest among the Indians at tied 14th in the Iskander Johor Open here on Sunday.  
	Among other Indians in fray, Digvijay Singh was the next best-placed at tied 38 th, while Anirban Lahiri (71) and Gaganjeet Bhullar (71) were tied for the 44th position.         
	Padraig Harrington (69) lifted the trophy after his total of 20-under 268 had him three shots clear of the chasing pack.

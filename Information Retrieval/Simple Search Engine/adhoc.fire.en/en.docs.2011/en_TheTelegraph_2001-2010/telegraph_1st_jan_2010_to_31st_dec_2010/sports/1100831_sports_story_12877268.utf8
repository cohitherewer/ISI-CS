The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Javed calls for team change
                                                                                                                       7                                        Javed calls for team change
  - Would like to see more proof before drawing a conclusion: Sunny       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES              Miandad                            
	Javed Miandad, director general of the Pakistan Cricket Board and former coach, has said his countrys team should be replaced for the rest of their tour of England following claims of spot-fixing against players.         
	Miandad, who scored over 16,000 Test and ODI runs for Pakistan in a 21-year international career, also said he wants the team management to return home ahead of the remaining two Twenty20 and five one-day Internationals against England starting from next week.         
	It will be tough for the players to handle this pressure as they will not be in the right frame of mind, Miandad said. Its better that they should be replaced with new players, and I think we have enough talented players in reserve.         
	Miandad said he would be willing to coach a new team of players were the current squad and management to stand down.         
	If anyone is found guilty, he should not be spared and punished strictly, Miandad said. I am more than willing to accompany the new team and coach them in the Twenty20 and one-day internationals.         
	Following are what some of the other legends had to say on the spot-fixing controversy (alphabetically):         
	Ian Chappell: The revelations place considerable doubt on the outcome of the Sydney Test between Australia and Pakistan in January. Obviously for them to lose that game they had to be one of two things: the worst Test players of all time or the best match-fixers of all time.         
	Sunil Gavaskar: If the allegations are conclusively proved with enough evidence then action need to be taken so that this thing is not repeated. Whoever is indulging in this should be punished. If it is proved that the no balls were deliberate and induced by money, then yes, they should be punished. But I will like to see more proofs before making a conclusion.         
	The quick bowlers sometimes try to attack batsmen with their deliveries and overstep. If you go by the incidence of the arrest, then its some evidence. But a detailed probe must be carried out to find out what he had said and what was actually done by the bowlers. It could be just a co-incidence also.         
	Muttiah Muralidharan: I think, it (the scandal) will not affect the game. If they (players) are guilty and proven then you have to give bigger punishment like bans. But until proven we cant say anything.         
	Ramiz Raja: An entire generation has been left rudderless and hopeless by the acts of its favourite players. It is a disaster for cricket and at home it will take a long time for the wounds to heal. The players have let the country down. Mohammed Aamer! What a waste of talent... He was caught in a quick-fix mentality and will now pay the price. He will regret this for the rest of his life and the game has lost a great asset. For them to do it at Lords, the Mecca of cricket, brings extreme shame and sadness.

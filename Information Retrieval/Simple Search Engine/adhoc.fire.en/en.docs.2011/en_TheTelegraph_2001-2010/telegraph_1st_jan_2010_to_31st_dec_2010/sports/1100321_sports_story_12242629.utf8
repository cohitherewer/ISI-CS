	Shillong: Hosts Lajong FC rode a 71st minute goal by striker Seikhohao Tuboi to register a much-needed victory against Pune FC in a Round XVII I-League match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here Saturday.         
	The home side edged past the fancied opponents by a solitary goal to post a second straight win against Pune FC in a span of 30 days. Lajong had defeated Pune FC in the EK Nayanar Cup in Kannur by the same margin in their last encounter.         
	With Saturdays win, Lajong have added three more points to their tally to be 13th on the table with 17 points.         
	The slugfest, however, did not end on the ground. In the post-match news conference Pune FC coach Derrick Pereiras comments infuriated Lajong coach Stanley Rozario who lashed back from the same table.         
	In other matches, JCT beat Mumbai FC 1-0 in Ludhiana, while Dempo defeated Churchill Brothers 4-2 in Margao.         
	Salgaocar would be looking to exploit home advantage when they meet Chirag United Sunday.

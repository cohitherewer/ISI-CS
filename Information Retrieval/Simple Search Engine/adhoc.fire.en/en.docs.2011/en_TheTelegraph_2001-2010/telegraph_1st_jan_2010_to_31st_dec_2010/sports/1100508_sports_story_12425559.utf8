The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Houghton issue still unresolved
                                                                                                                       7                                        Houghton issue still unresolved
  - All India Football Federation agrees to give the Asian Cup campers a hike       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Bob Houghton                                 
	New Delhi: The issue of Bob Houghtons resignation remained largely unresolved on Friday although All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Praful Patel claimed the 61-year-old Briton continued to be Indias national coach.         
	Patel, who arrived more than an hour late for the AIFF executive committee meeting, later told newspersons that Houghtons resignation was nothing more than speculation in the media and expressed confidence that the coach would be in charge for Januarys Asian Cup in Doha.         
	I myself spoke to Houghton a few days back and reports that he has resigned are completely baseless. He has certain issues (with the AIFF) as expressed by his agent. But that does not mean he is no longer coach. He continues to be India coach and he will be there for the Asian Cup, Patel said.         
	The executive committee has authorised me to take appropriate steps (in the Houghton issue), he added.         
	Sources in the AIFF said Patel did not allow the topic to be discussed properly in the meeting and remained rather busy defending those officials who are believed to be responsible in the main for the poor treatment meted out to Houghton.         
	No discussion was held on Houghtons contract, his latest demand for salary increase or the tenure of his stay, said an executive committee member. Neither the president nor the senior office-bearers bothered to inform us whether it would be financially feasible to pay Houghton more money till 2013.         
	There is a feeling that the coach may be asked to lower his price and the AIFF is only trying to buy time, he added.         
	Disgusted by the attitude and functioning of a section of AIFF officials, Houghton put in his papers on April 30 with a three-month notice. Under Houghton, India won three back-to-back tournaments, including two Nehru Cups, and secured qualification for the prestigious Asia Cup.         
	On the Asian Cup players contract issue  for the eight-month period from June 2010 to January 2011  the AIFF chief said the footballers would be paid an extra 15 per cent on the basis of their present contract.         
	He said that exceptions could be made for certain individuals who might not have received satisfactory deals from their respective clubs in the ongoing season.         
	Some of the national team players, however, felt the deal could be unacceptable to many top footballers. There are players whose performance in the current season is so good that other clubs are offering even a 100 per cent increase in their salaries, said a national team midfielder.         
	Why should these players accept ridiculous offers from the AIFF? the player asked. We did not chalk out this plan, AIFF did. Let them arrange for the money needed to make the project successful, he said.

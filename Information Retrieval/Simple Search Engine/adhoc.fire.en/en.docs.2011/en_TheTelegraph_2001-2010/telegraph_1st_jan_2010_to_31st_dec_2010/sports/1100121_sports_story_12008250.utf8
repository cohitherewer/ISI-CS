                                                                                                                       7                                      Hari stuns top seed
                      
	Wijk Aan Zee: Grandmaster P. Harikrishna shocked top seed Arkaditsch Naiditsch of Germany in group B, while Viswanathan Anand settled for a draw with American Hikaru Nakamura in group A in the fourth round of the Corus meet here.         
	Anand took drew his fourth consecutive match before the first rest day, and the Indian ace will now have to start winning a few games as Alexei Shirov is simply running away from this field.         
	The Latvian-born Spaniard recorded his fourth victory at the expense of Dutchman Jan Smeets, and is now a full point ahead of nearest rivals Nakamura, Magnus Carlsen of Norway and Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine.         
	Ahead of the first rest day, Anand stands joint fifth in the company of defending champion Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine, Leinier Dominguez of Cuba and Vladimir Kramnik of Russia.         
	Harikrishna caused a big flutter, defeating Naiditsch with awesome ease. Playing the Kings Indian attack with white pieces, Harikrishna did everything right. Routine manoeuvres in one of the popular variations led to a passive position for Naiditsch on the King side, and the Indian crashed through with a timely piece sacrifice.

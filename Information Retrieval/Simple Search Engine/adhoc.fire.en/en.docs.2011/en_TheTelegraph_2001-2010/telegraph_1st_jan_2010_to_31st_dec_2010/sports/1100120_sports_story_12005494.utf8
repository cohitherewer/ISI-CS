            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Lajong FC would aim to shake off their 5-0 drubbing to Mahindra United last week and recapture their Federation Cup form when they take on Mumbai FC in an eleventh I-League football encounter here on Wednesday.         
	The boys have had a good rest and are ready, Lajong coach Stanley Rosario said on the eve of the match. The hosts would be without the services of Evans Quao and Noel Wilson, both due to suspension.

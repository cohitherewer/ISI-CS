            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal turned out to be lucky losers as they entered the knock-out stage of the national one-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy despite losing to Orissa by six wickets at the Barabati Stadium, in Cuttack, on Thursday. Orissa finished the zonal proceedings with an all-win record, logging 16 points.         
	Although Bengal and Tripura both got nine points, Bengal went through by virtue of a better net run-rate. Bengals net run-rate was 0.489 while Tripuras was 0.185.         
	It was Manoj Tiwary who led the side on the day as regular skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla had to rush back to Calcutta due to a personal tragedy. Shuklas mother passed away in the wee hours of Thursday, and he took the first flight back home.         
	Tiwary opted to bat and Bengal lost their in-form batsman Sreevats Goswami (15) early. He was dismissed by veteran Debashish Mohanty. Sourav Ganguly, who came in at No. 3, played 17 deliveries and hit a quick-fire 23 with the help of four boundaries.         
	Sourav was run out by a direct throw from Nataraj Behera. But it was young Sudeep Chatterjee, replacing Shukla, and Manoj, who added valuable 111 runs for the third wicket. Manoj was in good form and he top-scored with 86 off only 78 deliveries with 10 hits to the fence. Bengal finished on 283 for seven.         
	In reply, Orissa reached the target in 48.2 overs. Opener Paresh Patel (123 .., 10x4, 3x6) paved the way for the win.         
	Meanwhile, the Bengal team for the knock-out stages of the Vijay Hazare Trophy will be selected Friday.

	London: Didier Drogba came off Chelseas bench to earn his team a 1-1 Premier League draw at Tottenham, on Sunday.         
	Chelsea trailed to Roman Pavlyuchenkos 15th-minute opener before Drogba entered the game at halftime. The Ivory Coast striker latched onto a bouncing ball in the area and smashed a shot at goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, who fumbled it over the line.         
	Gomes then saved an injury-time penalty by Drogba to stretch Chelseas run without a win to five league matches. Chelsea still moved level on points with third-place Manchester United, but United can leapfrog Manchester City and provisional leaders Arsenal if they beat the Gunners, on Monday.         
	Earlier, Stuart Holden scored with two minutes left to help Bolton overcome their fourth red card of the season and beat Blackburn 2-1.         
	Blackburns Mame Biram Diouf had just equalised but Holden burst forward following the resulting kickoff to run onto a flick by Kevin Davies and half-volley past goalkeeper Paul Robinson from just outside the area.         
	The American midfielders second goal of the season lifted Bolton to 26 points, just six behind Arsenal.         
	Bolton took the lead shortly after going down to 10 men, bringing on Fabrice Muamba as a 58th-minute substitute moments after midfielder Mark Davies was sent off for a second yellow card.         
	Muamba, an England under-21 midfielder, had been on the field for just seven minutes when he cut inside defender Ryan Nelsen to score with a low shot to the near post.         
	But Diouf, the Senegal striker on loan at Blackburn from Manchester United, made Blackburns pressure and numerical advantage count in the 87th. Diouf collected a pass from Jason Roberts, held off a defender and lifted the ball over diving goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen.         
	But Holden made sure the lead lasted for only seconds. In another match, Stephen Hunt scored to give Wolverhampton Wanderers a 1-0 win over Birmingham that boosts their attempt to avoid relegation.         
	Hunt scored his second goal of the season and Wolves stopped the opposition from scoring for the first time this season to go to 15 points, three clear of last-place West Ham and just one point away from climbing out of the three-team relegation zone.

	Calcutta: Defending champions India crumbled under pressure as arch-rivals Pakistan sent them packing with a two-wicket triumph in a thrilling rain-hit Super League quarter-final of the ICC Under-19 cricket World Cup at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln on Saturday.         
	Pakistan opted to bowl first in the match, which became a 23-overs-a-side affair due to overnight rain, and skittled out India for a paltry 114 for nine.         
	In reply, Pakistan struggled before reaching the target in 22.3 overs courtesy valuable late order contributions.         
	Pakistan thus kept their unbeaten run at the event intact. The Pakistani top-order collapsed and the team score read 16 for three in just under seven overs.         
	However, Ahsan Ali brought them back into the match with a 45-ball 30 before being run out by Jaydev Unadkat.         
	Azam hit Sandeep Sharma for a massive six in the 20th over to reduce the runs-required and balls-available margin. Needing 12 off 16 balls, Azam ensured a Pakistani victory with a couple of fours and some swift running between the wickets even as wickets fell around him.

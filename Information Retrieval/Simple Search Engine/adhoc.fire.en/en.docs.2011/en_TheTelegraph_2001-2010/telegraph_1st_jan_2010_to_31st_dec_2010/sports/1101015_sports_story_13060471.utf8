The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For now, Incredible India 
                                                                                                                       7                                      For now, Incredible India 
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	New Delhi: This is one turnaround even the best scriptwriters would have found difficult to put together.         
	India has redeemed itself in the eyes of the world, after turning the brickbats at the start of the Commonwealth Games into bouquets, by the time the closing ceremony came to a raucous end at the Jawaharlal Nehru stadium here.         
	India had become the favourite punching bag of the world, but by the end of the Games, India was shining after having secured not just its best ever show, but also upstaging England to the race, to finish second, with 101 medals that included 38 gold, 27 silver and 36 bronze medals. The hosts remained only behind the runaway champions Australia.         
	All this happened over a period of 12 days where Indian athletes  shooters, wrestlers, boxers and shuttlers in particular  lived up to the initial promise. In short, Indian sport had well and truly found its moment under Delhis blazing afternoon sun.         
	It has not been an easy path, and India has reached this milestone by a slow and steady rise over the years. The country grabbed 10 medals in 1966, 16 in 1982, 25 in 1998, 69 in 2002 and 49 in the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.         
	If shooters, wrestlers and boxers were expected to rise to the occasion, what the athletes did at the Nehru Stadium was simply remarkable. Only a few days before the start, Milkha Singh predicted a doom for India in the track and field events, but the nations generation next athletes proved the Flying Sikh wrong.         
	Krishna Poonia, a name familiar perhaps only to die hard sports lovers, sent India ecstatic with her gold winning discus throw. Harwant Kaur and Seema Antil followed her with a silver and bronze, for a stunning 1-2-3 finish for the first time by Indian women in the Games.         
	The next day, Manjeet Kaur, Siny Jose, Ashwini Akkunji and Mandeep Kaur ran the race of their lives to lift the gold in the 4x400metre womens relay.         
	But the power of Indian women was truly displayed on the wrestling mat, at the Indira Gandhi Stadium. The unassuming Haryana girls  Geeta, Alka Tomar and Anita  dished out gritty displays to bag three gold medals in the Greco-Roman section against grapplers from Canada, England and other western nation.         
	So much so, the organisers of the next Games at Glasgow are now seriously planning to drop Greco-Roman wresting in both mens and womens section, to put a halt to Indias medal winning spree. Two other events  tennis and archery  where India again did a commendable job, would be missing in Glasgow.         
	Amidst the euphoria, there were some disappointments at the shooting range, as India could not match their tally of 16 gold medals in the Melbourne Games. Yet, the performance of Gagan Narang, an MBA degree holder from Hyderabad, would be etched in the memory for long, especially in the 10m air rifle event where he pipped compatriot and Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra for the gold medal.         
	Bindra paid rich compliments to his junior saying Narang would be the next Olympic champion. With four gold medals in his kitty from the Games, Narang looked good enough to fulfil the promise.         
	The last two days of the Games was a thrilling affair. With India and England in close race for the second spot behind Australia, the boxers and shutters clinched the issue in favour of the hosts.         
	The excitement reached a feverish pitch at the Talkatora Stadium on the penultimate day, when three Indian boxers  Suranjoy Singh, Manoj Kumar and Paramjeet Samota  punched their way to earn the gold.         
	If only Vijender Singh had managed the much expected gold. His controversial loss and the following blame game left a bad taste in the mouth.         
	Then Indian women took over the last day of the meet  badminton star Saina Nehwal getting the gold in singles and Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa in womens doubles.         
	The last couple of days also brought some disappointments for the hosts  world champions Australia routed the hockey team and 20km walker Rani Yadav failed the dope test despite erasing her personal best time by at least four minutes.         
	While the defeat against Australia, not the margin, was more or less expected, the dope scandal was a serious blow to Indias claim to field a dope-free contingent for the Games.

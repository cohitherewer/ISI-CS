The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United held by City
                                                                                                                       7                                      United held by City
                      
	London: Manchester United drew 0-0 at Manchester City on Wednesday to let Chelsea stretch their lead at the top of the Premier League with a 1-0 win over visiting Fulham. The Manchester rivals created a few chances in a high-paced encounter at City of Manchester Stadium and Uniteds fifth draw from six away games this season left them four points behind the defending champion.         
	Michael Essien scored and was sent off for Chelsea as the Blues stretched their unbeaten streak against their west London neighbours to 10 matches.         
	Marouane Chamakh scored both goals as Arsenal stayed in third place with a 2-0 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers, while City stayed fourth.         
	Newcastle stayed in fifth place despite a 2-1 home defeat to Blackburn, followed by six teams tied on 16 points. Chelsea lead with 28 after recovering from Sundays surprise 2-0 loss at Liverpool, albeit without dominating their less heralded opponents.         
	Didier Drogba had already had a free kick saved by Mark Schwarzer when Essien, back in the team after missing two matches because of a toe injury, headed Salomon Kalous 30th-minute cross down and into the net for his fourth goal of the season.         
	But Essien now faces an absence through suspension after he was shown a red card in the final minute for a two-footed lunge on Fulham forward Clint Dempsey. Chelsea could have won by more.         
	Florent Malouda drew a save from Schwarzer five minutes before halftime and Kalou shot just wide of the far post seconds later.         
	Manchester City struggled to break down a defence marshalled by Man-of-the-Match Nemanja Vidic, while United had little cutting edge with Wayne Rooney injured and Javier Hernandez only a 78th-minute substitute.         
	City are very difficult to beat on their own ground, United manager Alex Ferguson said. I think there was too much tension for it to be the kind of match people thought it would be.         
	Carlos Tevez came closest to putting City ahead against his former club with a curling free kick that Edwin van der Sar dived full stretch to push past his left post, while Dimitar Berbatovs acrobatic second-half volley at keeper Joe Hart was Uniteds best chance.

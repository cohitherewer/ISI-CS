The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Total unity is Oranje style
                                                                                                                       7                                      Total unity is Oranje style
    - Change is here, so are the Dutch           John Ley                            
	The Dutch have been there, twice before, but, notwithstanding the much-vaunted teams of the 70s and the 80s, have never done that. This time around, however, things have been different. When they set sail for Africa, it was only coach Bert van Marwijk who believed his boys could finally win the elusive title. For that, the coach said, the team would have to do things differently. For starters, Van Marwijk said, the Arjen Robbens could try being a little less arrogant and a little more unified. The Van Marwijk blueprint, so far, seems as successful as the past Dutch models with its biggest test on Sunday. Heres looking at how the Dutch teams of the past compare with the 2010 finalists:         
	1974 and 1978 World Cups               
	The team         
	In the 1970s, Dutch football reached the peak of its success, with the team dubbed Clockwork Oranje for its mastery of Total Football.         
	Holland reached successive finals and, in both cases, lost to host nations.         
	In 1974, they were beaten 2-1 by West Germany despite taking an early lead. Four years later, in Argentina, Holland beat the Germans in the semi-final.         
	And had Rob Rensebrinks last minute effort not hit the woodwork, the Dutch would have won the World Cup instead of losing to Argentina in extra-time.         
	Strengths         
	Total Football or Totaalvoetbal, was the name given to the tactical theory invented by Rinus Michels, the 1974 coach, who encouraged every player to take over the role of any teammate, and led by the inspirational Johan Cruyff. At times, the inter-play, overlapping runs, passing and finishing left a world spell-bound; it was, as some suggested at the time, as good as it gets.         
	Weaknesses         
	In 1974, the Dutch were not as convincing in defence. They were missing the commanding Barry Hulshoff and his absence turned the back line into an alarmingly unconvincing outfit.         
	And, in 1978, they were without Cruyff, the inspiration four years earlier. He stood by his guns by refusing the urges of the nation to feature, while Willem van Hanegem and Jan van Beveren were also absent.         
	Egos         
	Holland actually struggled to qualify for the 1974 and their squad appeared uncomfortable and mercenary. There was also a clash between the players of key club rivals from Hollands leading teams Feyenoord, of Rotterdam, and Amsterdams Ajax. Only when Michels warned unhappy players that constant complaints about money would see them left at home did several high-profile stars relent.         
	1988 European Championship         
	The team         
	So far, Hollands only ever success came in 1988 when they beat the Soviet Union in the European Championship final, hosted by West Germany.         
	Unsurprisingly, Holland turned to Michels to resurrect the Dutch side and, after a shaky start, Holland beat England 3-1 thanks to a hattrick by Marco van Basten, before winning 1-0 against the Republic of Ireland.         
	Strengths         
	There is little doubt Holland were the most accomplished team at the Euro 88 finals. In the AC Milan group of Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Van Basten, Holland had a trio of hugely talented players.         
	This was not Total Football but the 80s version could control the ball well and pass at distance. And in Van Basten they had the player of the tournament.         
	Weaknesses         
	Holland showed an ability to panic, highlighted by the semi-final against host nation West Germany, when they succumbed to intimidating tactics. They were also regarded as the luckiest but few took away the fact that they deserved to win the title. Yet, in the game against England, the Dutch survived two efforts against the woodwork, not to mention some controversial referring decisions.         
	Egos         
	The semi-final against West Germany, in which Van Basten scored an 89th minute winner, is also remembered for its post-match shenanigans. Those included an incident in which Ronald Koeman, who, in front of the German supporters, provocatively pretended to wipe his backside with the shirt of Olaf Thon, an action Koeman later regretted.         
	2010 World Cup         
	The team         
	In terms of high-profile stars, the 21st century version does not come close to the Total Football team. And in Bert van Marwijk, the coach, they have an understated and less celebrated leader than the likes of Rinus Michels (1974 and 1988) and Ernst Happel (1978). Van Marwijk has taken advice from Johan Cruyff and Ruud Gullit among others, while Rudi Krol has been a constant presence at training sessions. Rather than Total Football, this team plays with Total Togetherness.         
	Strengths         
	Holland have won every game so far; if they win the final they will become only the fifth nation to achieve that. And that is no fluke. Dirk Kuyt claimed earlier this week that while Spain have the better individual players the Dutch have the better team. And that is, perhaps, something that could not be said in the 70s and 80s. Attack-wise, though, few countries can post a trio as talented as Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie, with all three reaching their peak at the tournament.         
	Weaknesses         
	Van Marwijk has said his team must be less haphazard in front of goal to counter Spain during Sundays final. But defensively the Dutch are something of a mixed bag. And they could be caught out by the pace of David Villa, with their ageing back line sometimes exposed to counter-attack.         
	Egos         
	Back in 2008, Van Persie and Sneijder were involved in a war of words, stemming from a dispute over a free-kick that came in the Euro 2008 quarter final against Russia. So, when Van Persie complained about being substituted against Slovakia, claiming Sneijder should have been the man to be tugged, Van Marwijk probably felt a sense of deja vu. The manager acted quickly, pulling both to one side to deliver a warning then addressed the team as well to nip the potential falling out in the bud. Some Dutchmen never learn.

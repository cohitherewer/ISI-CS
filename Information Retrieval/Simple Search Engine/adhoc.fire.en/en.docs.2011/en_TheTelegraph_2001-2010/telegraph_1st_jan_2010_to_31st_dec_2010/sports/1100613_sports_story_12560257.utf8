            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former Angola and the Maldives national team coach Manuel Jose Gomes will be in charge of the East Bengal team in the upcoming season.         
	Manuel will replace Philippe de Ridder after the Belgian could bring about no change in the clubs fortunes in the last I-League.         
	Manuels deal was finalised after it was discovered that the Portuguese was a European Pro-License holder, which is equivalent to the AFC A license.         
	Manuel last coached the Angolan national team. He has also done exceptionally well with the Maldives national team. His appointment is an unanimous decision, assistant secretary Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta said on Saturday. Manuel will be arriving in the city next week to sign on the dotted line.

	Calcutta: Less-fancied Palme Dor decided to put his best foot forward in the 1,400m Royal Mantle Cup, on Thursday. The Shafiq Khan-trained horse was not stand alone outsider to score in the six-event card which also witnessed other long-shots in total control. As a result of this, the popular jackpot pool found no takers after the third leg and the entire collection of close to Rs 2.5 lakh was carried over. Apprentice Babu Singh, who partnered Palme Dor to a start-to-finish win had, earlier in the afternoon, guided Khans another less fancied runner Mandira to well-judged victory over the course-favourite, Credit Ease, in the baby race, the 1,200m Amalita Plate.RESULTS

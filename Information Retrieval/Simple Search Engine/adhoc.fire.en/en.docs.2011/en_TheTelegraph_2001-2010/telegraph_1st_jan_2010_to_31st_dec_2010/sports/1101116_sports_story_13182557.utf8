	Dubai: A record third-wicket partnership of 242 runs from South Africas Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis left Pakistan with a mountain to climb on day four of the first Test on Monday.         
	Amlas 118 not out and Kalliss unbeaten 135 helped South Africa declare its second innings on 318-2 at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. Their partnership was South Africas highest for a third wicket against Pakistan, surpassing 207 in Lahore in 2007 between Kallis and Graeme Smith.         
	At stumps, Pakistan reached 109-2 in its second innings and needed another 342 runs to win.         
	The most Pakistan has managed in the fourth innings of a Test match is 341-9 against West Indies in 1988, while its highest successful run chase was 315-9 against Australia in 1994.

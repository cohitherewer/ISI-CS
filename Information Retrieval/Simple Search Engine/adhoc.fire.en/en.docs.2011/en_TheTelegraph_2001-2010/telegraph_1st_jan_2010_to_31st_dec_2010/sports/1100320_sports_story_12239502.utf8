                                                                                                                       7                                      Eden to be dearer for India Cup ties
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) in all likelihood will have higher priced tickets for the ICC World Cup match between India and England at Eden Gardens on February 27, next year. However the ticket prices will be lower for the other three matches which doesnt feature the home team.         
	The other matches at the Eden are South Africa vs Ireland (March 15), Ireland vs Netherlands (March 18) and Kenya vs Zimbabwe (March 20).         
	The CAB working committee will be meeting on Monday to decide on the ticket prices. It has been learnt that for the India match, the lowest ticket price will be Rs 1,000.         
	The ticket prices will range from Rs 1000 to 1500 for the India match. Obviously, for the three non-India matches, the denominations will be lower as interest level will be less, a senior official said.         
	He also added that around 10,000-12,000 tickets will be available for public sale (for the India match) after CAB distributes the complimentary tickets to its members (honorary, associate, life and annual) as well as affiliated units.         
	The capacity of the stadium will be around 73,000. The capacity of the B, C, K and L blocks which are being renovated will have 26,000 seats compared to the earlier capacity of 38,000, he added.

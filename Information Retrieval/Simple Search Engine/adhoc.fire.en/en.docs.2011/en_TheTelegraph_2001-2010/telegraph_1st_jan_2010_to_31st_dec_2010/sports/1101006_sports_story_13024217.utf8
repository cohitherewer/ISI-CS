The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Win clinched on Sunday: Colin
                                                                                                                       7                                      Win clinched on Sunday: Colin
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Colin Montgomerie shared the credit for Europes Ryder Cup win with his players and vice-captains and admitted the result was clinched in Sundays session.         
	Graeme McDowells 3 amp;1 win over Hunter Mahan, on a historic extra day, ultimately proved decisive but it was the contests third session  in which Europe took 5 1/2 points from six across two foursomes and four four balls  which set up an eventual 14 1/2-13 1/2 win at Celtic Manor.         
	Montgomerie said: We won this Ryder Cup on Sunday night by having that fantastic session of five-and-a-half to a half. Thats where we won the Ryder Cup, it wasnt actually Monday.         
	But we needed to maintain that momentum, we knew the Americans would come out strong and they did. Lee Westwood was put out first, hes our strongest player, and he lost (2 amp;1 to Steve Stricker) and you thought hang on a minute, this might not go the way we were hoping for. There were some great results. Miguel Angel Jimenez, at 46, to come through that way (4 amp;3 against Bubba Watson), Luke Donalds victory (over Jim Furyk) down the last hole  and of course G-Mac (McDowell).         
	To hold him as 12th man was a good decision by us all. He is the Wales Open champion on this course, hes the current US Open champion  he was put there for a reason because he can handle himself in that situation. That birdie on 16 will live in my memory, and live in all our memories, for a long time.         
	Montgomerie has famously never won any of the sports four major championships during his career but, asked if he would swap this success for such a title, he said: No, not at all, this was the culmination of many years. I wouldnt swap any of my career for anything.

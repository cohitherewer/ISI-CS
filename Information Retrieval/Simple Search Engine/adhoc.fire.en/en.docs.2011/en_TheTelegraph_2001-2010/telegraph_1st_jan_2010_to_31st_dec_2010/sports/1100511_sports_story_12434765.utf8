                                                                                                                       7                                      Rohit Sharma penalised 
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: Rohit Sharma has been docked 15 per cent of his match fee for showing dissent during Indias 14-run defeat to the West Indies in their World Twenty20 Super Eight Group F match on Sunday.         
	The middle-order batsman had stood his ground, indicating to umpire Billy Bowden that the ball had gone off his arm en route to wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin off Kieron Pollard during the match in Bridgetown.         
	Sharma was also seen gesturing to Bowden, asking him to refer it to the third umpire. Though Bowden was unsure of the legitimacy of the catch, he had consulted leg umpire Simon Taufel before ruling Sharma out.         
	Rohit Sharma has been fined 15 per cent of his applicable match fee for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during his sides 14-run defeat against the West Indies at Kensington Oval on Sunday, the ICC said in a statement.         
	Sharma was charged with a Level 1 offence under article 2.1.3 of the code which relates to showing dissent at an umpires decision during an international match.         
	The right-hander pleaded guilty to the charge and as such, under the provisions of the code, the matter was determined by Jeff Crowe of the Elite Panel of ICC match referee without the need for a full hearing. The match referee imposed a fine equivalent to 15 per cent of the players match fee.         
	Offences included in Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct can range from an official reprimand up to 50 per cent of his or her match fee.         
	Meanwhile, the West Indies have been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate during their 14-run victory over India on Sunday.         
	Jeff Crowe of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees imposed the fines after Chris Gayles side was ruled to be two overs short of its target at the end of the match when time allowances were taken into consideration.         
	In accordance with the ICC Code of Conduct regulations governing minor over-rate offences, players are fined 10 per cent of their match fees for every over their side failed to bowl in the allotted time, with the captain fined double that amount.         
	As such, Gayle was fined 40 per cent of his match fee while his players received 20 per cent fines. If Gayle, as captain, is guilty of two further similar over-rate offences in T20Is over the next 12 months, he will receive a one-match suspension as per the provisions of the Code.

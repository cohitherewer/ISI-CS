                                                                                                                       7                                      26 Pak players register
                      
	New Delhi: Former Indian Cricket League (ICL) recruits like Shane Bond and Damien Martyn, 26 Pakistan players and four players from the Associate countries are among the 97 who have registered themselves for the third Indian Premier League (IPL) auction to be held on January 19.         
	Apart from the injury-plagued Bond, who has quit Test cricket, and Martyn, who has retired from international cricket, other prominent ex-ICL players who have switched sides include Chris Cairns, Saqlain Mushtaq and Justin Kemp.         
	The Pakistanis who have registered for the auction include Twenty20 captain Shahid Afridi, dope-tainted pacer Mohammed Asif, exciting pace prospect Mohammed Aamer and the talented Umar Akmal.         
	The four registered players from the Associate countries are Rizwan Cheema and Khurram Chohan (Canada), Ryan ten Doeschate (the Netherlands) and Niall Brien (Ireland).         
	The list of South African players interestingly has Nicky Bojes name. The retired ex-ICL off-spinner was implicated in the 2000 match-fixing scandal and avoided touring India for a long time for fear of arrest before coming to play for the ICL.         
	The IPL will send the names to all the franchises, who will decide the shortlist for the final auction and the players would be informed about it by Tuesday.

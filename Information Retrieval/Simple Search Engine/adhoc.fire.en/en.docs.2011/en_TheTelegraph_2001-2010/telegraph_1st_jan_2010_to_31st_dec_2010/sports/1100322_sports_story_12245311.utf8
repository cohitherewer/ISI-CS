The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chasing not a problem: Whatmore
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chasing not a problem: Whatmore
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Kolkata Knight Riders coach Dav Whatmore, on Sunday, said chasing was not an issue for the Knights, despite the team failing to overhaul the target twice in as many games.         
	We have had contrasting chasing efforts. In the first match (against the Chennai Super Kings), we lost too many wickets and in the second (against the Rajasthan Royals), we kept wickets in hand but still couldnt finish the job, Whatmore observed, on the eve of the clash against the Mumbai Indians.         
	In this format of the game, you must be good in both (setting targets and chasing). If you win the toss, you set targets, but if you dont, you must be prepared to chase.         
	The coach did not believe the team made a blunder in setting their batting order against the Rajasthan Royals.All of us are good in hindsight. I think the batting order was okay.         
	We had some plans but our execution was not well done, he said.         
	Whatmore stopped short of confirming that Chris Gayle would play on Monday. He only said: He is the captain of the West Indies team  we welcome him with both arms.         
	The coach said his team had the bowling options to contain Sachin Tendulkar and Co. We have the flexibility to go for either a spin-based or medium pace-based attack. But of course that can be decided only after having a look at the pitch, he said.         
	Whatmores Mumbai counterpart Robin Singh said his team would not lose sleep over planning a strategy for Gayle or Shane Bond.         
	We have not really thought about it. It hardly matters. There are many big hitters in IPL, Singh .

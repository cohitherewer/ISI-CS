The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Simons is bowling consultant
                                                                                                                       7                                      Simons is bowling consultant
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), on Monday, appointed former South Africa coach Eric Simons Team Indias bowling consultant for the two Tests against Bangladesh, and the Test and ODI series against South Africa which follow Indias tour of Bangladesh.         
	Eric Simons has been appointed bowling consultant of the Indian cricket team for the Test series against Bangladesh, and the Test and ODI series against South Africa, a statement from BCCI secretary N Srinivasan said.         
	The Test series against Bangladesh starts on January 17, while the two Tests and three one-dayers against South Africa are scheduled next month.         
	Simons tenure as the South Africa coach was not a happy one. He was in charge of the team from September 2002 to October 2004 and lost his place because of a dip in the sides form.         
	Simons played 23 one-day Internationals for Proteas in the period between 1994 and 95. Even though he did not do well with bat, scoring 217 runs at an average of 15.50, he got 33 wickets at a decent average of 24 with his fast medium bowling.         
	India have been without a bowling coach ever since former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad was sacked.         
	BCCI sacked him and fielding coach Robin Singh after Indias poor show in the Champions Trophy.         
	Of late, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been very vocal about the need for a bowling coach.         
	Just before departing for Bangladesh, the India captain had said that the absence of a bowling coach was making coach Gary Kirstens job too difficult as he had to look after too many things.

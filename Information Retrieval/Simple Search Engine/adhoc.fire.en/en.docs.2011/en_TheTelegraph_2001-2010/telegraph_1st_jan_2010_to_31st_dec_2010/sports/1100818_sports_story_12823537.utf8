                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB ropes in Whatmore   for the juniors
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president, has kept his word.         
	At the annual general meeting last month, Dalmiya, after being re-elected unopposed for a fresh term, had said that the development of Bengal cricket would be among the associations top priorities.         
	On Tuesday, after the seasons first working committee meeting, when Dalmiya announced that the vastly experienced Dav Whatmore has been appointed director for the development of junior cricket in Bengal, one had to admit that it was a masterstroke from the veteran of many battles.         
	The Australian signed a six-month contract with the CAB on Tuesday and will take over on September 1.         
	Whatmore has been assigned three specific tasks: a) he will be in charge of CABs proposed academy at the Kalyani University campus, masterminding the overall set-up and its programmes, b) he will look after the U-14, U-16 and U-19 state teams, and c) he will train the local coaches at various levels.         
	But wouldnt Whatmore, who is also the coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), have too much on his plate? Dalmiya, speaking at a media conference, said: We have checked and KKR have no major assignments in the next six months and so I dont think that will be a problem.         
	Although the appointment is initially for this season, we will see how it goes and might then extend the contract for the 2011-12 season as well.         
	Dalmiya also informed that although the World Cup-winning coach would be in-charge of the junior teams, the CAB will appoint some assistant coaches to help him. There will an assistant coach for each level. However, we are yet to finalise their names, he said.         
	Asked what made the CAB zero in on Whatmore, Dalmiya said: Dav has got all the experience behind him. Apart from being a former coach of Sri Lanka, he has also been associated with the National Cricket Academy. He is, therefore, the right person to take our endeavour forward.         
	Lets hope that this fresh partnership yields results.

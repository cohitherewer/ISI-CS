	Groningen: Former world junior champion and second seed Grandmaster Abhijeet Gupta beat Daniel Naroditsky of United States in quick time to jump to the joint third spot after the fourth round of Groningen International open chess tournament, here.         
	After back-to-back draws, Abhijeet needed to stay in hunt for top honours and he did that in style with black pieces to outwit young talent Naroditsky. IM Sahaj Grover was held to a draw by Heemskerk of Holland while Shiven Khosla remained on course for his final IM norm after disposing the challenge of Axel Partenheimer of Germany.         
	The other Indian in the fray, GM norm holder Ashwin Jayaram staked his claim for a comeback by outsmarting Koen Lambrechts of Holland.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Panel gets down to business
                                                                                                                       7                                      Panel gets down to business

	Calcutta: The three-member disciplinary committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), reconstituted in Mumbai on Saturday afternoon, had its first meeting within hours.         
	Messrs Arun Jaitley, Chirayu Amin and Jyotiraditya Scindia have less than four months to probe the grave charges against Lalit Kumar Modi, who was suspended by the BCCI in the early hours of April 26.         
	The two politicians on the committee, Jaitley, the leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha, and Union minister Scindia, have a demanding schedule and, so, no time is being wasted.         
	We met last evening... Had our first meeting, one of the members told The Telegraph on Sunday morning.         
	He added: Obviously, its much too early to say anything about Modis fate... The process has started and will now be taken forward.         
	The committee had to be reconstituted as the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, recused himself. A smart move, really, as Modi couldnt continue crying about a bias.         
	Taking that forward, the BCCI has also decided that secretary Narayanswamy Srinivasan wont be convening the committees meetings. Jaitley and Co. have been empowered to meet at their convenience.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Liuzzi shoots down rumours 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Liuzzi shoots down rumours 
                      
	New Delhi: Force India driver Vitantonio Liuzzi on Thursday laughed off speculations that he runs the risk of losing his job to reserve driver Paul di Resta, saying there is a mutual respect between him and the team management.         
	 ...there has been speculation that Force Indias reserve driver Paul di Resta is in competition for my seat. I am not worried about these rumours; speculation is always at the door and all over the papers, Liuzzi, who finished ninth in Sundays Monaco Grand Prix, wrote in his column.         
	The Italian, who has scored points in three of the six races this season, said he held a two-year contract and enjoyed a perfect relation with the management of the Vijay Mallya-owned team.         
	I have a contract for two years with Force India and they believe in me and I believe in them, so our relationship is very good.         
	They know exactly the problems I was having in China and Spain and they know that it was not due to anything else. Also I scored points at the first two races and again in Monaco, so they can see that Im very much fighting for the team to meet its targets, said the Italian.         
	Red Bull, meanwhile, will switch Sebastian Vettels chassis after finding a defect in the car he used in Monaco last weekend, team boss Christian Horner said on Thursday.         
	Horner said that the change was being made as a precautionary measure. (AGENCIES)

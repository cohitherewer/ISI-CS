            STAR RACER                                
	Calcutta: Trainers Vijay Singhs prized youngster Hall Of Glory and Harvinder S. Baths ward Secret Fire are expected to win the two monsoon classics  the 1,400m Calcutta Colts Trial Stakes and the fillies version of it, respectively, on Saturday. In his upcountry starts, Hall Of Glory was not even a shade of his brilliant past which had helped him win three juvenile plum events, last winter. The horse returns to the racetrack he relishes most and the Placerville son may be counted upon to bounce back to his old form. C. Alford partners the likely hot-favourite.          
	Secret Fire, on the other hand, has retained her winter form. Her recent win, in a Class III company, speaks volume of her potential, in view of some top-rated youngsters having cut a sorry figure in the same category. The challenge to Secret Fire may come from trainer Pesi Shroffs filly Alice Springs, a runaway winner who has also performed fairly well in the west coast.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

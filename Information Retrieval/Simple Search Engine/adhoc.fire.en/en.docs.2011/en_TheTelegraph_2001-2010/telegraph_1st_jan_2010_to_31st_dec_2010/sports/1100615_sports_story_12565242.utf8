The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Itll be tough, says Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Itll be tough, says Dhoni
  - Good to have the senior players back in the side for Asia Cup, says Team India captain             Mahendra Singh Dhoni enjoys a bicycle ride, in Dambulla, on Monday. (Reuters)                           
	Dambulla: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni believes the rest given to the senior players has done a world of good to their game and they will play to their potentials in the Asia Cup starting here Tuesday.         
	Speaking at the launch of the Asia Cup trophy, Dhoni welcomed the return of the senior players and hoped they would keep intact, if not enhance, their reputation.         
	It is good to have all the senior players back. They have worked on their fitness. During the break they have also worked on their skills, which they couldnt have done during the season, Dhoni said.         
	I am confident that they will perform to their potential, added Dhoni.         
	India had fielded a second string unit under Suresh Rainas captaincy for the tri-series in Zimbabwe where the rookies finished last.         
	Dhoni, however, refused to be harsh on the youngsters who struggled in Zimbabwe, saying too much should not be read into their back-to-back defeats against Zimbabwe in the tri-series.         
	We lost to Zimbabwe but we beat Sri Lanka (in one match). You have to understand that we have had fitness issues with our bowlers and we do not have experienced fast bowlers. The series in Zimbabwe has given us options in playing young fast bowlers.         
	There is a huge difference between domestic and international cricket. Only by playing would our younger bowlers be able to bridge the gap. The series has given us an opportunity to play youngsters and prepare them for international cricket, said Dhoni.         
	He deemed India would be under pressure to win the Asia Cup.         
	When you are representing your country you are always under pressure to perform. This will be a tough assignment as it would not be easy to beat sides like Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The competition is bound to be tough, said Dhoni.         
	India, who are expecting six players to arrive from Zimbabwe, will play Bangladesh on Wednesday.         
	Meanwhile, Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara reckoned a victory would help Sri Lanka in preparing for the World Cup which is to be hosted in the sub-continent next year.         
	The Asia Cup is unique and prestigious. We could take confidence from a triumph here to build the team and in preparation for the ensuing World Cup, said Sangakkara, who for some queer reason turned up in casual attire for the official launch of the tournament.         
	Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi, on his part, emphasised that every tournament was important for Pakistan.         
	From now on every competition is important. We will keep our focus on this tournament to prepare for the World Cup. I can tell you that we havent brought youngsters here on a holiday, said Afridi.         
	The Pakistan captain hoped that comeback pacer Shoaib Akhtar would perform as well as he prepared for the tournament.         
	He has worked hard on his comeback. He wants to prove to everyone that he can perform as he did in the past. As a captain, I hope he does well. It will help Pakistan cricket, said Afridi.

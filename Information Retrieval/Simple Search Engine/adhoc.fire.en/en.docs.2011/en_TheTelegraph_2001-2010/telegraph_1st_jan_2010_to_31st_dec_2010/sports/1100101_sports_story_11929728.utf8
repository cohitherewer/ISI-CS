The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Knee is better, not perfect: Roddick
                                                                                                                       7                                      Knee is better, not perfect: Roddick
                      
	Brisbane: Andy Roddicks left knee isnt perfect but hes hoping for a successful start to the 2010 tennis season at the Brisbane International.         
	Roddick had his first practice session Thursday at Pat Rafter Arena in preparation for next weeks first tune-up tournament ahead of the Australian Open from January 18-31.         
	The 27-year-old American missed the ATP World Tour Finals at London in November because of the knee ailment.         
	He had one of his best years on tour this season, reaching the semi-finals at the Australian Open and losing to Roger Federer 16-14 in the fifth set of the Wimbledon final in a mammoth match.         
	He is the No 1 mens seed at the Brisbane International.         
	Roddicks left knee was unstrapped Thursday during a hour-long session with defending champion Radek Stepanek.         
	Its coming around all right, Roddick said.         
	It was disappointing to finish the year like I did, especially considering I felt like I was having a really good year until the injury came about.         
	That was disappointing but on the flipside Im probably a little bit more mentally rested than a lot of these guys, maybe a little bit more eager to get out here.         
	Ive been playing a lot. Im definitely not coming in under-practiced.         
	The 2003 US Open winner said his 2009 record, including a fourth Australian Open semi-final appearance, gave him extra belief he can claim a second career Grand Slam title  possibly in Melbourne in January.         
	Obviously I feel like maybe I could have played a final there before, he said.         
	It hasnt quite happened but theres not a lot of people walking around that can say ... that theyve played in four semi-finals.         
	Roddick said he still flashes back to the tough Wimbledon loss against Federer.         
	Its like anything thats hard in anyones life, Roddick said.         
	You just keep going and do the things you enjoy and slowly, maybe, Ill only think about it four times today.           (AGENCIES)

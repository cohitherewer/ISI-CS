The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chelseas lead in risk 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chelseas lead in risk 
                      
	London: While Chelsea play Birmingham on Saturday trying to recover from their worst home defeat since Roman Abramovich bought the club seven years ago, captain John Terry is on the sidelines worrying about more than whether his team will retain the Premier League title.         
	Terry will be absent for a second straight match at Birmingham and, with his central defensive partner Alex also out of action; Chelseas defence looks as vulnerable as it did in last weeks 3-0 loss to Sunderland. Chelsea now lead by just two points and could be overhauled by Arsenal if they lose, but Terry is concerned about the long-term implications of his latest injury.         
	The nerve injury that has caused him pain since the end of last season has finally forced him to seek treatment, but it is just the latest problem to affect the former England captain. Alex is out for as long as eight weeks with a knee injury.         
	Chelseas four-man defence against Sunderland featured three right-backs and such a pattern could continue against Birmingham, who are in the relegation zone but have lost just one of six home matches.         
	Lee Bowyer could return to Birminghams midfield if Craig Gardner fails to recover from the ankle injury he sustained in last weekends 0-0 draw against Manchester City.         
	Arsenal could overtake Chelsea if the leader loses and the Gunners beat local rival Tottenham. Andrei Arshavin and Tomas Rosicky are expected to be fit for Arsenal, while Robin van Persie could play after continuing his recovery from an ankle injury with a second-half appearance in the Netherlands 1-0 friendly win over Turkey on Wednesday.         
	Jack Wilshere could be involved if he has recovered from the back problem that ruled him out of Englands defeat to France.         
	Jack has a test, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. He has a little strain of a little muscle in the back and is not in full training at the moment.         
	Although Tottenham could have striker Jermain Defoe back after two months out with an ankle injury, Arsenal should be confident.           (AGENCIES)

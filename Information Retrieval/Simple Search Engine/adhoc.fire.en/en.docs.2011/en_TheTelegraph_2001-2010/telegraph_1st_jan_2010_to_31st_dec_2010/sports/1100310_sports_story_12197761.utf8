The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haddin hammers NZ for 2-1 lead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Haddin hammers NZ for 2-1 lead
                      
	Hamilton: Brad Haddins second one-day International century gave Australia a 2-1 lead and the most one-sided victory of the tour as they chased down their target with 16 balls to spare. Haddins 110 was his highest ODI score and he ended Daniel Vettoris hopes of winning, what he said before the match, was the most important game of the series, according to Cricinfo.         
	Ricky Ponting made 69 and combined with Haddin for a match-winning 151-run partnership that justified Pontings rare decision to send New Zealand in. It is a gamble he has taken 24 times in his ODI captaincy career for a remarkable 20 victories.         
	His bowlers did the job by dismissing New Zealand for a thoroughly gettable 245, and in the chase, Haddin set about determining the result early.

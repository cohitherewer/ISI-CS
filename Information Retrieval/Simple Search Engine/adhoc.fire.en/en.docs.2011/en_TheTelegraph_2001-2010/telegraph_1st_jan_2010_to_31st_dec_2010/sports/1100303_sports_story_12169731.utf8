The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bappa inclusion raises eyebrows
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bappa inclusion raises eyebrows
            A STAFF REPORTER            Laxmi Ratan Shukla                           
	Calcutta: In an inexplicable move Tuesday, the zonal selection committee named Tripuras Bappa Das as the replacement for the injured Varun Aaron in the East Zone squad for the Deodhar Trophy.         
	Bappa was included as a medium pacer but he has failed to take a single wicket in the four first-class and 10 one-day matches he has played so far.         
	The CAB had recommended Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shuklas name as a probable replacement but Orissa, Assam, Jharkhand and Tripura voted for Das whose credentials as a cricketer are clearly not that strong.         
	Shuklas name was proposed by the CAB but other selectors felt Bappa should be the choice. He was originally in the squad but had been later replaced after Ashok Dinda was inducted at the last moment, convenor of the zonal selection committee Bikash Baruah told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Raja Venkat, national selector and chairman of the East Zone selection committee, refused comment when contacted. It wont be fair on my part to say anything as I wasnt present at the meeting.         
	Never have the zonal selection meetings been marred by so many controversies. In the one that was held in Cuttack on February 27, questions were raised as to how Debasish Mohanty, who is nearing 34, was appointed captain when he wasnt even leading his state in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Orissa were led by Haladhar Das in the competition.         
	Meanwhile, Shukla, Manoj Tiwary and Wriddhiman Saha will be reporting for the Kolkata Knight Riders camp on Wednesday before leaving for Cuttack where they will have a two-day camp.         
	Thereafter they will be making for Vadodara where North Zone are their opponents in the first semi-final on Sunday.         
	At the KKR camp on Tuesday was a new face  England batsman Owais Shah. The KKR squad will be leaving for Mumbai on Monday where they will be wrapping up the last-minute preparations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal staring at an innings defeat 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal staring at an innings defeat 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Murali Kartik picked up two wickets                           
	New Delhi: An innings defeat looms large over Bengal after yet another batting capitulation against Railways at the Karnail Singh Stadium here on Friday.         
	Having conceded a 144-run first innings lead, Bengal were struggling at 105 for six in their second essay at the end of the third days play. With Arindam Das still nursing an elbow injury and unlikely to bat, Railways need to capture just three more wickets, on Saturday, to register a victory for a quarterfinal berth. Bengal will have to score another 40 runs to force the home side to bat again.         
	To Bengals misfortune, star batsman Sourav Ganguly flopped for the second time in the match and was out for seven. He got out in identical fashion sending an edge on to his stumps off medium pacer Anureet Singhs delivery.         
	Let us admit its a one-way match now, said Bengal coach W. V. Raman at the end of the days play. We have four wickets in hand and, on Saturday, we will try to delay the inevitable as much as possible.         
	Ganguly, who did not want to talk much on the tie, just quipped: Laxmi (Ratan Shukla) is still there  so lets hope for the best.         
	Bengal hardly looked a fighting lot. In the morning session, they allowed the Railways (overnight 250 for six) to add another 95 runs to their total with tail-ender Dhiren Salvi scoring an unbeaten 81.         
	Salvis 230-minute stay produced eight fours and one six. Bengal spinner Ires Saxena, who toiled hard for most part of the day, finished with figures of five for 78 in 37.2 overs.         
	Bengal batsmen failed to apply themselves and the visitors kept losing wickets at regular interval. Except Shukla (31 batting) and Dibyendu Chakrabarty (21), none of the Bengal batsmen could stay at the crease for long.         
	Contrary to the belief that the wicket would behave unpredictably, the strip showed no demons for the batsmen. There was no terror in the wicket we could have batted better, Raman said.         
	Of course, luck did not favour Bengal too. At least two batsmen  skipper Manoj Tiwary (17) and Dibyendu Chakrabarty  got out to dubious decisions. While Tiwary was trapped leg before, Chakrabarty was given caught by Sanjay Bangar. Both batsmen fell to Murali Kartik.         
	Bengals slump started when Jaiprakash Yadav removed Geetimoy Basu (19) and Anustup Majumdar (3) in quick succession. Once the openers departed, the hosts attacked with more vigour to push the visitors to the brink of defeat.

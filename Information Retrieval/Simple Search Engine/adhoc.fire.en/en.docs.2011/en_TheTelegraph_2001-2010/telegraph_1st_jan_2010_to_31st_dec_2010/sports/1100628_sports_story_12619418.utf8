	Cromwell: Arjun Atwal rose five rungs to tied 55th after carding a steady one-under 69 in the penultimate round of the Travelers Championship. At the top, Justin Rose led the pack with two-under 68 that left his three-round total at 16-under 194. American Ben Curtis (64) was a distant second on the leaderboard with a total of 13-under 197.         
	The day did not begin particularly well for Atwal as he stumbled to a first-hole bogey. But he immediately made amends with birdies on the third and sixth hole.         
	It remained one-under for the day as Atwal found one birdie against a bogey in the back-nine. The Orlando-based golfers overall total stands at three-under 207. (PTI)

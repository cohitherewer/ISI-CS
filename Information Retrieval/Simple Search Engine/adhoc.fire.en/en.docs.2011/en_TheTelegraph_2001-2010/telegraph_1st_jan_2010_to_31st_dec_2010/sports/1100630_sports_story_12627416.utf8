The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dunga: Brazil still need to improve
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dunga: Brazil still need to improve
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: There was not a soul at the jam-packed Ellis Park on Monday who could help but be amazed by Brazil as they danced their way into the quarter finals of the World Cup.         
	However, there was one exception. Dunga, the Brazil coach, who had a perfect reason to smile after the emphatic 3-0 win over Chile, said he was still not satisfied with his team while reminding them that they must strive to do better.         
	We passed the ball well, were able to maintain balance and made use of the chances we got, said Dunga after the match.         
	We have already seen that in this World Cup, we have to play an open game, go forward, as that is what everybody wants to see. The marking and running was impressive and we played quickly, but we still need to improve every element of our game, said the coach.         
	Not many agreed with Dunga, not even Tostao, the great striker and a member of the 1970 World Cup-winning Brazil team. Wearing a beret and a long coat, the scorer of 32 international goals for Brazil was sitting at the media tribune, telling doubters that he was impressed by his teams display.         
	Compared to our days, football has been globalised, he pointed out. And it has brought down the difference between teams. In this Brazil team, the most outstanding players are in defence  Julio Cesar, Lucio, Juan, Maicon etc.         
	This Brazil team is good and have the ability to lift the Cup, said Tostao. Normally we have great preference for players who attack. But we must note that things have changed. Our team have really played well (against Chile).         
	Tostao wasnt far from the truth. The five-time world champions, who have now booked themselves a mouth-watering clash with the mighty Netherlands in Port Elizabeth, might not be as entertaining as the Brazilian teams of the past, but the new generation is seriously looking unbeatable.         
	Yet, amidst the euphoria, there was one thing that was bothering the Brazil camp. After returning to the starting line up following a one-match suspension, Kaka once again picked up a yellow card. Dunga said he was unhappy with the development and would talk to the 2007 World Player of the Year.         
	Kaka, however, remained nonchalant. It was a normal foul and the first foul I committed in the match, he said. I dont know why the referees are taking an interest in me. I was worried because another card would have put me out of the next game.         
	Teams         
	Brazil: Julio Cesar, Maicon, Lucio, Juan, Michel Bastos, Gilberto Silva, Ramires, Daniel Alves, Kaka (Kleberson, 81), Robinho (Gilberto, 85), Luis Fabiano (Nilmar, 76).         
	Chile: Claudio Bravo, Ismael Fuentes, Mauricio Isla (Rodrigo Millar, 62), Alexis Sanchez, Pablo Contreras (Rodrigo Tello, 46), Carlos Carmona, Arturo Vidal, Mark Gonzalez (Jorge Valdivia, 46), Jean Beausejour, Gonzalo Jara, Humberto Suazo         
	Referee: Howard Webb (England)

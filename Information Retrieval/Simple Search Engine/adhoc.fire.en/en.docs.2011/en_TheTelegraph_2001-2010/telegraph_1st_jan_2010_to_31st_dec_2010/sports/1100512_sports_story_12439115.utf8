	Madrid: World No.1 Roger Federer began the defence of his Madrid Masters crown with a 6-2, 7-6 dismissal of Benjamin Becker in the second round on Tuesday.         
	Becker mounted a mini fightback to save two match points at 6-5 down in the second set and one more in the tiebreak but sent a backhand wide on the next point to hand Federer victory.         
	The 28-year-old has made the final in three of the past four years, also winning in 2006, but has not claimed a title since lifting his 16th Grand Slam at the Australian Open in January.         
	In the womens section, unseeded Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine thrashed world No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki 6-2, 6-3 in the second round.         
	The other seeds to fall were No. 9 Agnieszka Radwanska, No. 12 Marion Bartoli and No. 14 Flavia Pennetta. Polish Radwanska lost to Patty Schnyder 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, Bartoli was ousted 2-6, 0-6 by Anabel Medina Garrigues while Germanys Andrea Petkovic got the better of Pennetta 7-6, 6-3.

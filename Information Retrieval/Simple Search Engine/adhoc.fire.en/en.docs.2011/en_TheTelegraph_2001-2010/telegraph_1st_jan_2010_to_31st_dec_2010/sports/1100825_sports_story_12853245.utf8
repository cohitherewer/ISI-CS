	Paris: Indian mixed doubles team of V Diju and Jwala Gutta eased into the third round, beating Malaysias Peng Soon Chan and Liu Ying Goh, at the World Badminton Championships, on Tuesday.         
	After their hard fought three-game win over Englands Chris Adcock and Gabriella White on the opening day, the Indian pair outclassed the Malaysian pair 21-19, 21-8 in 24 minutes.         
	The ninth seeded Indians now play Singapores Chayut Triyachart and Lei Yao who beat the third seeds Robert Mateusiak and Nadiezda Zieba in another match.         
	Even though the scoreline did seem as if the Indians enjoyed court supremacy, Diju felt it was a hard fought win.         
	We were leading in the first game but they turned the momentum and opened a three point lead before we kind of steadied ourselves, said a relieved Diju.         
	I think we were consistent today. Even though the Malaysians played well in the first game, we were sure of ourselves, Jwala added.         
	Meanwhile, top Indian shuttler Chetan Anand crashed out, with a disappointing straight-game defeat against a lowly-ranked opponent in the mens singles first round.         
	Chetan, seeded 14th  the highest ranked Indian in the mens singles lost 14-21, 18-21 to Singapores Ong Zhao Ashton Chen. Chen is ranked 107th in the world.         
	He recovered from a knee injury recently, but failed to find any rhythm and lost the tie without putting up any sort of resistance in 37 minutes.         
	The disappointment was all evident when after the tie, Chetan said, It is a big blow as I had trained keeping the World Championships in focus. But today, nothing seemed to work and I just failed to come to grips with my game and also played into my opponents hands.         
	With Chetans early exit from the tournament, Indian challenge in mens singles ended as Parupalli Kashyap had also crashed out in the first round last night.         
	Unlike Chetan, Kashyap had the luxury to win the first game but he squandered it to lose 21-14, 14-21, 16-21 to Thailands Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk in a 56-minute first round match.         
	After winning the first game 21-14, Kashyap seemed well on course of advancing to the second round. But Saensomboonsuk had other plans as he came back strongly to shatter the hopes of the Indian.         
	Saensomboonsuk forced Kashyap on the backhand in the second game to race to a 8-3 lead and finally win the game 21-14 to tie the scores at 1-1.         
	In the decider, Kashyaps defensive errors continued as the Thai took a 19-15 lead. In the end, despite Kashyap prolonging the rallies, Saensomboonsuk won the third game 21-16 to cruise into the second round.         
	But its a learning experience for me. I have no doubt that I was the better player with the better shots but he forced me to play to his style and I just couldnt adapt, Kashyap said.         
	Meanwhile, top-seeded Wang Yihan of China began her bid for her first badminton by cruising through her opening match.         
	Following a first-round bye, Wang beat Porntip Buranaprasertsuk of Thailand 21-12, 21-19 to move into the third round.         
	Despite her status, and being the worlds No. 1 player since late last year, Wang hasnt won a title since November and been susceptible to upsets this year.         
	Next up is Eriko Hirose of Japan, and a looming quarter final against seventh-seeded Lin Wang of China or Pui Yin Yip of Hong Kong, who beat Wang at the Swiss Super Series.         
	Lin, the bronze medal at last years worlds in India, defeated Maja Tvrdy of Slovenia 21-7, 21-18.         
	Petya Nedelcheva of Bulgaria ousted Larisa Griga of Ukraine 21-17, 21-13.         
	In mens singles, second-seeded Peter Gade of Denmark and fourth-seeded Chen Jin of China reached the second round. Chen, a 2009 world runner-up, beat Ville Lang of Finland 21-14, 21-14 while European champion Gade cruised past Daniel Paiola of Brazil 21-10, 21-7.         
	Chen will next face Kestutis Navickas of Lithuania, who rallied past Kieran Merrilees of Scotland 15-21, 21-13, 21-14.         
	Gade will have a trickier match against South Koreas Shon Wan Ho, ranked 19th in the world, who defeated Hu Yun of Hong Kong 21-18, 21-13.         
	Ninth-seeded Boonsak Ponsana of Thailand routed Vladimir Malkov of Russia 21-6, 21-6 and eighth-seeded Simon Santoso of Indonesia beat Przemyslaw Wacha of Poland 21-11, 21-17.

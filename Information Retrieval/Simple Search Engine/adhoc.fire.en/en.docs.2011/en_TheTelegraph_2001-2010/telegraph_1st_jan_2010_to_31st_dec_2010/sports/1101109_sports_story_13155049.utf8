	Dubai: Jacques Kallis scored a half-century and took three wickets to inspire South Africa to a 57-run win over Pakistan and a 3-2 victory in the one-day series.         
	South Africa reached 317 for five for their highest total in the series after winning the toss and choosing to bat. Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers and JP Duminy also chipped in with half-centuries.         
	Pakistan began the run chase strongly, with Mohammed Hafeez and Shahzaib Hasan teaming up for an 82-run partnership for the first wicket.         
	But after that, the top order collapsed with Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf and Fawad Alam scoring a measly seven runs between them. Umar Akmal and Abdul Razzaq gave Pakistan some late hope with 60 for the seventh wicket but it wasnt enough.         
	Earlier, for South Africa, the first 50 runs for the team came in only 7.1 overs  the fastest ever against Pakistan.         
	After captain Graeme Smith was out for 14 to make it one for 37 and Amla was removed in the 15th over with the total on 98, Kallis and De Villiers put on 121 runs for the third wicket.

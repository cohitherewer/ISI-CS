	Barcelona: Michael Schumacher shook off his comeback rust on Friday after setting the third fastest time in Spanish GP practice behind Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber.         
	Vettel, on pole three times in four races this season, dominated a sunny afternoon by lapping the Circuit de Catalunya with a best time in one minute 19.965 seconds ahead of Australian Webber.         
	McLarens world champions Lewis Hamilton, in 1:21.134, and Jenson Button had been first and second in an overcast morning session.         
	Schumacher, the sports most successful driver who has struggled to match his young German teammate Nico Rosberg so far in his comeback season at the age of 41 and after three years out, was third in both sessions. The second was stopped briefly when Germanys Nico Hulkenberg crashed his Williams.         
	The seven-time champion was 0.582 behind Hamiltons first session pace and 0.792 slower than Vettels in the second.           (REUTERS)

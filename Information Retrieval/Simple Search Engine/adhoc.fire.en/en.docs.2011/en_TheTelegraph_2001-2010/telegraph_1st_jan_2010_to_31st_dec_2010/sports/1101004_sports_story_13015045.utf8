                                                                                                                       7                                      Bindra: A dream come true
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra, who carried the national flag in the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony, on Sunday, became the fourth Indian shooter to do so in a mega event.         
	The winner of the 10-metre air rifle event in the Beijing Olympics said, it was an emotional moment for him. When I played my first Commonwealth Games in Manchester, I was only 15 years of age and the youngest member of the contingent. Today (Sunday), it was a dream come true for me. To represent the country in the Commonwealth Games and also to carry the national flag is a great honour, said the crack marksman.         
	Bindra also took the athletes oath on behalf of the 7,000 participants from 71 countries and territories.         
	We declare that we will take part in the 2010 Commonwealth Games, in the spirit of true sportsmanship, recognising the rules which govern them and desirous of participating in them for the honour of our Commonwealth and the glory of sport, said Bindra.         
	The late Karni Singh, a silver medallist in skeet in the World Championships, was the flag bearer at the 1982 Asian Games. Ace pistol shooter Jaspal Rana carried the Indian flag during the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.         
	Athens Olympics silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore carried the tri-colour at the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games and the 2008 Beijing Olympics.         
	Olympic bronze medallist and 66kg world wrestling champion Sushil Kumar handed over the Queens baton to Prince Charles. The relay started with Vijender Singh, followed by Mary Kom and Samresh Jung, who finally handed over the baton to Sushil.

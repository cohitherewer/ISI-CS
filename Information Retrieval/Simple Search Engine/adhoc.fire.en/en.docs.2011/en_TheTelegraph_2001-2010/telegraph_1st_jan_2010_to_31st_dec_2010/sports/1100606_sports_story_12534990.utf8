	Manchester: England are in command of the second Test at Old Trafford after Bangladesh collapsed to 216 all out at the close of play on the second day.         
	Tamim Iqbal scored 108 with 11 fours and one six, but a disastrous evening session by Bangladesh on Saturday handed England the initiative. Bangladesh reached tea on 96 without loss but lost all ten wickets after the interval, falling three runs short of the follow on target.

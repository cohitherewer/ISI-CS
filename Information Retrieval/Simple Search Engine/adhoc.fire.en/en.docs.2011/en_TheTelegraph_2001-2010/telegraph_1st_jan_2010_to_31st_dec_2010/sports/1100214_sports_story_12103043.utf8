                                                                                                                       7                                        2-0 win will be terrific
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sachin Tendulkar at the Eden on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: South Africa captain Graeme Smith feels that the Indian Premier League (IPL) has helped the Proteas to identify the chinks in the Indian armour.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The solid homework         
	We have been exposed a lot more to Indian cricket through the IPL. We have seen the footage of the Indian players. That has helped us prepare a plan against them. Some of the players also played against them in the emerging tour in Australia last year. All that helped. The success in the Test at Nagpur was a result of the professional attitude showed by the players. They deserve all credit for that.         
	On the Nagpur triumph         
	Its about adapting to the surface you are playing on. Its very important to execute those plans. To have the mental strength to do what you want to do under pressure. Thats what preparing is all about.         
	Starting as favourites         
	Its a terrific feeling. Not many teams get an opportunity to win series in India and, in our two tours, we have the opportunity now. Going into the Eden Test 1-0 up in the series is a lifetime opportunity to win a series in India. Its something you really want to achieve. That really works in getting yourselves motivated.         
	All the talk regarding the pitch         
	There has been a lot of talk about the wicket. It looked pretty good yesterday (Friday). I am sure it will be a pretty good wicket as it has always been.         
	Dale Steyn vs Gautam Gambhir         
	Dale (Steyn) has been very exciting. He has been consistently good over the last couple of years. He has been able to adapt to the various conditions he has played in, over the years. He has matured as a cricketer and is a great asset. About Gautam, he has batted really well and has performed in the subcontinent. He is a good player of spin bowling. His real test will however be when he travels to the other parts of the world.         
	His take on the four-pronged Indian attack         
	I believe that the Indian attack has a lot of quality. Zaheer (Khan) and Harbhajan (Singh) have been the leading wicket-takers for India in the last couple of years. They have stuck to their game plan of playing four bowlers. Our job is to create pressure on their attack by having big partnerships. Thats the challenge.         
	Whether they were expecting a change in the Indian strategy         
	I dont expect India to change their game plan much. I guess they wont like to panic after losing one Test match. From our perspective its about executing our plan.         
	Ranking or a series win         
	One takes care of the other. Well know in the next five days If we can play good cricket then the ranking will take care of itself.         
	A clean sweep         
	A 2-0 margin will be something that you can look back on as having achieved as team. It will be a terrific memory for all of us at the end of our careers.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian womens football team marked their return to the international arena with a gold, defeating Nepal 3-1 in the final at the South Asian Games (SAG), in Dhaka, on Monday.         
	The last time the Indian girls played an international match was in October 2008. In June 2009, Fifa struck India off the rankings list because of inaction. India were ranked 11th in Asia then.         
	In the final at the Bangabandhu Stadium, it was India who fell behind to an early goal, but skipper Bembem Devi soon converted a spot kick to level the scores before half-time. Naobi Devi then scored twice in the second session to settle the matter in Indias favour.         
	True, the level of competition wasnt too high here but the victory is a great morale booster for the entire team, said Bembem Devi. Given a chance, we are ready to take on the best in Asia, the captain added.         
	India, who also bagged the fair play trophy, won all their five matches with ease, scoring 29 goals and conceding only two. The girls started their campaign in the round robin format with an 8-1 victory over Sri Lanka, followed by emphatic wins over Pakistan (6-0), Nepal (5-0) and Bangladesh (7-0) before the second encounter with Nepal, in the final.         
	While the womens team goes from strength to strength, their male counterparts find themselves further hamstrung.         
	The Indian B team for the AFC Challenge Cup in Colombo was further weakened when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) decided to send goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya for the senior camp in Dubai.         
	Bhattacharya was the mainstay of the B team that won the SAFF Cup in Dhaka last month. He dished out sterling performances in that tournament and saved three spot kicks in the final against the Maldives.         
	The Indian squad for the AFC Challenge Cup is currently practising in Pune, under Sukhwinder Singh.

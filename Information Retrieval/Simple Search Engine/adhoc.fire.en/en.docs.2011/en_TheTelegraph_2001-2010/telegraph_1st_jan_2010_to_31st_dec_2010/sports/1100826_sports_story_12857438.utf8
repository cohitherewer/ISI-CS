The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru took it away from us: Taylor
                                                                                                                       7                                      Viru took it away from us: Taylor
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Dambulla: New Zealand captain Ross Taylor admitted that they were completely outplayed by the Indians on Wednesday. The way Sehwag batted he took the game away from us. The way they bowled, they bowled full and straight he said.         
	Praveen Kumar was special. The ball has been swinging all through the tournament. For us now, it is back to the drawing board, he added.         
	I guess we didnt start well and when you get put on the backfoot straightaway, a total like 220 is a long way away. They bowled well but our batters, we just didnt step up, really. Its disappointing to finish the tournament on a poor note. I thought we played quite well at times. Its such an important game and we didnt play as well as we would have liked.         
	I guess one of the biggest things is probably the experience some of the youngsters have gained, he said.         
	There was some confusion in the middle with the batting Powerplay and when asked about the incident, Dhoni said there was a miscommunication as Kyle Mills had not informed the umpires about the Powerplay.         
	Mills told me he was taking Powerplay, and I arranged my field accordingly, and forgot to look at the umpire. When we asked the umpires how many overs left, they said the Powerplay was not even on. But Mills stood by his word, and it was sorted out, he said.

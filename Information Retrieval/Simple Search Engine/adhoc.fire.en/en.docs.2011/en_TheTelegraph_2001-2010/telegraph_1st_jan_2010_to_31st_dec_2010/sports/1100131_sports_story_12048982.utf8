The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Casey, Dredge in joint lead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Casey, Dredge in joint lead
                      
	Doha: Paul Casey return to form in shooting a 6-under 66 Saturday to share the lead with Bradley Dredge after the third round of the Qatar Masters.         
	Casey arrived in Doha still feeling the effects of a lingering rib muscle injury and having missed the cut in each of his three previous appearances at the tournament. But he made seven birdies along with a single bogey to sit tied with Dredge (70) with a 10-under total of 206.         
	Dredge is looking for his first title since the 2006 European Masters, and is hoping to make an early case for inclusion on the European Ryder Cup team.         
	They will be chased by Lee Westwood in the final round, after he shot a 70 to stay one shot off the lead  despite cracking the head of his driver on the 11th tee. (Agencies)

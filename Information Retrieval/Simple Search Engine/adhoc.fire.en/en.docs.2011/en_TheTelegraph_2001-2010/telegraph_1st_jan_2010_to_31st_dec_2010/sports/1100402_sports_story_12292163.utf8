  - Royal challengers look to put campaign back on track               Brett Lee                           
	Mohali: Their back against the wall after six defeats in seven matches, Kings XI Punjab desperately need a win to keep their slim semi-final hopes alive when they take on formidable Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League here Friday.         
	Barring a couple of closely-fought contests, Kings XI Punjab have put up a dismal show so far. The 2008 semifinalists and last years No. 5 finishers have lost all three of their home games and won only one match.         
	The latest defeat came against table-toppers the Mumbai Indians on Tuesday.         
	What added to their misery was the fact that they were without regular captain Kumar Sangakkara serving a one-match ban for the teams inability to maintain the required over-rate for the third time in the event.         
	The big-hitting Yuvraj Singh has been a flop so far managing just about 100-odd runs in the seven games. Mahela Jayawardene has also come a cropper.                     
	Sangakkara, who had replaced Yuvraj as captain this season, has also failed with the bat in six games that he played.         
	The team had to depend mostly on the starts provided by Englands Ravi Bopara and some lusty hitting down the order by Irfan Pathan to a large extent.         
	Shaun Marsh, who was the top run-getter for his side in the inaugural IPL, again proved what he was capable of by hitting a half-century against the Mumbai Indians in the first match. His inclusion in the side has lifted the batting to an extent.         
	The return of Brett Lee was expected to boost the pace attack, but the Aussie has failed to impress so far. Pathan and Salabh Srivastava have not made much impact either.         
	The Bangalore side, on the other hand, has been going great guns under Anil Kumble, who has also been the pick of the bowlers, taking six wickets averaging only just 5.28 runs per over.         
	The RCB, placed No.3 with four wins in seven games, have a formidable batting with South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis in terrific form with both the bat and ball.         
	Manish Pandey has also looked good and the inclusion of Kevin Pietersen and Cameron White has lent depth to their batting. Robin Uthappa can also score briskly and make useful contributions for the side.         
	In bowling, Praveen Kumar and Dale Steyn have been doing well, while Vinay Kumar, too, has shown his ability to contain the batsman.         
	At this stage of the tournament, Kings XI Punjab will have to come up with an extraordinary performance if they dont want to see their campaign in IPL III come to an abrupt end.

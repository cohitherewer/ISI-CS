	Miami: Justine Henin cruised into the second round of the Miami Open with a speedy 6-2, 6-2 victory over American Jill Craybas on Wednesday.         
	Former world No. 1 Henin, who entered the tournament as a wild card, needed only 62 minutes to advance in the $4.5 million event on a bright, breezy day in Key Biscayne, Florida.         
	She will now face Russian Elena Dementieva, who Henin beat in the Australian Open this year en route to a runner-up finish after 16 months away from the game.         
	Its been good to be back on the courts, said Henin, who lost in the second round at Indian Wells earlier this month.         
	I didnt live this life for almost two years, so that takes a little bit of time. Ive worked pretty good between Indian Wells and here. Now Im going to have a tough round, tough match. Thats what I want. So its going to be perfect to test myself.         
	Belgian Henin took the first set with ease after firing off eight winners to Craybass one, but then had a slight stutter in the second. After breaking Craybas twice to move ahead 5-2, Henin could not convert three match points.         
	Up 40-15 she lost sight of the ball after Craybass lob, then hit the net on her next attempt to bring up deuce. She hit an ace to take the advantage but then double faulted on her next serve.         
	American James Blake survived a late rally by 18-year-old Filip Krajinovic to win 6-7, 6-4, 6-4. Wild card Blake overcame eight double faults and 47 unforced errors to beat the Serbian, who was playing in his only second ATP World Tour-level match.         
	Argentine David Nalbandian and Japanese veteran Kimiko Date Krumm, who last played in Miami in 1996, were also first-round winners on Wednesday.         
	Date Krumm, who retired from the tour in 1996 and started to play again in 2008, spent 2 hours, 32 minutes on the court in beating Chakvetadze.         
	Meanwhile, fourth-seeded Rafael Nadal, who will play on Friday, said a toothache sent him to a dentist and kept him from practising.         
	I had a little bit (of) problem on the teeth, so I didnt practice for a few days, Nadal said. I started to practice on Tuesday afternoon. I have an inflammation (of) Wisdom tooth. I have to take out all (of them), but not now. (agencies)

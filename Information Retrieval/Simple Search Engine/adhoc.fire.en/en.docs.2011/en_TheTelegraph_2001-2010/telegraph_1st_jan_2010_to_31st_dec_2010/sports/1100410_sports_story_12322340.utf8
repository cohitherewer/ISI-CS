The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers take on CSK

	Nagpur: The Deccan Chargers five-match losing streak finally ended with a win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore, and a the confident Chargers will now look to dent the Chennai Super Kings semi-final hopes in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match here Saturday.         
	The Hyderabad outfits hopes of making the last four were almost over after they lost six of their 10 matches. However, a seven-wicket victory over the Royal Challengers Thursday boosted their morale, and Adam Gilchrists men will look to win the rest of their four ties.         
	The last time the two teams clashed, Andrew Symonds had blown away the Super Kings by blasting a 43-ball 50, and picking up two crucial wickets. However, meting out the same treatment again will be far from easy considering the Super Kings recent form. They have beaten the Royal Challengers, the Rajasthan Royals and table-toppers Mumbai Indians in their last three outings.         
	After a series of flops, the Chargers middle-order finally started firing Thursday night when Tirumalasetti Suman (78) and Andrew Symonds (53) shared an unbeaten 91-run stand to overhaul RCBs 184, with four balls to spare.         
	But the Chargers opening combination has been a problem with Mohnish Mishra and Herschelle Gibbs proving failures so far, and Adam Gilchrist not being in the best of forms. Another cause for concern is Rohit Sharmas inconsistency.           (PTI)

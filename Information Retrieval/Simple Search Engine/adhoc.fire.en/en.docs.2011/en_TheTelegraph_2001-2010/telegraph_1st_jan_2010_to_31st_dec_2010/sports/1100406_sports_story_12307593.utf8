The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I expect to win: Woods 
                                                                                                                       7                                      I expect to win: Woods 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	Augusta: Tiger Woods says nothings changed on the golf course and he still expects to win the Masters in his return to competition after a devastating personal scandal.         
	Woods began his comeback with an extraordinary 35-minute news conference at Augusta National on Monday, taking full blame for the personal failings that led to revelations of multiple extramarital affairs.         
	He said: I acted terribly, poorly, made these incredible bad decisions and decisions that have hurt so many people close to me. Thats enough.         
	I fooled myself as well. I lied to a lot of people, deceived a lot of people, kept them in the dark. When you strip all that away  the full magnitude of it, its pretty brutal. I take full responsibility for what I have done and I dont do that lightly.         
	He added: What I have done in past years has been terrible to my family; the fact I have won tournaments has been irrelevant. quot;         
	Woods refused to say why he spent 45 days in rehabilitation, but says he intends to continue with his treatment. He also said he received five stitches in his mouth after the infamous November night car crash outside his home, but stressed that hes not addicted to prescription drugs.         
	While his wife, Elin Nordegren, wont be joining him at Augusta, Woods still believes he can win his fifth green jacket after a five-month layoff.         
	Woods said he had got away from my core fundamentals that my mum and dad taught me and that one of the most difficult consequences of his actions that he has had to live with was the constant harassment of my family, my wife and kids being badgered. That was pretty tough.         
	But probably the most difficult moment, he said, was not being there to celebrate the first birthday of his son Charlie because he was undergoing treatment at a sex addiction clinic.         
	I missed my sons first birthday, quot; he said. That hurt, that hurt a lot. I cant have that happen again. Its something I regret and probably will for the rest of my life.         
	Woods said he was blown away by the reception he received from fans on Monday.         
	Coming into today (Monday) I didnt know what to expect with regards to the reception, Woods said. I tell you what, the galleries couldnt have been nicer.         
	The encouragement, it blew me away. The people here over the years are extremely respectful but today was something that touched my heart pretty good.         
	Woods denied taking illegal drugs. He admitted that he had been treated by Dr Anthony Galea, the controversial physician who is under federal investigation in the United States concerning a drugs case.         
	Galea visited Woods at his home during the golfers recovery from knee surgery and Woods acknowledged he had received a treatment known as blood spinning which was to help aid his recovery. He added: He [Galea] did come to my house, he never gave me HGH [human growth hormone] or peds [performance enhancing drugs]. I had PRP [platelet rich plasma] treatment.         
	Asked if federal agents had contacted him in relation to Galeas case, Woods added: They contacted my agent and will get full co-operation whenever they need me, but right now they havent asked for my time.         
	Woods played 18 holes in practice with 1992 Masters champion Fred Couples earlier in the day, and the pair were joined for the last six holes by 2003 US Open champion Jim Furyk.         
	Woods, however, was not impressive enough in the practice round.         
	And if he continues to drive the ball, like he did on Monday, he cannot win the Masters. Thats for sure.         
	It might be a good idea if Augustas officials order more of those yellow hard hats they issue to marshals and hand them out to the patrons when they arrive on Thursday.         
	One fan called out: Tiger, come and play where we can see you, as spectators dived for cover once more on the 11th hole.         
	The 14-time Major winner stepped on to the first tee to polite applause from a gallery that included Augusta National chairman Billy Payne and Woodss agent Mark Steinberg.         
	It is tough to get back into the playing routine, Briton Luke Donald told reporters as he prepared to tee off for his practice round.         
	As much as you practice out on the range it is not quite the same as being out on the course. I am sure Tiger feels ready. He wouldnt be back here otherwise.

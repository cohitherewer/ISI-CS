The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hernandezs Cup wish 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hernandezs Cup wish 
                      
	Johannesburg: Javier Hernandezs family has a long footballing tradition, and the Mexico striker will try to repeat history in South Africa and score in a World Cup like his grandfather did in 1954.         
	Hernandez is 22, the same age as his granddad, Tomas Balcazar, when he played in the tournament 56 years ago. Mexico fans hope Hernandez can mirror his dream start with Chivas last season when he scored eight goals in his first five games.         
	He ended up the season as the leagues top goal scorer and will join Manchester United after the World Cup.         
	Hernandez was overlooked as a starter in the tournaments opening match Friday against South Africa in favor of Guillermo Franco, but came on as a late substitute. He played aggressively, but didnt have any clear opportunities to score and finished with one off-target shot.         
	If coach Javier Aguirre selects him, he will get his next chance when Mexico takes on France in their Group A match Thursday in Polokwane.           (AGENCIES)

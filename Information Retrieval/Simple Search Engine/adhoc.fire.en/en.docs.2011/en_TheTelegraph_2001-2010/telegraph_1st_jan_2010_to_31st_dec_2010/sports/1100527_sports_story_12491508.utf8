            A STAFF REPORTER            Harbhajan Singh in the city, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Star off-spinner Harbhajan Singh wished the young Team India side, under the leadership of Suresh Raina, good luck for their tour of Zimbabwe and said that the team had potential to do well. They have good potential and I hope they come back with flying colours, said Harbhajan on the sidelines of a promotional in the city.         
	Harbhajan, who has been rested for tour of Zimbabwe, said that he is utilising the break to indulge in some endurance-enhancement training.         
	I do not go to gym too much as I do not want to build muscles and look bulky That might affect my bowling. But I stick to a lot of ground exercise, do a lot of running around the field to enhance my stamina and endurance that will help me on the cricket ground, Harbhajan said.         
	Speaking on a different issue, he said that he would root for Brazil in the upcoming Fifa World Cup beginning June 11 in South Africa.         
	Harbhajan confessed that while he is not an avid football follower, his favourite side is Brazil. My favourite side is Brazil. I hope they beat all the opposition and win the World Cup. I will support them. With the selectors opting to test Indias bench strength in their Zimbabwe tour, Harbhajan is busy utilising the break to decorate his newly-built house in Jalandhar.         
	Of course, its a welcome break. I just finished my new house. I am spending a lot of time with my family and utilising the time away from cricket as we get very little time. I am busy collecting different stuff to decorate my house, he said.

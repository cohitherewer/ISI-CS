	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings present was held by their past.         
	The CFL Premier Division clash between Mohammedan Sporting and Calcutta Port Trust, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Sunday was also a battle of brains between Syed Nayeemuddin and Shabbir Ali. And Shabbir, Mohammedan Sportings last seasons coach, might be smiling at the end of the 1-1 draw.         
	Port Trust, in fact, were the better team on the day creating more opportunities and displaying a neater game than their more fancied rivals. Nayeems boys will have to redouble their effort in the rest of the league if they harbour any hopes of a respectable position in the league.         
	After a barren first half, Port Trust drew first blood when Rajib Ekka scored from point blank range in the 73rd minute. However, veteran Dipendu Biswas found the equaliser in the 79th minute when he took advantage of a faulty clearance by the Port Trust defence.         
	While Mohammedan Sporting players were collectively insipid, Port Trusts Nigerian striker Efemena Charles was impressive with his speed and power. He, in fact, missed a sitter in the dying minutes of the match. Also, his powerful shot in the 80th minute found the horizontal on its way.         
	In the other match of the day, BNR defeated Southern Samity by a solitary goal scored by Shyam Mondal.         
	Teams         
	Mohammedan Sporting: Priyant Singh (Manas Barua, 59 th), Zoheb Hasan, Debkumar Sashmal, David Mkandawire, Hatchibuddin Mondal, Sarip Ali Mondal, Zodinliana, Sandip Rai, Goutam Thakur, Dipendu Biswas, Suroj Mondal (Mohammed Mukhtar, 88 th)

	Meanwhile, Chirag United begin their CFL campaign on Monday when they take on Railway FC, at the Barasat Stadium. According to coach Subrata Bhattacharya, Chirag are fit and ready for the match. There are no injury worries for the team with the likes of Junior, Joshimar and Chika Wali all available for selection.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hauritz feels Tendulkar, too, can make mistakes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hauritz feels Tendulkar, too, can make mistakes
                      
	Chandigarh: Australia off-spinner Nathan Hauritz Friday admitted that it would be a tough challenge to bowl against Sachin Tendulkar in the upcoming Test series but said the champion batsman, too, is vulnerable.         
	He (Tendulkar) is the worlds best batsman, he is unbelievable. I am looking forward to bowling to him, in what I know is going to be a tough challenge. But people make mistakes and Tendulkar, too, can make mistakes, Hauritz told reporters ahead of the three-day practice match against Board Presidents XI starting here Friday.         
	Hauritz, who made his Test debut against India in Mumbai six years ago and took the prized wicket of Tendulkar in that match, will be leading the Australian spin attack during the two-Test series starting here on October 1.         
	I would be looking to bowl in the right areas but a lot depends on the wicket as it has been raining here. Generally, the wickets dont turn much after the first two days, said the off-spinner, who is returning after an injury.         
	He also sees a great challenge in bowling to other Indian batsmen, including Virender Sehwag, VVS Laxman, Rahul Dravid and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, saying all of them play spin very aggressively.         
	I know its going to be a tough challenge, but my focus would be to see the ball come out well out of my hands, said Hauritz, who has so far scalped 57 wickets from 15 Tests.         
	Hauritz also heaped praise on Harbhajan Singh and rated the Indian off-spinner as one of the best spinners in the world.         
	Asked if he had made any special preparation for the strong Indian bating line-up, he said: There is no different preparation as such. Its only a matter of adapting to the wicket.         
	India go into the Test series as the No. 1 side . We respect every opposition. Once you start disrespecting your opponents, you will get beaten, he said.           (PTI)

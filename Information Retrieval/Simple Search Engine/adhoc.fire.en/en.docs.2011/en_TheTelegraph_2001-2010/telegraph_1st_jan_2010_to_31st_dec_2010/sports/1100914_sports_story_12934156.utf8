The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nice way to start season: Kallis
                                                                                                                       7                                      Nice way to start season: Kallis
            A STAFF REPORTER                       
	Calcutta: The Royal Challengers Bangalore got their CLT20 campaign off to a great start in Centurion on Sunday when they outclassed Guyana in their opening match.         
	Man of the Match Jacques Kallis, who took three for 16 and made an unbeaten 47, said it was a perfect start to the season for him.         
	Its amazing what a break can do, he said. Weve had a break of about two months. I took a couple of weeks off and then it was back to the fitness training and its been nice to get fit and strong again.         
	It was nice to start the season like that, he added. I struggled last week with a little bit of a back injury, so couldnt do too much batting and bowling, but it worked out perfectly for me.         
	It was good to get the ball in the right areas again. Early on in the season you have to just go back to the basics, which is what I tried to do, and it worked for me.         
	Also with the bat, to get a few balls in the middle of the bat  it was a great way to kick off a season, especially one with an important World Cup at the end of it. Hopefully that continues.         
	Kallis, who was controversially left out of the South African team for the ICC T20 in 2007, said he had worked very hard on his T20 cricket.         
	A few years ago, there was criticism, and they said I couldnt play it. I wanted to prove to myself that I could, and Ive worked very hard with Duncan Fletcher to get consistency as well as aggression.         
	Ill carry on working at this format  I really enjoy it, he said.         
	Weve had a really good preparation, he said. Ray (Jennings) has organised some really good practice facilities and net bowlers, so we had a week and a half of excellent preparation. We covered all the bases and we just needed to put in a good, solid performance on the field, which we did. We were good in all departments and when you fire like that, youre in with a good chance.

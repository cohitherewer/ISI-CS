The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United, Leeds will reignite old rivalry
                                                                                                                       7                                        United, Leeds will reignite old rivalry
  - FA Cup Liverpool visit Reading today               Alex Ferguson                           
	London: With 9,000 Leeds United fans headed for Old Trafford, Sundays FA Cup third round game against record 11-time winners Manchester United will be a throwback to some of the great showdowns between the two teams.         
	These days, however, Leeds are 43 places behind United down in the third tier of English footballs pyramid and a victory will be considered a major upset.         
	Back in the 1960s, Manchester United vs Leeds would mean a meeting of the Charlton brothers  Uniteds Bobby and Leeds Jack. It pitted Uniteds George Best and Dennis Law against Leeds Billy Bremner and John Giles.         
	Moving on to the early 90s, when Leeds last won the league title, it was Uniteds Mark Hughes against Leeds Lee Chapman.         
	And 10 years ago when Leeds was riding high at the top of the Premier League at the halfway stage, it was Dwight Yorke and David Beckham against Rio Ferdinand and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.         
	That was when Leeds had a team capable of competing for the big titles  also reaching the semi-final of the Champions League in 2001. Soon after that the team ran into serious financial trouble and dropped two divisions while Manchester United added to their huge total of titles.         
	United manager Alex Ferguson says his team still has to be wary of a Leeds side which tops the League One standings by eight points.         
	But the Scot, who turned 68 on New Years Eve, has strong memories of United-Leeds confrontations.         
	With his team two points behind Chelsea in the Premier League and an eye-catching League Cup semi-final against Manchester City to follow on Wednesday, Ferguson is likely to rest some of his regular starters, such as Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs.         
	Hoping to make an impact, Leeds is likely to field their strongest available side, including striker Jermaine Beckford who has banged in 19 league and cup goals this season to go with the 46 in 84 appearances in the previous two.         
	Leeds manager Simon Grayson said Friday the game will give his players the chance to make an impact in an already impressive season.         
	During the 1970s and 80s, fans of the two clubs clashed frequently and Grayson called on supporters not to spoil the occasions by looking for trouble. Sundays game is one of few top match-ups in the last-64 of footballs oldest and most prestigious competition with only three meetings of Premier League rivals.         
	Arsenal, which is one behind Uniteds record 11 FA Cup triumphs, go to West Ham United. Aston Villa, which has won the trophy seven times but not since 1957, host a Blackburn side which have six cup triumphs but none since 1928. Wigan and Hull also meet but neither has even reached the final.         
	Chelsea start their defence with a home game against Watford, from the second tier League Championship. With Didier Drogba, Salomon Kalou, Michael Essien and Jon Obi Mikel among those headed for the African Cup of Nations, manager Carlo Ancelotti has a restricted choice of players to choose from but could still rest some of his regulars.         
	On Saturday, Seven-time cup winners Liverpool visit another Championship club, Reading, which has won only once at home in 12 league starts while Manchester City play Middlesbrough.         
	Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez may consider resting striker Fernando Torres and captain Steven Gerrard to keep them fully fit for Premier League games.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                        Subhas Bhowmick named Bagan TD
            A STAFF REPORTER            Subhas Bhowmick                           
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan, on Tuesday, roped in Subhas Bhowmick as the teams technical director after Stanley Rozario quit as coach Monday. Bhowmick, who will be taking charge of the green and maroon brigade after 19 years, said he was thankful to the officials for the chance given to him.         
	I want to thank all the officials, fans and players who have put their faith in me. I will aim to do my very best, Bhowmick said on Tuesday.         
	Bhowmicks appointment came less than 24 hours after Rozario put in his papers. We did not ask the coach to leave. It was Rozarios decision to resign, said a Bagan official.         
	The former East Bengal coached pleaded for time. All I ask for is time. Ive always maintained that 90 per cent of a player is his technical ability and 10 per cent luck.         
	Its unfortunate that Bagans luck hasnt been clicking. All the team needs is a good performance to get their confidence back. This is just a passing phase, said Bhowmick, who trained the team this afternoon.         
	A few players are injured, like (Edeh) Chidi, Murithala and Kingshuk (Debnath). But, Im sure that well manage.         
	Ive spoken to the players and they seem fine. The only thing I want to make clear is that I will not make an injured player play and hamper his chances further, he added.         
	Bhowmick said he had always wished to work with Jose Ramirez Barreto.         
	It had been a dream which I never thought would be fulfilled. However, Barreto would always say that one day it would surely happen. And now it has.         
	For Bhowmick, Thursdays I-League match against Dempo tops his priority at the moment.         
	Bagan has played only three matches so far. Its just the beginning so all is not lost. My aim is to survive the test against Dempo. Only then will I think of anything else, the Asean Cup winning coach said.         
	Bagan said they would submit a coachs name who holds an A-licence to the AFC, by December 31.         
	We are in talks with a few A-licence coaches. Well submit a name by December 31, a club official said.

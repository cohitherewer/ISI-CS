The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: Sourav still excellent
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne: Sourav still excellent
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Shane Warne said on Saturday that the inexperience in the Rajasthan Royals ranks cost them dear in the third edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	We lost three matches at the start, then won six and ended the tournament with another five losses in between. We didnt have enough runs on the board today From 59/0, we lost nine wickets for 73 runs in 13 overs.         
	We tried everything to get a wicket but it didnt happen when the Knight Riders were batting It was turning a long way and the wicket wasnt easy to bat on. Just six wins in 14 games is disappointing. We missed experience at certain stages and the inexperience cost us dear, the Royals captain said.         
	When you have inexperience, in tough situations, you may show a tendency to panic... To win six games out of eight after losing three in a row shows a lot of character. Unfortunately, there was pressure in the last three games, and it all boiled down to this one. I think our inexperience showed.         
	As captain and coach, I take full responsibility. I take full responsibility for three losses in a row, he added.         
	The legendary leg-spinner was all praise for Sourav Ganguly. He is an experienced player. He played beautifully. He took a good catch to get rid of Yusuf Pathan. He is still an excellent cricketer.         
	Warne didnt regret the decision to leave out local boy Abhishek Jhunjhunwala. He is a very good player. We opted for a player who can hit, do some power-hitting towards the end... Someone who can get runs quicker Somebody who can clear the fence in these conditions.         
	Warne stressed once again that he wasnt sure of returning to the IPL next year.         
	I am not sure to be honest. I think I am still good at captaincy and also bowling pretty well. Itll be a completely different set-up next year. Depends whether there will be retention by the franchise or everyone will be up for auction. For me, its all about enjoyment. However, I think I am fit enough.

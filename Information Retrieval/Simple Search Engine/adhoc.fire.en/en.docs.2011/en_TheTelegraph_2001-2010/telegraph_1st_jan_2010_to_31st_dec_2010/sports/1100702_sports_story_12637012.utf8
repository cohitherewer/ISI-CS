The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Argentina bad losers: Lahm
                                                                                                                       7                                        Argentina bad losers: Lahm
    - Maradona says team eyeing revenge for 2006 exit                 German players during a training session, on Thursday                           
	Erasmia: Germany captain Philipp Lahm has kept the salvos coming in the war of words with Argentina by saying his teams World Cup quarter final opponents are bad losers.         
	Germany team manager Oliver Bierhoff added to the tension on Thursday, calling the Argentines aggressive and provocative on the pitch.         
	The statements came a day after midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger said Argentina showed no respect for opponents and referees.         
	Not one to take things lying down, Diego Maradona reacted to Schweinsteigers jibe by saying it must be that nerves were getting to Schweinsteiger.         
	Laughing during an interview Wednesday night with a sports broadcaster, Maradona mockingly asked Schweinsteiger whether he was nervous and said his players were looking forward to revenge.         
	Lahm dismissed suggestions his teammates were nervous.         
	We are tense but not nervous, Lahm said. We are looking forward to the game.         
	The unusually bellicose German comments appear designed to raise the stakes in the mind games ahead of the match on Saturday in Cape Town.         
	The two teams have a history of ill-tempered run ins, with the latest coming at the 2006 World Cup when they fought on the field after hosts Germany beat Argentina on penalties in the quarter finals.         
	We have to concentrate on our own game. They are temperamental, well see how they deal with defeat on Saturday, Lahm said. They are impulsive, temperamental and they dont know how to lose.         
	Bierhoff said he had played with many Argentines and found them friendly, warm-hearted people.         
	But on the pitch they are different. They become aggressive and provocative. We should keep a cool head and concentrate on our own game, the former Germany striker said.         
	Referring to the post-match fight in 2006, Bierhoff said, emotions run high after a game but we should put it behind us.         
	Asked if the teams staff had talked to Schweinsteiger about his comments the day before, Bierhoff said he saw no need for that.         
	I dont think they were so inflammatory. It was not his intention to start a fire. He is a fair sportsman, Bierhoff said.         
	A day earlier, Schweinsteiger had said that the fight after 2006 quarter final still weighed heavily on his teammates minds.         
	When you look at their body language and gesticulations, the way they try to influence the referees, they have no respect, Schweinsteiger said. Its their mentality and character and well have to adjust.         
	Bierhoff said the German team had a healthy dose of self-esteem but would not be overestimating themselves but Lahm said there was no such danger of such a thing happening anyway.         
	We are playing the top favourite and we wont be over confident, Lahm said.         
	Germany beat England 4-1 in the round of 16 by exposing Englands defensive weaknesses and Bierhoff said the team had devised a game plan for Argentina, although he would no reveal details.         
	We see Argentina as a stronger team than England. We saw for ourselves in March how strong they are, Bierhoff said. They are ambitious and have a strong team spirit and use every chance they get. They have fewer weaknesses than England, but we have detected some.         
	Argentina beat Germany 1-0 in a friendly in Munich in March.         
	We have a lot of quality and we must play as a team, as we did against England. Well be well prepared and we know how to beat a strong opponent, Lahm said. We have to show that we can beat a really strong rival, its been a long time.

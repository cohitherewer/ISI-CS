The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | More pressure is on the players
                                                                                                                       7                                        More pressure is on the players
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                (From top) Piyush Chawla , Murali Vijay, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja                      
	Calcutta: Poor Ravindra Jadeja.         
	Hit for sixes in the recent World Twenty20, abused by Indian fans in St Lucia, showcaused by the Board and, simultaneously, warned by a very senior functionary.         
	Jadeja, according to The Telegraphs sources, has been unambiguously told that if he didnt perform in Zimbabwe, it would be the end of his India career.         
	Besides a tri-series, with Sri Lanka being the third team, the tour will feature two T20 Internationals against the hosts.         
	Can such a warning have a positive impact? Its more likely that, because of the added pressure, Jadeja just wont be able to deliver... The same may be said of the others whove been showcaused for the pub incident, one of the sources pointed out.         
	The others in that category, and heading to Zimbabwe, are: Piyush Chawla (for the T20 Internationals only), Murali Vijay and Rohit Sharma.         
	Ashish Nehra, Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan arent going to Zimbabwe, but have been asked to explain why action should not be taken against them for the ruckus at Tequila Joes.         
	Having had too much to drink, a group of fans targeted Jadeja, holding him responsible for Indias ouster (at the Super Eights stage) from the World Twenty20. Matters got worse when Nehra and Yuvraj took the lead in defending their teammate.         
	It actually showed good team spirit.         
	Clearly, anybody representing the country has to be at his/her best behaviour, at all times, but the India cricketers had definitely been provoked on the night that the team exited from the tournament.         
	The showcauses were issued on Tuesday and the players have to respond within a week. The Jadejas are scheduled to leave for Zimbabwe, via South Africa, very early on Wednesday.         
	Its quite likely that all seven in the dock wont be at the receiving end of anything more than a reprimand.         
	Not that the Board cant spring a surprise, though.

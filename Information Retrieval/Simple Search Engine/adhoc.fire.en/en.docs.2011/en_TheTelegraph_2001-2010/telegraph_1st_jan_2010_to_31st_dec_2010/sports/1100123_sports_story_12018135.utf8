The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kim: I want to forget this defeat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kim: I want to forget this defeat
                      
	Melbourne: Kim Clijsters, the US Open champion, was at a loss as to why her game completely fell apart in her 0-6, 1-6 thrashing at the hands of Nadia Petrova in the Australian Open third round on Friday.         
	Clijsters was one of the favourites, both sentimentally and form-wise for the years opening Grand Slam at Melbourne Park, but she was taken apart in 52 minutes by the 27-year-old Russian.         
	I was completely off. Just, I think tennis-wise, I didnt feel the ball at all, Clijsters told reporters. It sucks. Its something you dont want to happen too often.         
	You know, matches like this, maybe it happens once a year where you feel like this.         
	But you dont want it to happen more than this because then, you know, its not a coincidence.         
	Clijsters said she would return home and leave the match to the archives.         
	This is something probably you want to forget as soon as possible and go home and get settled at home for a few days and then start working hard again and try to forget about it. Im going to try to not let a match like this get me down or start doubting myself or anything.

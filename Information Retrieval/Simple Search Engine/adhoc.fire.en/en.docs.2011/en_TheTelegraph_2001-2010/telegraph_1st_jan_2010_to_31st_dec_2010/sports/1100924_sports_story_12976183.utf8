The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Archers asked to carry galoshes!
                                                                                                                       7                                      Archers asked to carry galoshes!
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The archery competition in next months Commonwealth Games may prove to be an eyeball-popping spectacle.         
	Though archers in knee-length boots is not a commonplace sight, it can be quite possible, thanks to the poor ground condition of the Yamuna Sports Complex.         
	According to secretary of the Archery Association of India (AAI) Paresh Mukherjee, the archery venue of the sports complex is so muddy that it may not be fit enough to host the competition involving 27 nations.         
	So much so, the AAI has already written to all participating nations to come to India with galoshes for the archery event. In my opinion, wearing those boots would be the only way to stand on the slippery and wet ground, Mukherjee said. I have written to all the participating nations and have also given a copy to the Organising Committee (OC). They (OC) are well aware of the ground reality, Mukherjee added.         
	Since adequate measures were not taken while preparing the ground, it has complicated the problem, Mukherjee said. Now, because of the incessant rain the ground has turned marshy and it would be difficult for the archers to keep their balance during the competition, he said.         
	An official of the Yamuna Sports Complex, which was jointly renovated by Ministry of Urban Development and Delhi Development Authority (DDA) at a cost of Rs.250 crore, confirmed the problem.         
	There are hitches but such things do happen. Once, the Indian archers too had to use long boots during a tournament at Singapore. We are trying our best to bring the ground back to shape as soon as possible, the official said.         
	To make matters worse, the Indian archery team had a harrowing time when they landed in the capital from Calcutta on Thursday morning.         
	With no one from the OC to receive them at the domestic airport, the archers waited for three hours before they were asked to proceed to the international airport.         
	We had written to the OC at least a week back confirming our arrival in Delhi, on Thursday. Yet there was no one to take care of the players, an archery official said.

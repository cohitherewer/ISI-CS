The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Imran Khan supports IPL boycott
                                                                                                                       7                                      Imran Khan supports IPL boycott
                      
	Karachi: Imran Khan is against Pakistani cricketers playing in the Indian Premier League (IPL) in future but said he was not in favour of boycotting the hockey and cricket World Cup.         
	Imran on Sunday slammed the IPL, saying the Pakistani players were deliberately insulted by the franchises and they shouldnt participate in it again. They (IPL) deliberately insulted our players at the auction, there was no merit in ignoring our players, Imran told reporters here. If the IPL franchises had any concerns about security and other issues they should have been clear about this and not invited them to the auction in the first place.         
	But to include them in the auction and then to snub them was appalling and our cricket board and government should lodge a strong protest with the Indian government over this, he added.         
	Eleven Pakistani players were included in the IPL players auction held in Mumbai on January 19 but none were bought by the franchises which resulted in allegations from Pakistan that it was a pre-planned move to humiliate the players and the country.         
	The legendary pacer, however, didnt agree with the demands to boycott the hockey and cricket World Cups.           (PTI)

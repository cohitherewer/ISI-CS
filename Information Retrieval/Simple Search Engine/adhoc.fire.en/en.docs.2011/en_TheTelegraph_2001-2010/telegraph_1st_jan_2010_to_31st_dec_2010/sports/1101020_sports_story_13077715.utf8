The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big budget but poor selection
                                                                                                                       7                                      Big budget but poor selection
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: At a time when the government has sanctioned Rs 10 crore for training and development of the Indian football team for the Asian Games, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has decided to field a bunch of novices for the prestigious event.         
	AIFF sources say the China-bound team could easily be the weakest ever to play in a major meet for India. It is virtually our third team that will play in the Asian Games, said a senior AIFF official.         
	Since our first 30 players are in the Asian Cup camp, and national coach Bob Houghton is not ready to release any of them for the Asian Games, we have no option but to organise the camp with 24 players, who have very little experience, the official said.         
	An official of the sports ministry said he was surprised to learn that AIFF was not sending the best possible side. There is a huge budgetary allocation for the football team, and we expect encouraging results. But selection of teams is one area where we cannot interfere, he said. The football event in the Asian Games is an under-23 tournament, but each nation is allowed to field three senior players         
	Federation sources said that it was initially agreed that a few players would be released from the Asian Cup camp for the Asian Games.         
	Most of these players fall in the under-23 category and are eligible to play in the Asian Games. But in a meeting with the AIFF officials last month, Houghton said that leaving the players for Asian Games would not be right, since the Asian Cup was more important than any other tournament, said the sources.         
	India are in a strong group, with Kuwait, Qatar and Singapore being the other teams.

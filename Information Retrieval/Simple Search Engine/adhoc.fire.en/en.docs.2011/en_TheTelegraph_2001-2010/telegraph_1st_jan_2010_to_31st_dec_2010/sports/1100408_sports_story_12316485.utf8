                                                                                                                       7                                      I see myself as a rebel with a cause: Andrew Symonds
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Australian all-rounder says theres more to life than Cricket             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                      Andrew Symonds    
	Calcutta: Andrew Symonds, whod be quite happy being described as a free spirit, spoke to The Telegraph for around 45 minutes during his recent visit to the city with the Deccan Chargers squad.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Have you done justice to your talent?         
	A (After a pause) Took me a long time to learn how to put an innings together, but Ive got the hang of it now... There have probably been only a couple of occasions when Ive walked off the ground completely satisfied... You always want to score more or feel that you couldve bowled better or fielded better. As for the justice bit, your question could be better answered either by people Ive played against or teammates.         
	Would one of the most satisfying days be when you lashed that unbeaten 143, against Pakistan, in the 2003 World Cup?         
	Yeah, most definitely.         
	The general belief is that you havent done justice to your talent...         
	Being around the right people brings the best out of you... I havent had that throughout my life... For example, some coaches work better for you than some of the others. So, finding the right combination of people to have around you as well as finding the right way to prepare for the challenges is important.         
	Youve always been regarded as temperamental. Why?         
	Dont know who has said Im temperamental... Obviously, on the ground, Im passionate. Off it, Id say Im pretty laid-back and in my zone.         
	Today, you arent playing for Australia... Why the negative headlines over the past few years?         
	Part of the reason is that I did silly things. But, also, I think the way people see professional sportspersons has changed.         
	Too much scrutiny?         
	Yeah... There arent many places where you can be left alone and, so, I generally dont go out a great deal... The change in the rules of the game has probably worked to my detriment. You know, I like to have a good time and I like to enjoy myself, but there are (new) things you can do and things you cant. For me, enjoying cricket holds more meaning than winning or losing. It would be difficult for someone like me to survive and enjoy life in this Australian teams environment.         
	Because of the emphasis on discipline?         
	Youve got all the recovery sessions (at the end of the day)... Alcohol is banned... In the end, its rebellion if you go to town for a drink and to let your hair down. After a Test match, for example, Id need a release... Its a fair enough requirement and, if you cant have it, something builds up within... At some point, its going to burst.         
	Did too much of authority leave you suffocated?         
	Yeah, it would probably be fair to say that I dont respond well to too much of authority... However, I do know right from wrong...         
	Youve been brought up on values...         
	Yeah... But you cant get sort of smothered and suffocated and then think why If something is not reasonable, then I might choose not to do it.         
	Your Australia debut was in 1998-99, but you didnt have a problem for the major part of your international career. Why suddenly?         
	Because of the change in the (teams) culture. Earlier, the restrictions were much less... It would be simpler then, but the attention began to grow more and more... Then, the demands on the free time began to grow, too... Endorsements, the formal appearances which are mandatory... In such a busy schedule, when youre away from home for eight to nine months in a year, it gets very tough.         
	Would you describe yourself as a rebel with a cause or a rebel without one?         
	(Laughs) Wow... Hopefully, I have a cause, for Im not the only one who feels it (the suffocation). Indeed, I do see myself as a rebel with a cause!         
	Is it true that, for a contract-related meeting with the then chief executive of Cricket Australia, you walked in bare feet?         
	Yeah, I did... It wasnt a meeting to negotiate, I just had to put my signature on the papers... I couldve gone in a three-piece suit, but I wouldnt have got a dollar more. In any case, Id just come off the beach.         
	Have you, in recent months, felt the urge to again play for Australia?         
	Dont know if there is an urge any more... When I look at the time I first played and the present times, I see a completely different environment... Im really enjoying just staying at home and playing in the IPL... After so many years, I enjoy being able to barbecue, absolutely enjoy being in my environment. Im not a person who eats, sleeps and drinks cricket... For me, life holds much more.         
	But you havent announced your retirement from international cricket (after 198 ODIs, 26 Tests and 14 T20s)...         
	Dont think theres any need to do that.         
	Is there a chance that the team culture, as you put it, may change and you could feel comfortable going back?         
	Dont think that would happen at all.         
	Who, then, is the loser?         
	I dont know... Im happy where Im at in my life (at 34)... Whether they are or not, I wouldnt know.         
	Do you follow Australias performances closely?         
	No, Im not a big cricket-watcher at all. I dont see much TV.         
	For a number of years, you were an ODI specialist. Did that label irritate you or did it actually motivate you to work harder for a Test cap?         
	At times, it was a bit frustrating. We had a huge number of batsmen available for the middle-order and there was no room for me... People say that if you score enough runs, you are good enough to be in the team, but I wasnt... I kept working and working at it and, then, people started to retire and things began to open up a little bit.         
	What would you pick as the turning point in your career?         
	(Grins) The 2003 World Cup... Thats when I realised I was good enough to play at a top level... I found a way to be successful.         
	Can you elaborate on that way?         
	It was about constructing an innings and helping the team win.         
	Did John Buchanan, the coach at that point in time, have an influence on you?         
	Yeah, he did... John challenged players individually... Challenged different players differently. The way he challenged Matthew Hayden was different to how he challenged somebody else... He challenged people personally which, at times, might not be right... But there were times it brought the best out of them... He was always a strategist, very calculating... Not that it worked every time, but players didnt realise his effort till after the event...         
	For an Australian cricketer, the Baggy Green is the ultimate... What were your emotions when you made your Test debut, in 2003-04?         
	I was very excited, very nervous. Allan Border gave me my cap, which was really nice and sort of settled me a bit, because Id played with Allan for Queensland and Id roomed with him when I was younger... After five-six years of ODIs, I was ready for Test cricket. Was hungry...         
	What are the qualities youd look for in an all-rounder?         
	An all-rounder has to work on three skills... It is physically demanding, so Id look for the resilient type... Id go for somebody who knows his body well.         
	The enjoyment bit...         
	Talking of myself, my attention span has always been very short, so Ive always wanted to be involved in whatever Im doing... I learnt how to bat, learnt how to bowl... And, when I wasnt doing either, Id be fielding... I wanted to be a good fielder and enjoyed fielding... That, in my case, made it easier to train... If you dont enjoy something, it becomes very hard... I wouldnt enjoy it if someone made me write an essay, but if I was asked to catch 200 cricket balls, I would gladly do it. (After a pause) Its the same with information... I retain information if it interests me, but if it doesnt, I forget it very quickly.         
	Who did you idolise?         
	Viv Richards... Loved the way he batted and the way he went about his cricket... Unbelievably skilful and talented.         
	Youre a natural for T20...         
	Another question that is hard for me to answer... But, yes, its the form that I really enjoy and it came around at the perfect time in my career... Its a short, fast and explosive game... Thats what I like.         
	Two years have passed since the Sydney incident involving you and Harbhajan Singh. Your thoughts?         
	There always has been and there always will be times when words are exchanged... The SCG issue, though, was handled poorly... I know what happened and the other Australian players involved know what happened... People can think what they like, but I know the truth... What disappointed me the most is that I approached him (Harbhajan) about it and, then, it happened again... Because it was handled poorly, it made people look bad. That, for me, was the most disappointing outcome.         
	The two of you have met in the IPL...         
	I wouldnt really mind if I dont see him... Surely, I wont jump out of the bus to shake his hand... Weve shaken hands after the matches, yes, but I havent spoken to him.         
	Do you follow other sport?         
	Yeah, Im passionate about rugby... I appreciate soccer, but I dont sit and watch it like I do rugby. Actually, a sport that Im definitely interested in is ice hockey.         
	The last one... Having been born in Birmingham, you couldve played for England... Has there ever been a regret that you played for Australia?         
	(Almost interrupting) Never...

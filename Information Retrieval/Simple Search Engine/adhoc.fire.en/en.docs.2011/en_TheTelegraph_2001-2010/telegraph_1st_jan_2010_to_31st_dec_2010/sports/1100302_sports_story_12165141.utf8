	New Delhi: For the second consecutive day, the favourites found the going tough in the Hero Honda World Cup when world champions Germany drew 2-2 with South Korea in a Pool A match at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium on Monday.         
	In the days last match, however, three-time champions the Netherlands were in roaring form as they thrashed Argentina 3-0. The star of the victory was their ace drag flicker Taeke Taekema, who scored the first hattrick of the tournament with three stunning penalty corner hits. He tried three different variations and all of them landed into the net. Taekema was the top scorer in the last World Cup in 2006.         
	While the Netherlands were all over their opponents, Germany, the reigning champions, aiming for a rare hattrick of titles, were distinctly lucky to troop out with the one point as the Asian Games gold medallists allowed them to make a comeback after taking a 2-0 lead at half time.         
	The Koreans must be ruing their luck as Sung Hoon Yoon missed a golden opportunity to clinch the match-winner seven minutes from close when he failed to hit from hand-shaking distance. Overall, the South Koreans were clearly the superior side and played the dominant role in the first half.         
	The Koreans played at a faster pace and struck twice in the first session through Hye Sung Hyun and Nam Young Lee. The second goal was a brilliant effort by Lee, who reverse-flicked from an extreme acute angle to leave the German goalkeeper stunned.         
	The holders were much better in the second half. After Florian Fuchs struck off a penalty corner in the 50th minute, Benjamin Wess made it 2-2 much to the relief of the German bench.         
	Playing the Koreans is always tough, said German captain Maximmillan Muller. We missed a lot of chances. That was the problem, he said.         
	In the days first match, New Zealand twice came back from behind to beat a fighting Canada 3-2.         
	The Black Sticks, who were trailing 1-2 at the breather, made a strong comeback in the second session to start their World Cup campaign on a winning note.         
	Indian-origin player Priyesh Bhana (11th minute), Nicholas Haig (47th) and veteran playmaker Ryan Archibald (67th) scored for New Zealand. For Canada, who were dominant till midway of the opening session, Mark Pearson (2nd minute) and Philip Wright (20th) found the target.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Saina Nehwal does a volte-face on CWG
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The organisers of the Commonwealth Games were left red faced on Saturday when Saina Nehwal said India was not ready to host the mega event.         
	However, Saina, one of the six brand ambassadors of the Games, quickly changed her statement after a while and said she was sorry for her utterance during a function at the Gopichand Badminton Academy in Hyderabad.         
	Saina, who spoke to newspersons, had everyone stunned when she said Delhi might not be ready for the Games in time.         
	Looking at the stadiums and progress I dont really think we are capable of holding such big tournaments, she said. I have seen many Games like Melbourne Commonwealth Games and Olympics in China. Compared to that, it is not up to the mark. But I am sure (that) before October 3, it will be ready and people will like it, said the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna winner.         
	Later, when contacted by The Telegraph, Saina said she was sorry for the statement.         
	I did not really mean it. All I wanted to say was that there may be some grey areas that could be corrected. It was not my intention to say that India wont be able to hold the Games, she said .         
	Saina said she wants to do well in front of the home crowd.         
	I am proud that the Games are being held in India. I am a little disappointed after making these comments. It was not right on my part to say it, as lots of people follow me, she said.         
	Saina also said India would win a lot of medals. The players are all preparing hard and have done well in major international events in the run-up to the Games.

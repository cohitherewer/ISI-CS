            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Rajasthan Royals have signed up Shane Warne and Shane Watson, retaining them as their marquee players ahead of the IPL-IV auction.         
	Yes, we have signed Warne and Watson, a Rajasthan Royals spokesperson told The Telegraph on Tuesday.         
	Asked about signing up the two Australian players despite a final verdict on their termination still pending, the spokesperson said: Why should we be worried? As far as we are concerned, a stay has been given (on the termination) and all our rights have been restored.         
	The Royals, last week, earned a stay on their termination for six weeks from the Bombay High Court.         
	The player auction has been slated for January 8-9, but is shrouded in uncertainty due to the ongoing legal battle between the BCCI and the two terminated franchises (Royals and Kings XI Punjab).         
	The contracts of the Aussie duo are for two years with an option to extend it for another year.

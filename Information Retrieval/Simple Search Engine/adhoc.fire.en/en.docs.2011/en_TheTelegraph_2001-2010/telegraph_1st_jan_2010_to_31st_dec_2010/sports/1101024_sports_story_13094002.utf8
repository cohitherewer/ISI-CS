	Yeongam: Sebastian Vettel seized pole position for the inaugural South Korean Grand Prix, on Saturday, forcing Red Bull team mate and Formula One championship leader Mark Webber to settle for second best.         
	Ferraris Fernando Alonso and McLarens Lewis Hamilton will line up together on the second row of the grid in third and fourth places, respectively, for what could be a wet race on Sunday.         
	McLarens world champion Jenson Button, the fifth title contender who is 31 points adrift of Webber, qualified only seventh after struggling to get heat in his tyres on the slippery surface.         
	With so little running yesterday (Friday) and this morning, it was a pretty good achievement, said Vettel of his ninth pole of the season.         
	Earning points will be a difficult task for Force India drivers as Adrian Sutil and Tonio Liuzzi will start 14th and 17th, respectively, on the grid.         
	Sutil manged to sneak into Q2 but Liuzzi settled for his position in first qualifying. The Italian had finished 18th but moved up a place following a five place penalty on Renaults Vitaly Petrov.         
	Sutil was 15th in the first qualifying but could not get into the Qualifying 3 and settled for the 14th position.         
	Although P14 isnt exactly what we would have hoped for, we were still quite close to the top 12 and with a bit of luck could have been even closer to Q3. In Q2 I had some traffic on my first lap and then my second was good, but it was tough out there with the tyres, Sutil said.         
	We suffered with a lot of graining on the soft tyres today. We missed out on the last run in the morning because of a puncture and didnt try the option tyres, but we didnt expect them to grain as badly as they did, he said.         
	Meanwhile, Webber is 14 points clear of double world champion Alonso and Vettel, with two races remaining after Yeongam. Hamilton is a further 14 points adrift.

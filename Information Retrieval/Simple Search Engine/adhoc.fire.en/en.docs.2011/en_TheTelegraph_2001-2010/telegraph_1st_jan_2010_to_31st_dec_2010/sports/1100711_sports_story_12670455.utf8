            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: West Indies spinner Sulieman Benn has been suspended for barging into the South African dressing room and entering into a verbal altercation with the players during the lunch break of the third Test match in Barbados last month.         
	Match referee Jeff Crowe ordered the imposition of two suspension points, which amounts to a ban of one Test match or two ODIs or two T20Is, whichever comes first.

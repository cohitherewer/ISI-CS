The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Important to adapt quickly: Saba Karim
                                                                                                                       7                                      Important to adapt quickly: Saba Karim
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: It was his elder son Anirban who gave Prasanta Saha one of the best news of his life  Wriddhiman was in the playing XI against South Africa in Nagpur.         
	Papali (Wriddhimans nickname) called up yesterday night to inform us that he wasnt in the XI. I just told him that he should still be ready in case he gets a chance. In the morning just before the start, my elder son Anirban, who works in Delhi, was surfing the Internet and saw a news that had Aakash Chopra (former India opener) wishing good luck to Wriddhiman. He immediately told us to switch on the television. For us, its one of the happiest days of our lives, Wriddhimans father told The Telegraph from his Siliguri residence.         
	His childhood coach Jayanta Bhowmick was ecstatic: The best part about him is that he is ready to learn. Since childhood, he has been very disciplined and obedient.         
	The following are the reactions of Wriddhimans teammates and former stars (alphabetically).         
	Deep Dasgupta: I find a lot of me in Wriddhiman. Even my Test debut was against South Africa in 2001 in Bloemfontein. On that day, Sourav Ganguly told me just before the toss that Sameer Dighe (first wicket-keeper) was suffering from back spasms. I am very happy that Wriddhiman made his Test debut in this fashion. Had he been told two days earlier, he would have been under more pressure Here he straight got into action. I only hope that he bats at No.7, as that is his batting number.         
	Syed Saba Karim: I wish him all the luck not only for this match but also for matches to come. Whatever I have seen of him, he comes across as a good keeper. But here, it will be a test of his batting skills. Its about how quickly an individual adapts to the situation.         
	Arun Lal: Its terrific for Bengal cricket. I hope he does well. But remember that since he is not keeping wickets for India, he will be under too much pressure to perform. Its not right to pick him as a specialist batsman for India.         
	Laxmi Ratan Shukla: He deserves this opportunity. He is a hardworking boy. What makes him a cut above the rest is his temperament.

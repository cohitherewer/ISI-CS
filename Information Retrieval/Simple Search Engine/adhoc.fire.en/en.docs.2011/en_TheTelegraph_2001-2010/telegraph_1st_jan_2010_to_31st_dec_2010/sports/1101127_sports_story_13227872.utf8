	Guangzhou: India created history by recording their best-ever performance in Asian Games with 64 medals, including a record 14 gold, with star boxer Vijender Singh providing the icing on the cake by bringing the last yellow metal on the penultimate day, here, on Friday.         
	The mens and womens kabaddi teams, expectedly, maintained their supremacy by clinching the gold before the womens 4x400m quartet bagged a yellow metal on the most productive day for India in the mega-event.         
	With the addition of 11 more medals, Indias tally climbed to a record 14 gold, 17 silver and 33 bronze (total 64), the biggest ever haul in the Asian Games, so far, to jump to the sixth place.                 
	Indias best medal haul till date was recorded in the 1982 Games in Delhi when they had won 13 gold, 19 silver and 25 bronze for an overall tally of 57. India had finished 10 in the last edition of the Games in Doha with a tally of 10-17-26.         
	India have now completed their engagements in the Games and their final standing will depend after the completion of the six events  mens and womens marathon, mens and womens doubles sepaktakraw finals and womens volleyball final  on Saturday.         
	China leads the medal table with 197 gold, 117 silver and 98 bronze (total 412), followed by South Korea (74-63-91) and Japan (47-73-94) at second and third, respectively.         
	While the kabaddi teams did not sweat much to keep their reputation intact in rather lopsided finals, Vijender made amends for his bronze-finish in Commonwealth Games with a gold, while compatriots Santosh Kumar (64) and Manpreet Singh (91kg) settled for a silver each.         
	The womens 4x400m relay team also lived up to the expectations as they defended the gold they won in the 2006 Doha Asian Games.         
	The 4x400m relay team of Manjeet Kaur, Sini Jose, AC Ashwini and Mandeep Kaur ended the campaign by clinching gold in 3 minutes 29.02secs. Kazakhstan took the silver in 3:30.03 while China claimed the bronze in 3:30.89.         
	Long distance runners Preeja Sreedharan, who had earlier won a gold in womens 10,000m race, and Kavita Raut had their moment of glory by winning the silver and bronze medals, respectively, in the womens 5000m event.                     
	Rollersports fetched India a couple of unexpected bronze medals with Anup Kumar Yama bagging one in mens single free skating before combining with Avani Panchal to finish third in the pairs skating event.         
	The Indian mens chess team also contributed a bronze.         
	The mens kabaddi team maintained their impeccable track record by winning the gold medal for the sixth time on the trot, demolishing Iran with a facile 37-20 margin what turned out to be a lop-sided contest.         
	The Indians beat Thailand 28-14 in a dominating performance to clinch the inaugural womens kabaddi gold of the Asian Games.         
	It was sweet revenge for Olympic and World Championship bronze-medallist Vijender when he blanked reigning world champion Abbos Atoev of Uzbekistan 7-0.         
	Atoev had beaten the 25-year-old Indian at the World Championship semi-finals last year but Vijender wiped off the disappointment with a performance fitting the hype around him.         
	However, V Santhosh Kumar (64kg) and Manpreet Singh (91kg) settled for silver medals after losing in the finals.         
	While Santhosh lost 1-16 to Kazakhstans Daniyar Yeleussinov in finals, Manpreet went down 1-8 to Mohammad Ghossoun of Syria to take Indias silver tally to three in boxing after Dinesh Kumar (81kg) had finished second, on Thursday.         
	Preeja, however, could only get a silver in the womens 5000m despite making a great effort to catch Bahrains eventual gold winner Mimi Belete, while compatriot Kavita Raut got the bronze as India won one gold, a silver and a bronze.         
	Preeja and Kavita clocked their personal bests of 15:15.89 and 15:16.54 while Belete had a timing of 15:15.59.         
	Indian mens chess team of P Harikrishna, Sasikiran Krishnan, Surya Shekar Ganguly and B Adhiban contributed a bronze with a 3.0-0.5 victory over Iran the ninth and final round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Retention remains a bone of contention
                                                                                                                       7                                      Retention remains a bone of contention
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: As the IPL governing council meet once more here on Sunday to try and decide on the format for the 2011 season, the growing feeling is that it had bitten more than it can chew by adding two teams to the fold this year.         
	There are two primary issues that need to be sorted out. First, the number of matches that is bound to go up with two more teams being added in this home and away format. If one goes by current format, 94 matches will be played in a span of 60 days.         
	Secondly, the player retention ahead of the fresh auction that is to be held later this year.         
	The governing council had failed to take any decision regarding these two issues in their previous meetings. The official version from BCCI brass on the meeting, held on August 20, was only to discuss about matters related to accounts.         
	On the other hand, the franchises seem to have little or no idea about how the IPL intends to resolve the issue of the number of matches as well as player retention..         
	We are waiting to hear from the governing council. At the time of adding the two teams, we were told that the same format would continue and we (franchises) agreed. Now we dont know what the alternate proposal is, nothing has been placed in front of us, a franchise source said.         
	With regard to retention of players, again, there seems to be little headway made. The Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians, who have the two marquee names in Indian cricket, want a minimum of players to be retained while the rest, particularly the two new ones, want all the players to be put on auction.         
	Its impossible to imagine Sachin Tendulkar playing for a team other than Mumbai Indians. Similarly, (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni has been with Chennai (Super Kings) for three years now and an identity has been developed, another franchise source said.         
	There might be a different view on that, but what is clear is that time is running out for the council and they have to make some hard decisions.

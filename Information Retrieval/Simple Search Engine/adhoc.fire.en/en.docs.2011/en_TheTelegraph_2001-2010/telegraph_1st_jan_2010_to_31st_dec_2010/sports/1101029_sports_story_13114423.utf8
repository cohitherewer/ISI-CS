	Ranchi: Even though bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan have dried up post 26/11 Mumbai terror attack in 2008, Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik on Thursday said he always enjoyed playing in India.         
	I enjoy playing in India in front of packed crowd, Malik said at the inauguration of a state-of-the art tennis academy, set up by the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) here.         
	The tennis academy was inaugurated by the state chief minister Arjun Munda. Sania Mirza, who was accompanying her husband Shoaib, was the star attraction.         
	Shoaib, who was not considered in the Pakistan squad for the ongoing limited overs series against South Africa in UAE, further said that there is hardly any difference between the two neighbouring nations.         
	The language of both the countries is same and so is the cuisine. There is no difference, the former Pakistan skipper said, adding that he never feels being in another country when he is in India. Responding to Maliks comments, deputy chief minister Sudesh Mahto described the cricketer as our countrys son-in-law.         
	Meanwhile, JSCA president Amitabh Choudhary promised the world class cricket stadium, which is now under construction, will be completed by 2011. (PTI)

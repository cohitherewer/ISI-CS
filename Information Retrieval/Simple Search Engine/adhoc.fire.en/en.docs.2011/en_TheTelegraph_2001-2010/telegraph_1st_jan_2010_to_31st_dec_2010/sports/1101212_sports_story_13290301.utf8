	Calcutta: Punjab Sports thrashed CESC 4-0 to cruise into the semi-finals of the Coal India 115th Beighton Cup hockey tournament at the SAI complex, here, on Saturday.         
	In another match, star-studded Air India blanked Western Railway 2-0 to pick their maiden win of the tournament and remain in line of a last-four contention. Gagandeep Singh (49th, 65th) and Munish Rana (66th, 69th) struck a brace each to help Punjab Sprots rout CESC in their group A quarter final league match.         
	Punjab Sports now lead group A ahead of defending champions Indian Oil by virtue of goal difference, as both the teams have already booked last four berths.         
	Air India and South Central Railway, who drew on Friday, now have four points each with the latter ahead in group B standing on goal difference.         
	The semi-finalists from group B will be identified after Sundays league matches of Air India v Karnataka XI (three points) and South Central Railway v Western Railway.

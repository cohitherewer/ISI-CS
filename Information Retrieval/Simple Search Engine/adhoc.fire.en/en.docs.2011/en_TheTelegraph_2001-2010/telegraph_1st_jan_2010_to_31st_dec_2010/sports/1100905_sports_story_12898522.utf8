The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak Board threatens to sue ICC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pak Board threatens to sue ICC
                      
	London/Karachi: Miffed with the suspension of the three Pakistani cricketers implicated in the spot-fixing scandal, the PCB Saturday threatened to sue the ICC if the players are found innocent even as the countrys diplomats struck a discordant note with contradictory statements on the matter.         
	A day after Test captain Salman Butt and pacers Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer were suspended by the ICC and questioned by the Scotland Yard, PCBs legal advisor Tafazzul Rizvi said that if the trio are found innocent, the PCB would consider taking legal action against the ICC.         
	I want to make it clear that the PCB will consider legal action against the ICC and other bodies if our players are found innocent because we feel the ICC has bypassed some of its own procedures in suspending the players in this case, Rizvi said.         
	He also emphasised that at the moment there was no criminal investigation going on against the three players, who were released without charge by the Scotland Yard after questioning in London.         
	It is just a preliminary inquiry and nothing more. They are being questioned. No investigations have been held, he added.         
	Even as the controversy raged on, Pakistans response appeared contradictory with its high commissioner in Britain Wajid Shamsul Hasan continuing to attack the ICC for suspending the trio but the countrys envoy to the United Nations Abdullah Haroon asking for punishment for those found guilty in the scandal.

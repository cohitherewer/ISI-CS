The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Agassi probe dropped
                                                                                                                       7                                        Agassi probe dropped
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Andre Agassi                           
	Tennis officials have closed the book on Andre Agassis drug revelations.         
	International Tennis Federation president Francesco Ricci Bitti revealed on Wednesday that despite appeals from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), the statute of limitations in the case expired long ago and no retroactive punishment was possible.         
	In Agassis recently published autobiography Open he wrote that he ingested crystal meth in 1997 and then lied to the ATP to avoid a suspension after failing a doping test.         
	The ATP is the only entity that could have shed light on what happened, but its too late, Bitti said. Wada asked information from the ATP without much success. As a member of Wadas executive committee, Im obviously very disappointed that Agassi  such a great and emblematic player  decided to make these revelations.         
	Im sure he had his reasons, which were not easy to understand. ... There were a lot of strange reasons involved. From a sports point of view, its very unfortunate. I think what he did hurt our sport.         
	In another drug issue, Bitti expressed concern over the appeals launched by Belgian players Yanina Wickmayer and Xavier Malisse, who were given one-year bans for violating Wadas whereabouts rule.         
	The suspensions were lifted in December after the players appealed to a Belgian court, and both still have appeals pending with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Wickmayer has also taken her case to the European Commission and the European Court for Human Rights.         
	Its a very important case because it could have consequences resulting in the revision of the Wada code, said Bitti, who is also an International Olympic Committee (IOC) member.

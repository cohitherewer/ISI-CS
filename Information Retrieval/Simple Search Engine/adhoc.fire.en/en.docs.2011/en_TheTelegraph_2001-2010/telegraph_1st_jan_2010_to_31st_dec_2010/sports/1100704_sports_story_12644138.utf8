                                                                                                                       7                                      Samba turns sombre
                      
	Rio de Janeiro: Tears rolled down Paulo Gamas face and his girlfriend sobbed in his arms as he stared in disbelief at the video screen on Copacabana beach.         
	The final whistle had signaled that Brazil  colossus of the football world and favourites to win the World Cup  was eliminated from the tournament in a 2-1 loss to the Netherlands.         
	Across the famous beach, heads bowed and many of the 20,000 people there crumpled to the white sand. Grandfathers holding babies cried. Brazils colours of canary yellow and green streaked down faces painted with the national flag. Children looked up to their mothers at the grief around them.

	Its over. Its over. I cannot believe that it is over, said Luciano Barreto, using the Brazil jersey in his hand to wipe his face.         
	Earlier, when Brazil took a 1-0 lead and looked like they were cruising toward an easy victory, that same shirt was proudly waved in the air with the certainty of a win. (Agencies)

	Budapest: Germanys Sebastian Vettel stormed to his fourth successive pole position on Saturday in a Red Bull sweep of the Hungarian Grand Prix front row with Australian Mark Webber.         
	Vettels seventh pole of the season was also Red Bulls 11th in 12 races and they looked utterly dominant at the twisty Hungaroring, a slow circuit where overtaking is difficult and grid position crucial.         
	The gap between the 23-year-old and Webber was a cavernous 0.419 seconds and the Australian could only congratulate his teammate, who bizarrely described the tricky circuit as like a woman alongside you that doesnt behave well.         
	Ferrari filled the second row, with Fernando Alonso lining up alongside Brazilian Felipe Massa  qualifying without incident after suffering life-threatening head injuries at the track a year ago.         
	McLarens championship leader Lewis Hamilton qualified in fifth place while world champion teammate Jenson Button, second overall and 14 points behind his fellow-Briton, qualified a disappointing 11th.         
	Force Indias Adrian Sutil will start at the 13th position on the grid, just ahead of Michael Schumacher, while Vitantonio Liuzzi will begin at 16th as they both failed to qualify for Q3.         
	Sutil, who just managed to sneak into Q2 by clocking 1:22.080 in Q1, improved his timing to 1:21.517.(Agencies)

	London: Arsenals faint hopes of winning the Premier League title were finally killed off when Wigan Athletic scored three goals in the last 10 minutes to snatch a dramatic 3-2 victory on Sunday.         
	Arsenal, lifted by Chelseas defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, looked to be coasting to victory through goals by Theo Walcott and Mikael Silvestre either side of halftime.         
	But Ben Watson, Titus Bramble and Charles NZogbia struck in quick succession to turn the match on its head and give Wigan their first league victory over Arsene Wengers side.         
	It is the most disappointing defeat of the season and the way we conceded, it was also the most disappointing, Wenger said. It is difficult to understand and accept, perhaps the players felt too comfortable but in football you must stay focused for 90 minutes and we were punished. We made mistakes and they took advantage, they were sharper in the final part of the game.         
	Wigan had already beaten Chelsea and Liverpool at home this season but captain Mario Melchiot said it was the sides biggest victory of the campaign.         
	In the days other match Aston Villa won 2-1 at relegated FA Cup finalists Portsmouth and leapfrogged Liverpool into sixth place, at least until Liverpool play West Ham United on Monday.

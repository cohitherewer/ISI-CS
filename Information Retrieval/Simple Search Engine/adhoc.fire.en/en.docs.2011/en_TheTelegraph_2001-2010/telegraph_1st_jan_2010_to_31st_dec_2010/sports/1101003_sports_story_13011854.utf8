The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dengue hits Delhi Games
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dengue hits Delhi Games
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The first case of dengue was reported at the Commonwealth Games Village here on Saturday, when a lawn bowls player was diagnosed with the mosquito-borne viral disease.         
	According to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) sources, the athlete  Ruptu Gogoi  was shifted from the Games Village to a private hospital in the capital early on Saturday morning. He was suffering from high fever and was later diagnosed with dengue.         
	Gogoi was vomiting for the past few days and he even complained of weakness. Seeing his condition deteriorate, it was decided to shift him to a private hospital.         
	Gogoi was running high fever. Initially, blood tests at the Village clinic did not reveal anything. But later, tests confirmed that he was suffering from dengue, the source said.         
	But a proper diagnosis now has put Gogoi on path to recovery. The boy is much better now. Hopefully, he should be back in the Village in a couple of days. The doctors are sure that the boy contacted dengue before he checked into the village, the source added.         
	The state government has been working hard to eradicate the disease from the capital. The health department has been spraying insecticides all over the Village after several Indian athletes complained of mosquito menace.         
	India will be participating in the lawn bowls event of the Commonwealth Game for the first time. Coached by Australian Richard Gayle, they won the Asian championships in Shenzen last year.         
	Meanwhile, in a strong warning to Indian athletes, who tested positive recently but whose suspensions have been temporarily lifted, the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) said they would be stripped off their CWG medals if the decision is reversed subsequently.         
	Addressing a press conference a day ahead of the Commonwealth Games launch here, Wada general secretary David Howman said the agency was monitoring the case of a dozen Indian athletes who recently tested positive for methylhexaneamine.         
	The case is going on in the National Anti Doping Agency (Nada) panel (next hearing on October 21), so Wada cannot interfere now. Our job is to monitor that any dope-related matter is dealt with under the Wada code. So, as any other case, we will see that the hearing goes on according to rules, he said.         
	Wada would appeal as usual if it feels that the Nada disciplinary panel, which is hearing the matter, was not following the Wada code, Howman said.         
	Twelve Indian athletes, including seven in the original CWG squad, tested positive for the banned stimulant in Nada tests conducted in August.

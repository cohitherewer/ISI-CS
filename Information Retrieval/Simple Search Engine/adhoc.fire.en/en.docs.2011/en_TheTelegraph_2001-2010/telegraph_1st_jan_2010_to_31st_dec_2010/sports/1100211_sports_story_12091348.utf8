The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal hit a new low, succumb to Tripura
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal hit a new low, succumb to Tripura
  - Vijay Hazare Trophy
  -   I dont want to point fingers at anyone: Shukla         A STAFF REPORTER            Sayans 31 runs and three wickets went in vain                                 
	Calcutta: A batting debacle saw favourites Bengal suffer an ignominious two-wicket defeat against Tripura in the opening encounter of the Vijay Hazare Trophy (East Zone leg) at the Ravenshaw College ground in Cuttack on Wednesday.         
	Bengal thus achieved the dubious distinction of losing to Tripura for the first time at the senior level in any format. Put in to bat, an inept show by the top and middle-order saw Bengal score only 162 in 41.3 overs.         
	Complete lack of application from the batsmen saw them being dismissed with 51 legitimate deliveries still to be bowled. Tripura reached the target in 48.2 overs.         
	The Bengal bowlers gave away as many as 23 runs in extras, including 13 wides and seven no-balls. Ashok Dinda alone bowled four wides and three no-balls, giving the opponents an extra over.         
	Only three batsmen  Sreevats Goswami (36), Manoj Tiwary (25) and Sayan Sekhar Mondal (31) were able to notch up 20-plus scores.         
	In reply, Tripura won with 10 balls to spare and two wickets in hand. Their opening pair of Kaushik Aphele (29) and Wilkin Mota (34) paved the way with a 65-run stand.         
	But skipper Shukla (2/25) and Mondal (3/25) ensured Bengal clawed their way back into the match in the middle overs, reducing Tripura to 93 for five.         
	However, Shuklas counterpart Rajib Datta (25) and Timir Chanda (21) added 43 valuable runs for the sixth wicket to steady the ship. With very little to defend, it was Tushar Saha (19) who struck two boundaries to seal the issue.         
	Earlier, Bengal paid the price for lack of experience in the middle-order. The two debutants, Sudip Chatterjee (7) and Arnab Nandi (7), did not do much.         
	The fact that Arnab, a top-order batsman who has been included as an off-spinning all-rounder, bowled only 2.2 overs, shows the selectors error of judgement.         
	A disappointed Shukla expected that his team will make a strong comeback against Jharkhand on Friday.         
	The match was played on a green top. Maybe we would have done better had we fielded first. But thats not an excuse for losing a match like this.         
	Our opening pair (Subhamoy Das and Sreevats Goswami) started well, adding 25 for the first wicket, but suddenly a couple of run-outs took the momentum away from us. I dont want to point fingers at anyone. It is our collective responsibility to make a strong comeback, he told The Telegraph over phone from Cuttack.         
	The Bengal squad will be bolstered by the presence of Sourav Ganguly and Wriddhiman Saha (back from national duty) in their next match.

            A STAFF REPORTER                                
	Calcutta: India coach Gary Kirsten was all praise for his bowlers, especially Harbhajan Singh, for the manner in which India clawed back into the match on the first day of the second Test against South Africa, at the Eden. At the post-match news conference, he reasoned that the off-spinner had bowled well in the first Test too.               
	The following are excerpts               
	A fascinating day of cricket         
	It was definitely an interesting day of Test cricket. We didnt start off well, but seven wickets in the final session brought us right back into the match.         
	On how things changed in one session         
	It can happen in cricket It happened with us Nagpur. We had a good partnership going in the first innings (between Virender Sehwag and S Badrinath) and suddenly we lost wickets in a heap. Same thing happened today (Sunday) also. They (Hashim Amla and Alviro Peterson) were having a very good partnership and then Harbhajan came in and bowled superbly.         
	If reverse swing was a factor         
	The ball was doing a bit However, the bowlers took a few wickets and that created pressure on them. It was about doing creative things which, in turn, would give us success. There were times we felt that we could have played a third seamer, but that would have affected the balance of the side. Using a fifth specialist bowler means that we will have a batsman less.         
	Ishant Sharmas spell before tea         
	All the bowlers did well and so did Ishant. We just have a feeling that he is on the edge of doing something great. It was a nice aggressive spell from him. He consistently bowled in the range of 140 kmph. That actually set the tone for us.         
	On South Africas batting         
	I think we allowed them to play aggressively. We bowled some bad balls and South African batsmen are quite capable of punishing those deliveries. They will obviously be hit for fours. The outfield is very fast and their initial run-rate was a reflection of the fast outfield.         
	Harbhajans impressive spell         
	Harbhajan bowled very well in Nagpur as well... One should try and look at the way hes bowling, rather than look at the end result... He bowled very well, but the South Africans also played him very well... His rhythm has got better and we do know hes a strike bowler         
	Zaheer Khans consistency         
	Zaheer is a bowler who takes enormous workload. He is the leader of the bowlers. And, he has delivered consistently. This is the fourth Test on the trot that he has bowled really well. Its because of bowlers like him and Harbhajan that we back ourselves of taking 20 wickets in a Test match.         
	The wicket         
	Looks like a good wicket. However, there isnt much turn for the spinners, though there is good carry. But there still a long way to go in this Test match. Also, there was much less grass today than what we saw yesterday (Saturday).

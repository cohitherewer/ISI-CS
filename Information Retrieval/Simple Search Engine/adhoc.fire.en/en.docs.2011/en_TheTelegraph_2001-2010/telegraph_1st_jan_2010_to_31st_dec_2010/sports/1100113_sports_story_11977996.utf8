The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gill urges players to rejoin camp
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gill urges players to rejoin camp
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: A few hours after the talks between the striking players and Hockey India broke down in Pune, several other agencies, including the sports ministry, stepped in to resolve the crisis.         
	Late in the evening on Tuesday, sports minister M.S. Gill issued a statement urging the players to return to the camp while a private cement company promised to shell out Rs 1 crore towards the payment for the players.         
	A London-based Indian doctor, too, has expressed willingness to pay Rs 10 lakh to Hockey India (HI) to meet the demands of the players.         
	Gill said: I wish to appeal to the players to immediately join training and continue with full heart till the tournament (World Cup) and focus to win it.         
	After the tournament, the ministry of sports will be in dialogue with a newly-elected HI management to find satisfactory solutions to all issues raised by the players, the minister promised.         
	Sahara India, the sponsors of HI, and the Sports Authority of India (SAI) are also perturbed by the development and are keeping a close eye on the situation.         
	The sponsor, however, has no plan at the moment to meet the players as suggested by some of the campers in Pune.         
	Its a huge loss of money, said a SAI official. We have been paying the coaches salaries and taking care of all the arrangements at the camp. What is the point of doing all this if the players do not practice, he said.

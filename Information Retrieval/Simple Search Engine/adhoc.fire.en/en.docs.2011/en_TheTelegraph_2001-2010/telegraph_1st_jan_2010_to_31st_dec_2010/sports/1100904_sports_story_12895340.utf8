	London: The Delhi Commonwealth Games continue to be dogged by star pullouts with 800m world record holder Kenyan David Rudisha and double European long distance champion Mohammed Farah of Britain becoming the latest to withdraw from the October 3 to 14 event.         
	Both Rudisha and Farah say they are too tired to compete.         
	I started my season early and was in shape and I maintained it until September. I believe I need time to rest and focus on next year, said Rudisha, who broke the 13-year old world record twice in a week recently.         
	Farah said his body is also too tired to make the trip to India. My body is telling me it is time to take a break, said the 27-year-old, who won gold for Britain in the 5000 and 10,000m at the European Championships in Barcelona.

  - Chirag crestfallen after Chidi converts dubious penalty       A STAFF REPORTER            Jubilant Mohun Bagan players after retaining the CFL title, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: A 25-minute stoppage due to a power failure. A bloomer from referee Minangshu Bhattacharjee, followed by a few moments of madness from Chirag United players, who were just 25 minutes away from rewriting history.         
	That in a nutshell was all about Mohun Bagans contentious 1-0 victory over Chirag. It was green and maroon brigades 29 th CFL title and third on the trot. Edeh Chidi, who had an evening flight to catch, scored from the spot.         
	The win also ensured that the green-and-maroon brigade dont suffer the ignominy of ending season without a single trophy. The local league may not be high on the prirority list of the club but then something is better than nothing.         
	The title could have come in a better way and without the help of the referee. Subrata Bhattacharyas bravehearts deserve full credit for putting up a gutsy fight even with nine men for the last 25 minutes.         
	This was after Minangshu gave marching orders to Chirag skipper Denson Devadas and stopper Eduardo Chacon. The latter in fact was rightly shown the red card as he unnecessarily went on a rampage, jostling and slapping the referee after he awarded a penalty in favour of Bagan.         
	It happened in the 65th minute when Japanese medio Ryuji Sueoka sprinted down the middle and was closed down from both sides by central defenders Arnab Mondal and Eduardo. Eduardo effected timely tackle as Sueoka, sandwiched between the two fell inside the box. Minangshu, who didnt have a clear view, awarded penalty and all hell broke loose. Subratas boys played to a specific plan and save those three minutes when everything went haywire, they looked good. The former Bagan stopper started with Joshimar and Shankar Oraon upfront but then sensed the need to get his defensive organisation more compact, he introduced Jayanta Sen at the centre of the park replacing Oraon.         
	Ashim, who was till then playing from the deep joined Joshimar upfront. There was a conscious effort to let Bagan attack more and trying to hit them back on the break.         
	Chirag started losing concentration once the game restarted after the 25-minute power failure. The 25-minute stoppage helped Bagan as Chirag took some time to settle down. In the 63rd minute, Souvik Chakraborty scored from a melee after Chidi headed the ball down. Minangshu ruled it in favour of Chirag despite protests from the Nigerian.

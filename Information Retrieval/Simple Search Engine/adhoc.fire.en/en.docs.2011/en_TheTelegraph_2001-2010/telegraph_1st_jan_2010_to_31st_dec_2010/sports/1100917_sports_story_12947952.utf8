            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes, in Chennai, on Thursday. (PTI)                           
	Chennai: Leander Paes, who is playing his 21st season as a professional player, will be felicitated by the All India Tennis Association on Saturday, on the sidelines of the Davis Cup tie against Brazil here. The 37-year-old, who has 12 Grand Slam trophies to his name, spoke to The Telegraph.                     
	Q Journey over the last two decades as a professional tennis player         
	A It has been an amazing journey. I started as a ball boy in a Davis Cup match in 1986, and then I got selected into the junior Davis Cup team and then the seniors. After that was my first Davis Cup tie in a doubles match, then the transition from singles to doubles. I became the captain and then now am back as a player. It has all come a full circle.         
	Decision to choose tennis over football         
	It was my decision to choose tennis. A conscious decision. Tennis is an individual sport and it taught me to carry the workload. Its interesting because I thrive in the team atmosphere. But I worked hard for many, many years and it culminated in the Olympic medal.         
	On battles with epilepsy and other problems         
	It was very challenging. I am really blessed by the lord and I am very respectful of that.         
	The memorable moments         
	Winning the junior Wimbledon and US Open, the Atlanta bronze in 1996, the Grand Slam titles They were all big landmarks for me and each was special in its own way. The Olympic medal, for instance, taught me to put mind over matter. I worked hard for 16 years to get it and it was the result of lifelong perseverance of both my parents and me.         
	On Mahesh Bhupathi and Grand Slam wins         
	I have a lot of respect for what Mahesh and I have achieved together. I have played with many partners but my first Grand Slam title was with a fellow Indian. We have both grown over the years and learnt to respect each other. I cannot rate one title over the other because each Grand Slam is special in its own way. For instance, the Wimbledon mixed doubles crown with (Martina) Navratilova and the two Grand Slams last year with (Lukas) Dlouhy were all very special.         
	On his doubles partners...         
	I have had some fabulous partners  my first partner Sebastian Lareau, Mahesh with whom I had a fantastic season in 1999, Navratilova and (Martin) Damm. Damm never believed that he could win a Grand Slam. Then I told him, come, lets go and win it. We reached the Australian Open final (in 2006) and ran into Bryan brothers. But the same year, we won the US Open.         
	2012 Olympics in London...         
	Yes, I have set my targets and I definitely want to play.

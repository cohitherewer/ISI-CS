	Gros Islet: Australia knocked out hosts West Indies with a comprehensive six-wicket triumph in their final Super Eight match on Tuesday to set up a semi-final clash against Pakistan in the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean.         
	Set a paltry target of 105, Michael Clarkes men romped home with 3.4 overs to spare.         
	All-rounder Steven Smith picked up the Man of the Match award for starring with the ball, scalping three wickets for 20 runs in his four overs. David Warner (25) and Brad Haddin (42) then guided the team to the target after a few hiccups.         
	Opting to bat after winning the toss, the hosts were dealt an early blow when Dirk Nannes bowled in-form skipper Chris Gayle (4) off the innings second delivery.         
	The other opener Shivnarine Chanderpaul (24) did not outstay his captain for long, departing on a miscued shot off Mitchell Johnsons bowling that was caught by David Hussey. Chanderpaul struck four boundaries in his 18-ball cameo.         
	His departure triggered a collapse and the hosts were soon reduced to five for 60.         
	Ramnaresh Sarwan, top-scored with a 31-ball 26, and the paltriness of that distinction underlines West Indies showing in the match.         
	Sarwan hardly had any support from the others and as the wickets kept tumbling around him, he could not provide the kind of acceleration that the West Indies needed.         
	For Australia, David Hussey sparkled in the only over he bowled, picking up two wickets for three runs. Johnson finished with reasonably good figures of two for 22 in his four overs.         
	Australias chase got off to a flier courtesy Warner who was his usual destructive self. The opener smashed a 12-ball 25, studded with four fours and a six, before being caught at slip by Gayle off Jerome Taylor.         
	Shane Watson (5) departed in the very next over and Clarkes run out by Dawyne Bravo after a halting 24-ball 16 created some anxiety in the Australian camp.         
	But Haddin and David Hussey (10) ensured that things went smoothly for their team thereafter and safely saw them to 109 for four in 16.2 overs.           (PTI)

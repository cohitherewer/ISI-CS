The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Soniya hopes to win Indias first gold
                                                                                                                       7                                      Soniya hopes to win Indias first gold
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Indian weightlifting has recently been in the news for all the wrong reasons. From a host of top lifters caught doping and India being banned from international events to the sudden collapse of the false ceiling in the lifting hall on the eve of the Commonwealth Games  the woes have been way too many.         
	But, on Monday, the sport is likely to bring cheer for India as Soniya Chanu is hot favourite to win the first gold medal for the country during the 19th edition of the Games. The 48 kg lifter is in good form and is expected to carry on the good work that was started by Kunjarani Devi years ago.         
	One of the seven children of a poor farmer, Soniya (not related to Sanamacha Chanu) had to fight poverty to fulfil her goal of becoming a weightlifter. My dream will come true if I become the countrys first gold medal winner in the current Games, she said.         
	Indeed, Soniya will win the gold, said a confident chief coach, Harnam Singh. She is in fine form and has lifted around 180 kg in the training session. I dont think there is anyone in the field, who can challenge our girl. Indias hopes rest on Soniya as there is a general feeling that the country will surely bag the gold medal, even if she manages to lift 175 kg.         
	In total, India are hoping to win four golds, one more than what they bagged in the last Games at Melbourne. Other than Soniya, Swati Singh (53 kg), Renubala Chanu (58 kg) and Ravi Kumar (69 kg) are other strong contenders for the gold medals, while Sukhen Dey (56 kg) and Monika Devi (77 kg) have the outside chance of add to the golden tally.         
	India are considered a weightlifting powerhouse in the Commonwealth Games, having won 93 medals, including 33 golds since 1966, when India sent their first lifting team.         
	Only Australia with 145 medals and England with 105 are ahead of India in the number of medals won in this category, in the Commonwealth Games history.         
	Since 1990 to 2002, nearly half of Indias medals have come from weightlifting alone, as each category carried three gold medals then. The rule changed since 2006 in Melbourne where Indian lifters contributed nine medals  three gold, five silver and one bronze  to the countrys total of 49 (22 gold, 17 silver and 10 bronze).         
	Apart from medals, the sport has also brought shame for India in a host of international events including three editions of the Commonwealth Games. While Subroto Pal was first to be stripped of a medal in Auckland, four other Indian lifters suffered similar fate in 2002 and 2006.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Robin needs to realise potential, says Morgan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Robin needs to realise potential, says Morgan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Trevor Morgan was not quite dazed unlike others after Robin Singhs second goal on Sunday. The strikers effort, when he scored after a long run from the midfield, got a tepid response when Morgan said: Thats something that doesnt happen too often. But it was a good strike after a good run as well.         
	The Briton, who himself played as a centre-forward, made a sharp comment. I have said to him so many times that if you get the ball in the midfield, just pass it. And he got the ball and kept running and running and smashed a great shot into the corner of the net.         
	Morgan had praised Robin after East Bengal beat Mohun Bagan in their Calcutta Football League match last month. Even Sunday, he emphasised the need for Robin to understand his potential.         
	Just why and where his comment stemmed from is unfounded, but that Robin is yet to give his best was clear when Morgan said: Robins got potential, but its not good having the potential when you dont realise it. But we have to make sure that he realises it soon enough. I think for his size, Robin should probably be more aggressive when the ball is in the air.         
	AIFF XI coach Desmond Bulpin liked Robins effort, but felt the East Bengal striker has a long way to go. Robin has done well today and he has got the right coach with him. Hes still a boy and two goals (in I-League) dont make him a world champion.         
	AIFF XI had started well, but petered out in the second half. According to Morgan, the visitors had done their homework and refused to judge them in their first season. It was a very difficult first-half. They pressed us high up the pitch and we really couldnt get going. But once we got the first goal, the game became a bit open and we started creating chances. Certainly three of the goals were very high-class, Morgan said.

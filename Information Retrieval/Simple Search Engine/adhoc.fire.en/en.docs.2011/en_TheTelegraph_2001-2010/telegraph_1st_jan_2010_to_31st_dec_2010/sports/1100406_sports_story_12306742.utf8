The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Waugh for day-night Tests
                                                                                                                       7                                      Waugh for day-night Tests
                      
	New Delhi: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh has backed day-night Tests.         
	I would have loved to play day-night Test cricket, Waugh told a website. I think it is exciting, brings another dimension to the game. People want a bit of change, they want that excitement. Why not bring that into Test cricket? We have got it in Twenty20s. Lets get a pink ball in and play a day-night Test if it is possible.         
	Waugh said the concept needed to be thought through, however, since it wouldnt work everywhere. Obviously in England it is not really possible because it doesnt get dark till 10 clock in summer. Maybe in the subcontinent the dew might make it impossible. So youve got to have common sense around it as well.         
	Waugh sounded optimistic about the future of Test cricket.         
	Quality always survives, he said. As a cricketer I think youve got to be true to yourself. Why did you take up the game? To fulfil your potential, and you cant do that by playing Twenty20 because you cant bat for a whole day and you cant bowl 30 overs. And as a cricketer I think it wouldnt be that satisfying if I couldnt get out there and technically, mentally and physically challenge myself against the best players in the world over five days.         
	As a member of the MCCs World Cricket Committee, he said he had discussed some radical ideas to spruce up one-day cricket. We talked about the possibility of getting the seams a bit larger, even increasing the number of seams to eight.         
	The biggest change, Waugh said, between the time he played and the present was in the physiques of the players. In our days you looked at the gym, but you never went in there. These days the guys are big, its all about power and speed in Twenty20 cricket. They are hitting the ball long because they are much stronger.         
	Waugh said the present was the best time in the sports history to be a top-order batsman in Tests, since so many fast bowlers were breaking down and opting out of the format. Waugh said there are more instances of injuries today because diagnosis is available more easily.

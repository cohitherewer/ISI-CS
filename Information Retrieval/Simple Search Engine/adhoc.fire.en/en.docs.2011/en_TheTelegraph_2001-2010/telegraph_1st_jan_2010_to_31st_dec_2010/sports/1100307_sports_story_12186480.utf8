The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Butt denies taking any names
                                                                                                                       7                                      Butt denies taking any names
                      
	Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt has claimed that he was talking about former captain Salim Malik and fast bowler Ata-ur Rehman when he had, a few days ago, mentioned two national team members being involved in match-fixing.         
	Butts statement, made at a news conference, about the two players caused a furore as he gave the impression that he was talking about two current Pakistan cricketers.         
	Butt, however, told a hearing of the National Assembly standing committee on sports, on Saturday, that he had referred to Malik and Rehman when a question was put to him on the match-fixing issue.         
	I referred to these two players, who were already banned for life on the recommendation of the Justice Malik Qayyum committee 10 years ago, Butt said.           (PTI)

	London: Andrew Strauss delivered the perfect riposte to those questioning his place in Englands one-day team with a polished 126 to help his side to a four-wicket win over Pakistan in Leeds, on Sunday.         
	After Pakistan, hopeless in the Twenty20 internationals, had scored a testing 294 for eight, England were always close to their near six an over target as they moved 2-0 up in the five-match series.         
	Captain Strauss was the backbone and though it proved a nervous finale after the opener departed with 47 runs still needed, Michael Yardy and Tim Bresnan brought England home with three balls to spare.         
	Despite the defeat Pakistan will have been pleased with their display, not least in the field where they were much improved. They also produced one of their best batting displays of their long tour of England after winning the toss on a rare sunny morning in Leeds.         
	Kamran Akmal (74) and Mohammed Hafeez (43) built an opening stand of 122 in 23 overs with Akmal in particular punishing some loose England bowling with a slew of boundaries.         
	The assault was maintained by Mohammed Yousuf (46) and Asad Shafi, a late call-up for the tour who hit 50 from 57 balls, including one mighty straight six off spinner Graeme Swann, as England did not help their own cause with some poor fielding.         
	England set about the chase confidently and opener Steven Davis, who hit 87 in the first match of the series, started powerfully again with 26 off 21 balls before being caught behind off Shoaib Akhtar.

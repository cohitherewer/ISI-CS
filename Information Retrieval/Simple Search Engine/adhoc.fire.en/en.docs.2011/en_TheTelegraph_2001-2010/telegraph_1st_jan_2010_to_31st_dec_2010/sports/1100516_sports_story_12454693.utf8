The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shastris money is on Australia
                                                                                                                       7                                        Shastris money is on Australia
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Ravi Shastri                           
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): Ravi Shastris money, too, is on Australia.         
	England have been playing smart cricket, but Australias confidence is bound to be right at the top after the fantastic win over Pakistan, the former India captain told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Saturday morning, before leaving for Bridgetown, Shastri added: If I had to put my money on one team, it would be Australia... If a No.7 (Michael Hussey) can play the kind of innings seen yesterday, then that team has to be ahead of the rest.         
	Lauding Hussey, whose 24-ball unbeaten 60 turned the tables on Pakistan, Shastri said: He calculated his assault to a perfection and, at the end, was brilliant...         
	Australias captain Michael Clarke, meanwhile, gave England enough respect at a pre-final media conference in Bridgetown.         
	Englands bowlers may not have speed, but have the skills, Clarke pointed out. He then quipped that if his team got to bat first, hed love a total of 250. Should England get first strike, his target would be to bowl them out for 100.         
	Its highly unlikely, of course, that Sundays final is going to be one-sided.

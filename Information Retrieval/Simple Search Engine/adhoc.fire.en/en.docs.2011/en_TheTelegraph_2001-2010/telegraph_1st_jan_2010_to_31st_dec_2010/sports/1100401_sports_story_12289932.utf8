The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rooney is likely to be out for a month 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rooney is likely to be out for a month 
                      
	Manchester: Wayne Rooney flew back to England on Wednesday with his right foot in a protective boot and will reportedly miss between two and four weeks with a twisted ankle.         
	The sight of Rooney lying on the turf in pain led to fears the England striker might be out for several months and could even miss the World Cup.         
	England coach Fabio Capello said the injury was terrible news.         
	I think he will have a scan, Capello said. Im not happy when a player from the England team is injured, its terrible. Its not a good thing for me. I will speak to him.         
	Sky Sports News, quoting unnamed sources, said an initial examination in Germany indicated that Rooney had only a sprain and wouldnt be sidelined longer than a month.         
	Rooney is extremely doubtful for Saturdays Premier League match with Chelsea at Old Trafford. The result is likely to have a major effect on the title race, with United only a point ahead of Chelsea at the top of the standings.

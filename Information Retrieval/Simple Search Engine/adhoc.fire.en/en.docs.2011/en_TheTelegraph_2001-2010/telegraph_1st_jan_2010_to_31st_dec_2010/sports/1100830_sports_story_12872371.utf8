                                                                                                                       7                                      England win series
                      
	London: England crushed Pakistan by an innings and 225 runs to win the fourth and final Test, at Lords, Sunday, with more than a day to spare.         
	Victory, wrapped up before lunch on the fourth day, gave England a 3-1 series win. It is also their last series before they defend the Ashes, in Australia, in November.         
	Englands victory was marred by a betting allegation.         
	On the field, Pakistan collapsed for the second time in this match. Resuming on an overnight score of 41 for four, having been made to follow-on after being dismissed for 74 in their first innings, Pakistan were bowled out for 147.         
	They lost five wickets for 34 runs in 61 balls on Sunday before a last-wicket stand of 50 between Umar Akmal  whose 79 not out was the lone act of Pakistan batting resistance this match  and Asif briefly checked England.         
	England off-spinner Graeme Swann took three wickets for four runs in 15 balls on his way to final innings figures of five for 62 in 12 overs.         
	That gave Swann a match haul of nine for 74 after hed taken four for 12 in Pakistans first innings. Pakistan started the day still 331 runs adrift of Englands first innings 446 and batsmen Azhar Ali and Umar Akmal, both nought not out overnight, were booed by some spectators as they walked onto the field at the home of cricket.

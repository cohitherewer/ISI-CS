The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Team morale is high: Waqar
                                                                                                                       7                                      Team morale is high: Waqar
                      
	Dubai: Pakistans morale is up despite the chaos surrounding the team and the sudden departure of wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider to England, coach Waqar Younis said on Thursday.         
	Morale is pretty high. What happened in the last four, five months is not ideal, not what we want, but we are all professionals, he told a media conference in Dubai the day before the start of a two-Test series against South Africa.         
	If we deliver the goods tomorrow (Friday), we stand a good chance. Weve got a fairly good side, Younis said.         
	Pakistan captain Misbah ul-Haq said the team were looking forward to playing with new wicketkeeper Adnan Kamal.         
	I think thats the past now, he said, when asked about Haiders departure.         
	We have a new keeper here. He is also good and he has scored good runs in first-class cricket. He is a plus point and I hope he can perform well.         
	Meanwhile, the Pakistan selection committees decision to replace Haider with Adnan instead of more talented Sarfaraz Ahmed, has come as a huge surprise. Sources in the PCB claimed that since Sarfaraz was playing for the Pakistan A team in the West Indies, there were logistical issues in flying him in time to join the team in Dubai for the first Test.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A dramatic day for Yiu
                                                                                                                       7                                      A dramatic day for Yiu
                      
	Guangzhou: Hong Kong rider Wong Wan Yiu defined sporting bravery at the Asian Games, on Tuesday, after she grabbed a silver medal in the womens points race, despite sustaining a suspected broken arm. Two pile-ups marred the race.         
	While Chinas Liu Xin avoided the carnage to take gold, medical staff rushed to the aid of other riders.         
	Chinas swimmers clinch-ed five out of seven titles to leave their fans thrilled and Japans swimmers deflated with only two days left in the competition. China predictably swept the mens and womens table tennis titles, and have now amassed 77 gold medals. South Korea are second with 22 and Japan third with 15.         
	Despite coming to the Asian Games buoyant after their runner-up at the Commonwealth Games, India are languishing at the ninth spot, with a solitary gold medal in billiards.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We missed a lot of chances, says Morgan
                                                                                                                       7                                      We missed a lot of chances, says Morgan
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: East Bengals 1-0 victory over I-League debutants ONGC, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Saturday, may have lacked their usual finesse but coach Trevor Morgan refuses to believe that his team looked fatigued.         
	I dont think that we looked fatigued. Its true that we have been quite busy There was the Mohun Bagan match and then we had to play the Super Cup But I dont think that affected our performance, the British coach said after the match.         
	Asked why his team looked colourless, Morgan said: If you are trying hard and not getting the goals, frustration is bound to creep in. We missed a lot of chances. But in the last 15-odd minutes the boys showed what they can do. The way we played in those last minutes, we could have easily won by a bigger margin.         
	There were no special advice I have always said that it is important to keep things simple on the ground. Thats the key to perform well, he added.         
	Australian striker Tolgay Ozebe, who headed in the all-important goal of the match, took off his jersey while celebrating the goal. The unnecessary act earned him a yellow card. But the coach played it down saying that such things happen in the ecstasy of scoring a goal.         
	I know it was inviting an unnecessary card But when you score an important goal, a lot of things goes through your mind. That is the reason why at times one forgets some rules. Similar was the case with Tolgay today, Morgan said.

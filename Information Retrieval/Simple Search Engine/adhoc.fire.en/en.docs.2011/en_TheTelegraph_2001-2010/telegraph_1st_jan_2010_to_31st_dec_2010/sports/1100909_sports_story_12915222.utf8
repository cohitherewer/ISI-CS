            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta/Karachi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has denied having chargesheeted Salman Butt and Kamran Akmal.         
	An agency report had said that the duo were chargesheeted after getting unsatisfactory replies on the showcause notices served on them last month. A report in a Pakistani newspaper said that the two players were served the notices on August 21, the day Pakistan won the Oval Test against England.         
	This is not true Ive checked with the legal cell and can confirm that no such chargesheet was issued, ICC spokesman Colin Gibson told The Telegraph.         
	According to the report, the ICC was tipped off about the suspicious activities of the two players after the World Twenty20, in the West Indies, and the governing body also had some information on the conversations between them and the alleged bookie Mazhar Majeed.         
	The report said both Salman and Akmal were asked to reply to notice within 14 days, asking them to provide their mobile phone numbers which they used during the World T20.         
	After finding their replies unsatisfactory, the ICC sent chargesheets to the two players and were delivered at their personal addresses and not through the PCB.

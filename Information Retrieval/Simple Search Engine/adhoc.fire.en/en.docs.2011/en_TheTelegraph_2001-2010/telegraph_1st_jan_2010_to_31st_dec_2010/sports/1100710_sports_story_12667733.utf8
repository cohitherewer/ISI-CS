                                                                                                                       7                                      QUICK TAKES
                      
	Paul faces parakeet challenge  
	Singapore: Paul, the Octopus, is not the only creature predicting World Cup results. A parakeet, long tailed parrot, named Mani has also been forecasting match results.  
	Mani has become the talk of the town after predicting that the Netherlands will lift the trophy. The parrot, an assistant to a roadside astrologer, had earlier predicted Spain-Germany semi-final and all the quarter final ties.         
	Paul, however, has predicted a Spanish triumph. He has also predicted that Germany will win over Uruguay in Saturdays third place playoff.         
	Money for match         
	Johannesburg: South Africas airport management body says it will reimburse hundreds of fans who missed a World Cup semi-final because of congestion at Durban airport. Airports Company South Africa said Friday it has set aside $52,000 to be distributed to those affected. It said this was a gesture of goodwill and not admission of any liability.         
	Two robbed         
	Potchefstroom: Spain players Sergio Busquets and Pedro Rodriguez were robbed ahead of their World Cup semi-final win over Germany in Durban. Spanish media reported the players rooms were broken into ahead of their 0-1 victory on Wednesday, with Busquets losing documents and about $1,014. Pedro reportedly lost about $1,267 from his safe.         
	Antic angry         
	Belgrade: Serbia coach Radomir Antic has criticised Fifas decision to suspend and fine him. In a statement Friday Antic calls the punishment inappropriate and undeserved. Serbias football association said this week that Fifa handed Antic a four-match ban and fined him $13,000 over his alleged inappropriate behaviour after a World Cup match against Australia in South Africa.         
	Scribe no more         
	Johannesburg: Fifa president Sepp Blatter has paid tribute to Associated Press sports writer Robert Millward, who died Thursday while covering the World Cup. Millward, 58, collapsed and died in his Johannesburg hotel room, apparently of natural causes.         
	Ruud for Spain         
	Madrid: Ruud van Nistelrooy agrees with Spains status as the favourites in the World Cup final against the Dutch, saying the European champions style of football is out of reach. Van Nistelrooy said that no one moves the ball as well as the Spanish team.           AGENCIES

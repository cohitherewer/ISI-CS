	Port Elizabeth: South Korea will attempt to end a five-match winless streak against Uruguay when the teams meet Saturday in the round of 16 at the World Cup.         
	Uruguay are 4-1-0 against South Korea, including a 1-0 win in the 1990 World Cup when Daniel Fonseca scored in the 90th minute that put the South Americans into the round of 16.         
	We watched a few of Uruguays games, they have quality and they are strong and their performances were great in the group stages, South Korea midfielder Park Ji-sung said. We have to prepare well.         
	It is the second time South Korea have advanced to the knockout stage in eight World Cup appearances. The other time was in 2002 when they reached the semi-finals in the tournament they co-hosted with Japan.         
	Our goal was to reach the last 16, Park added. It really is fantastic to write a new chapter in the history of Korean football. We succeeded in doing this for the first time away from home.         
	In the first round, Uruguay won twice  3-0 over South Africa and 1-0 over Mexico  and played a scoreless draw with France. The win over Mexico clinched top spot in Group A.         
	The important thing is that we qualified in first place, Uruguay striker Diego Forlan said.         
	South Korea, the second-place finishers in Group B, beat Greece 2-0 in their first match, lost 4-1 to Argentina and drew 2-2 with Nigeria. Argentina beat Uruguay twice in South American qualifying.         
	Uruguay, the two-time World Cup champions, are bidding for their first quarter final berth since 1970.         
	Forlan, who got 32 goals two years ago for Atletico Madrid to win top European scoring honours, has scored twice at this World Cup. All of Uruguays goals have come since Edinson Cavani was inserted into the lineup as a third striker alongside Luis Suarez for the second match against South Africa.         
	We would like to offer more from an attacking point of view, Cavani said after his teams win over the host country.         
	We want to play in a faster, more intelligent style. Weve got a team that really opens up when going forward.         
	Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez wasnt totally happy with his teams play, despite progressing from group play for the first time since 1990.         
	We had bad moments, but also good moments, Tabarez said. It was a lack of experience.         
	Both teams were asked by Fifa not to train at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium ahead of the match. Heavy rain about 10 days ago forced Fifa to begin restricting team training at the stadium, where five matches have been played.         
	In Englands 1-0 victory Wednesday over Slovenia, large chunks of missing turf were noticeable in the penalty areas.         
	Before the match, England captain Stephen Gerrard said the pitch had some problems but he had certainly played on worse.         
	LIKELY TEAMS         
	Uruguay (4-4-2): 1-Fernando Muslera, 2-Diego Lugano, 3-Diego Godin, 4-Jorge Fucile, 16-Maximiliano Pereira, 15-Diego Perez, 17-Egidio Arevalo, 7-Edinson Cavani, 11-Alvaro Pereira, 9-Luis Suarez, 10-Diego Forlan.

	Referee: Wolfgang Stark (Germany)           (AGENCIES)

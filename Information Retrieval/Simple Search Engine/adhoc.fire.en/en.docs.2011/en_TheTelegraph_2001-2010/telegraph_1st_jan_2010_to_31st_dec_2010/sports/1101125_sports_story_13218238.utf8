The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bose scores in Md. Sp. victory
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bose scores in Md. Sp. victory
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting, it seems, have found their winning touch back. But their coach Tope Fuja will agree the trend is a little too late.         
	After their win against Mohammedan AC last Friday, the David Mkandawire-led side beat BNR 1-0 in their 13th CFL match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday. Mohammedan Sportings points tally is now up to 25 with eight wins and four losses. There wasnt much to look at both sides, barring veteran mid-fielder Satyajit Boses lone goal in the match.         
	Bose scored the winner four minutes before half-time. Shyam Mondal cleared Boses header off a Mumtaz Akhtar cross, but the mid-fielder thundered the ball into the rival net after it ricocheted of an attempted side volley by teammate Suroj Mondal.         
	It was the combination of Bose and Mondal again in the 49th minute that almost got Mohamedan Sporting the second. Bose set Mondal up with a measured pass from the left, but the latter shot it straight into BNR keeper Ganesh Singhs hands.         
	Teams         
	Mohammedan Sporting: Rakesh Prasad, Deb Kumar Sasmal, Suman Chandra Dey, Satyajit Bose (Kartick Kisku, 63), Dipendu Biswas (Din Din, 94), Suroj Mondal (Nilendra Dewan, 79), Lucky Imran, Mumtaz Akhtar, David Mkandawire, Sudip Das, Md. Adeola Hassan.         
	BNR: Ganesh Singh, Akhil Rajbanshi, Shyam Mondal, Bimal Sarkar, Krishanu Banerjee, Dhiman Sinha, Pratim Sarkar, L Zuala (Ashim Das, 46), Jagannath Sana (Ajay Saha, 71), Somenath Aich, Prince James, Ganesh Singh.         
	Referee: Prabir Dhar         
	MoM: Satyajit Bose

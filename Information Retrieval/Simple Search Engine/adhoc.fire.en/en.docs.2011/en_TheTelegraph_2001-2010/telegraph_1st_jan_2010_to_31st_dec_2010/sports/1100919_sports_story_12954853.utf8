                                  Mary Kom      
	Bridgetown: Indias woman boxer M.C.Mary Kom, on Saturday, claimed a historic fifth successive World Championship title, beating Steluta Duta of Romania 16-6 in the final here.         
	Mary Kom, who competed in the 48kg category, had defeated Alice Kate Aparri of Philippines 8-1 in the semi-final on Friday to assure herself of at least a silver in the sixth edition of the competition.         
	The Khel Ratna awardee from Manipur thus remained the only boxer to have won a medal in each edition of the World Championship.         
	Duta had defeated Kazakhstans Nazgul Boranbayeva 10-5 in the semi-final.         
	Earlier, in Fridays bout, Mary Kom was slow off the blocks and was in fact down 0-1 in the first round.         
	I did not attack much in the opening round. I was just observing her. I needed to be patient before going for all-out attack, she said.         
	Mary Kom had last faced Aparri way back in 2004 and had come out triumphant and she made sure that her all-win record against Filipino remained intact.         
	The Indian got her first point in the second round and went on the offensive in the third, landing five scoring blows. She added another couple of points in the final round, while denying Aparri any chance with her swift foot movement.         
	I wouldnt say it was a very easy bout but it was not too tough either. I covered up the points in the third round. I am confident about myself and that helps, Mary Kom said.         
	Talking about Duta, whom she had beaten twice in the finals of the World Championships (Delhi 2006 and Ningbo City, China 2008), Mary Kom said she never takes her opponents lightly.         
	I never take my opponents easy. On her day anybody can be dangerous.         
	I have beaten her twice before and that gives me a good feeling but I cant really say whether it would be easy or tough, Mary had said on Friday.         
	Mary Koms tremendous run notwithstanding, it has been a disappointing tournament for 2006 champions India.         
	A record 72 countries are participating in the current edition and the increased competition has affected Indias tally with just two medals assured this time.         
	The competition has increased but more importantly, how other countries have caught up with us.         
	Womens boxing is now an Olympic sport and we have to re-invent ourselves to remain competitive, conceded Indian Boxing Federation Secretary General Colonel P. K. Muralidharan Raja, who attended the event.         
	The coaching system has to be re-looked and the IBF will work out all this once the Championships is over, he added           (PTI)

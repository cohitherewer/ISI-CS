The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ashwin ready   to turn   on the heat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ashwin ready   to turn   on the heat
                                  
	Visakhapatnam: Seven years after he scored a double century here as an under-17 opener, Ravichandran Ashwin is back at his favourite venue, ADA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, this time to cement his place as an India off-spinner.         
	Ashwin had some remarkable performances in the recent past helping the Chennai Super Kings win the Champions League T20 with 13 wickets in six outings, the highest in the tournament.         
	But it was only after selectors decided to rest star off-spinner Harbhajan Singh for the three-match ODI series against Australia, that the Tamil Nadu youngster made the cut.         
	However, the opening match of the series was abandoned without a ball being bowled in Kochi, on Sunday. Heavy rain before the one-dayer spoiled the ground conditions. While the weather was clear at the scheduled start time, the clouds returned to force a cancellation.         
	The 24-year-old, speaking ahead of the second ODI, in Visakhapatnam, on Wednesday, said that its difficult to be a spinner in India.         
	Fast bowlers do have an edge. India are always in search of pacers and you get a break immediately after doing well, Ashwin said.         
	Asked whether its difficult to make the cut with Harbhajan around, Ashwin said: He has been a great servant for the Indian cricket. Its not about what they are, its about what you are and how you do... Its always a learning experience with them.

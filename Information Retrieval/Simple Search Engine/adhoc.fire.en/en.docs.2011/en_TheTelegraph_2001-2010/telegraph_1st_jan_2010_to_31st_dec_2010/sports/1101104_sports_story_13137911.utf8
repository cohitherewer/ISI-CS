The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Was keen to extend form, says Virat
                                                                                                                       7                                      Was keen to extend form, says Virat
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Delhis premier batsman Virat Kohli, who hit a fantastic 173 in the Ranji Trophy Group A Super League game, against Bengal, at the Kotla, has said he realises the importance of carrying form and confidence from one format of the game into another.         
	I scored a hundred against Australia in a one-day International recently and was keen to extend the form, he said. I realise that there could be times when batsmen hit a lean patch and therefore it is important to make good form count.         
	Kohli spoke of how he wanted to be positive despite the pitch not being conducive to stroke play at all.         
	It was critical for us to remember that we were chasing a Bengal first innings total of 473 and there was no point in getting bogged down because the track would not allow stroke play, he said. It was important to bat aggressively and get the runs.         
	Delhi coach Manoj Prabhakar gave the Bengal team much credit for not giving away easy runs to the home batsmen.         
	The (Bengal) faster bowlers stuck to a steady line and bowler to the field. The fielders backed them up by saving at least 20 runs, he said.         
	Bengal fast-medium pacer Ashok Dinda, who picked up three wickets, said the team was determined not to let either Kohlis class or the dropped catch affect its morale. We knew that we had to choke the flow of runs by bowling a good line and length and all three of us  Ranadeb Bose, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and I  managed that pretty well, he said.         
	Of course, Kohli played a classy innings and the value of his wicket can be seen by the fact that he made 173 runs out of the score of 261 when he was out, Dinda said.         
	I am glad we had a plan and we stuck to it all through the day on this track. We know we have to do the same when play resumes tomorrow (Thursday).

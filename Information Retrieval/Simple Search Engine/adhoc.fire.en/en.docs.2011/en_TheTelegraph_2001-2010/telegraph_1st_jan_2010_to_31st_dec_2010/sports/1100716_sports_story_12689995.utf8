The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hockenheim will be better for us: Liuzzi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hockenheim will be better for us: Liuzzi
                      
	New Delhi: After finishing 11th in British Grand Prix, Force India driver Vitantonio Liuzzi is desperate to get back among points and the Italian hopes to cash in on a familiar track at Hockenheim, during the German GP, on July 25.         
	Liuzzi, who had qualified 15th but started 20th after copping a five-place penalty for deliberate obstruction in the qualifying session, gave it everything but finished 11th in the last race at Silverstone.         
	I think, Hockenheim will be better for us, but we still have to work hard and bring some developments. It has a very flat surface, or it did when we were last there two years ago! So you can use a much stiffer set-up, a much lower car.         
	I grew up in Germany in F3, so I really like it, and I drove quite a bit there. So Im looking forward to it. I think we could be in a strong position, Liuzzi said.         
	Its not as linked to downforce as Silverstone, so maybe we should be more competitive and with a better pace. We have to try to score points with both cars to be back in the fight. In Silverstone I was close, but we knew it was not a track for our cars best characteristics, he added.         
	The Italian regretted the way things had turned up for him in Silverstone and feels that a through analysis should be carried out before he sits behind the wheels in Germany.

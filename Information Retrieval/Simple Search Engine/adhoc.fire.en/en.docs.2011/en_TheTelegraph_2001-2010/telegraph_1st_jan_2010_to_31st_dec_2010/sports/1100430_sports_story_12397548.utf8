The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warne: Pakistan, India favourites
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warne: Pakistan, India favourites
                      
	Melbourne: Australian spin legend Shane Warne has tipped India and Pakistan as the favourites to win the third-edition of the World Twenty20 starting in West Indies from Friday.         
	India are one of the favourites because their players played so much in the IPL; and Pakistan are also the hot contenders because the format suits them. But Australia is playing more of it and understanding the game a lot better, Warne said when asked which team would be his favourite.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a very good captain, but Virender Sehwag is a massive loss with his shoulder injury, Warne told an Australian daily.         
	Dhoni also figured in Warnes list of best five Twenty20 cricketers, which also had Shane Watson, Kevin Pietersen, Lasith Malinga, Kieron Pollard and a fit Sehwag.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Edmilson banned for 2 matches
                                                                                                                       7                                      Edmilson banned for 2 matches
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In an unprecedented move, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Thursday slapped a two-match ban and a fine of Rs. 15,000 on Chirag United striker Edmilson for spitting on a Churchill Brothers player in the I-League match in Calcutta on March 7.         
	Edmilson, who was ejected by the referee immediately after the incident, had already served an automatic one-match suspension against Mumbai FC and would also sit out in the next two outings against Salgaocar and Mahindra United. Edmilson had earlier tendered his unconditional apology for the incident.         
	Though spitting is considered one of the worst on-field offences in football, the decision of the AIFF disciplinary committee has come as a surprise since the I-League regulations are silent on the subject.         
	One must congratulate the AIFF for arriving at a quick decision in punishing Edmilson, that, too, after consulting the Fifa rule book, said an I-League member. If only they had been equally prompt in punishing other offenders, it would have been better, he added.         
	A few months back, a coach of a Goa club wrote a letter to the AIFF threatening to take the law in his own hands if the refereeing standard was not improved. No action was taken against him, the member alleged.         
	Edmilsons suspension is a body blow for Chirag, who are at the moment placed fourth in the league table. Out of the 24 goals scored by Chirag so far, the Brazilian alone has struck nine.

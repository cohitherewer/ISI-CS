            STAR RACER                                    
	Calcutta: A couple of favourites, five fancied winners and two outsiders entertained a near 15,000-strong racecrowd at the RCTCs New Years Day on Friday. The day is considered as the biggest in the RCTCs racing calendar, in terms of cash register raking the moollah, and the totalisator broke all past records on the day, crossing the Rs 1 crore barrier. The tote collection on the day was in excess of Rs 1.1 crore; said an excited Chandranath Chakravorty, RCTCs senior manager, betting operation.          
	The two star events in the frame of nine also produced results on the expected lines. Trainer Pesi Shroff Rommel fought out a hard battle with another strongly fancied runner, Silver Fox, to win the 2,200m RCTC Gold Vase. Jockey C. Ruzaan partnered the Ontario son to a long-neck victory.          
	The 1,200m Kunigal Stud Indian Produce Stakes, on the other hand, was an easy pick for the Vijay Singh-trained Hall Of Glory, ridden by Christopher Alford. The jockey almost made it a pillar-to-post victory to let his stablemate, Record Breaker, fight out the issue with Arbroath for the minor placings. Vijays 6-1 shot Royal Charter (Neeraj Rawal-up) bagged the 1,400m Calorescence Cup.

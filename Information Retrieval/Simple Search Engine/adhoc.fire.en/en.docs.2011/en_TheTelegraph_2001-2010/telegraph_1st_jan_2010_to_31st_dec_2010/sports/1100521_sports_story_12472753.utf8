The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Blanc to be France coach after Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                      Blanc to be France coach after Cup
                      
	Paris: Laurent Blanc will replace the controversial Raymond Domenech as France coach after the World Cup, the French Football Federation (FFF) said on Thursday.         
	A prominent member of Frances 1998 World Cup-winning squad, although he was suspended for the final, Blanc will take over from Domenech after the June 11-July 11 World Cup in South Africa.         
	The 44-year-old took over as coach of Girondins Bordeaux three years ago, leading them to a Ligue 1 and League Cup double last season.         
	The FFF confirmed the choice of Laurent Blanc as national team coach after the 201O World Cup, the ruling body said in a statement issued after a council meeting in Paris.         
	The Federation said it would make no further comment until Blanc officially signs his contract and did not specify when that would happen.         
	The last significant hurdle was cleared on Thursday when the FFF said they had reached an agreement with Girondins, meaning there should be a financial compensation for the club, Blanc having a year left in his contract.

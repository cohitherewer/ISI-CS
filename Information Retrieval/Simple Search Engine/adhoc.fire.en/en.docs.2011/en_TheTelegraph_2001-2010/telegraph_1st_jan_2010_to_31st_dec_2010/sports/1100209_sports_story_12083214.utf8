The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger Woods on six-month trial
                                                                                                                       7                                        Tiger Woods on six-month trial
  - Reports say Elin Nordegren is willing to give erring husband a chance to make amends             Tiger and Elin: Will they be back to the good old times?                           
	London: After being at the receiving end for going over the top, Tiger Woods, who according to reports returned home from sex rehab on Saturday, would now have to see what he can throw overboard to keep the ship of his marriage from sinking. And, if a British daily is to be believed, it is betrayed wife Elin Nordegren who has shown an interest in keeping the household afloat.         
	A close friend of the Swedish former bikini model told the newspaper that Elin was still hopeful for their marriage and that she had told the disgraced golfer: To save our marriage you have six months to prove you wont cheat again.         
	The simplest of conditions on the face of it but one that Tiger with his track record of trespasses could find hard to fulfil. At least thats the challenge and it seems Elin is willing to put her money on her man to do it for the family that also consists of two-year-old daughter Sam and son Charlie who is just a year old.         
	The stint in rehab cannot be ignored and Elin, clearly, is counting on that while she begins to piece together a life torn to bits by the media blitz and the hue and cry over the world No.1 golfers many mistresses.         
	On Saturday, the friend said: She (Elin) has been convinced there is hope for the marriage. The doctors told her she shouldnt underestimate Tigers ability to learn new coping skills and grow as a person they say he has made remarkable progress.         
	The friend added: It is so hard for Elin. After all the horrible stories about his affairs and all the hurt, the reality is there is still a lot of love left for Tiger. Thats why she is willing to give him another chance.         
	Thankfully for Tiger, Elin has chosen to pardon the villain and not be vindictive; now its up to Tiger to see that she is vindicated. But the trust this time is not going to be blind.         
	She would hate herself if she just gave up on him, the friend said. Especially when hes so serious about getting help. But one thing is for sure Elin wont be duped twice.         
	Elins decision comes just weeks after she told friends she was full of hatred for Tiger and that she was planning to end their five-year marriage and move back to Sweden with their children.         
	But when Tiger checked out of rehab Elin  who also took part in counselling sessions  was there to bring him back home. Now, the question is whether the two of them can keep it from falling apart again.         
	Meanwhile, rumours of Tigers imminent return to competition at the Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona from February 17 has been emphatically denied by his caddie Steve Williams.         
	The stories stating Tiger will return at the match play have no truth to them, an Australian daily quoted the New Zealander as saying.         
	Certain media reports had earlier suggested that Tiger was set to stun the world by returning to the Dove Mountain course where he made his comeback from knee surgery last year. It is also a favourite event of the superstar golfer, who has won it in 2003, 2004 and 2008.         
	Ross McGowan of England might get the final spot in the 64-man Match Play Championship if Tiger doesnt return from his indefinite break. Sunday was the cut-off for players to qualify based on the world rankings. Players have until Friday to officially declare they are playing.         
	Phil Mickelson, who slipped to No.3 in the world Sunday, had already said he would not play this year because of a family vacation that had been postponed because of his wifes breast cancer.         
	Assuming that Tiger doesnt play, and no one else withdraws, among the first-round matches would be Japans Ryo Ishikawa against Michael Sim, and Justin Leonard against Ian Poulter of England.

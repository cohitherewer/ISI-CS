The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rafique saves Chirag blushes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rafique saves Chirag blushes
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chirag United coach Subrata Bhattacharya substituted an off-colour Denson Devadas for Mohammed Rafique half an hour into the match. The change did the trick, as last years CFL Premier Division runners-up defeated BNR 1-0 at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Friday, courtesy Rafiques strike in the 79th minute.         
	After listless display for the better part of the match, it was Gouranga Biswas who floated the ball from the right channel. Elijah Junior who was inside the box did well to head it in front of the goalmouth as BNR goalie Santosh Goswami failed to judge the trajectory. Rafique came from behind to shoot home from close range.         
	The first half was a barren affair, as Junior didnt find much support upfront. With both seniors Malswantluanga and Lalkamal Bhowmick failing to create chances, Junior got increasingly frustrated. Also U-19 player Munna Mallicks inexperience was another reason for Chirags failure to make any decisive inroads.         
	The only time that Chirag came close to scoring in the first half was when a BNR defender effected goalline save off a Rafique shot. Chirag now have six points from two matches.

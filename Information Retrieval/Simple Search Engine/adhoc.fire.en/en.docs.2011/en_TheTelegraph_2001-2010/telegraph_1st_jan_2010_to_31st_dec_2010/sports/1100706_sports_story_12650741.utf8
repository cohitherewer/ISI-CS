The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | President backtracks on ban
                                                                                                                       7                                      President backtracks on ban
                      
	Abuja: Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has dropped a threat to suspend the national football team from playing because of their poor World Cup showing, a source informed.         
	The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the official announcement had not yet been made on Monday.         
	The Fifa did not immediately confirm the development, but has set a deadline for the Nigerian government to withdraw the threat by 1600 GMT.         
	The Fifa intended to suspend Nigeria from world football if the threat wasnt revoked because its rules forbid governments to interfere in footballs affairs.         
	A presidential spokesman announced last Wednesday that President Jonathan wanted the Super Eagles team suspended for two years to allow Nigerian football to be restructured, after they left the World Cup with just one point from three matches.         
	Earlier Monday, Fifa president Sepp Blatter said at a news conference that footballs governing body has taken all adequate steps to resolve the dispute.         
	We do hope that everything comes back to normal, Blatter said.         
	The Fifa dispatched Nigerias most senior football official  Amos Adamu, a member of its 24-man ruling executive  to mediate with the government.         
	A Fifa suspension would have stopped Nigerian club teams, referees and officials from taking part in international football.         
	Nigeria is due to send a womens under-20 team to the World Cup, which kicks off next week in Germany.         
	Nigerian club Heartland also stood to lose their place in the African Champions League if they could not fulfil a home fixture against Egypts Al-Ahly scheduled next week.         
	The dispute between Nigeria and Fifa flared last week after the national team returned from South Africa.         
	Nigeria earned a 2-2 draw with South Korea in their final game. They lost to Argentina 0-1 in their Group B opener and fell to Greece 1-2 in a game that turned on the first-half dismissal of midfielder Sani Kaita.         
	The suspension threat by Nigerias government also followed corruption allegations that plagued the team before the World Cup.         
	Presidential spokesman Ima Niboro said last Wednesday that all funds directed toward the Nigeria Football Federation would be examined and all those found wanting will be sanctioned.         
	Fifa spokesman Nicolas Maingot could not confirm on Monday if Nigerias federation had yet been paid any of the $8 million prize money it is due from Fifa for taking part in the World Cup.         
	On Sunday, the federation fired its president and vice president in an effort to convince the Nigerian state President to drop the suspension threat.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Powar scythes through Delhi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Powar scythes through Delhi
                      
	Mumbai: Ramesh Powar wreaked havoc with his five-wicket haul as Mumbai skittled Delhi out for a meagre 211 to take a first innings lead of 289 runs on Tuesday, Day III of their Ranji Trophy semi-final match.         
	The deadly spell of 5.3-3-9-5 by the India discard, after lunch, triggered a dramatic collapse as Delhi, replying to Mumbais huge first innings total of 500, lost their last six wickets for 23 runs in 20.3 overs.         
	Powar, who ended with figures of five for 47, got good support on a spinning Brabourne Stadium track from left-arm spinner Iqbal Abdulla. Among Powars victims was Delhi captain Rajat Bhatia.         
	At stumps the hosts, who did not enforce follow-on, had increased their overall lead to 412, making 123 for four in the second innings, with opener Sahil Kukreja getting the bulk of the runs with a knock of 71.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murray stays in the hunt for title

	Melbourne: Andy Murray has reached the Australian Open final and is only one victory away from doing what no British man has done in more than 70 years  win a Grand Slam singles title.         
	Murray beat Marin Cilic 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 on Thursday in a semi-final to advance to Sundays championship match. He will take on the winner of Friday nights semi-final between three-time Australian Open winner Roger Federer and 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.         
	If Federer wins, it will mean a rematch of the 2008 US Open where the Swiss star beat Murray in straight sets. That was the 22-year-old Scots only trip to a Grand Slam singles final, where his loss continued a stretch of no British man winning a major since 1936.         
	Murray expects Federer to be across the net from him on Sunday night at Rod Laver Arena. Tsongas played a lot of sets, hes going to be a little bit tired like Cilic was, but you never know with him, hes a great player, Murray said. Still, I expect Federer to come through.         
	Earlier Thursday, Serena Williams and Justine Henin won their semi-finals over Chinese opponents to advance to Saturdays final. Williams beat Li Na 7-6 (4), 7-6 (1) while Henin wasted little time in beating Zheng Jie 6-1, 6-0.         
	The last British man to win at the Australian Open was Fred Perry in 1934. Perry won Wimbledon in 1936, the last British man to win there, a drought that has worn heavily on the psyche of players such as Murray, Tim Henman and others before them.         
	Murray is the first British man to reach the Australia final since John Lloyd in 1977 and the first to reach two Grand Slam finals in the Open era.         
	Murray used to joke several years ago that when he lost, the domestic press referred to him as Scottish, but when he won he was British. He could make everybody happy in the UK if he breaks the drought on Sunday.         
	 I wouldnt (make) my tiredness an excuse for losing this match, Cilic said. I think he deserved to win.         
	Serena got some help from her sister for her semi-final win. After Venus Williams lost in the quarter finals to Li, ending any chance of an all-Williams semifinal, she did all she could to ensure at least one family member would be there.         
	She told me how to play her and what to do, Serena said. She had chances yesterday and she knew how to play her. It always helps when you have someone who can help you out.         
	Serena recorded her 50th career win at Melbourne Park and advanced to her fifth Australian Open final. Henin is playing in her first Grand Slam tournament in two years since ending a 20-month retirement. It was the first time that two Chinese players had advanced to the semifinal of a major, but Williams and Henin stopped the numerous Chinese flags at Rod Laver Arena from being raised too often in jubilation.         
	Good for both players, Li said. Also good for China tennis. I think if the children, they see this, maybe they will be more confident and think they can do it some day too.         
	Unfortunately for Zheng, it was the most lopsided womens semi-final at the Australian Open since Chris Evert beat Andrea Jaeger by the same score in 1982. It was perfect, said Henin, who had to beat Olympic gold medalist and No. 5-ranked Elena Dementieva just to get past the second round. I had enough tennis in the past two weeks so it was good to have a pretty easy match.         
	Serena has won the title every time shes played the final here since beating Venus here in 2003. The winning sequence has been every odd-numbered year so far. I really should have won sooner ... I had so many match points and I blew it and I knew I couldnt mess up my serve because she never gives up, Serena said of her win over Li. Every time I had match points she came up with some big serves and great shots. She just goes for broke.         
	Serena, the 11-time Grand Slam singles champion, and Venus, the defending champions in doubles, later beat Lisa Raymond and Rennae Stubbs 6-3, 7-6 (6) in the semi-finals. Theyll play No. 1 Cara Black and Liezel Huber in Fridays final.

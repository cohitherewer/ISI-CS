The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Punters Corner - Katrak ward has edge
                                                                                                                       7                                                                                      Katrak ward has edge 
            HONKY DORY                        
	Cambiasso and Sea Of Kisses are expected to fight out the issue in the 2,000m P. R. Mehta Trophy, Thursdays main event. However, going by their recent clash, the weight appears to be favouring the China Visit-Stolen Kisses son, Sea Of Kisses. The Cooji Katrak-trained ward may come good in the hands of jockey Imran Chisty.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Kothari shuts out Advani
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Saurav Kothari in Mumbai, on Wednesday                           
	Mumbai: Calcuttas Saurav Kothari scored his first major victory when he upset amateur World No. 1 Pankaj Advani in the final of the Nahar Group All-India Snooker championship, here on Wednesday.         
	Kothari outclassed the double world champion Advani 81-1, 66-61, 37-62, 29-77, 72-38, 36-56, 77-0, 73-0, 60-45 in the summit clash.         
	Its Kothari juniors third amateur title, the previous two being the all-India championships at Meetur and the Australian Open in Sydney in 2008. The 25-year-old has earlier beaten Advani three times but this is the first time he is conquering his India teammate in a final.         
	More importantly, the victory would be a big boost for Kothari who would be departing for the Asian snooker championship in Chonburi, Thailand, on Thursday.         
	Any win is important, and beating the world champion in the final makes it even more important, an elated Kothari said. My cueing was straight today (Wednesday) and I potted the crucial points.         
	Advani took the defeat in his stride.         
	I was definitely far below my best, but thats sport. If you know the winner before hand, there is no need for a tournament. Saurav did better in adjusting to the conditions, the Bangalore-based cueist said.

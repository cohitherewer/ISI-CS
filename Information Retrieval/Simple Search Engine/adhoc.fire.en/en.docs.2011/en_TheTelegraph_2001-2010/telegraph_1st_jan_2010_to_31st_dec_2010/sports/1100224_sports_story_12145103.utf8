The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Problem for hosts is actually a bigger problem for visitors
                                                                                                                       7                                      Problem for hosts is actually a bigger problem for visitors
    - Sehwag seems fine, but call to be made today; Amla may make XI           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Gwalior: The problem for the Indian team is that we are expected to win every game, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Tuesday evening, on the eve of the second (and penultimate) ODI against South Africa.         
	Actually, when the wins start to roll, particularly at home, it becomes a bigger problem for the opposition!         
	Being 0-1 down, the visitors are in an unenviable position, for playing catch-up cricket is easier talked about than achieved in the subcontinent.         
	Many would argue that South Africa should have won in Jaipur, on Sunday, but the reality is that they didnt. Theres nothing for finishing second-best, even if just one run separates the teams.         
	Clearly, to keep the Micromax Mobile Cup series alive, South Africa must win at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium, the showpiece facility in Scindialand.         
	We know where we went wrong (in Jaipur). We are going to work on getting that right and thats our focus, insisted South Africas coach Corrie Van Zyl.         
	Van Zyl oozed confidence, but would be aware that his team missed a great opportunity a couple of days ago, largely because the basics werent right in the two key departments  batting and bowling.         
	Significantly, he confirmed that a rotation policy was being followed, which may lead to the best XI not being on the park.         
	It wont surprise if Hashim Amla, MoS in the two Tests, makes the XI. He wasnt in the squad originally announced, but made it as regular captain Graeme Smiths replacement.         
	The stroke-players could build their innings around the solid Amla.         
	Much of the attention during the match-eve practice was, rather understandably, on Virender Sehwag and his back. The vice-captain did almost everything, but the rest of the team management is keen to assess how he feels in the morning.         
	We will have to see how the back shapes up tomorrow, Dhoni pointed out, adding that the team had been forced to live with injuries for the past many months.         
	Painful, but unavoidable.         
	Obviously, challenge No.1 between now and the 2011 World Cup, which is less than 365 days away, is to ensure that the core players are free of major injuries.         
	Should Sehwag have to be rested, The Telegraph learns that Abhishek Nayar will get a look-in, with Dinesh Karthik possibly being promoted to open with Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Sudeep Tyagi, who must have become bored of carrying drinks, appears to be in contention. He may take the place of Sreesanth, who was mauled in Jaipur.         
	The dew wasnt much of a factor in the first ODI, but could play a bigger role here. To get a better idea, or gather intelligence, a word used by Corrie, the home team has asked the ground staff to give an update before the toss.         
	TEAMS         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Dinesh Karthik, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Yusuf Pathan, Ravindra Jadeja, Praveen Kumar, Ashish Nehra, Sreesanth/Sudeep Tyagi.         
	South Africa (from): Herschelle Gibbs, Loots Bosman, Jacques Kallis, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Albie Morkel, Johan Botha, Wayne Parnell, Dale Steyn, Charl Langeveldt, JP Duminy, Morne Morkel, Alviro Petersen, Roelof van der Merwe, Lonwabo Tsotsobe.         
	Match starts: 2.30 pm.         
	Footnote: Dhoni, who has friends in the air force station, called on them on Monday itself, soon after arriving in Gwalior. Some returned the visit, on Tuesday, and were delighted to meet a few of the captains teammates (at the Stadium).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drama over Pak replacements
                                                                                                                       7                                      Drama over Pak replacements
                      
	Lahore: The lack of communication within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was apparent once again when the national selectors, captain and the coach had to backtrack on their original choice of replacements in place of injured Umar Gul and Yasir Arafat for the World T20 in West Indies.         
	Although chief selector, Mohsin Khan, captain Shahid Afridi and coach Waqar Younis had named fast bowlers, Mohammed Sami and rookie Mohammed Irfan as the replacements but the PCB announced the names of Sami and left-arm spinner Abdul Rehman as the replacements.         
	The problem is that Irfan was not included in the original list of 30 players which is why we couldnt consider him according to ICC tournament regulations, PCB chief Ijaz Butt said from Dubai. He made it clear that ICC regulations only allow for injured players to be replaced by players named in the list of 30 probables for the tournament.         
	That is why the selectors have in consultation with the captain and the coach decided to have Abdul Rehman and Sami as the replacement players in the final squad, Butt said.         
	But the PCB chairman conveniently forgot that last year itself during his tenure, Abdul Razzaq was sent to England as a late replacement although he was not in the list of 30 players.

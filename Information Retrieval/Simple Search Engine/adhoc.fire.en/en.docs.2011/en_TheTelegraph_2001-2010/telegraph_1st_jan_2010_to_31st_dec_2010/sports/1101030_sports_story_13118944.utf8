            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Rahul Dravid on Friday doubted if there were any similarities between youngster Cheteshwar Pujara and himself, since he believed that the middle order batsman would turn out to be a better player.         
	Pujara is a terrific player, there is no doubt about that. I dont know if he reminds me of myself but I think he will be a better player than me, Dravid, at a function where sports memorabilia was auctioned, said.         
	The memorabilia auctioned, the proceeds from which would go to actor Rahul Boses NGO, included Viswanathan Anands world championship medal, Sachin Tendulkars fourth highest ODI scoring bat, Abhinav Bindras world championship rifle, Roger Federer-signed shoes and Mahesh Bhupathis Australian Open winning racquet among other items.

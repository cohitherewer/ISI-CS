The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Srinivasan hits back at Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                      Srinivasan hits back at Modi
                      
	New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) franchise owner N. Srinivasan on Thursday rubbished reports that he tried to fix the IPL 2009 player auction and insisted that he won the bid fair and square.         
	A television channel on Wednesday claimed that Srinivasan in connivance with suspended IPL chairman Lalit Modi tried to fix the bid of former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff in Chennai Super Kings favour.         
	I didnt need anybodys favour. Rajasthan Royals bid for $1.5m for Flintoff and I beat them at $1.55m. So where is the deal? How can I have any deal? How can Modi have control over Shane Warne unless he is the owner of the Rajasthan Royals?, Srinivasan told another television channel.         
	The Chennai Super Kings is the only team which had the $2 million in the purse. Everybody else had less, so we didnt need anybodys favour to buy Flintoff, he added.         
	This is not the first time that Srinivasan has found himself in a controversy. A few days back, the BCCI secretary was accused of fixing umpires for Chennai Super Kings matches during the IPL.           (PTI)

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: An act of callousness on the part of National Anti Doping Agency (NADA) nearly cost wrestler Joginder Kumar a place in the Commonwealth Games squad.         
	On Thursday, the 120 kg grappler in the freestyle category was named among the six wrestlers who failed dope tests conducted during the Commonwealth trials in Sonepat. All six were immediately put under suspension by the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI).         
	Joginder drove down to Delhi on Friday morning and straightaway went to the NADA office to challenge the verdict. Upon enquiry, it was revealed that the wrestler who actually failed the test was Joginder Singh of 55 kg Greco-Roman category and not the freestyle wrestler, who had earlier won a gold medal in junior Asian meet.         
	It was a mistake on the part of NADA, admitted WFI secretary Kartar Singh. The change of verdict has come as a big relief for us. Now that Joginder has been exonerated, he could be accommodated in the Commonwealth Games team for 120 kg category. He can easily replace Rajiv Tomar, who has tested positive.         
	A NADA official conceded that a mix up created all the trouble. Since both the names are same, a clerical mistake created this problem. We are happy that Joginder himself came and made us realise the error.

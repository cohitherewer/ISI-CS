	New Delhi: For Harminder Singh, the Indian bronze medal winner in the 20km walk event of the Commonwealth Games, walking is a way of life. For the last eight years I have been doing just that. Walking and walking, he said, at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, on Saturday. The 26-year-old finished his race in one hour 23 minutes and 18 seconds and that is his personal best. For the record, he is the second to win a medal in athletics in the Games.

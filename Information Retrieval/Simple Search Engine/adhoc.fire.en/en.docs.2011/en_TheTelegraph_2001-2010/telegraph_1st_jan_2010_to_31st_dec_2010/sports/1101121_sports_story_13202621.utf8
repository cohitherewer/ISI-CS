            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan played his cards close to his chest on the eve of their CFL clash against Durand Cup winners Chirag United on Saturday. Chirag are a buoyant lot after their Durand victory and Morgan, for sure, is aware of the pitfalls ahead of the seasons first high-voltage encounter between the two heavyweights in the local league.         
	The red and gold brigade will miss the services of midfielders Mehtab Hossain and Reisangmi Vashum for double booking, and though the formers absence has Chirag coach Subroto Bhattacharya excited, Morgan is unperturbed by it.         
	East Bengal striker Robin Singh opted out of practice citing fatigue on Saturday, but the Noida lad said he would be ready to start against Chirag United. Even if Robin fails to recover in time, Morgan will have a choice between Bikash Narjinary and Budhiram Tudu for Sundays match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asian Games gold is Sushils next target 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Asian Games gold is Sushils next target 
            JAYDEEP BASU            Sushil Kumar, on Sunday                           
	New Delhi: Who said the Commonwealth Games is not a magnet for spectators? All doubting Thomases would have done well, should they have been present at the Indira Gandhi indoor stadium on Sunday.         
	On a day when city traffic was thrown out of gear because of the road blockades to facilitate cycle races, there was not an empty seat left at the stadium.                     
	The crowd, gathered to watch the Indian wrestlers in the finals, made a lot of noise, but despite the support and an electric atmosphere, the hosts could collect just one gold medal, which came through the efforts of 66kg world champion Sushil Kumar, who dished out an exemplary performance right from the start.         
	In the 84kg final, Indias Anuj lost to Pakistans Mohammed Inam, while Joginder Singh lost to Canadas India-born grappler Arjun Bhullar in the 120kg title round.         
	Elsewhere, in shooting, it was a relatively quiet day for the hosts as India picked up only one gold medal to boost up their tally from the sport to 13 gold, eight silver and three bronze medals.         
	Harpreet Singh won the gold in the mens 25mcentre-fire pistol event while Vijay Kumar secured the silver after a four-way dramatic shoot-off. In another shoot-off, former world champion Manavjit Singh Sandhu bagged the bronze in the trap event.         
	If Deepika Kumari and Rahul Banerjee stole the limelight at the archery venue, it was Sushils turn to do the same in wrestling. So dominant was the Olympic bronze medallist that it prompted one of the Indian coaches to comment that the level of competition here was not good enough to field the star freestyler.         
	I am not resting. I will start training for the Asian Games immediately, said Sushil after outclassing Heinrich Barnes of South Africa in the final. Now I want to win the Asian Games gold, added Najafgarhs latest hero after cricketer Virender Sehwag.         
	Sushil went on the attack from the start and raced to a 2-0 lead before pinning down his opponent in the next to win the gold medal. Earlier, Sushil stormed into the final after beating Jarjou Famara of Gambia in just nine seconds with the first move of the semi-final bout.         
	In the morning session, he made it to the semi-final without conceding a single point in his first two bouts.         
	In shooting, Harpreet shot 580 to win his second gold of the meet, although he fell three points short of the Games record of 583 set by Jaspal Rana in the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games. Vijay and Harpreet had won the gold in the pairs event as well.         
	Manavjit was on top after the qualification round, with a score of 123. In the final, he was tied for the third place with Australias Adam Vella, bronze medallist in the 2004 Athens Olympics, with a final score of 144.         
	In the shoot-off, world No.5 Vella missed his second shot while Manavjit found the target to win the bronze. Another Indian in fray, Mansher Singh finished sixth with a total score of 137. Mansher and Manvjit had won the pairs silver in the same event.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raman cracks the whip, yet again
                                                                                                                       7                                      Raman cracks the whip, yet again
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal coach Woorkeri Raman is living up to his reputation of being a hard taskmaster.         
	Since he took over his job earlier this month, he had issued a gag order on the players asking them to perform first and then talk.         
	Now, the former India batsman has made it clear to the Bengal players that he would not tolerate any laxity during the training sessions.         
	According to a source, he has also decided to fine the players if they are late for practice. Some players, including a few seniors, were reportedly arriving late at practice.         
	Irked with this indifference, the coach has now decided to slap a Rs 100 fine for every hour of practice missed. That means that if someone is late by five hours, he has to give Rs 500 as fine.         
	The coach is also not happy with the players chatting over the phone during practice, added the source. It remains to be seen if he takes any concrete step regarding the matter.         
	Meanwhile, the first match of the SK Acharya Challenger meet, between CAB Red and CAB Blue was cancelled due to wet ground conditions. The teams shared the points.

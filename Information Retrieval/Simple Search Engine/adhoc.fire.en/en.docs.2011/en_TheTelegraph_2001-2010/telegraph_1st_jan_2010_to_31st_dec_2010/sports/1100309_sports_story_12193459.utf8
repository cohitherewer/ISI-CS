	Vadodara: West Zone thrashed Central Zone by 216 runs in the second semi-final of the Deodhar Trophy on Monday to march into the finals against North Zone.         
	Central elected to field first and though they managed an early wicket in the form of opener Chirag Pathak, the West batsmen refused to budge putting on a mammoth total of 335 for eight on the board.         
	Ajinkya Rahane (76) and Cheteshwar Pujara (86) shared a 154-run second wicket partnership for West to set up the stage for a victory. Some useful contributions down the order by Yusuf Pathan, who smashed a 24-ball 59, and Ravindra Jadeja, who hit a breezy 18-ball 42, helped West cross the 300-run mark.         
	In reply, the Central batsmen surrendered meekly as they were bundled out for 119 in 29.4 overs.         
	Wests Jadeja picked up four wickets for eight.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Trio barred from training at NCA
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has woken up from a slumber to stop the suspended trio of Salman Butt, Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif from training at the National Cricket Academy or using any of their facilities.         
	Sources in the Board said that the International Cricket Council (ICC) had reminded the PCB of their responsibilities under the anti-corruption code after Butt spoke to the media following a training session at the NCA last week.         
	The media talk that Butt had, alerted the ICC, who then reminded the PCB that the suspended trio could not be linked to any facility or event of the PCB because of their suspensions, the source said.         
	But Tafazzul Rizvi, PCBs legal advisor, said that the Board had taken the decision to stop the suspended players from training at the NCA or using any of its facilities by itself.         
	It is mandatory upon us to ensure that these players cannot be associated with any of our events or use our facilities. They cant even interact with the other players, Rizvi said.

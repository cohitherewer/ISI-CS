The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The players must know rules: Official
                                                                                                                       7                                      The players must know rules: Official
                      
	Los Angeles: Dustin Johnsons two-stroke penalty on the final hole of the US PGA Championship has served as a timely reminder that players should always acquaint themselves with local rules, a European Tour official said.         
	American Johnson, one ahead playing the last hole at Whistling Straits on Sunday, was penalised two shots for grounding his club in a bunker to the right of the fairway, an infringement that cost him a place in a playoff for the title.         
	We all feel sympathy for him but it was clear-cut from what I saw on television, European Tour chief referee John Paramor said on Monday after officiating at the tournament in Kohler, Wisconsin.         
	I had finished duty when I looked at the television and I thought: Hes grounded his club in a bunker. I just couldnt believe it.         
	My advice to anyone playing in a competition is that you should know the rules and regulations under which youre playing, Paramor said.         
	It doesnt take an awful lot to look at that.           (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni: The reality is that we are always under pressure
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni: The reality is that we are always under pressure
    - Whatever the wicket, we will be giving it our best shot, says captain           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the city on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: Defeat hurts, more so if a chain of wins gets broken.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, though, appears to have recovered from the innings loss suffered by his team in Nagpur, on Tuesday.         
	Theres always a first for everything Just as well, perhaps, that it has come early in my career as a captain That first done, no matter how disappointing, its time now to move ahead, Dhoni told The Telegraph, on Thursday evening.         
	Speaking shortly after arriving in the city, for the second and final Test against South Africa, which gets underway on Sunday, he added: Weve got no choice, but to go for a win Whatever the wicket, we will be giving it our best shot.         
	Incidentally, it will be for the first time that Dhoni is going to captain Team India in a Test in his own zone  East.         
	Feels nice, of course The Eden is a huge venue Its strange, however, that I havent ever led India in Jamshedpur, the only international centre in my state (Jharkhand) Weve been playing all over, except in Jamshedpur, Dhoni said.         
	That, indeed, is strange and the Jharkhand State Cricket Association and the Tatas, owners of the Keenan (in Jamshedpur), definitely need to bury whatever differences exist.         
	Other centres have been benefiting.         
	Dhoni, captain in all forms from November 2008, led India for the first time in September 2007  that was in the inaugural World T20, a tournament won by India.         
	Asked if the must-win situation here would put his team under more pressure, Dhoni replied: The reality is that were always under pressure Everybody expects us to win Its something that we cant get away from If anything, were probably under more pressure when playing overseas         
	Dhoni was under pressure of a very different kind  that of obliging endless autograph seekers  while keeping a dinner engagement at the residence of an old acquaintance, on S.N.Roy Road.         
	Clearly, the 28-year-old Dhonis legendary calmness came to good use and even those who were disappointed passionately roared Dhoni, Dhoni as he left for the team hotel after a couple of hours.

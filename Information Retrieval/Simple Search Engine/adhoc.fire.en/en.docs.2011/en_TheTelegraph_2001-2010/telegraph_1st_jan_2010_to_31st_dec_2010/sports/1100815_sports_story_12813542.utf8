The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Just a few hours with spinners 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Just a few hours with spinners 
  - Anil kumble invited to speak at Csas annual conference in Joburg         LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Anil Kumble                                 
	Calcutta: Forget conducting a clinic, Anil Kumble wont be spending more than a couple of hours with South Africas spinners, during his forthcoming trip there.         
	Its not that Ill be offering tips at a clinic... Ive been invited to speak at the Annual Conference of Cricket South Africa (CSA), on Thursday evening, and will probably interact with the spinners that morning, Kumble told The Telegraph.         
	The third most successful bowler in Tests, with 619 victims, Kumble retired from international cricket 22 months ago.         
	Speaking from hometown Bangalore, on Saturday afternoon, the former India captain added: Ill start the journey back the very next morning and, so, theres no question of holding a clinic... The request to spend some time with the spinners came from Gerald Majola (CSAs chief executive) and I agreed.         
	Whats unusual is that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) hasnt yet asked Kumble to interact with our own spinners, even though one can count them on the fingers.         
	I havent done anything formally, but Im available to help... I do talk to Bhajji (Harbhajan Singh), for example... Im there to make suggestions or work with somebody, Kumble pointed out.         
	Asked when he would start working with the India cricketers on personality development, Kumble said: As of now, my company (Tenvic) has an agreement, in principle only, with the BCCI. The modalities need to be worked out.         
	A Sachin Tendulkar and a Rahul Dravid dont need to sit down with Kumble, but the Amit Mishras and Praveen Kumars certainly do. Not to mention Ravindra Jadeja.         
	Thursday, incidentally, will mark a first for Kumble. While hes been addressing corporates, he hasnt worn that hat before the board members of a cricket organisation. That, too, as major as CSA.         
	Its going to be something new, yes... Ill be dwelling on the challenges faced by the modern-day cricketers, Kumble, who turns 40 in October, revealed.         
	Has he been following Team Indias performances? Absolutely... I do keep track of who is doing what, Kumble replied.         
	Passionate about wildlife, he has recently adopted five inhabitants (including two cobras) of the Bannerghatta Zoo, on the outskirts of Bangalore.         
	Kumble is vice-chairman of Karnatakas Wildlife Board.         
	Once back from South Africa, Kumble will resume training for next months Champions League T20, in that very country. Right now, Ive been doing just a bit of it, he remarked.         
	Kumble is the Royal Challengers Bangalore captain. The franchise finished third in the last IPL.         
	Footnote: The 10-wicket haul in the second innings of the Kotla Test against Pakistan, in 1999, has inspired Tenvic. Its short for ten wickets, the one difference being v in place of w. The v denotes victory, Kumble explained, laughing.

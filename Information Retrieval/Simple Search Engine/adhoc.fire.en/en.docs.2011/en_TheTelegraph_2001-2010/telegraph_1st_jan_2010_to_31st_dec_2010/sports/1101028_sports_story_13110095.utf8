	Bangalore: Out-of-favour Indian batsman Yuvraj Singh Wednesday said he is planning to open a cricket academy in about a years time to groom budding cricketers.         
	Yuvraj has been left out of the Indias squad for the upcoming three-Test series against New Zealand and was also not in the team for the recently concluded Test series against Australia.         
	I have an idea of starting an academy. The aim is to get the best talents of India, he told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.         
	On the location of the academy, he said, Wherever I can, where there is some space and the right environment, adding that he would probably open it in north India.         
	It is a long procedure, he said, adding there was a need for good academies that offer various facilities for training.         
	Asked if he had any idea that may help India clinch the next years World Cup, he said, It is not just an idea that would help clinch the World Cup. It requires work and effort by the team. Having just an idea and playing cricket were altogether different.           (PTI)

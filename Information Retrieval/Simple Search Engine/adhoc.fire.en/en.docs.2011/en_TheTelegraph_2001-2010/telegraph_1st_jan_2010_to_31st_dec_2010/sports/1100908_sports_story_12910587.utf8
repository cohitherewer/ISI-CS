	Norton: Charley Hoffman was rolling in so many putts he lost track of how many birdies he made, on Monday. His final stroke on a Labor Day masterpiece was his 11th birdie, more than enough to win the Deutsche Bank Championship.         
	Hoffman ran off four straight birdies early to erase a four-shot deficit, seized control by holing a bunker shot on the 13th and closed with a 9-under 62 on the TPC Boston for a five-shot victory over Geoff Ogilvy, Jason Day and Luke Donald.         
	Tiger Woods had three rounds in the 60s for the first time this year. He closed with a 69 to tie for 11th, and kept his No. 1 ranking in the world, when Phil Mickelson imploded again.         
	Mickelson needed only to finish fourth to become No. 1 for the first time in his career. Instead, he took two double bogeys on the back nine and shot 76 to tie for 25th.         
	Ogilvy closed with a 66, and the runner-up finish moved him from No. 52 to No. 9, assuring him a spot in the Tour Championship. It was Ogilvys first top 10 on tour since he won at Kapalua in the first tournament of the year.

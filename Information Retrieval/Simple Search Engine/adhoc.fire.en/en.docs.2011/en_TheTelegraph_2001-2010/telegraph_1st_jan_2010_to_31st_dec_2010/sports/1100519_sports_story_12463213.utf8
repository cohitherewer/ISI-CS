The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Collingwood: A massive achievement
                                                                                                                       7                                      Collingwood: A massive achievement
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Englands triumphant World Twenty20 captain Paul Collingwood has said their first ever ICC tournament trophy success is on a par with their Ashes triumph last year.         
	The result capped a memorable tournament for Collingwoods side who, after scraping through the group stage, won their final five games to clinch a breakthrough success.         
	We went over there to win a World Cup and we achieved that, Collingwood said. Its a massive achievement. Weve had a monkey on backs having not won a ICC trophy and put that right.         
	Its right up there with last years Ashes win, Collingwood said, before describing beating their arch rivals in the final as sweet.         
	Of course its different to Ashes. But in the last five years weve done well against them (Australia), he said.         
	Its a different form of game but beating them is always sweet. When you do something for the first time  winning the World Cup for us as the England cricket team  its definitely something very special, he said.         
	Youre playing against world-class outfits, theres always challenges that come along at different stages throughout the tournament. The way that the guys have overcome all them and come out on top, a lot of credit goes to the boys. The euphoria of winning it is very, very similar to the Ashes.

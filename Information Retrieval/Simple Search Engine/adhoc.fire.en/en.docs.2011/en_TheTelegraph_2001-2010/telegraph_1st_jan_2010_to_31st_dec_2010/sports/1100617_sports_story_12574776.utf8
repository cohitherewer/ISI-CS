The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pele should return to the museum: Diego
                                                                                                                       7                                        Pele should return to the museum: Diego
            JAYDEEP BASU            Diego Maradona during a training session                           
	Pretoria: Diego Maradona was unperturbed on the eve of Argentinas crucial group league match against South Korea on Thursday.         
	On Wednesday, the Argentina coach cancelled the scheduled training session at Soccer City in Johannesburg but found enough time to once again criticise Brazilian great Pele. He even took a dig at former French captain Platini, currently president of Uefa.         
	Asked his view on the match against South Korea, the left-footed genius, who was addressing the media at the Loftus Versfeld stadium, nonchalantly said: I want my team to be the champions and I have (Lionel) Messi, supported by a great team.         
	But Maradona was more interested in criticising Pele. Asked how he felt about Peles comment that making him Argentina coach was a mistake, the hero of the 1986 World Cup promptly replied that the Brazilian legend had grown old.         
	He (Pele) should return to the museum, said Maradona.         
	He also criticised Platini for calling him a great player but not a good coach. I am not surprised by what Platini said. I always had a distant relationship with him, we would just say hi and goodbye. But we all know what the French are like and Platini is French, he believes he is better than the rest of us.         
	Look at the World Cup ball this time. It is creating so many problems for all the players. I didnt want to talk about it. But why dont people like Pele and Platini do something to improve the quality of the ball and stop talking about me, said Maradona.         
	As to Thursdays engagement, the Argentina coach sounded extremely confident of victory against South Korea despite the absence of veteran midfielder Juan Sebastian Veron.         
	I think South Korea are a good team, fast and excellent. We have a lot of respect for them but we are going to win this match, he declared.         
	When a South Korean journalist asked who he considered Messis equivalent in Asia, Maradona said: With due respect to all of you and your football, you dont have a Messi yet. The journalist, who was hoping Maradona would take Koreas Manchester United star Park Ji-sungs name, looked disappointed.         
	Like Argentina, South Korea, too, made a winning start by defeating Greece 2-0 in Group B. The Asian giants, in fact, are on top of the group on better goal difference.         
	Maradona said Maxi Rodriguez would be taking the field in Verons place. I dont want Veron to aggravate the calf injury he is carrying at the moment, said the coach.         
	Maradonas South Korea counterpart, Huh Jung-moo, was a member of the national team that lost to Argentina 1-3 in the 1986 World Cup. Jung-moo, who also played for PSV Eindhoven, was known to be an aggressive footballer and was booked for a nasty foul on Maradona in that match.         
	The Argentine striker also accused his team of having played taekwondo football against them in 1986.         
	Maradona also renewed his call for fair play and strict refereeing. The referees have a lot to answer for if you want to see a match where the stars are not hampered. If Korea do something to Messi or (Carlos) Tevez, they will have to get a yellow card and, (after) the second time, they should be sent off.         
	We come here to see wonderful football and those who dont want to see that can go home. We are here to watch greats like Messi and Kaka. Rough football should not be encouraged, said Maradona.         
	Maradona said he was not unduly perturbed by the lack of goals in the World Cup.         
	Thats not a matter of concern. All the teams have come prepared and after studying their opponents, so you are watching fewer goals. I am sure there will be more goals, he said.

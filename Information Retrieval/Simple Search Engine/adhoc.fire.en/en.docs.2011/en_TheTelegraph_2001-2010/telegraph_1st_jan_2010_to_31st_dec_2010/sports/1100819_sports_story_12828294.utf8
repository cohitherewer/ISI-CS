	Calcutta: India qualified for the final of the 40-over leg of the ongoing Emerging Players Tournament, with a two-wicket win over Australian Institute of Sports (AIS) in their third league game in Brisbane.         
	India will play South Africa in the final on August 20, 2010, after the latter beat New Zealand comfortably by five wickets. New Zealand and AIS will face off for the third place.         
	AIS decision to bat after winning the toss backfired as Jaydev Unadkat continued his impressive show to scalp four wickets for just eight runs.         
	His pace colleague R. Vinay Kumar and Dhawal Kulkarni picked up two wickets apiece to bowl out the Australian side for 127 in 35.2 overs.         
	The hosts innings never got the momentum as they lost their first six wickets for a mere 48 runs.         
	It was Glenn Maxwells counter-attacking unbeaten 50-ball 63-run knock, studded with four fours and two sixes, which took the AIS innings beyond the 100-run mark.         
	 He added identical 31 runs with James Pattinson and Michell Starc for the seventh and eighth wickets, respectively, to give the AIS bowlers something to bowl at.         
	However, he ran out of partners in his unbeaten knock, as Unadkat  who finished with 4 for 8 in 5.2 overs  returned to mop up the tail and bowl out Australia for 127.         
	Brief Scores: AIS 127 in 35.2 ovs (J. Unadkat 4/8). India 128/8 in 28.3 ovs (C. Pujara 32, M. Pandey 23 no). India won by 2 wkts.

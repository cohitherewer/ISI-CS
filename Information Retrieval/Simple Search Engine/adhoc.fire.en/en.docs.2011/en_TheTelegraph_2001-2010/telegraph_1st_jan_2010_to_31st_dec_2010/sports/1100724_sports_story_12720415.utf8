The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nadal looking unbeatable

	With the Wimbledon fortnight during the World Cup 2010, it has been one of the greatest and most enjoyable of sporting summers. Spain with a revival of the buccaneering spirit of the conquistadors captured the world soccer title and Rafael Nadal with victories at Wimbledon and Roland Garros became the undisputed monarch of world tennis.         
	Two occurrences, however, struck a sad note in sporting hearts. First, the defeat of the Brazil with their mesmerising Joga Bonito style of play, and secondly, the end of the reign of the greatest player of all time the 28-year old Swiss Roger Federer, the lone Joga Bonito of the tennis world.         
	The Brazilians will come back with their magic and the Samba drums, but who will replace Federer now waltzing into the last pages of his illustrious career. There will never be another like him.         
	I first saw the decline in Federers game at the French Open. The hallmark of Federers game, which set him apart from the pack, was his ability to fearlessly hit winners and go for service aces on important points.         
	In Paris, I noticed that on more than one crucial occasion Federer tended to hold back and play safe rather than go flat out when an opening was there. Many, many years ago, I remember Jack Kramer telling me that at the highest level it was futile to put the ball back on pivotal points and hope that your opponent will make an error  they wont. Federers inability to close out matches is times foot in the door saying enough. Indeed, it is enough.                   Rafael Nadal       
	With a career spanning 900 matches, a record breaking 16 Grand Slams, Federer has smashed almost every record in tennis history. He must be rated as the greatest of all time. The only blemish, and who doesnt have one, is that in a head to head with Nadal, Federer trails by 7 matches to 14 ! Nadals spectacular victories on the slow clay courts of Roland Garros and on the fast grass at Wimbledon highlight the versatility of his game and signals the dawn of the Nadal era.         
	The whirling dervish-like swing of his topspin forehand, the viciously sliced backhand, Beckham-like swerve on passing shots and a flat coup de grace forehand, with a powerfully accurate serve have overwhelmed the opposition. Nadal is described by his support team as one who mixes the pace of 200 metre runner with the resistance of a marathon runner. They further add, we know he is Nadal and that he will overcome everything.         
	In politics time unravels it, but in tennis, for Nadal spin has brought control, consistency, direction and deception. Woven together and strung in Nadals steel frame it now rules the tennis world. Nadal has taken the game to an unbelievable level of accuracy, consistency and endurance. The challenge to Nadal will come from the well over 6-feet giants lurking in the top echelons of the game.         
	Their height leverages more power and a sharper angle on the service can open up a large vulnerable gap on the receivers court.         
	But will the challengers be able to measure up to the level of consistency demanded by Nadals game?         
	For the moment, Nadals standards seem unbeatable, provided he stays free of injury.

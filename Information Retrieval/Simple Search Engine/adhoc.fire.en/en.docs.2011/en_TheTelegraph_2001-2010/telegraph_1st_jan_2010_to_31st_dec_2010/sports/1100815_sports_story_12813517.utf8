            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), on Saturday, appointed Shabbir Ali as their coach for the upcoming CFL Premier Division.         
	The decision to appoint Shabbir was taken after much deliberation.         
	The current coach Prabir Mazumdar is finding it difficult to communicate with the players, Calcutta Port Trust official Shibaji Banerjee said.         
	Shabbir is a successful coach and when I approached him, he instantly agreed, he added.         
	Bengal regained the Santosh Trophy after 11 years under Shabbirs guidance.         
	The former India international coached Mohammedan Sporting from 2007-10.         
	He was given the boot after Sporting failed to qualify for the I-League first division.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Relishing Nadal, missing Serena 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Relishing Nadal, missing Serena 
                            
	London: The year, for tennis, had begun with two precise questions  whether Rafael Nadals body would support his quests and if Roger Federer would be able to keep his head above others, dominating the circuit.         
	And as a pleasant surprise, if one may call so, both men ended the year at the peak of their powers with promises of some mouth-watering new chapters of their rivalry in 2011.         
	The mens season came to a spectacular end with two of the greatest players of their generation enthralling the tennis enthusiast on opposite sides of the net, at Londons O2 Arena. That was a heart-warming site for fans the world over.         
	A paltry four meetings between the Spaniard and the Swiss in the past two years has left tennis followers feeling slightly hungry, but with the Australian Open not very far away on the calendar, both are eager to square off, once again.         
	With Serbias Novak Djokovic on a high after leading his country to a historic maiden Davis Cup title, against France, talented British Andy Murray and Swedens Robin Soderling being potential threats, the mens circuit heads into the new year in good health.         
	However, the womens game cannot boast of such luxury and is in a state of flux.         
	Serena Williams won the 2010 Australian Open and then claimed a 13th Grand Slam title at Wimbledon before treading on broken glass in a Munich restaurant in July. She has not played since and the Tour needs her back.         
	Serena had been the dominant personality on the WTA Tour and her absence has left a vacuum that the new generation of players are not yet ready to fill.         
	Denmarks 20-year-old Caroline Wozniacki ended the year as world No. 1 almost by default. All eyes will be on her to win her maiden Grand Slam title in Australia. More so because a still-struggling Serena will not be defending her crown.         
	Vera Zvonareva reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals but the Russian world no. 2 could walk through most city centres without attracting a second glance.         
	With Serena injured and sister Venus now the other side of 30, 2011 could be prime time for Belgians Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin to regain a stranglehold on the game.         
	The mens game is not flush with new faces either. There are no teenagers in the top 100 but, thankfully, the quality of the cream at the top persists.         
	Nadals year was simply phenomenal.         
	After ending 2009 short of confidence and form, with concerns about his knees, the 24-year-old Mallorcan caught fire during the claycourt season and blazed a trail back to the top of the rankings in devastating fashion.         
	In March, he slipped to fourth in the rankings, then, in May, he snapped an 11-month title drought by winning the Monte Carlo Masters for a sixth consecutive time  demolishing Fernando Verdasco 6-0, 6-1 in the final.         
	Suddenly the demons vanished and he swept to victory in Rome and Madrid before regaining his French Open crown with an emotional win over Soderling, at Roland Garros.         
	Unstoppable, Nadal roared to a second Wimbledon title and then won the U.S. Open for the first time, beating Djokovic in the final.         
	In doing so he became the youngest man to win a career Slam.         
	Nadals return to No. 1 in the rankings coincided with Federers crisis of confidence.         
	The Swiss was overpowered by Soderling on a soggy claycourt in the quarter finals of the French Open, ending a run of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semi-final appearances.         
	Worse was to follow.         
	At Wimbledon, in the quarter finals, big-hitting Czech Tomas Berdych put him to the sword.           (AGENCIES)

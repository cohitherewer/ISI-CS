            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After soccer, it was cricket where East Bengal triumphed over arch-rivals Mohun Bagan. East Bengal edged past Bagan by three runs in the final of the JC Mukherjee Trophy at the Eden on Monday.         
	East Bengal managed a modest 145 for six, thanks mainly to Sayan Sekhar Mondals 45, in their stipulated 20 overs.         
	In reply, Bagan were going great guns till the 12th over with both their openers, Anustup Majumdar and Subhomoy Das, scoring freely. But once Anustup was dismissed for 55 in the 13th over off Arnab Nandy, the Bagan wickets fell like nine pins.         
	For East Bengal, Arnab (4/28) did the star turn as he scalped three wickets  Subhomoy, Debabrata Das (0) and Arindam Ghosh (0)  in the 16th over to break Bagans backbone.         
	Brief scores         
	EB 145/6 in 20 overs (SS Mondal 45, D. Chakraborty 28). Mohun Bagan 142/6 in 20 overs (A. Majumdar 55, S. Das 46; A. Nandy 4/28). East Bengal won by 3 runs.

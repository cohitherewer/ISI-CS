                                                                                                                       7                                      Shahid Afridi amazed at Indias ouster
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): Shahid Afridi, the Pakistan captain, is amazed that India have exited from the World Twenty20.         
	Im neither happy nor sad, Im just amazed Hairani ho rahi hai... India had a good team and some even felt it was a favourite, Afridi told The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon.         
	Laughing, he added: T20 is such that khali pareshani aur hairani hoti hai... You cant predict as the game may change in one over...         
	Earlier, talking to the media in general, Afridi said: Australias been playing very well, but we have plans for them... After beating South Africa (in the Super Eights), my team is confident...         
	Yes, weve been a bit lucky in making it to Fridays semi-final, but we want to win and retain the trophy, thereby telling the world that we remain the best...         
	Afridi termed it normal for us, when asked about the off the field problems after the disastrous tour of Australia in the 2009-10 season.         
	According to Afridi, besides the first six overs, both batting and bowling, the fielding would be a critical factor.

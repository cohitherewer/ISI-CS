	London: Defending champion Roger Federer edged into the third round at Wimbledon with a 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (5) win over Serbian qualifier Ilija Bozoljac.         
	Federer did just enough to see off the unheralded Bozoljac, ranked 152nd in the world, but once again the air of invincibility that usually surrounds the six-time Wimbledon champion was completely absent.         
	The top seed had made heavy weather of his first round win over Colombian Alejandro Falla and this was no different as Federer struggled to maintain any momentum.         
	Although Federers phenomenal record at Wimbledon was enough to guarantee him the No. 1 seeding, ahead of world No. 1 Rafael Nadal, he has arrived in south-west London with serious questions over his form.         
	There was little sign of an improvement in his form as the Swiss star stumbled to an error-strewn victory over Falla in the first round on Monday.         
	Three-time Wimbledon finalist Andy Roddick moved into the third round with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (2) victory over Frances Michael Llodra while Novak Djokovic beat Taylor Dent 7-6(5), 6-1, 6-4.         
	Roddick, the fifth seed, was back in action on Centre Court for the first time since his 16-14 last-set defeat to Federer in last years final.         
	Somdev Dev Varmans Wimbledon campaign did not last long as the Indian and his Philippine partner Treat Conrad Huey went down to the Indo-Pak pair of Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi in the first round of the mens doubles.         
	Somdev fought tooth and nail in tandem with Huey but the experienced opponents chalked out a hard-fought 3-6, 7-5, 6-3,7-6 (8/6) win.         
	Third seeds Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy made a winning start as they beat Rik de Voest and Mischa Zverev in the first round. The Indo-Czech pair won 7-6(4), 6-4, 6-3 over the South African-German duo.         
	Sania Mirza with partner Caroline Wozniacki beat local British pair Melanie South and Anne Keothavong 6-4, 6-1 in the first round of the womens doubles.         
	Llodra, 30, had never made it past the second round at the All England Club, so he approached Amelie Mauresmo, the 2006 womens singles champion here, earlier this year to act as his guide to the intricacies of grass play.         
	The results were instant as the French left-hander won the pre-Wimbledon warm-up event at Eastbourne last week.         
	A few well-timed charges to the net were backed up by excellent volleying as Llodra took a 3-2 lead with the first break of the match.         
	Roddick was still on the back foot at the start of the second set and had to save two break points before finally holding serve. It proved a crucial moment. Roddick was able to impose himself more as he start to come into the net more.         
	The pressure on Llodra began to increase and he cracked, missing three volleys, as Roddick broke at 5-4 to level the match. Llodra is a top doubles player and his volleying skill earned another break point early in the third set.         
	But again Roddick held serve and the Frenchmans resolve seemed to crumble as he made a host of mistakes to gift Roddick the set. The fourth set was a tense affair as both held serve well. It went to a tie-break and Roddick was able to turn up the heat decisively as a series of booming forehands sealed the win.         
	Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams lost only 11 points on her serve and beat Ekaterina Makarova 6-0, 6-4. Venus is seeded second behind her sister Serena, who won when they met in last years final.         
	Justine Henin was also made to sweat during her second-round match. The seven-time Grand Slam champion twice was broken serving for the victory, then regrouped and beat Kristina Barrois 6-3, 7-5.         
	Fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters also advanced, beating Karolina Sprem 6-3, 6-2. Clijsters and Henin are both back at Wimbledon after coming out of retirement, and they could meet in the fourth round.         
	No. 13 Shahar Peer lost to Angelique Kerber 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. No. 11 Marion Bartoli advanced with a walkover against Petra Martic.         
	No. 15 Lleyton Hewitt, the 2002 champion, advanced when Evgeny Korolev retired trailing 6-4, 6-4, 3-0. American Mardy Fish served 30 aces but missed all nine of his break-point chances in the final set and lost to Florian Mayer 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.

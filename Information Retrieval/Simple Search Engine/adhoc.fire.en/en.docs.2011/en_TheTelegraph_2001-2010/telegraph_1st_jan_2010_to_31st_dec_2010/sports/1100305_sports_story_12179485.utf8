	Melbourne: Set to take over as the International Cricket Council (ICC) president from 2012, former Australian Prime Minister John Howard has rejected concerns about Indias dominance in international cricket, saying the countrys enormous stature should not be viewed in a negative light.         
	India is the second most populous country in the world, its cricket-mad, they are pluses, Howard said.         
	I think its entirely wrong to look at the Indian involvement in cricket in a negative light. I think of those millions of people in India and the subcontinent who play cricket They play it with a passion and love it, he added.

            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: Three favourites  Temptation, Credit Ease and Alize  are expected to deliver the goods in Wednesdays seven-event card which otherwise looks very competitive. Temptation is sitting pretty at the weights while Credit Ease is up against a poor opposition. Alize, on the other hand, boast of her western India form. The Pesi Shroff-trained filly is also working well.

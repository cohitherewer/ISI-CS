The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Maria set to script history 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Maria set to script history 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Maria Rebello                           
	New Delhi: Maria Rebello is set to make history this Sunday by becoming the first woman referee to supervise a match in the national championships for the Santosh Trophy.         
	Never before in Indian football has a woman referee been assigned to officiate in a senior national-level mens match. At best, they were either deputed to do junior tournaments or the womens national championships.         
	Bentla DCoth, another woman referee from Goa, was assigned a Santosh Trophy match in Kerala a few years ago but she had only been the fourth official.         
	Maria, 38, however, is different. Already a Fifa referee, the former international from Goa has performed creditably enough for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) to seriously consider including her on their elite panel.         
	I am grateful to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for providing me with the unique chance of supervising a Santosh Trophy match, Maria told The Telegraph from Goa.         
	There are three Santosh Trophy matches in Calcutta on Sunday. I am likely to referee in one of them, said Maria.         
	The former midfielder, who was known for her good ball control, said she was not feeling nervous before her big assignment.         
	There is no extra pressure on me for doing mens matches. I have done a number of matches in the Goan league. Of course, I never got a chance to supervise a Goa Professional League match.         
	The Sundays Santosh Trophy match could also turn out to be the stepping stone for Maria in her bid for a place onthe elite AFC panel.         
	An examiner from the Asian body is expected fly down to Calcutta on the day of the match to assess the Goan girl for the coveted job.         
	When I was a player, I excelled and played for India.         
	As a referee, too, I expect to reach the top, said a confident Maria.

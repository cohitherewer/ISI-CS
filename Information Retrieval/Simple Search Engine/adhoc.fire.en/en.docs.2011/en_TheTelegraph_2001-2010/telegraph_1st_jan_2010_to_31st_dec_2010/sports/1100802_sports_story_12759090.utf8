	Budapest: Mark Webber kept his feet firmly on the ground after winning Sundays Hungarian Grand Prix and taking over as leader in the F1 world championship.         
	His sixth career win lifted him four points clear of 2008 champion Lewis Hamilton of McLaren in the title race.         
	But, the Red Bull driver said he was taking nothing for granted. To maximise your opportunities is always good, irrespective of what happens to our rivals, said Webber.         
	But we are not getting ahead of ourselves. There are some big races coming up, all different challenges for us and technically for the cars. Its nice to have a few more points than other people, but we are not getting ahead of ourselves.         
	Webber said luck was on his side during an incident-packed race that saw his Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel pick up a drive-through penalty for infringing the safety car rules.         
	It was a bit of a gift for me  I havent had many but I will take it. Tough luck for Seb, said Webber, who started from second on the grid. Unless Seb had a technical problem, he was on pole, he was leading the first stint and unless he made a mistake it was probably his race.(agencies)

            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  Sourav   Ganguly    
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has, through a brief interaction with The Telegraph, saluted Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Sourav, by the way, has always been close to Sachin.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Sachins 50th Test hundred...         
	Its an unbelievable achievement... I doubt if anybody else will get there. Look at where Sachin has placed Indian cricket, what awesome feats.         
	Whether he watched the moment         
	I did... Saw the 100th run on the TV... I did get emotional.         
	First thoughts         
	Felt very happy for Sachin... What a quality hundred! Its an honour that I shared the India dressing room with him for 12-13 years.         
	The Sachin hundreds which stand out         
	(Laughs) All.         
	His take on where Sachin stands in the debate over who is the all-time greatest         
	Sachin, for me, is the greatest. Theres no debate.         
	This having been a fantastic year for Sachin         
	Absolutely... Just goes to show that age has nothing or little to do with performance. Hell keep getting hundreds till he decides to call it a day.         
	What sets Sachin apart         
	Ability, more than anything else... Sheer ability.         
	Finally, whether hell be calling/messaging Sachin         
	Ill definitely text him my congratulations.

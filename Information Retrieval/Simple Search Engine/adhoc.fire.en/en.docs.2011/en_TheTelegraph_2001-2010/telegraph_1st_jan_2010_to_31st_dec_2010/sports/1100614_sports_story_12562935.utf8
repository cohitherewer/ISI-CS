The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dutch dream of total recall
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dutch dream of total recall
            JAYDEEP BASU              Robin van Persie during a training session at the   Soccer City, on Sunday                      
	Johannesburg: After Arjen Robben had been ruled out of the Netherlands first World Cup match against Denmark on Monday because of a hamstring problem, Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk seems to be taking no chances.         
	On Sunday, at the Soccer City, when Wesley Sneijder collided with defender Khalid Boulahrouz during the practice session and was seen lying on the ground, Marwijk looked more worried than Sneijder himself. Before anyone could react, the coach ran onto the pitch and asked his most valuable player to quit the ground immediately.         
	I know nothing happened, it was only a minor blow on the head but I didnt want to take any chance, said the coach after the session. Robben is already out tomorrow (Monday). So I didnt want to take any chance. There are too many injuries in this World Cup.         
	Marwijk cannot be faulted for being extra cautious. He knows that after 70s, when Dutch made their mark in world football with their Total Football, this could be the Netherlands best chance to make a serious attempt to win the World Cup. They have quite a few talented players and the team, if the qualifying matches are any indication, are playing in perfect harmony highlighted by a fluid style.         
	Robben, who picked up a hamstring injury against Hungary, preferred to stay back at team hotel. The Bayern Munich star is believed to be regaining fitness and may play in the second group league match.         
	Though the Orange will miss the thunderous left foot and the electrifying pace of Robben, they still have a bunch of footballers who could easily be world beaters. While Sneijder is going to be the man to watch in the midfield with his accurate shots and perfect passes, Robin Van Persie and Rafael van der Vaart are the other two players whom the opponents would like to keep under strict vigil.         
	Thankfully for Marwijk, Van Persie, after missing much of the Premier League season, is fit and the striker would be ready with his intelligent and imaginative shots. Van der Vaart is another tough midfielder with excellent passing abilities.         
	From the training session, it was clear that Van Persie, Van der Vaart, Sneijder and Mark van Bommel would form the core group of the Netherlands attack. On Sunday, Marwijk made these four players stand in the middle and take a series of shots and headers at the goal with crosses coming from both the sides. For half-an-hour the four footballers did the target practice before the players were divided into two groups to play a match.         
	Marwijk, however, once again underlined his displeasure for the Jabulani ball. Its a funny kind of ball. Its very unpredictable when in the air. But I think we can manage it since the ball seems to be okay on the ground. We would like to play it along the ground, the coach commented.         
	Defender Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who is expected to make his 100th appearance on Monday, said his team would fulfil the expectations of the fans this time. We were always a good team but could never win the Cup. It wont be like that this time. We have a team that desperately wants to be the champions, the defender said.

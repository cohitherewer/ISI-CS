The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sunderland hold Arsenal

	London: Darren Bent scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time to earn Sunderland a 1-1 home draw after 10-man Arsenal had scored a freak goal but also missed a penalty in a thunderous Premier League clash on Saturday.         
	Arsenal had led through a bizarre early Cesc Fabregas goal, had Alex Song sent off after 55 minutes and saw Tomas Rosicky blaze a 74th minute penalty over the bar but just when it seemed they had held out for the win England striker Bent struck.         
	Some inspired substitutions gave a relieved Tottenham Hotspur a 3-1 home victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League on Saturday when they scored three goals in the last 13 minutes.         
	Trailing 1-0 at halftime, Harry Redkapp played his hand to perfection as Rafael van der Vaart and replacements Roman Pavlyuchenko and Alan Hutton brought an impressive turnaround.         
	Everton could not repeat their own comeback heroics from last week as they lost at home in the league for the first time in 10 months, thanks to a superb 45th-minute strike by Newcastle Uniteds Hartem Ben Arfa.         
	Birmingham Citys unbeaten start to the season ended at The Hawthorns as West Bromwich Albion came from 1-0 down at halftime with three goals in 10 minutes to win 3-1, while Aston Villa against Bolton Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers v Fulham and Stoke City against West Ham United all ended 1-1.         
	Spurs, who made their Champions League debut with a draw against Werder Bremen on Tuesday, looked to be suffering a European hangover as Steven Fletcher put Wolves ahead.         
	Fullback Hutton went on for the second half and earned the 77th-minute penalty that Van der Vaart converted.           (AGENCIES)

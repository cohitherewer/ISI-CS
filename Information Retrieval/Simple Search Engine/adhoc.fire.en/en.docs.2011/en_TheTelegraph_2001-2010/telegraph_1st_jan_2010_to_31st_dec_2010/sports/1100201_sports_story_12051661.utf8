	Luanda: The Egypt team completed a hat-trick of African Nations Cup triumph when substitute Mohamed Gedos 85th-minute strike ensured 1-0 win against Ghana on Sunday. No other team has won the biennial tournament three consecutive times. Gedos curling shot inside the penalty box meant that Egypt have won the title for seventh time. Ghana hoping to win their first continental crown since 1982, dominated for most of the match but failed to create any decisive chances.         
	Egypt played without suspended striker Mahmoud Fathallah while Ghana was at full strength with goalkeeper Richard Kingson overcoming a minor hamstring injury to find a place in the playing XI.         
	For the first time in 53 years, the two teams were pitted against each other. Both teams started cautiously, scrapping for possession in midfield and struggling to create chances.         
	Ghana defender Samuel Inkoom tried his luck with a free kick from 30 meters in the eighth minute, while Egypt captain Hamed Hassan fared no better with a long-range effort five minutes later which flew over the horizontal.         
	Fielding four members of the team that won the U-20 World Cup last year, Ghana defended neatly and were able to move swiftly into the Egypt half.         
	However, Ghana failed to really support its strikers. Enjoying the support of the Angolan crowd, Ghana had another chance in the 15th minute but Agyeman Badus shot from a free-kick was deflected wide. Andre Ayew, the son of African great Abedi Pele, then failed to take advantage of Egypts poor clearance in the 20th minute, fluffing his half-volley while unmarked in the box.         
	Moments before Kwadwo Asamoah fired a 30-meter drive directly into the hands of Essam El Hadary. Hassan tried to latch onto a free kick with his hand four minutes before the interval but couldnt catch the ball. Asamoah Gyan, who scored Ghanas winners against both Angola and Nigeria in the previous stages, went close in the 52nd minute with a perfectly curled free kick that was tipped over the bar by El Hadary.

The New Zealander defended her shot put title at the Nehru Stadium. Adams, who threw 20.47 metre on her first attempt, went on to beat the 20m mark on all her remaining five attempts.         
	Altogether, four Games records were created in the track and field event.         
	In the mens 20 km walk, Jared Tallent of Australia came first with a Games record of 1 hour 22 minutes and 18 seconds. In 20km womens walk, Jo Johnson of England won the gold with a Games record of 1 hour 34 minute and 22 seconds. Jareds wife Claire came second.

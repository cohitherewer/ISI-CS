	Hobart: Australia captain Ricky Ponting made Pakistan pay dearly for their mistakes in the field as he brought up only his second Test century on his home ground to guide his team out of early trouble on the opening day of the third Test at Bellerive Oval.         
	After being reduced to 80 for three at lunch, the hosts finally got going and ended the day on an imposing 302 for three.         
	Ponting took full advantage of being dropped on nought by ending the day unbeaten on 137, while vice-captain Michael Clarke also scored an unbeaten century as the pair combined for a record 231-run fourth-wicket stand for Australia, against Pakistan.         
	Things looked promising for the tourists in the opening session when, having lost the toss, they claimed the wickets of Simon Katich, Shane Watson and Mike Hussey.

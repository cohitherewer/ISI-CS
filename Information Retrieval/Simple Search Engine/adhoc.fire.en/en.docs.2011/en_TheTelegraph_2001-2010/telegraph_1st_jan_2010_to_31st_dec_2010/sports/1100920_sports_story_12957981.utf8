The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bopanna wins a world war
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bopanna wins a world war
            K. KUMARASWAMY               Rohan Bopanna celebrates with Somdev Dev Varman, in Chennai, on Sunday                      
	Chennai: Sunday morning, Somdev Dev Varman woke up to a text message from teammate Mahesh Bhupathi. Wake up boy, the sun is out, it flashed on the screen.         
	The message portended a change in conditions. And as the day wore out, it also marked a reversal in fortunes of historic proportions for the Indian Davis Cup team.         
	As the sun came out in full for the first time during the World Group playoff tie, the Brazilians wilted under the typically hot and humid conditions of Chennai. The Indians pounced on the opportunity to clinch a thrilling 3-2 victory and advance to the World Group next year.         
	Thomaz Bellucci, who had outlasted Rohan Bopanna in a four and a half hour marathon on the opening day, succumbed to the heat and conceded the first reverse singles match against Dev Varman when the score read 6-7(3), 0-4.         
	Bopanna then stepped up to deliver the knock-out punch, thrashing Ricardo Mello 6-3, 7-6(2), 6-3. That was some response to the murmurs about his temperament after his close loss on Friday.         
	Ever since Indias debut in the Davis Cup in 1921, the team have never come from being 0-2 down on the first day to win a tie. Only seven nations have done it before in the 110-year history of the tournament.         
	Until Saturday, the skies had been partly cloudy, which made the visitors comfortable. But, luckily for the Indians, the sky god decided to smile on them at the most crucial stage in the tie.         
	As a coincidence, it was the most athletic and fit player in the team to benefit from his blessings. Hot and humid means its good for me and Bops (Bopanna). We are used to playing in these conditions, Dev Varman said.         
	After Brazil won both the singles on Friday, their captain, Joao Zwetsch, had talked about how his players were physically prepared to play in humid conditions and mentally tuned to slug it out for hours.         
	On Sunday, the opposite proved to be true. Both Dev Varman and Bopanna were the fitter players on court and also mentally up for a fight.         
	The heat was harder today than Friday. Unfortunately Thomaz (Bellucci) was not feeling well and although Ricardo was alright, Rohan Bopanna played a fantastic match, the visiting skipper said.         
	Bellucci seemed to preserve himself even before the first set went into the tiebreak. He saved three break points in the ninth game, but didnt exert himself to reach some of the balls, which unfortunately for Dev Varman missed the line by inches.         
	Things quickly deteriorated for the Brazilian in the tiebreak. After putting a drop shot into the net, Bellucci recovered with a backhand winner. But the sun was quickly sapping his energy and a double fault followed by some weak ground strokes gave the Indian the set.         
	Bellucci then took a lengthy toilet break but that hardly helped. He took a medical time-out after being broken in the second game to give India a 3-0 lead. His blood pressure and pulse were checked and, fortunately, found to be normal.         
	But once Dev Varman broke him for the second time in the next game, Bellucci threw in the towel. Actually, he put his hands up even as before the point was completed.         
	Bopanna was in roaring form against Mello whose only chance in the match came in the second set when he had two break points in the 10th game. After wriggling out of the tight spot, Bopanna clinched the tiebreak with the help of a few unforced errors from Mello.

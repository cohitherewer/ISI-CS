  - Team India earn one ratings point to widen gap with South Africa
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Gautam Gambhir      
	Calcutta: India reaped rich dividends in the ICC test rankings released Thursday with the team gaining one ratings point for the clean sweep over Bangladesh and series heroes Sachin Tendulkar and Zaheer Khan making memorable leaps on the individual rankings lists.         
	India now have 125 ratings points and the Mahendra Singh Dhonis lead second-ranked South Africa by five ratings points going into the two-Test rubber that starts February 6 in Nagpur.         
	The Proteas can topple India to regain the top spot if they win the series at 1-0 or better. However, they will slip to third, behind Australia, if India win both the Tests.         
	In the individual rankings, Tendulkar and Zaheer have returned to the top 10 for batsmen and bowlers respectively. Tendulkar, who started the second Test in 13th position, has now jumped four places to ninth after scoring his 45th century. This is the first time since December 2005 that Tendulkar features in the top 10. He last headed the batting table in August 2002, after the Leeds Test against England.         
	Gautam Gambhir, the No.1 Test batsman, extended his advantage over Graeme Smith while Virender Sehwag consolidated his hold on No.6.         
	Rahul Dravid, too, has moved up the order and the former India captain, who scored 111 before retiring hurt in the second Test in Dhaka, has jumped four places to No.15.         
	Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal is the other batsman to make an upward movement in the latest rankings. Tamim scored nought and 151 in Mirpur and has vaulted 13 places for a share of the 42nd spot with New Zealands Brendon McCullum.         
	However, V.V.S. Laxman has dropped four places to 19th after missing out on the second Test due to injury. A player loses one per cent of his rating for every Test missed.         
	Zaheer has jumped five places after recording his maiden 10-wicket haul and the pacer now finds himself Zaheer to be Indias highest-ranked bowler at No.6 on the list. Harbhajan Singh, however, has slipped two places to eighth position after managing just two wickets in the final Test.         
	In the rankings for Test all-rounders, Bangladeshs Shakib-al Hasan has slipped one place to fifth. The top three in this list features two players who were on opposite sides in the England versus South Africa Test series.         
	Both Jacques Kallis and Graeme Swann impressed as the four-match rubber ended tied 1-1 and the Proteas all-rounder continues to sit at the top of the list.

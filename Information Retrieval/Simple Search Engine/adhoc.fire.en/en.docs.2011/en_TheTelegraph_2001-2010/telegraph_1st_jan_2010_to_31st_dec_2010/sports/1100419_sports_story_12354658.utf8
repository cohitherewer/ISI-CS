                                                                                                                       7                                      Chargers storm into semis
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Neither the blasts in Bangalore nor the scorching heat in the capital could dampen the spirits of the spectators at the Kotla on Sunday. They turned up in large numbers to watch what was to be virtually a knockout match in the Indian Premier League (IPL) but returned home a disappointed lot as hosts Delhi DareDevils lost the battle for a semi-final spot with their 11-run defeat against the Deccan Chargers.         
	The win, fifth on the trot for the defending champions, took them to the semi-finals in the eight-team competition with 16 points. Bad luck for the DareDevils then after they lost four out of their last five matches.         
	In a do-or-die battle, the Chargers became the first outstation team in the current edition to win the toss at the Kotla but could not really take advantage of that. Faced with some accurate bowling by the DareDevils bowlers, especially Umesh Yadav and Ashish Nehra, Adam Gilchrists boys could manage only 145 for seven on a wicket that once again proved to be a slow one.         
	But what they could not do with the bat, the Chargers made up for with some superb fielding and precision bowling. Rohit Sharma, the hero in the previous match against Kings XI Punjab, disappointed with the bat but took three terrific catches to leave the DareDevils reeling.         
	Sharmas three catches  two in the slips and one at short mid-wicket  sent back the DareDevils three most important batsmen, David Warner, Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir.         
	Interestingly, when Paul Collingwood (51 not out) and Nehra (22 not out) made a late charge in the last four overs, almost threatening to take the match away, Rohit Sharma was the culprit for having dropped the Englishman twice in a span of two overs. The heroics of the two later order batsmen, however, werent enough to make the DareDevils day as they could only manage 134 for seven.         
	Earlier in the day, the DareDevils were able to restrict the visitors to a score that looked achievable even though the team batting second has always faced problems on this pitch. Except for Andrew Symonds, none of the Chargers batsmen could stay at the wicket for long.         
	Symondss innings of 54 was thoroughly entertaining and studded with some highly authoritative shots.

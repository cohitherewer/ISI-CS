            Duncan White            Arsene Wenger                           
	For Arsene Wenger, who loves his numbers, the statistics make grim reading: Arsenal have lost their last five games against Chelsea and have not scored in nearly five hours of play against the champions.         
	Against Manchester United they have lost five and drawn one of their last six games  and that draw came when United had already wrapped up the title and were looking to the Champions League final.         
	After Arsenals latest defeat against a title rival, against United a fortnight ago, Cesc Fabregas admitted that sometimes we seem scared of losing these big games.         
	From Arsenals captain and most competitive player, it was a surprising admission but at least an honest answer. Both United and Chelsea have had real problems on the pitch this season and are arguably as vulnerable as they have been for some time  but Arsenal have already lost to both.         
	Wenger pays a lot of attention to team psychology. The fair wage structure at the club is designed to foster unity while Wenger uses Jacques Crevoisier, an accomplished sports psychologist, to provide profiles of his players.         
	Most of his public statements are designed to protect his players and he would rather look stubborn or foolish than undermine his players after a game.         
	Yet so entrenched has become the inhibition against United and Chelsea that Wenger has welcomed Fabregass public admission. The team need to acknowledge they have a problem before they can confront it.         
	Im not unhappy he has said that because Cesc is a winner. The most important thing for the top-level teams and the top-level players is to have an honest and fair assessment of what happened with your performance. With that you can correct it. If you hide in front of the truth you can never correct it.         
	There can be no hiding at the Emirates on Monday. In the 10 Premier League games since beating Arsenal at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea have won three, drawn four and lost three.         
	With Didier Drogba, who has battered and bullied Arsenal over the years, lacking his usual menace since contracting malaria, this is an opportunity for Arsenal to break their run and, in doing so, reassert their seriousness as title contenders  not so much to the fans, but to the players themselves.         
	I do not need to change the Arsenal mentality because the Arsenal mentality is fantastic and very strong. This team is hungry and the players want success.         
	It is more about belief and belief comes by focusing on playing together and the way we want to play rather than thinking, can we beat Chelsea or not.         
	We can beat Chelsea but the best way to beat them is to focus on what we want to achieve and how we want to achieve it.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modis leak irks BCCI secretary
                                                                                                                       7                                      Modis leak irks BCCI secretary
                      
	New Delhi: BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan kept mum on whether he would recuse from proceedings against Lalit Modi but lashed out at the suspended IPL chairman and commissioner for his habit of leaking information to the media.         
	In a 14-page letter to BCCI president Shashank Manohar, Modi Tuesday launched a scathing attack on Srinivasan, saying the secretary should not be part of the panel adjudicating charges of financial irregularities against him.         
	Asked if he would stay away from the proceedings and oblige Modi, an annoyed Srinivasan said: Im afraid I cannot discuss these issues in the media. Mr Modi has this habit of leaking information and letters to selected press but I cannot comment on these issues, Srinivasan said.         
	In his letter, Modi said Manohar, too, should stay away from the proceedings, since it would tantamount to being a judge, witness and a potential co-notice in the case.         
	Manohar, however, was not available for comment.         
	Charged with allegations of bid-rigging and proxy investment, Modi first sent a staggering 15,000-page reply to the showcause notice and followed it up with another letter Tuesday in which he targeted Manohar but came down more heavily on Srinivasan with a series of allegations including that of match-fixing.         
	Modi, in fact, requested Manohar to serve a show cause notice to Srinivasan and also suspend him pending an investigation. Modi alleged Srinivasan had grossly misused his power as BCCI secretary and said there was a clear case of conflict of interests since he was also owner of the Chennai Super Kings team in the IPL.         
	Modi said if allowed to be part of the panel deciding his fate, Srinivasan would have an axe to grind against him.         
	Modi accused Srinivasan of trying to fix matches by hand-picking a panel of umpires to officiate Chennai Super Kings matches in the IPL. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SRK to miss BCCI meet
                                                                                                                       7                                        SRK to miss BCCI meet
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shah Rukh Khan                           
	Calcutta: Shah Rukh Khan, principal owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), perceived to have been close to Lalit Kumar Modi, wont be attending Thursdays meeting called by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	The meeting, in Mumbai, will feature the BCCI brass and the 10 Indian Premier League (IPL) franchisees  either the owners themselves or their nominees.         
	Shah Rukh is overseas and Ive myself returned to Mumbai today. Im not sure whether Ill be representing KKR or not. The call will be taken tomorrow (Wednesday). Its not a big issue, co-owner Jay Mehta told The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon.         
	Mehtas wife Juhi Chawla is a co-owner, too.         
	Incidentally, days before Modis suspension from all posts in the BCCI (including those of chairman and commissioner of the IPL), on April 26, Mehta had himself given a TV interview which hadnt gone down very well with many in the BCCI.         
	The meeting has been called by the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, as the top officials arent really familiar with the franchisees. For, till his suspension, Modi had monopolised the interactions on behalf of the BCCI.         
	Actually, for the franchisees, Modi was pretty much the face of the BCCI.         
	That has changed and the franchisees must now learn to deal with Manohar and the IPLs interim chairman, Chirayu Amin. The latter, who is also a BCCI vice-president, will be present as well.         
	As the objective is to know the franchisees, a formal agenda hadnt been set till Tuesday evening. The owners do wish to raise issues, but may not do so till the next meeting. Or, they could convey the same informally, at the very first opportunity, to Manohar and Amin.         
	For both the IPL and the franchisees, plenty has to be sorted out before the fourth edition, next year.

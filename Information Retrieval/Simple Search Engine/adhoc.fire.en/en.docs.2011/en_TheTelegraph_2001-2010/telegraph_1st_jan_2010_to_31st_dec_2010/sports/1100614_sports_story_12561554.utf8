The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cant take Ivorians lightly: Cristiano
                                                                                                                       7                                        Cant take Ivorians lightly: Cristiano
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Cristiano Ronaldo during a practice session                           
	Magaliesburg: As the Portugal squad came out for the practice session, the buzz was very difficult to miss. The news had just trickled in that Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba is unlikely to take the pitch when Portugal play the African nation in Group G on Tuesday.         
	Drogba is still nursing the elbow injury that he suffered in a friendly match against Japan a few days before the start of the World Cup.         
	Yet, there was one man who looked unperturbed. Wearing a green jersey, Cristiano Ronaldo seemed in a jovial mood as he came out of the team bus. He had a very subdued qualifiers, leaving his fans disappointed. In those seven matches he failed to get his name in the scoresheet!         
	As the team walked into the ground at this rural practice centre on the suburbs of Johannesburg, Ronaldo was seen juggling the ball and talking to Simao Sabrosa with whom the superstar is rumoured to have developed a sour relationship during the training camp.         
	Yes, I know Drogba may not play against us. It is definitely a big blow for Ivory Coast but it is not going to give us a big advantage, Ronaldo said later.         
	Our match is against Ivory Coast, not Drogba, he said.         
	As a battery of photographers and television crew followed the Real Madrid forward, he stepped up his pace but couldnt avoid the series of questions thrown at him.         
	Ivory Coast is a very good team  they have some highly talented players, said Ronaldo. Like most African teams, they are quick and physically strong. And if Drogba plays, they are definitely going to be stronger. We respect their strength.         
	To stop Drogba, the defence will have to be on their toes. Like any great striker, if you switch off he will punish you. But let me remind you again, no one is unstoppable and Drogba is no exception.         
	Ronaldo admitted he, to some extent, was worried over his form in international matches. I should play better and Portugal should win an international tournament to prove they are one of the best teams in the world.         
	In 2004, we came close to winning the Euro Cup. Our match against France in 2006 World Cup was a bitter defeat. I am sure I will play well this time because I am very demanding with myself. My biggest objective is to help the team and I will do that, Ronaldo said.         
	Carlos Queirozs Portugal side are currently ranked third in the world but struggled to qualify, and their best World Cup finish was in 1966 where they finished third.

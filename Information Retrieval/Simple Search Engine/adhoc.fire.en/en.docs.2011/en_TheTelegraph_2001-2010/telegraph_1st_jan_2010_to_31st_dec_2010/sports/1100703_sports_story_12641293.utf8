The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Targeting net gain
                                                                                                                       7                                      Targeting net gain
            ANSHUMAN ROY      Player of the week                                  David Villa        
	Right now, everything is going the David Villa way. The Spain striker already has four goals against his name and, along with Gonzalo Higuian, is in the running for the Golden Boot Award. And should Spain stay in the tournament till July 11, who knows he may even surpass Raul as Spains all-time highest scorer.         
	Till date he has scored 42 goals from 62 matches and needs two more to equal Raul who got 44 from 102 matches.         
	An out-an-out striker, this World Cup we are seeing a different Villa. He starts on the wide and then cuts in to create confusio in the rival defence. And he is also dropping deep to stifle the opponents attack.         
	As his coach Vicente del Bosque said after the Portugal match: He is doing a wonderful job for us. And we want him to continue with that. Its not just his coach. His teammates, the legends and the fans are going gaga over Barcelonas new acquisition. If Xabi Alonso says Villa is a threat for any defence, Eusebio is putting his money on this 28-year-old to win the Golden Boot Award. Last week, he scored twice. One against Chile, and then the winner, that threw Cristiano Ronaldo out of the World Cup. The goal against Honduras was simply superb.         
	A delightful 45 metre chip which dipped into the empty Honduras net before the defenders could retreat. And against Portugal? Linking up with his would-be Barcelona teammates  Andreas Iniesta and Xavi  Villa was at the right place at the right time. A poke which Eduardo partially managed to stave off and off the rebound he kept his cool to steer it into the far corner. That particular move actually showed what to expect when the trio take the field in Barcelona colours. A pure Barcelona move  Iniesta, Xavi and Villa said one. Barca do it for Spain, should be the headline, advised another.         
	Villa is one of the few stars who has been in prolific form both for the club as well his country. Whether its Sporting Gijon, Zaragoza or Valencia, Villas goal scoring boots never ditched him. Complemented beautifully by Fernando Torres in the past, this World Cup has proved that Villa can do it alone. With Torres at his misfiring best, the onus is on Villa to deliver and till now he has done with admirably. Agreed he has missed chances, the penalty bungle against Honduras and spurning at least three on that night, Villa is getting into the groove as the Cup reaches its business end.         
	As a single striker  Spain went with 4-5-1 against Switzerland and Villa never looked at ease  though he tends to struggle. That because as a short statured marksman he needs a bigbodied striking partner like Torres or Fernando Llorente to support him.         
	On Saturday, against Paraguay, Del Bosque is expected to start with two frontliners once again. And who knows that day itself we may see Villa becoming Spains all-time highest scorer. A hat-trick we will all like to see from David, the Goaliath!

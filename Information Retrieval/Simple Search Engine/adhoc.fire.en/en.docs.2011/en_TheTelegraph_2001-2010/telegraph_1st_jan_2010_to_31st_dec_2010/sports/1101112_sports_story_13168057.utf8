The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tiger hits 2-under 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tiger hits 2-under 
                      
	Melbourne: Tiger Woods produced his most consistent ball striking since he remodelled his swing for a two-under 69 to finish within touching distance of the Australian Masters first round leaders, Thursday.         
	Woods made three birdies and a bogey in his first round in near perfect conditions at Victoria Golf Club but was left to rue some wayward putting as he finished four shots adrift of Australian trio Alistair Presnell, Adam Bland and Daniel Gaunt.         
	That was probably the highest score I could have shot today, the world No. 2 said.         
	I really played well and hit a lot of good shots. Im probably hitting the ball better for stretches of six or seven holes but nothing like this for the entire day. I really hit it good.         
	Woods has not won a title since claiming the gold jacket at nearby Kingston Heath on Melbournes sandbelt a year ago. (Reuters)

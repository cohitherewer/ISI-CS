	St Johns: Hashim Amla hit 92 as South Africa posted 300 for five against the West Indies on Monday in the second one-day International at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.         
	The 27-year-old opener, who made a century in the first one-dayer that the South Africans won convincingly, struck seven fours in his 95-ball innings, while Jacques Kallis added 85 off 89 deliveries.         
	There were also useful contributions from A.B. de Villiers (41), captain Graeme Smith (37) and David Miller (26 not out) as the visitor set the West Indies a huge target.         
	Kieron Pollard led the hosts attack with two for 39 while Jerome Taylor grabbed two for 50.         
	South Africa won the toss before Smith and Amla gave their side a solid platform with an opening stand of 89 from 16 overs.         
	Left-hander Smith, dropped on 29, was eventually bowled behind his back when sweeping at left-arm spinner Nikita Miller but Amla found another solid ally in Kallis, the pair adding 79 for the second wicket to further frustrate the West Indies.         
	Amla, who made 102 in a victory at the same venue on Saturday, was closing in on his third one-day hundred when he clipped Taylor to midwicket.         
	South Africa continued to coast along as Kallis and De Villiers put on 71 before Pollard removed both in the final 10 overs and Taylor added the cheap scalp of Alviro Petersen (1).         
	Kallis, playing his 300th one-dayer, struck the ball crisply and rotated the strike during his 89-ball knock in which he struck only four boundaries on the sluggish outfield.         
	Kallis has been in superb form this season and this showed in his innings Monday.         
	De Villiers holed out to long off while Kallis, who struck four fours, miscued into the off-side.         
	Meanwhile, the final one-day International and the first Test between West Indies and South Africa next month could be moved from Kingston to another Caribbean island due to violence in the Jamaican capital.         
	The WICB (West Indies Cricket Board) is monitoring the situation in Jamaica and is discussing it with the major stakeholders and will take a decision (on whether to move the matches) in the coming days, a spokesman for the board told reporters on Monday.         
	The ODI is scheduled to be played on June 3 and the Test from June 10-14.         
	Jamaica declared a state of emergency in two parishes of Kingston on Sunday after shooting and firebomb attacks on police stations by suspected supporters of an alleged drug lord who faces extradition to the United States.         
	Gunmen fired on two police stations and set fire to another. At least one policeman was injured.           (AGENCIES)

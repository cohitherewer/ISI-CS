The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Swann rises to the third spot
                                                                                                                       7                                        Swann rises to the third spot
  - Virender Sehwag retains his numero uno position       A STAFF REPORTER            Graeme Swann                                 
	Calcutta: India continue to be the No.1 team while opener Virender Sehwag remains the longest formats numero uno batsman in the latest update of the International Cricket Councils Test rankings on Monday.         
	Outside the top-10 on the batting list are senior pros V.V.S. Laxman and Rahul Dravid at No.14 and No.16, respectively.         
	Making the big strides was England off-spinner Graeme Swann who might have only gained two places but has become the highest-placed slow bowler in the world at No.3 in the bowling rankings.         
	Swann has overtaken Pakistans Mohammed Asif and Muttiah Muralidharan following his six wickets at Old Trafford.         
	There is an imminent scope for change in the team rankings as South Africa embark on a three-Test series in the West Indies which begins with the first match in Trinidad on Thursday. Graeme Smiths team must win the series to stay in second position. A drawn series would see the Proteas drop to third behind Australia and if they happened to lose, , they would fall to No.4 with Sri Lanka being promoted to third.         
	A drawn series or better for Chris Gayle and Co. would move them above New Zealand and Pakistan into sixth.

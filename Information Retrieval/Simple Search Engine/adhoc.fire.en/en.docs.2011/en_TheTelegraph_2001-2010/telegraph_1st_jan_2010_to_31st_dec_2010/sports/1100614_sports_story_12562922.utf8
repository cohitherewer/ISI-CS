The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Can Kaka deliver?

	Brazil are always the worlds favourites or second favourites to win the World Cup  but there is often scepticism in Brazil, and this year is no different. Dungas squad selection has divided opinion. Some may disagree with his 23-man list but few can deny that it is very much Dungas squad  and it should be very difficult to beat.         
	The squad was all about the outcome of three years work rather than the recent form of outstanding prospects such as Paulo Henrique Ganso and Neymar from Santos. Tried-and-tested found favour ahead of exciting newcomers. Pre-tournament matches against Zimbabwe and Tanzania highlighted some frailties but Dunga will have used them to reinforce a sense of unity.         
	Where Dunga really got it right was in leaving Adriano behind. The strikers attitude at Flamengo flew in the face of what Dunga was preaching as national coach, so, although he is more limited, Wolfsburg frontman Grafite.         
	Their opening group match on Tuesday against North Korea would appear an apparent formality but I think it may actually be Brazils toughest, because the opposition is unknown. Secrecy surrounds them. The onus is on Brazil, and North Korea has little to lose. Anything less than a win for Brazil will increase media and popular pressure, while making qualification so much tougher as well.         
	Brazil must approach it as just another game and avoid becoming distracted by unusual opponents  but that is easy to say, and not always so easy to carry out. I would not change the team for this encounter but would expect Dunga to demand Brazil be a little more assertive and take the initiative.         
	The suggestion that Brazil is in a group of Death is an exaggeration though: Brazil and Portugal remain favourites to progress. The Group of Death label I think applies better to Group A, which was reflected in the opening day.         
	But my main concern about this Brazilian team is the fitness and form of Kaka. He is a wonderful player of course but experiencing a really rough patch.         
	He had to prove his match fitness against Tanzania but his performance did not dispel the doubts following a mediocre season in Spain. It may be that in this World Cup Kaka will be unable to produce what we expect of him and what he himself expects to deliver. And, worryingly, there is no adequate replacement for Kaka in the party.         
	Dunga talks about Julio Baptista performing Kakas role but it is not like-for-like. Ronaldinho would have been a better stand-in, with considerable World Cup experience but Ronaldinhos inclusion should have come at the expense of Kleberson.         
	Kaka, Luis Fabiano and Robinho form the cutting edge of Dungas counter-attacking style, but I think Brazil is a little lopsided, looking more effective down the right with Maicon than it does on the other flank. Marking, along with movement of the ball from defence, also need to improve. Goalkeeper Julio Cesar was a fitness worry this week. He is a very important figure because the security of the team starts with him.

	Chennai: Leander Paes, one of Indias most successful Davis Cup players of all time, is looking forward to Indias tie against Brazil over the weekend.         
	On the tour, we play on different surfaces and players, day in and day out. I dont think it really matters, because at the end of the day, you got to beat them to win the tie, Paes commented when asked whether Brazils Thomaz Bellucci and Ricard Mello, who are left handed, would pose a problem for the Indian team.         
	As for the hard court, it is very even because on the tour, you either play on clay or on hard court. So, we are all used to it, he further added when questioned whether Chennais hardcourts and weather would play to an advantage for the home team.         
	Paes, 37, said Brazil was close to his heart as he had a memorable time in the football crazy country.         
	Brazilians are very nice people and I had the honour of playing a match in front of Pele, but these players here are tough and strong, Paes said. For sure, this tie is something special for me.         
	Within an hour of his arrival here Tuesday afternoon, Paes reached the stadium for a practice session with other members of the squad.         
	I still remember my first match in Davis Cup, against Japan in Jaipur. Playing with Zeeshan Ali in the doubles, we won 18-16 in the fifth set. We also won the tie, said Paes.         
	Paes, who won his first ATP doubles title with Mahesh Bhupathi here, recounted some of his greatest moments.         
	There are so many good moments, but I particularly remember my win against Goran Ivanisevic (in Delhi in 1995 against Croatia), the tie in Frejus (vs France in 1992). The cleanest tie I felt was when I played against Jan Siemerink (against the Netherlands in 1996), when I won all my three sets in tie-breaks, Paes said.         
	Paes spelt out the need to exert every sinew to prepare for a Davis Cup tie, and took pride in saying that representing the country was the biggest high.           (PTI)

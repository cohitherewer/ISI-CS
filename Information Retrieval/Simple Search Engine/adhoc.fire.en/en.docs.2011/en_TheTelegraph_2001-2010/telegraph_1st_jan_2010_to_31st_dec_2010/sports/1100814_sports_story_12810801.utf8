The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Club upset with Vijayan 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Club upset with Vijayan 
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  I M Vijayan    
	Calcutta: Newly-promoted CFL Premier Division side Southern Samity are in troubled waters. Their coach I. M. Vijayan is absent from training sessions for the past seven days.         
	With the CFL set for an August 17 start, Vijayans absence has badly hampered the teams preparations.         
	Vijayan has informed us that he will be rejoining only on August 16. He is now in Goa attending a coaching course. His absence is badly hurting our preparations. Its the club officials who are now conducting the training sessions, a senior official of the club said.         
	So why did the club release Vijayan at such a crucial juncture?         
	Had it been someone else, we wouldnt have released him. But when someone of Vijayans stature asks for a leave, we can hardly do anything about it. Also he got a letter faxed from AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, the official said.         
	Samity, however, will not give Vijayan the boot. It doesnt look nice to sack someone like Vijayan. But we are planning to have a technical director who will head the support staff. We are thinking of appointing Prashanta Banerjee as the technical director. He has a AFC A licence.         
	If Vijayan has any problem working with a technical director, he is free to decide his future, the official added.         
	Banerjee, when contacted however said that he hasnt received any offer from the club. They havent yet contacted me. Let them approach me with a proper offer, I will then think about it, Banerjee said.         
	Meanwhile, East Bengal defeated Mohammedan AC 5-1 in a practice match at the club ground. Bikash Narjery, Robin Singh, Penn Orji, Ikene Ikenwa and Harmanjyot Singh Khabra were the scorers.

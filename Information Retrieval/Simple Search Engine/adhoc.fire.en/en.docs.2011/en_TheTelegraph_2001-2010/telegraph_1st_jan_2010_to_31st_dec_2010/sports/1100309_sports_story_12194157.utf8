The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A twist to the fixing tale
                                                                                                                       7                                      A twist to the fixing tale
  - Allegation of scorebook tampering stalls decision       A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Allegation of the scorebook being tampered with have surfaced in the CAB first division league match between West Bengal Police and Aryan which was mired in match-fixing controversy recently. West Bengal Police chased a record target of 515.         
	While examining the two scorebooks, it was found out that West Bengal Polices team total is six runs short of target. Although at the final total it has been mentioned that Police have scored 515, when it was calculated, the total was found to be six runs short.         
	If that happens to be true, then the match should have ended in a draw and the policemen would have been playing in the relegation play-offs instead of championship play-offs.         
	The revelation has left the tournament committee members, who summoned the representatives of two clubs on Monday, red-faced.         
	On record it was joint secretary Arun Mitra who said that the members have been given a couple of days time to think about the issue after hearing the statements of two captains, the coaches and the two umpires (Ananda Das and Sandip Chakraborty), all of whom vehemently denied match-fixing allegations.         
	The meeting was attended by Mitra, assistant secretary Naresh Ojha, tournament committee chairman Prabir Chakraborty, Subrata Banerjee (special invitee), Anu Dutta, Sambhu Poddar and Atanu Ghosh.         
	There is no doubt that the scorebook has been fudged. It is a Catch-22 situation for the tournament committee members. The issue is so sensitive that committee members are finding it difficult to deal with situation, a source said.         
	The main dilemma for the committee is that the immediate solution is to suspend the two teams or deduct points. The two umpires (Das and Chakraborty) future should also be under the scanner. Any such move may just backfire as the fixing allegations will gain credence which may show the association in poor light.         
	In another decision, the league match between Kumartuli and Customs whose result was withheld will be replayed as umpires Supriyo Sarkar and Subhranil Pakrashi have been found to be at fault.         
	The fate of the two umpires will be now decided by the umpires sub-committee. During that match played at the Customs ground, one of the umpires (Supriyo) signalled dead-ball when Kumartulis last pair was batting.         
	The leg umpire (Pakrashi) apparently didnt hear his partners call. The No. 11 batsman was run-out during that period.         
	The tournament committee after hearing the umpires has reached a conclusion that they are at fault. They have been cautioned and the match will be replayed. The date of replay hasnt yet been finalised. The fate of the two umpires will now be decided by the umpires sub-committee headed by Banerjee, joint secretary Mitra said.         
	It is unlikely that the two umpires will be suspended. However with their reputations being tarnished, it will be interesting to see whether they get big assignments this season which may include semi-finals and finals of various CAB tournaments that involves reputed clubs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Victoria win via the Super Over
                                                                                                                       7                                        Victoria win via the Super Over
  - Vijays breezy 73 goes in vain; Group a is now wide open             Murali Vijay on way to his 73, on Saturday                           
	Port Elizabeth: Opener Murali Vijays breezy 73 went in vain as Victoria Bushrangers snatched a dramatic win over Chennai Super Kings in a keenly contested Champions League Twenty20 Group A match that had to be decided via the Super Over, here on Saturday.         
	The win kept Bushrangers in contention for a semi-final place. It means that Group A is still open as far as semi-final places are concerned with both these teams as well as the Warriors still in the running.         
	The Super Kings have by far the best run rate and their fixture against the Warriors at St Georges Park on Wednesday is now going to be a key match. The Bushrangers last match is against the Wayamba Elevens at Centurion on Monday.         
	Riding on Vijays 53-ball innings, the Super Kings posted 162 for six in 20 overs but then the Bushrangers also managed the exact score and the encounter had to be stretched into the Super Over.         
	In the Super Over, Aaron Finch and David Hussey hammered spinner R Ashwin to gather 23 runs from the six balls with the help of three huge sixes.         
	In reply, Vijay and Suresh Raina could manage only 13 runs off McKay.         
	With 12 runs required from the last over to win, Victoria lost two wickets in the form of Clint McKay (10) and Dirk Nannes (0) as medium pacer Raina dismissed both of them.         
	However, Raina could not stop the Australian side from equalling CSK score although they lost their last wicket (Bryce McGain) in the last ball of the 20th over.         
	Earlier, chasing 163 to win, Victoria started on an attacking note with opener Finch taking on Chennai bowling attack head-on.         
	The 23-year-old cracked four fours and three sixes during his brief but pacy innings.         
	Chennai got their first success when Ashwin removed Finch in the fourth over. Finch mistimed a flick, the ball ballooned towards short cover and Ashwin took a diving catch after a short sprint.         
	The Australian side suffered another loss in the fifth over when Brad Hodge (6) fell prey to Bollinger and returned to the dugout, leaving Victoria at 49 for two.         
	But from there on, Matthew Wade (31) and captain David Hussey took the initiative away from the Chennai camp.           (AGENCIES)

    - Murithala, Ashim hit the target vs Mumbai FC           A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagan players (from left) Shilton Paul, Subair Murithala Ali and Ashim Biswas, after winning the match against Mumbai FC, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: We have got three points that is more than enough. We are not in a good position. I am not looking at the novelty factor at the moment. We didnt start well in the I-League and the rhythm isnt completely restored. Mohun Bagan technical director, Subhas Bhowmick, couldnt be more direct and point-blank on his assessment of a match that his boys won by two goals against Mumbai FC, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Thursday.         
	On paper, at least, Bagan had created slightly more chances than the visitors, but scratch the surface and this was probably a game that produced more questions than answers.         
	The hosts have so far won two matches, including Thursdays after Bhowmicks appointment, but only time will tell if the change of guard is actually a precursor to brighter things.         
	The first half, on Thursday, mainly centred around hogging possession at the midfield with both teams refusing to yield an inch. Mumbai FC were rather aggressive in snatching the ball and tried to play it within themselves before suddenly getting offensive.         
	The plan probably was to press more men behind the ball in the hope of keeping it tight and perhaps nicking a goal. But, in between, Bagan mounted their attacks that ended with a poor finish each time till the 45th minute. Shilton Pauls agility under the bar was creditable when he blocked Nicolas Rodrigues freekick in the 30th minute and immediately cut the angle for Euans Quao, who failed to score on the rebound. Two minutes later, Quao was denied a chance to head in off a Nicolas cross as Shilton intervened. The pressure kept mounting on Bagan and it showed when Gauranga Dutta missed an open net in the 36th minute.         
	The Bagan winger anticipated the ball inside the six-yard box, but failed to tap in despite getting Mumbai FC keeper Ishan Debnath off guard in a goal-mouth melee.         
	A golden opportunity wasted, Bagan pressed for the lead. Chance number two arrived 10 minutes later, on added time. Jose Ramirez Barreto showed fraction more awareness to take a quick throw, played a one-to-one with Snehasish Chakraborty and turned to float in a measured cross for Murithala to score from a header.         
	The match, which had no clear favourites in the first session, tilted in the hosts favour after the lemon break. Gourangas shot sailed wide from close range after Barreto set him up in the area in the 63 rd minute. Two minutes later, it was the Bagan striker who squandered an open-net opportunity. Mumbai FC left back Keegan Pereira airkicked in a bid to clear Snehasishs pass. Barreto was in line to smack in home, but his weak right footer went haywire.         
	But Bagan didnt give in and their efforts were rewarded through substitute Ashim Biswas in the 79 th minute. Ashims long-range effort rocketed through the far post from Ishans poor clearance after the latter denied Murithalas effort on the edge of the six-yard box.         
	Bagan moved to seventh spot with a total of eight points from six games. Mumbai FC remained on nine points at sixth from as many games.

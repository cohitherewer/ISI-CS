    - Rafique hits the winner as city club lift maiden Durand Cup           JAYDEEP BASU            Mohammed Rafique (bottom) and other Chirag United players, celebrate their Durand Cup triumph, in New Delhi, on Sunday. Picture by Prem Singh                                 
	New Delhi: Chirag United overcame a series of on-field handicaps to make history, at the Ambedkar Stadium, on Sunday night, when they won their maiden Durand Cup title with a 1-0 win over JCT.         
	It was a memorable triumph for Subrata Bhattacharyas boys, who appeared to be fighting a losing battle after two of Chirags key defenders  Chika Wali and Justine Stephen  suffered injuries in the first half and had to be immediately replaced.         
	To make matter worse, seasoned goalkeeper Abhijit Mondal was limping in pain throughout the second half even though he was brave enough to finish the match.         
	Chirag did not lose heart and scored the all-important goal through Mohammed Rafique in the 75th minute to become the only fourth Calcutta team to lift the prestigious Cup. Rafique had also scored the match winner against East Bengal in the semi-final.         
	Three other Calcutta teams  East Indian Railways, Rajasthan Club and BNR  also played Durand finals but had to remain content with the runners-up trophy.         
	It is a victory for Bengal football, an emotional Bhattacharya said after the match.         
	We have a bunch of local players who made this win possible. Chirag are not well known like Mohun Bagan and East Bengal but this win would give us the extra confidence before the I-League.         
	The goal, which completely shook the JCT defence, was the result of a counter attack and man of the tournament, Joshimar should get all the credit.         
	The Brazilian striker was the culprit of missing at least two clear chances in the first half but this time he displayed tremendous control and latched on to the ball inside the rival box. He then got past the JCT defender Omolaja Kareem and sent the ball backward on the top of the box for Rafique to rush in and slam home with a rising right footer.         
	It was a great goal, Bhattacharya said. Rafique has been the find of the tournament. He has a bright future but will have to work harder, said the coach.         
	True, it wasnt the best Durand Cup final ever played but the Chirag players showed great spirit. The Calcutta side started aggressively and had their forwards been more agile, the margin of victory could have been bigger.         
	Josimar and Rafique wasted easy opportunities in the first session that could have sealed JCTs fate.         
	JCT, on the other hand, were a pale shadow of the team that once drew huge crowd at the Delhi ground. They were poor in the midfield and unimaginative in creating moves.         
	The Phagwara team could not even take advantage of a depleted Chirag defence and hardly made appositive move except the one their striker Bidemi Daniel missed in the first session.         
	While the winners received Rs 5 lakh, the runners-up side was given a cash award of Rs 3 lakh. Both the losing semi-finalists got Rs 1 lakh each. Josimar received Rs 10,000 as Man of the Tournament.

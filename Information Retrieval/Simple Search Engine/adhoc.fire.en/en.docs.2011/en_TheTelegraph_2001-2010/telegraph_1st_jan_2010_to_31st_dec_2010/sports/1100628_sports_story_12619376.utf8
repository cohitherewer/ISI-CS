            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                Carlos Tevez celebrates his spectacular second goal, 
  in Johannesburg, on Sunday. (AP)    
	Johannesburg: Carlos Tevez scored two goals and Gonzalo Higuain added another Sunday to give Argentina a 3-1 win over Mexico and a spot in the World Cup quarter finals.         
	Tevez and Higuain scored once each in the first half. In the 52nd minute, Tevez sent in an unstoppable shot from 25 yards.         
	Javier Hernandez pulled a goal back for Mexico in the 71 st minute. Argentina will now face Germany.         
	A controversial goal and a terrible defensive lapse cost Mexico dear as Argentina took a 2-0 lead in an eventful first half. Pitted against the two-time world champions, the Mexicans did a decent job on the pitch but were definitely unlucky to concede two goals.         
	Carlos Tevez scored the first goal in the 25th minute when he looked like standing at an off-side position. Lionel Messi sent the through pass for Tevez and his shot was blocked by goalkeeper Oscar Perez, the ball went to Messi, who nudged it ahead for an off-side Tevez to head home.         
	The Mexicans were furious and surrounded the Italian referee Roberto Rosetti, who himself looked confused for a few seconds despite blowing the whistle for the goal. As Argentine players also rushed in, the referee consulted the assistant referee in the Mexican half before upholding his decision.         
	This is for the second time in one day a supervision error cost a team heavily. In the days first round of 16 match between Germany and England, a goal by Frank Lampard was disallowed by the referee.         
	The Mexicans, for obvious reasons, couldnt take it in the right spirit. Moments after the half time was announced, the players of the two teams were seen getting into a fight. It could have turned ugly but for Argentine coach Diego Maradona and his counterpart, Javier Aguirre, the situation was brought under control.         
	Mexico have every reason to complain but what complicated their problems further was their own misdoing. In the 32nd minute, Mexican defender Ricardo Osorio had the ball just outside his own box. He was in two minds about what to do at the back and finally he decided to pass it for Gonzalo Higuain much to the shock of his own colleagues. Higuain gratefully accepted the pass and then went around Perez to send it home.         
	Though the match was played under electrifying atmosphere, the proceedings remained scrappy for most part of the first session. Initially, Argentina had more of the ball possession and made a few threatening moves that had the Mexico defence in bit of the trouble. But once Mexico could organise things at their end, they created more positive chances than their fancied rivals.         
	The Argentine goal had a close shave in the eighth minute when Carlos Salcidos right footed long ranger almost entered the goal but goalkeeper Sergio Romero managed to tip the ball to the crosspiece. There was still no respite for Argentina as Andres Guardado fired yet another left footed angular shot in the next few seconds. Romero had no chance this time but he was relieved to watch the ball inching past the right post.

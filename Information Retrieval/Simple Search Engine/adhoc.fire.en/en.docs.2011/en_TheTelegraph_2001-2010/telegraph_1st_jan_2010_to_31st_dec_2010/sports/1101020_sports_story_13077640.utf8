The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Time for a trial of talents

 - Bollinger yet to be declared fit; Tiwary likely to debut today            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Yuvraj Singh and Munaf Patel during a training session, in Visakhapatnam, on Tuesday. (AP)                           
	Visakhapatnam: Everything about this one-day series points to the World Cup. Twelve matches and 123 days remain between Indias first match against Bangladesh in the quadrennial showpiece and now.         
	Every performance will be scrutinized, every move that Team India undertake will come under the scanner, every failure will be looked into with a sense of despondency and there will be call for desperate measures.         
	What if the big guns are missing from the Airtel Cup? What if the series has failed to generate enough enthusiasm, if one goes by the response in this part of the country? The countdown has already begun.         
	On the eve of the washed out opener in Kochi, Mahendra Singh Dhoni was quick enough to stress on the need for an all-rounder or a hard-hitting batsman at No.7. Not that the captain hasnt spoken about this before but it assumes greater significance in the light of next years tournament.         
	It all depends on what talent you have... If you have an all-rounder, then at No. 7 well try to have a big power-hitter to exploit the subcontinental conditions, Dhoni reiterated on Tuesday.         
	In a way this is a final warning for Ravindra Jadeja to improve or face the consequences. The all-rounder has been around for more than a year and while his bowling has clicked in phases, the batting has taken a nosedive. The lefthanders last ten innings is a tale of diminishing returns  36, 61 .., 51, 19, 6, 0, 25 .., 20, 0, 17.         
	While Jadeja has been given a long run, one Saurabh Tiwary has only been waiting in the wings for months craving for an opportunity. Its not that the Jharkhand boy will provide an instant solution to the problems plaguing the side, but his hunger brings in renewed hope.         
	Tiwarys Indian Premier League (IPL) and Champions League exploits for the Mumbai Indians have already drawn a lot of praise. Dont forget he has also been a consistent performer in the domestic circuit. In 20 Ranji Trophy matches, he has 1594 runs at an average of 49.81, with six centuries.         
	It will again be a toss-up between Tiwary and Rohit Sharma on Tuesday. The team management had persisted with Rohit despite repeated failures in the tri-series in Sri Lanka, Indias last one-day engagement. The Mumbaikars weakness outside the off stump has often made him easy fodder for the pacers.         
	In fact, before the Kochi ODI, Dhoni had hinted that Tiwary would be tried out in this series. And, in all probability, Tiwary is likely to get the nod ahead of Rohit.         
	Five years ago, Dhonis brutal 148 against a shell-shocked Pakistan at this very ground had brought him into limelight and changed the face of Indian cricket. Who knows Tiwary could also follow in his idols footsteps to recreate that magic in ideal batting conditions here!         
	Ravichandran Ashwin, the only specialist spinner in the side, will be another player who will be closely monitored. Will Ashwin be the one to replace Jadeja in the long run? The Tamil Nadu spinner has a better economy rate and has also proved to be handy with the bat.         
	In keeping with the horses for courses policy, the Indians are likely to go in with two pacers in Ashish Nehra and Praveen Kumar in sultry and humid conditions. Munaf Patel and Vinay Kumar will have to sit out. The fifth bowlers job will have to be shared between Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina.         
	For Yuvraj, reeling under the ignominy of being dropped from the Test side, a dazzling show of his talent and prowess will not only shut the Doubting Thomases but also cement his place in the World Cup side. These dozen matches will also be a chance to showcase that he is focused enough and the dip in form was only an aberration.         
	Our batting has always revolved around him. He is a type of player who can change gears at any point of time and can take complete control of the game, Dhoni exuded confidence on Yuvraj.         
	The Australians are still awaiting Doug Bollingers fitness update. He bowled in the nets Tuesday, but how he shapes up on the day of the match is still unclear. Mitchell Starc could make his debut in the circumstances.

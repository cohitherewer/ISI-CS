The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Akram knows better, says Shane Warne
                                                                                                                       7                                        Akram knows better, says Shane Warne
            A STAFF REPORTER            Wasim Akram                           
	Calcutta: Rajasthan Royals captain Shane Warne hit back at former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram who has told a television channel that bowlers were tampering with the ball in the ongoing IPL by rubbing red soil on it.         
	The Kolkata Knight Riders bowling consultant criticised the on-field umpires for not taking notice of the practice once the floodlights were on and batsmen looking to accelerate.         
	Warne, in fact, was at his sarcastic best, while making a comment about Akrams observations.         
	I dont know. Its the first time I am hearing about ball tampering... I think Wasim has heard about it a little bit more... Maybe he is an expert and I am not. I have got no idea about it.         
	We go out and play. I dont agree with it. Maybe I should ask Wasim if he can help me out, you couldnt miss the sarcasm in the Aussie legends voice while addressing the media at the Eden on Friday evening.         
	Akram, while speaking to espnstar.com, was quoted as saying: I wont name anyone but I have seen quite a few cricketers who have been rubbing mud on the ball and that is also tampering.         
	Around the 18th, 19th overs in places like Rajasthan, Mumbai or Ahmedabad, where there is red soil it is difficult to see the ball under lights and by putting the mud on the ball these players are trying to contain the batsmen or get wickets.         
	If umpires are not watching, then I dont know who is. In this IPL, umpires should look for players who are putting mud on the ball because you cant alter the state of the ball with anything, Akram said.         
	Akram, however said spinners running their hand over mud cant be called tampering.         
	That is different, that is just to get some grip on the ball but here someone is just going berserk rubbing the mud on the ball, he said.         
	While Akram declined to make any further comment, he clarified his stand on the issue through a KKR spokesperson.         
	He urged that his comments must be put into perspective rather than trying to rake up a controversy regarding ball tampering.         
	Wasim firmly stands by what he has said to the channel. His intention was not to create a new controversy. Neither did he level allegations at any particular player. The comments made were his observations after having played the game at the highest level for 20 years with distinction.         
	His primary objective was that the umpires should be more careful regarding the colour change of the ball during night games.         
	The comments of someone who has taken more than 900 international wickets (414 Test wickets and 502 ODI wickets) should be taken seriously, team director Joy Bhattacharjya told The Telegraph on behalf of Akram.         
	KKR skipper Sourav Ganguly said he was unaware of any such thing.

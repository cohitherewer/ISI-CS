	Guangzhou: Two gold medals came Indias way at the Asian Games on Thursday, when Joseph Abraham and Ashwini Chidananda won their respective 400m hurdles events, in Guangzhou.         
	Though 29-year-old Joseph clocked a seasons best of 49.96sec, he is still short of the national record of 49.51sec he set during the 2007 World Championships in Osaka.         
	The silver went to Saudi Arabias Bandar Yahya Sharahili, who clocked 50.29sec. Japans Naohiro Kawakita settled for the bronze medal with a timing of 50.37sec.         
	Ashwini snatched the gold with a timing of 56.15sec to give India their eighth gold medal in the Games.         
	The 23-year-old is a 400m and 4X400m relay runner specialist and was part of the team that won the gold in the Commonwealth Games last month. Ashwini, who started running 400m hurdle in May at the National Open Athletic meet in Kochi, is only the third Indian to win a gold medal in this category.                   
	MD Valsamma was the first Indian woman to win the 400m hurdles in 1982 New Delhi Asiad, while the legendary PT Usha repeated the show in 1986 at Seoul.         
	While Ashwini raced away with her first international individual gold medal in 400m hurdle, her compatriot Jauna Murmu was not so lucky as she missed the bronze by a whisker after clocking a personal best of 56.88sec.         
	Apart from the two gold, middle distance runner Tintu Luka bagged bronze for India.         
	Tintu won the bronze medal in 800m event but teammate Sinimole Paulose finished a disappointing seventh. Luka, a protegee of former sprint champion PT Usha, clocked 2:01.36, while Paulose timed 2:06.95.         
	Tintu led the pack right from the start, but couldnt keep pace in the last 50 metres.         
	Kazakhstans Margarita Matsko won the gold with a timing of 2:00.29 while Vietnams Thanh Hang Truong clocked 2:00.91 to settle for silver, at the Aoti Main Stadium. Both the medallists recorded their personal best timing in the discipline.         
	Luka had qualified for the finals, on Wednesday, as the leading timer, clocking 2:03.85 to win the womens 800m heat. Paulose also qualified for the finals after finishing third in heat number one with a timing of 2:03.83.         
	At the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, national record holder Luka had finished sixth in womens 800m with a timing of 2:01.25s.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stroll in the park for Paes, Sania
                                                                                                                       7                                        Stroll in the park for Paes, Sania
 - Easy victories for Poojashree and Rushmi; Bopanna has a mixed day            ANSHUMAN ROY            Leander Paes and Sania Mirza after their easy victory, on Monday. Picture by Prem Singh                           
	New Delhi: By his own admission, Leander Paes would have liked to have a tougher match than he had, partnering Sania Mirza, against Nykita Stacey Roheman and Alberton Richlieu of St Lucia in the first round of the Commonwealth Games mixed doubles tennis, on Tuesday. Leander and Sania won 6-1, 6-0 in 39 minutes in a mis-match, which at times, looked like an exhibition tie.         
	Definitely I would have liked to have better match practice. But then I cant help if the draw gives us such an easy match. Nevertheless, I am happy that we won easily as expected.         
	The Indian mixed doubles pair did not have to toil hard under the glare of the RK Khanna Tennis Stadium since the duo from St Lucia were pathetic if one is less harsh. They made so many unforced errors that after one point one just lost count. That the Leander-Sania pair would have it easy was a foregone conclusion but a cakewalk like this is something even Leander would not have liked.         
	Leander and I are playing after four years but it was amazing the way we communicated. We have to keep on doing the good work, said Sania after the match.         
	Leander said that he would definitely like to partner Sania in a Grand Slam tournament since they are both equally passionate about playing tennis.         
	Even though the match was a one-way traffic, the crowd enjoyed every bit of the 39-minute action. And when someone said: Come on Mrs Malik, go the duo could not stop smiling.         
	Later at the news conference she laughed since the match was an easy one. Had the match been a tough one, maybe I would not have thought of laughing at such a comment. I am glad that the crowd enjoyed themselves, she said.         
	Leander said he is not feeling pressurised by the fact that Sania and he have been billed as one of the favourites for the gold medal. After more than two decades of tennis I know how to handle pressure.         
	Earlier, Rohan Bopanna had a mixed day, winning his singles but losing the mixed doubles partnering Nirupama Sanjeev. In singles, Bopanna won 6-1, 6-4 over Ugandas Rober Buyinza but then in the doubles, lost 3-6, 6-3, 3-6 to the Australian duo of Paul Hanley and Anastasia Rodionova.         
	Rushmi Chakravarthi demolished Lesothos Pinki Agnes Montlha 6-0, 6-1 in the womens singles.         
	Poojashree Venkatesh beat Nthabiseng Eunicia Nqosa, also of Lesotho, 6-0, 6-0 in just 33 minutes.         
	Nirupama, who is coming out of retirement, supported Bopanna well. The Indian duo raised the hopes of an upset by clinching the second set but could not continue with the momentum.         
	An early break of Bopannas serve in the decisive set handed the Australians a 3-0 lead and although the Indians kept coming hard at their much-fancied opponents, the top-seeded pair got points at crucial junctures to ensure they do not become a first-day casualty.         
	As Leander said later in the evening: Five years back if somebody had asked me whether Rohan has done justice to his talent I would have said no. But today I would say he is going there. Rohan and Nirupama had a bad draw but fought till the end. Thats amazing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barisha refusal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barisha refusal
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Barisha Sporting Club have refused to play in the CAB relegation play-off matches which will start from May 9. Barisha cited the inordinate delay on the part of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) to re-start the league as the reason behind their non-participation.         
	Barisha, in fact, had given a walkover to BNR on Wednesday in a pre-quarter-final match of the senior division Knock-Out championship.         
	Barisha SCs official and former CAB assistant secretary, Arup Chatterjee, clarified that he will not be in a position to field a team.         
	I stick to my earlier stand. It is not possible to field a team. Nine other clubs have also written to the CAB about their inability to play. I had six to seven outstation players and they have all left for their respective states. The relegation play-off was to start on February 26 and now its starting on May 9, a furious Chatterjee told The Telegraph on Thursday.         
	What if the other teams agree? Simple. If Barisha is the only team that goes against the associations wishes, we would get relegated, was his prompt reply.         
	But if Barisha is complaining about the delay, senior Bengal pacer and East Bengal captain Ranadeb Bose presents a different aspect.         
	Due to this stoppage, we will now have to play till July. For a fast bowler it becomes unbearable to bowl long spells in these conditions.         
	Then, in grounds like Deshbandhu park there isnt proper changing facility for players. Had the league and other tournaments not been deferred, we could have already played few rounds. Come to think about it  by the time the club matches end, we will hardly get a months rest before Ranji pre-season starts, said Bose.         
	Deep Dasgupta and Manoj Tiwary stressed more on the recovery process in sultry conditions. When we play club matches, one needs to maintain a proper recovery routine , they said.

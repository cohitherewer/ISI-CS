The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Paes: India can upset Russia
                                                                                                                       7                                      Paes: India can upset Russia
                      
	Mumbai: Leander Paes Thursday said Russia would be a tough opponent in next months Davis Cup World Group tie but India are capable of defeating any side in the world in the prestigious team competition.         
	The Russians have got a very good team, besides a home advantage. They are very tough.         
	They have got players like Nikolay Davydenko, who recently defeated Roger Federer, and Mikhail Youzhny. Winning the doubles against them would be a challenge, Paes said.         
	But in Davis Cup, we dont worry about rankings. We have got a developing team. We have created many upsets in the past. There is no reason why we cant create an upset this time around, said the eleven-time Grand Slam winner.         
	I feel that mens tennis in India is on the way up. The fact that we qualified for the World Group, the top 16 of the World is a tough task.           (PTI)

                                                                                                                       7                                        Rudisha creates 800m world record in Berlin
                  David Rudisha celebrates after breaking Wilson Kipketers 13-year-old record, on Sunday. (AP)                     
	Berlin: Kenyas David Lekuta Rudisha made a new world record of one minute 41.09 seconds in the 800 metres at Berlins Olympic Stadium, on Sunday. His time shaved two hundredths of a second off the previous best mark, set by Denmarks Kenyan-born Wilson Kipketer in August 1997.         
	This was my first real attempt to break the world record. I knew I was good, I had trained hard, Rudisha said, adding, Now that I have run that time, I can say I have the ability to improve and go faster.         
	Rudisha managed to keep up his pace through to the line to break Kipketers long-standing record, something he had recently been threatening to do so. At a meet in the Belgian city of Heusden-Zolder in July, Rudisha timed 1:41.51, an African record and the fastest time in the world, since Kipketer set the previous best 13 years ago.         
	I met him last year and he told me, I can see you have a future in the 800, you can beat the world record, Rudisha said of Kipketer.         
	Rudisha broke the record at the same stadium where he was just a semi-finalist in the 800 at last years world championships.         
	I was very disappointed last year, but the weather was so cold then. I knew that I would be fast today and that I am in good shape. I was just hoping the weather would be good. It was a bit windy but otherwise it was perfect, quot; Rudisha said.         
	After this feat, Rudisha is now eyeing other records. He said: Now my next steps are to win world and Olympic titles. But I can still improve my world record.         
	Minutes before Rudisha set this record, Caster Semenya successfully returned to the Berlin Olympic Stadium to win the womens 800 metres race.         
	While Rudisha did not have good memories of his previous visit to Berlin, the Olympic Stadium was the site of the 19-year-old South Africans triumph at the world championships last year. She subsequently missed 11 months of competition while undergoing gender tests.         
	I still feel the same but it was not easy for a 19-year-old girl to go through what Ive been through, Semenya said after cruising home in 1:59.90.         
	I ran a good time, I felt at home, quot; said Semenya, who was greeted warmly by a crowd of nearly 50,000 at the Olympic stadium. She surged ahead in the last 50 meters to cross the line in under two minutes in her third race since she was cleared to run again in July. She competed in two minor races in Finland before getting invited to run in Berlin.         
	Semenya hopes to make the South Africa team for the Commonwealth Games, in Delhi, this October.           (AGENCIES)

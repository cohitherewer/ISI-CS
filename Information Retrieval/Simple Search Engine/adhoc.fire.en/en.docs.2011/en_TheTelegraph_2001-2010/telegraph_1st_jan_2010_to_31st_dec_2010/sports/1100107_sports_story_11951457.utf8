The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Batsmen look to pile on runs

  - Tri-series 
  -  Team India are not taking Bangladesh lightly today               Mohammed Ashraful during a practice session on Wednesday, the eve of their match against India. (AP)                           
	Dhaka: Jolted out of their comfort zone after last nights defeat against Sri Lanka, India will hope to be back to their winning ways when they take on Bangladesh in their second match of the tri-series in Mirpur on Thursday.         
	The Indians came here high on confidence after their Test and ODI series win over Sri Lanka but their five-wicket loss against the islanders, who were without some of their key players, has not only dented their pride but also shattered their hopes of attaining the No.1 ranking in one-dayers too for the time being.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his men will now have to go back to the drawing board and sort out their batting and bowling woes, besides praying that they dont end up on the receiving end of the dew factor.         
	The loss meant that India do not have any chance of becoming No. 1 at least till the end of the tri-series as they needed to win all their matches here to achieve the feat.         
	Dhoni blamed dew for their loss but his side was second best in all departments of the game against Sri Lanka. The batsmen, though, will have to take the blame for frittering away the chance to score 300.         
	As Dhoni himself said after the match, the only way to win after being put to bat first is to put up a big score so that it offsets the advantage the other side would get by winning the toss.         
	India, at one time, looked set for a 300-plus score after they were 259 for five but they could add just 20 runs in the last five overs which proved costly.         
	It is very tough for the bowlers especially for the spinners to grip the ball when dew sets in.         
	The only way a team bowling second could win a match in such a scenario is to score a big total and then get early wickets. We were unlucky not to get some early wickets, Dhoni said.         
	The Indians decided to rest on Wednesday with the players restricting themselves to their hotel rooms.         
	In the crucial game Thursday, a lot will depend on how Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir start the innings irrespective of whether India bat first or second.         
	On the bowling front, India need early wickets to put pressure on the home side. Zaheer Khan, who has now become a mentor for the young pacers, leaked runs against Sri Lanka and will have to lead form the front Thursday. Ashish Nehra, on the other hand, will have to maintain his consistent self.         
	India cannot take Bangladesh lightly as they would also be aiming for the first victory in the series knowing fully well that another defeat would make it tough for them to make it to the January 13 final.         
	Bangladesh have quality batsmen in the likes of Tamim Iqbal and Mohammed Ashraful, who seems to have regained a bit of his old touch after an indifferent run last year, with a 75 against Sri Lanka.         
	But Bangladesh have been hampered in the pace bowling department by the unavailability of Mashrafe Mortaza and injury to Nazmul Hossain, who was replaced by Shahdat Hossain.         
	With dew at night being such a big factor, it will be interesting to see whether the hosts field any spinners. They had included four spinners in their opening match against Sri Lanka.         
	The toss will once again be crucial. With cold weather, thick fog cover and little sunshine here, the side which wins the toss will have no hesitation in opting to bat first.

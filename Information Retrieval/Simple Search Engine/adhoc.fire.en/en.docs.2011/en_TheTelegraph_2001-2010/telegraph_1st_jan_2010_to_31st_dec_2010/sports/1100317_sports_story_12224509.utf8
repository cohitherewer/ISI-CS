The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Swann finishes the job in style
                                                                                                                       7                                      Swann finishes the job in style
                      
	Chittagong: Graeme Swann returned a maiden 10-wicket match-haul as England ended Bangladeshs resistance with a 181-run victory in the opening Test here Tuesday.         
	Junaid Siddique hit a solid 106 for his maiden Test century and Mushfiqur Rahim an impressive 95 to frustrate the tourists before Bangladesh were bowled out for 331 on the fifth and final day, chasing an improbable 513-run target.         
	Off-spinner Swann, who took five wickets in the first innings, finished with 5/127 in 49 overs in the second innings.         
	England, denied success for more than two sessions by left-handed Siddique and wicket-keeper Rahim, heaved a sigh of relief when Swann removed both batsmen in his opening four overs after lunch.         
	Swann struck in his first over after the break when he had Siddique caught by Paul Collingwood in the slips before accounting for Rahim, who was bowled after he stepped out to drive and missed the line.         
	Rahim, who came in to bat after five wickets fell for 110 before the tea break Monday, was involved in a 167-run stand for the sixth wicket with Siddique. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clash of billionaires at Stamford Bridge
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clash of billionaires at Stamford Bridge
                      
	London: New money takes on even newer money as the battle of the billionaires, otherwise known as Chelsea vs Manchester City, takes the Premier Leagues centre stage at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.         
	City desperately want to be where Chelsea are  top of Premier League, striving to make the final step in the Champions League and able to attract the best players and staff in the game. They have made quick inroads in the off-pitch areas but have a long way to go to match them where it matters.         
	As Chelsea went down to a creditable 2-1 first-leg loss at Inter Milan in a match screened all around the world on Wednesday, City were slumping to an extra-time defeat at Stoke City in a FA Cup replay. Citys Arab owners showed their impatience when they dismissed Mark Hughes earlier in the season and brought in Roberto Mancini with a clear remit.         
	After a bright start to his tenure the Italian has now had to deal with defeats by Everton and Hull City, a scratchy win over Bolton Wanderers and draws with Stoke and Liverpool  the latter a painful affair at Eastlands last Sunday when City managed only one worthwhile effort on goal.         
	Wednesdays feeble Cup defeat, which had the City fans besieging the phone-ins to berate Mancini for his negative tactics, makes a top-four finish even more important as the clubs trophy drought rolls into its 35th year.         
	Chelsea go into the match one point ahead of Manchester United, with a game in hand, while City are embroiled in a desperate four-way battle for fourth. Manchester United are playing Aston Villa in the League Cup final on Sunday, opening the door for third-placed Arsenal to close ground if they can overcome a physical Stoke at the Britannia Stadium.

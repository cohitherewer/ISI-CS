The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand forces draw
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand forces draw
                      
	Sofia: If this is a fight to the finish then the champion sure is not backing down. Viswanathan Anand seemed to send out just such a message on Sunday after he had dug in his heels to salvage yet another draw in game No.11 of his world championship match against Veselin Topalov.         
	The Bulgarian challenger pushed the world champion to the brink from where Anand had to use his endgame skills to prevent losing ground in the 12-game rubber.         
	After giving up a pawn in a dead position, it appeared Topalov would walk away with the game but Anand had seen enough to know where the game was headed and presumably had worked out the calculation that would allow him to secure a draw.         
	He got what he wanted after 65 moves with series now locked at 5.5-5.5. The world champion plays black in the last game on Tuesday .         
	Anand, playing white, went for the English Opening, a move that looked boring for the most part before he took a big risk by giving a pawn to leave the position unclear after 50 moves. Topalov went flat out to convert the endgame to a full point but Anand held the position with his counter-attack.         
	The draw looked certain when Anand sacrificed a pawn, a move which allowed Topalov a chance for counter play. But, then, Anand had his own counter on the kingside. Anand had to grind out a draw in the previous match as well, which ensured that the match will be fought on an even keel in the remaining two games under classical time control as, in the event of a tie, the winner will be decided on the basis of games played under faster time control.

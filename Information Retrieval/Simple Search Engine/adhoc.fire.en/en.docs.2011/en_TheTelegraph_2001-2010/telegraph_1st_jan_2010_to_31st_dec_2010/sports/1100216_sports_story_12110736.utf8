The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sania injures wrist again
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sania injures wrist again
                      
	Dubai: Sania Mirza revealed on Monday that her career-threatening wrist injury has returned.         
	Sania, who lost to Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain 3-6, 4-6 in the first round of Dubai Open Monday, said that her main concern now would be her injury.         
	You go through good patches and bad patches and that is something we have to deal with as athletes. But right now thats not my major concern. My main concern is my wrist  which I have to sort out, she said after the match.         
	It hurts when I stretch to a forehand. It hurts when I try to hit a hard cross court backhand, the 23-year-old said. Sania is now doubtful for the $ 220,000 Malaysian Open in Kuala Lumpur starting next week.         
	Its tough when youre playing with that (injury) and then mentally youre struggling, thinking oh great the wrist is back. Oh how am I going to deal with it.         
	I was thinking during the match. And okay, what am I going to do? Do I play Malaysia? Do I go back home? Do I see my doctor? All these things were going on in my head at that point in time, said Sania about the injury which seemed to have healed after an operation nearly two years ago.           (PTI)

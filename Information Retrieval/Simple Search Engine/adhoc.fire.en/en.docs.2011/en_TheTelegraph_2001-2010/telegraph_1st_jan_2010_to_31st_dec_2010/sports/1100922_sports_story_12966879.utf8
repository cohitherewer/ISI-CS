The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fennell drops a deadline bomb
                                                                                                                       7                                        Fennell drops a deadline bomb
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT              Michael Fennell                      
	New Delhi: The Commonwealth Games (CWG) plunged into deeper controversy on Tuesday when the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) president Michael Fennell said that parts of the Games Village were still not fit for accommodation.         
	While the red-faced Organising Committee (OC) officials promised to resolve the issue before the teams start arriving on Thursday, Fennell set them a 24-hour deadline to set the things right.         
	To make matters worse for OC, Mike Hooper, the chief executive officer of CGF, and senior officials of several other participating nations also joined Fennell to condemn the facilities at the Games Village.         
	While Hooper described the Games Village as filthy, New Zealand chef de mission Dave Currie, who has been camping here for a week, warned that the Games could be called off unless the situation improves.         
	Team leaders from England, Scotland, Wales, New Zealand, Australia and Canada have also all expressed grave concerns over the accommodation for the 6,500 participating athletes and said that it was unsafe and unfit for human habitation.         
	The Australian advance team found the premises surrounding their proposed accommodation in the Village so dirty that they hired the services of a professional housekeeping agency, which upkeeps New Delhis Australian High Commission, to clean their flats.         
	Officials of several countries have said their athletes will not stay in the village if their allotted rooms continued to be filthy. Many have for the time being decided to stay in New Delhis five star hotels.         
	In their feedback to the OC, officials from these countries painted a sorry picture of the Games Village with the athletes training centre still incomplete and the water in the training and recreational swimming pools being dirty, with insect larvae breeding on the surface. They also complained of OC staff urinating in public inside village premises, dogs roaming about and OC staff sleeping on beds meant for athletes.         
	Currie criticised New Zealands proposed accommodation, construction of which is still incomplete, and referred to the facility as extraordinarily disappointing. Currie even hired workers from an expatriate New Zealand couples cleaning business to fix up the rooms.         
	Speaking on the chances of the Games being cancelled, Currie said: That is not a decision that well make, but there are some realities. If the village is not ready and the athletes cant come, obviously the implications of that are that it (the Commonwealth Games) is not going to happen. I think they are in severe difficulties.         
	Fennell, however, remained the bitterest critic of the Village, described as world class by the OC.         
	The Jamaican official, who has already written to cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekar expressing his concern over the standard of cleanliness and hygiene at the Village, said: I am expecting some serious action in the next 24 hours. We have been waiting for the Village to be ready before the athletes arrive, but we have not seen any action so far.         
	Criticism also came from the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) which asked all the agencies involved in the Games preparations to get their act together.         
	Chandrashekhar held a meeting with Delhis Lt. Governor Tejendra Khanna and senior officials. He asked the Delhi government to oversee preparations at the Games Village.         
	The government, on their part, has decided to deploy senior officials to oversee the Games Village maintenance.         
	While Fennells arguments were understandable, the stance taken by Hooper on Tuesday came as a surprise. The New Zealander, who was singing praise of the Village till a few days back, suddenly lashed out at the facilities.

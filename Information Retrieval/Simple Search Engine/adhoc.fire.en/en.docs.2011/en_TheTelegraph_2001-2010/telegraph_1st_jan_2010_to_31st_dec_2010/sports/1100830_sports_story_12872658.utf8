	Bookie Mazhar Majeed also revealed he was plotting for Pakistan to lose two ODIs against England next month.         
	Boss Im telling you, the timing youve come into. Its perfect because the one days and Twenty20s are about to start and were going to be making a hell of a lot money.         
	A lot of the boys want to f*** up Afridi because hes trying to f*** up things for them. They all want Butt to be captain. They want to lose anyway.         
	Lets say for example Twenty20, Ill tell you the bowlers, how many minimum runs theyre going to concede. And the batsmen.         
	Im going to tell you how many, like say it was on the two opening batsmen, Salman and Kamran, for example, youve only got 20 overs, theyre going to waste two overs, three overs.         
	The Twenty20s are easiest. Then the bowlers as well, yeah, they will certainly give a certain amount of runs and theyre going to be batting as well and give their wickets. Well finalise a price for each one and well just take it off the balance. Well take it off the 150 (grand) balance until were square.         
	Boss believe me, you are talking to the right people.

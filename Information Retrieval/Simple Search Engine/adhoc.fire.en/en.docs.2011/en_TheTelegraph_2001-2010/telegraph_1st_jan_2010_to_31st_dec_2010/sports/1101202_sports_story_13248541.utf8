	Jaipur: Indian stand-in captain Gautam Gambhir did everything right at the jam-packed Sawai Man Singh Stadium on Wednesday. He first won the toss to ensure New Zealand were forced to bowl second on a dew-affected wicket and then came up with an unbeaten century (138), his eighth in ODIs, to steer India to an emphatic eight-wicket victory in the second one-dayer.         
	Chasing New Zealands 258 on a slow wicket, the hosts launched an all-out attack and romped home with seven overs to spare. India now lead the five-match series 2-0.         
	After the practice session on Tuesday, Gambhir said he was hitting the ball well and was looking for a big knock very soon. That he was spot on in his assessment of himself was evident when the Delhi opener sent anything pitched up to the fence with a lightening speed.         
	So commanding was Gambhirs innings that by the 30th over, New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori had used as many as seven bowlers, but none could effect a change. Getting the first century as the captain is always special, Gambhir said later. We chased a good score and managed to win the match, he added.         
	Fortunately for Gambhir, Virat Kohli gave him company adding 116 runs for the second wicket. Virat, who scored a rollicking hundred in Guwahati, continued his good form but failed to outshine his skipper. While Gambhir did most of the hitting, Kohli held the other end keeping the scoreboard ticking.         
	The right-hander brought up his 50 in 63 balls with the help of six hits to the fence and his final score of 64 needed just 73 deliveries. Once Murali Vijay (33) returned to the pavilion after showing some early promise, the Gambhir-Kohli combination had the opponents in complete disarray. Gambhir was in scintillating form as he attacked the Kiwi bowlers with a vengeance.         
	He was particularly harsh on Kyle Mills, whom he slammed for five boundaries in the opening overs. The southpaw oozed with confidence and his shot off Scott Styris when he stepped out to hit him through mid-off for a breathtaking boundary stood out.         
	He finally reached the three-figure mark in 89 balls when he sent Andy McKay for a four past mid-wicket. Overall, Gambhir cracked 18 boundaries.         
	New Zealand can always complain of missing some of their key players, but, overall, India were deserving winners. On Tuesday, Gambhir had said that the team, which would play 100 overs well would emerge eventual winners.         
	The days events went exactly the same way as Gambhir had predicted. India not only outclassed the visitors with the bat, but also proved better with the ball in comparison. While pacer Sreesanth was the pick of the lot capturing four wickets in nine overs, the others, too, never allowed the Black Caps batsmen to dominate.         
	Sreesanth bowled a good line and length and was in line for a hat-trick in the 46 th over when he removed Styris and Daniel Vettori with successive deliveries.         
	While Styris big hits towards the end of the New Zealand innings brought cheer, it was Martin Guptills patient knock that took the visitors total to 258. The 25-year-old was involved in two half-century stands to lend solidity to the Black Caps innings.

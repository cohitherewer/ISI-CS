The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | United, City ready for the slugfest
                                                                                                                       7                                      United, City ready for the slugfest
                      
	London: Manchester United go into the second leg of the League Cup semi-finals against Manchester City with Wayne Rooney in the sort of form that helped the team decide to let Carlos Tevez leave.         
	Tevez has rediscovered the touch that led United to sign him in 2007 with 17 goals in 26 matches for City this season, including two in last weeks 2-1 first-leg win over his old side.         
	But Rooney is on course for his most productive season ever, with his four goals in Saturdays 4-0 win over Hull taking United back to the top of the Premier League and his total to 20 in 28 matches.         
	With defending League Cup champions United having beaten City 4-3 at Old Trafford already this season, City and Tevez may not have everything their own way on Wednesday.         
	The game against City will be very hard, but its great that we have someone like Wayne who is in good form and feeling confident, United winger Nani said. (REuters)

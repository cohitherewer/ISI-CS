	Melbourne: Spin legend Muttiah Muralidharan, who has the highest number of Test wickets under his belt, is planning to quit Tests after the tour of West Indies in October.         
	The spin wizard has already announced that he will quit all forms of the game after the 2011 50-over World Cup. The 37-year-old off-spinner is just eight wickets shy of becoming first player to touch the magical 800-wicket mark in Test cricket.         
	Maybe I will play one or two Test matches, thats it, and then retire. The Tests against the West Indies will be the last ones I play, Muralitharan has told an Australian daily.         
	The also said he has forgiven John Howard, who has been nominated to take over as the ICC president in 2012, for calling him a chucker in 2004.         
	Im not upset or angry with him. It was not appropriate at that time, but its passe now. (PTI)

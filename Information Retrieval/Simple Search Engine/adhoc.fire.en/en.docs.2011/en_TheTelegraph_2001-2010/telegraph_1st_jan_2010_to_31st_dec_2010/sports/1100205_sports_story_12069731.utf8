The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mental preparation is the key, says Van Zyl
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mental preparation is the key, says Van Zyl
                      
	Nagpur: The South African team had a media session here on Thursday morning. Following are excerpts from what the coach and the players (alphabetically) had to say:                       
	CORRIE VAN ZYL (coach): My biggest challenge is to prepare the players in such a short time for these conditions, coming from the bouncy wickets of South Africa. We have to get in as many practice sessions as possible. The two-day game (against the Board Presidents XI that concluded Wednesday) has helped tremendously. The key lies in making sure were mentally up for the challenge         
	We had a look at the wicket yesterday (Wednesday) and it does not have the same amount of grass as we saw in the practice match. It looks like it will turn. Its still early days and well get a better picture tomorrow (Friday). But you cant really say about the bounce now unless you play on it. Thats something we need to assess. If you are a fine fast bowler, you would be able to adapt to any kind of wicket. We have quality fast bowlers capable of bowling at 140km plus, three of them at that. Those guys are going to be effective on any kind of wicket         
	Rahul is obviously a big player in the Indian team, we just have to see who India are going to play at No.3. There are other quality players. We are not putting too much emphasis on that (Dravids absence). But the Indians are definitely worried about the fact that they have lost a stalwart.                 
	AB DE VILLIERS: The transformation policy [about getting black players in the team] is something that is decided by the Board where Im concerned, its not an issue its not a divisive policy. Everybody who is in the team is there because he deserves to be there were all mature adults         
	The No.3 spot is the biggest one according to me. People dont realise how big a spot that is. Dravid has always stood like a rock under pressure for the Indian side, and to lose him is like us losing Kallis. You cant replace a guy like that         
	Knowing your own game plans, knowing your strengths and weaknesses  thats the secret (of playing in sub-continent). Its not unplayable over here. A guy who knows where the dangerous areas are normally does well here. Its about not being too worried about the conditions and other players. We know the ball comes slower here, and turns         
	I enjoyed playing with (Virender) Sehwag and (Gautam) Gambhir in the Indian Premier League (for the Delhi DareDevils). They are very nice guys. I really enjoyed the city (New Delhi), to be in the team with them and the Australians.                 
	MORNE MORKEL: We have got bowlers who can bowl 145 kms plus an hour. One of the strengths of our fast bowlers is bowling short. Well use that Luckily, its not my first time in India. I know what I can expect. Conditions are not easy for a fast bowler but as long as you prepare yourself mentally, I think youll be fine. The ball does reverse swing and sometimes the wickets play up and down. You just need to keep running and bowling fast and rewards will come         
	Sehwag played out of his boots in Chennai [on South Africas last tour when the opener scored a triple century]. After that we bowled well. We know how dangerous he is and how well he can dominate the attack. This time we need to get him out early.                 
	DALE STEYN: Last time around, Sehwag showed us in Chennai that on flat wickets, he can score runs. But once we exploited his weaknesses, he wasnt able to get away. We definitely have plans for him. Whats happened in the past has happened in the past I am not giving everything away here, we have two Test matches against him. Im not going to single out Sehwag because (Sachin) Tendulkar is also a marvellous player. Gambhir, too, has shown what hes got.

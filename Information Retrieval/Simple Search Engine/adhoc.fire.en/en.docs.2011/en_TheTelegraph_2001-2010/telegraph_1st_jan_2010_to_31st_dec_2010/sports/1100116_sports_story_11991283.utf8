	Sydney: Russias Elena Dementieva defeated a hobbling Serena Williams 6-3, 6-2 at the Olympic tennis centre on Friday to win the Sydney International for the second year in a row.         
	Dementieva completely outplayed the American world No. 1, who was troubled by a sore left knee that restricted her movement on court.         
	Serena said later the injury was not serious and would not prevent her from playing at the Australian Open, starting in Melbourne on Monday, but had distracted her.         
	Its just a little pain and the strapping usually helps the pain go away sometimes, Serena said. I havent played for two months on a competitive level, so I think its good for my body to go through this now, especially since Im playing in doubles as well as singles.         
	I think its a great blessing in a way. I played four matches and my body hasnt been used to it.         
	Dementievas win was her fifth in 12 meetings with Serena and provided her with her 15th WTA title and her second in Sydney after she beat Dinara Safina in last years final.         
	Im very satisfied the way I was playing, said Dementieva, who received the winners trophy from Margaret Court.         
	Thats what I was really looking for coming here in Sydney, just playing aggressively and playing with a lot of pressure. It was a great experience and its gonna help me next week.         
	Dementieva is still chasing her first Grand Slam title after making the finals at the French Open and US Open six years ago and said her win in Sydney had given her a real boost heading into the Australia.         
	Meanwhile, Richard Gasquet and Marcos Baghdatis continued to enjoy a welcome return to form by advancing to the mens singles final with contrasting victories on Friday.         
	Gasquet, who was embroiled in an arduous and messy doping case which he was eventually cleared of, defeated his fellow Frenchman Julien Benneteau 6-3, 7-5 to reach his first ATP final since Stuttgart in 2008.         
	Baghdatis had to work much harder before booking his place in the title match with a 6-4, 6-7, 7-6 victory over American Mardy Fish at the Olympic tennis centre.           (REUTERS)

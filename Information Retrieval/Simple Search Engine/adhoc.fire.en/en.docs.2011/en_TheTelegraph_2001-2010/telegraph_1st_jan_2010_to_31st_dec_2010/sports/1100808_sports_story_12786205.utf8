The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal face uphill task
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bengal face uphill task
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bengal players in a light mood at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: If you knew Shabbir Alis predicament, you would think twice before stepping into his shoes.         
	But Shabbir, as he used to be during his playing days, is not someone who will be cowered down by the odds.         
	The Bengal coach has only 15 fit players at his disposal, on the eve of Bengals Santosh Trophy final against Punjab. And the man remains unperturbed! Known as someone who likes to thrive in adversity, no wonder, when it comes to guts and gumption, he can challenge even the best in the business.         
	Me and my boys are only thinking about the championship. Being second best is no good. No one remembers losers. In front of our home crowd, we have a promise to keep. The boys know that well. Its the time to go out there and perform to the best of our abilities, the former India international, said on Saturday.         
	Bengal have been waiting for the last 11 years to turn a new leaf  that is to win the National Football Championship for the 30th time. The 29th title came way back in 1999 in Kannur and, to think about, that was in the last millennium!         
	On Sunday, Bengal will be up against a Punjab side, which is in real good form. The way they dismantled Tamil Nadu in the semi-final on Friday, was something worth remembering.         
	On the other hand, Bengal, bogged down by injuries, will take the field with single striker Robin Singh.         
	Shabbir has no choice in that as three of his four strikers are unfit. While Shankar Oraon has already been ruled out for six months, Nilendra Dewan is out with a knee injury (he didnt train on the day). Tarif Ahmed, who is nursing a calf muscle injury, also looks like a doubtful starter. Tarif has been ridiculously bad in front of the goal in this tournament and how his presence, if he makes the cut, will change Bengals fortunes remains to be seen.         
	Funnily, among the four reserves, one is a second goalkeeper, Sandeep Nandy, and three others are defenders, Habibur Rahman, Safar Sardar and Anupam Sarkar.         
	There is a high possibility that Bengal might adopt 4-5-1 formation with Robin Singh upfront and Souvik Chakraborty operating from the deep.         
	In order to stop the Punjab duo of Balwant Singh and Parveen Kumar, Chirag United captain Denson Devadas may play as a defensive screen in front of the back-four with the onus of attack on Jayanta Sen, Snehasish Chakraborty and Gauranga Dutta.         
	The Bengal players also had a brief shoot-out session, which indicates that the coach wants his boys to be ready in case the match goes into extra-time.         
	Senior pro Jayanta Sen feels that its revenge time for Bengal having lost to Punjab in Gurgaon three years back.         
	It really feels bad to lose in the shoot-out. I was a member of that team and that defeat still hurts, Jayanta said.

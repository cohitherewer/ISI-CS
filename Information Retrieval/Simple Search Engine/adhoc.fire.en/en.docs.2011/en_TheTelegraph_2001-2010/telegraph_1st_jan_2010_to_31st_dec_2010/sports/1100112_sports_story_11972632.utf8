The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldinho brace in Milan win
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ronaldinho brace in Milan win
                  Ronaldinho                     
	Milan: Two goals from Ronaldinho helped AC Milan to a 3-0 win at toothless Juventus on Sunday which piled the pressure on Juves rookie coach Ciro Ferrara.         
	Alessandro Nesta netted in the first half and Ronaldinho twice after the break to push Leonardos side eight points behind leaders Inter Milan, who beat Siena 4-3 on Saturday in the Serie A.         
	Second-placed Milan, who have a game in hand and meet Inter on Jan. 24, condemned Juve to their fourth defeat in five matches in all competitions and reports linking the Turin club with Russia coach Guus Hiddink have already re-emerged.         
	The visitors were far from spectacular on a cold night but third-placed Juves confidence is so low that an average display was enough to win handsomely.         
	Juve midfielder Felipe Melo, much derided for his poor form since a July move from Fiorentina, failed to clear a corner on the half hour and Nesta could not miss at the far post.         
	Milan doubled their lead on 72 minutes when Ronaldinhos header from a corner was deflected in by Paolo De Ceglie and the Brazilian added the third from David Beckhams cross late on.

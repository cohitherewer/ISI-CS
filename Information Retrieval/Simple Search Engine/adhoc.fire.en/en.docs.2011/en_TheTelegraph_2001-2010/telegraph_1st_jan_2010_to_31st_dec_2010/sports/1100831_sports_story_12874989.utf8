                                                                                                                       7                                      Hamilton fulfils classic dream
            Tom Cary                      
	Spa-Francorchamps: He said he wanted to carve his name alongside those of previous greats by winning the Belgian Grand Prix, one of only two classic races still to elude him.         
	And, with Sundays victory at a chaotic, rain-soaked Spa-Francorchamps, Lewis Hamilton not only joined the likes of Jim Clark, Juan Manuel Fangio and his all-time hero, Ayrton Senna  multiple winners all of this famously unpredictable waffle-fight in the Ardennes  he also reclaimed the lead of a riveting drivers championship.         
	After shimmying sideways on to the podium to celebrate in the gathering gloom he thanked his team, his mechanics and his God for a win that was only once in serious doubt from the moment he overtook Red Bulls Mark Webber off the start line.         
	That moment came when, with nine laps left and a 13-second lead, he skidded off the track at Rivage, across the gravel trap and within a whisker of the barrier.         
	The Lord had his hand over me at that point, he remarked.         
	He works in mysterious ways. Hamiltons unconfined joy was in stark contrast to the despair felt by his McLaren teammate Jenson Button, who was shunted out of the race through no fault of his own by Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel.         
	Ive never seen anything like it before, a dejected Button said later. Ive seen replays and I still dont know what he (Vettel) was doing.         
	Button now trails Hamilton by 35 points in the standings, leading to suggestions that, with just six races to go, the team may now start to favour their lead man.         
	 It was a great weekend, Hamilton acknowledged. Just to say I won here. Its one of those I can tick off.         
	Only Monza of the classics eludes him now. Guess what is up next?

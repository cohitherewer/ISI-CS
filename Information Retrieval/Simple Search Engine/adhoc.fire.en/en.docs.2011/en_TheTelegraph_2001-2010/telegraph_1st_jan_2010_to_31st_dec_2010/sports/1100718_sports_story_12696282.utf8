The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowlers will have to be patient: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bowlers will have to be patient: Dhoni
            A CORRESPONDENT            Mahendra Singh Dhoni during a training session in Galle, on Saturday                           
	Team India werent really the more convincing of the two teams in the drawn practice tie against the Sri Lanka Cricket Board Presidents XI, with a young, and inexperienced, line-up getting exposed in foreign conditions. Nevertheless, captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni seemed more confident than cagey at the news conference on the eve of the first Test, talking up Indias chances in the three-match Test rubber.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q On the practice match (vs SLCs BP XI)         
	A Whatever we got out of it, we are quite satisfied. Obviously we could have batted better. Still, whether it be a practice game or an international, at times you get out to good deliveries and thats what happened with us.         
	Harbhajan Singhs recovery         
	Hes a bit weak and thats what happens when you come out of the flu. He spent some time bowling today (Saturday) and he is batting right now even as we speak, so we are hoping he will be 100 per cent fit for the game.         
	On the spinners         
	As I said, we had an aggressive field for most of the time in the practice game. It didnt really work for us. The wicket wasnt turning all that much and it was on the slower side as well. So, its not a big worry because the whole approach changes for a Test match.         
	Bowling being a concern         
	If you compare our bowling to our batting, you can say that it is the bowling which is a bit weaker. ButTherell be new, young bowlers who would be getting international exposure. So, overall, I think its good for Indian cricket.         
	Missing swing bowlers         
	It depends on the conditions. Its not that our bowlers are not swing bowlers. Their strength is bowling back of a length on the off stump... a lot depends on what kind of wicket you get and what time of the day youre bowling.         
	Ishant and Mithuns bowling         
	Ishant and Mithun bowled really well in the practice game, bowled in the right areas. They went for quite a bit of runs but one of the reasons for that was us going for an over-aggressive field.         
	On what the bowlers approach should be         
	In Test matches, its vital to be aggressive. But at the same time, its important to be patient because these are wickets on which you wont get too much help. So you have to wait for the right moment Its important to keep bowling in the right channels.         
	Whether there is any difference in approach due to key bowlers absence         
	Not many changes, because, at the end of the day, in a Test match, you have to take 20 wickets to win the game. The only thing that changes is that, with someone as experienced as Zaheer around, you dont have to give much input. The bowler comes up with this session, I want to do this and you have to set the field accordingly. But with the younger bowlers coming in, you have to give more input.         
	Yuvrajs chances and his form         
	Youre asking me about the playing XI and, most of the times, we dont announce that. So youll have to wait. As far as form is concerned, he is a really good batsman in whatever format of the game he has represented India. Just hoping that he turns up well and gets some big runs for us.         
	On Sehwag         
	The way he bats, if he can bat for one or one-and-a-half sessions, more often than not, he will get past the century mark. There will be no pressure on Sehwag. He can bat the way he wants. And thats where his strength lies.         
	On him missing nets         
	It rained, so they pushed me out. They had to put the covers on. No injuries, nothing. I was padded up but the clouds came in.         
	On Muralidharan         
	In the first few series I played against Sri Lanka, Murali was the mystery bowler. To pick his every delivery was really difficult. Hes a great bowler I (also) think he is a great human being, which is very important. Sharing the dressing room with him for the Chennai Super Kings was really special.         
	Memories of Murali         
	I think more than on the field, its about memories off the field. The kind of character he is, its great to have him in the dressing room. He gets everyone going, so I think there are more memories of him off the field than on the field.         
	Teams plans for Muralis farewell         
	We will have to wait and see. We have been quite intense with the practice sessions and never really had the time to discuss that. Lets see what we can do, as a team. If not, then surely at a personal level, I will get a chance to do something when I see him during the Champions League.         
	Chances in the series         
	We will try our best; thats what I can say. I am not really a believer in predicting outcomes but we have to give more than 100 per cent in this series because the conditions are more in favour of Sri Lanka.         
	Physical demands of the tour         
	You have to accept that it (Sri Lanka)s one of the places where its quite hot and humid. So its quite demanding, especially for the fast bowlers.         
	Prediction ...         
	I dont really predict results. Its all about preparing yourself well and giving 100 per cent. Its all about that for us. We will try to do the best we can.

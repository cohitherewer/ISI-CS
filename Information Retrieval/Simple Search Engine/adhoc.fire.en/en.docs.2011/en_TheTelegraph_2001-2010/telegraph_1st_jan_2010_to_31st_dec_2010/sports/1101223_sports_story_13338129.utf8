The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dhoni hopes   to stage a comeback
                                                                                                                       7                                        Dhoni hopes   to stage a comeback
                  Mahendra Singh Dhoni                           
	Durban: Stung by the humiliating defeat at the hands of South Africa, at Centurion, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni Wednesday said that it is imperative for his team to dump the growing tendency of losing the first Test match of a home or overseas series.         
	Thats one quality we have, a sarcastic Dhoni said, referring to Indias an innings and 25-run loss in the first Test.         
	We dont really do well in the first Test Its not only in India, but also in overseas tours.         
	However, if you look at the previous records, we have come back well in the later stages. Hopefully, we will be back in the next two Test matches, an optimistic Dhoni said.         
	The Indian captain conceded that even though they devised a few plans for the South African batsmen, it didnt work out well.         
	The Indian bowlers were plundered for 620 runs at the Centurion and they managed to dismiss only four South Africa batsmen.         
	It was difficult because there was not much help from the wicket. We dont have bowlers with express pace. They dont bowl super-fast so they have to be even more precise with their line and length, Dhoni said.         
	We tried different fields We tried to contain them but were unsuccessful for the better part of their innings, the Indian captain conceded.         
	When asked whether pace spearhead Zaheer Khans absence made a big difference in the first Test, he said: Its not that whenever Zaheer plays, he gets wickets.         
	But with the amount of experience in his repertoire, he always has a back-up plan ready in case the first strategy doesnt work.         
	Its always difficult to predict the performance of an individual. Especially, we talk a lot about an individual when he is not present, Dhoni added.         
	Meanwhile, organisers of the second India-South Africa Test, in Durban, are facing huge demand of tickets even as weather forecast predicted rain in the lead up to the match.         
	Over 50,000 tickets have been sold for the second Test, at Sahara Stadium Kingsmead, starting Sunday.           (AGENCIES)

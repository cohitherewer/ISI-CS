            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: On their first ever visit to the Caribbean, the Indian womens team are hoping to better last years performance when they play in the ICC Womens World T20 championship that begins May 5.         
	The Indian women, led by Jhulan Goswami, were knocked out in the semi-finals of the inaugural tournament in England by eventual runners-up New Zealand. They have an early opportunity to avenge that loss as they face the New Zealanders in their opening match at Warner Park, St Kitts, on May 6.         
	We have learnt from our mistakes. New Zealand are a strong side, so beating them would give us the momentum. And T20 is all about momentum, Jhulan said ahead of the teams departure for the West Indies on Thursday.         
	The 14-member squad had a preparatory camp at the MCA ground here and also had an interaction with maestro Sachin Tendulkar.         
	Sachin was the highest run-getter in the IPL (but) in the entire tournament, he hit only a couple of sixes. That is what he also told us, that T20 is not always about big shots, said batting mainstay Mithali Raj.         
	The Hyderabad player revealed that the team had also learnt a lot about the shortest format by watching the IPL. Womens T20 came into being only last year, so we are learning, Mithali said.         
	We watched the IPL and now we know how quickly scenarios can change; how the lower-order can play shots; and if we dont get a good start, how to recover.         
	The recent ODI and T20I home series against England showed how much the batting depended on Mithali. She said the team must put more runs on the board than it did against the reigning champions.         
	I thing 140-145 is the average total in womens T20. In the England series, the scores were around 125 and we felt that, maybe, we should have scored 10-15 runs more, she said.         
	At least, the Indians would not be short on match practice. Charlotte Edwards side lost the ODI series 2-3 but bounced back to clinch the T20I rubber 2-1. Veteran Anjum Chopra, who personally had an ordinary series, was not overly worried.         
	When the mens team went to the (T20) World Cup in 2007, nobody expected them to win. So, we dont need to look far for inspiration, she said.

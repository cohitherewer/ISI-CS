The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bengal team on the sick bed!
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bengal team on the sick bed!
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The on-field performance, in the last couple of matches, had bruised Bengals Ranji Trophy hopes. Now, the off-field problems, illness to be precise, are threatening to injure the teams aspirations.         
	Having returned second best against Mumbai and Assam, mission Gujarat was crucial for Bengal. But with almost half of the first team players ruled out of the tie, by courtesy sickness, the mission may remain unaccomplished.         
	Middle-order batsman Abhishek Jhunjhunwala and young pacer Shami Ahmed were hospitalised in Ahmedabad, on Tuesday, the match-eve. While Abhishek had acute pancreas problem, Shami was diagnosed with dengue. Writam Porel, too, was rendered unavailable for the match with a running temperature.         
	And if that was not enough, wicket-keeper Sreevats Goswami developed fever after the days play on Thursday. Team sources from Ahmedabad informed that Sreevatss blood report was awaited as chances are that the youngster, too, might have dengue.         
	One can imagine Bengals plight from the fact that they had just a single substitute available on Wednesday, the opening day of the match which was washed off due to rain.         
	In fact, Arindam Ghosh, who flew to Ahmedabad on Thursday to bolster the squad, has himself just recovered from a bout of viral fever. Captain Manoj Tiwary, too, has just recovered in time to play the Gujarat game after missing most of the Assam match with fever.         
	Ace speedster Ashok Dinda didnt travel with the team as he too suffered from viral fever.         
	Bengals chief selector Sambaran Banerjee accepted that the situation was helpless. What can we do? Abhishek, Shami and Writam have been ruled out of the next tie against Tamil Nadu as they need rest. Dinda will be playing a local match tomorrow (Friday) and I will be there to assess his fitness. Lets see if we can send him for the next match, Sambaran said.         
	Meanwhile, team sources added that Anustup Majumdar will don the wicket-keeping gloves if Sreevats fails to take the ground Friday.

            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: Trainer Pesi Shroffs Deccan Derby winner, Xisca, takes on Vijay Singhs duo of Record Breaker, who is vastly improved, and Hall Of Glory, the last winters highest rated horse, in the 1,600m Calcutta 2,000 Guineas, on Saturday.           
	However, it looks like an uphill task for the stablemates to challenge the might of the filly, Xisca, whos recent mock race indicates that she has been retaining the form which won her the Derby on October 2. Jockey B. Prakash partners the China Visit-Altimara filly.          
	Vijays two babies  Petaloid and Aerator  are however, fancied to win their respective events  the 1,100m Tug Of War Plate and the 1,200m Hong Kong Jockey Club Trophy.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

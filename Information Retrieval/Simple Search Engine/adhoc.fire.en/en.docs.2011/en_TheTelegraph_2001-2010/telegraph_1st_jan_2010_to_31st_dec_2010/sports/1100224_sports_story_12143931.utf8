The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unimpressive victory for Mohun Bagan 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Unimpressive victory for Mohun Bagan 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The quality of football dished out by the Mohun Bagan players is on the wane since the club management decided to replace Moroccan Karim Bencharifa with Satyajit Chatterjee.         
	After managing a 1-1 draw against Mohammedan Sporting in their last CFL Premier Division encounter, the green and maroon brigade returned to winning ways with an unimpressive 1-0 win over Eastern Railway in a 10th round match, at home on Tuesday. Ishfaq Ahmed scored the winner in the 38th minute. Bagan now have 28 points and are four points clear of the second-placed Chirag United.         
	It was probably Bagans worst match of the season. There were not many moves worth mentioning. The mispasses and at times defending with 10 men inside their own penalty box turned the match into a drudgery. Although Snehasish Chakraborty and Ishfaq Ahmed, along with Ryuji Sueoka, tried to create pressure, they ran out of ideas once inside the Railway box.         
	In the 38th minute, Snehasishs innocuous free-kick from the left saw the Railway back-four going for an off-side trap. Ishfaq, who was on-side when Snehashish released the delivery, made a feeble placement. However, goalkeeper Biswanath Sengupta let it in much to the chagrin of the railway camp.

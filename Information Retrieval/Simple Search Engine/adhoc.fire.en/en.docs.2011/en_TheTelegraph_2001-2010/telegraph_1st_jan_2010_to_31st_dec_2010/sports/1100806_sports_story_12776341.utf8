The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kirdi is for speed in Reds deal
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kirdi is for speed in Reds deal
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Syrian businessman Yahya Kirdi is pressing to secure the purchase of Liverpool before the start of the Premier League season. He is hoping to hold face-to-face talks with Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton and owners George Gillett and Tom Hicks next week.         
	Early on Thursday, the Canadian broker handling negotiations said they were pressing for a swift conclusion to the deal. Kirdi is negotiating directly with the American owners rather than Broughton and BarCap, engaged in April at the insistence of RBS to oversee the sale of the club.         
	Dan Diamond, a partner in Gameday, the Canadian management consultancy working for Kirdi, said that one of his partners has already met with Broughton and they will press to seal a deal in the next 10 days.         
	Our target is to have our investors come to the opening game of the season on knowing that they have a deal, he said. Next on the line is to bring together Kirdi and Tom Hicks, George Gillett and Martin Broughton to execute the final purchase agreement and allow Martin to conduct his own sniff test on the deal.         
	He did say that they have agreed a fee with the Americans that includes taking on the 237m loan from RBS, providing funding for a new stadium and some transfer activity, and an equity consideration for Hicks and Gillett.

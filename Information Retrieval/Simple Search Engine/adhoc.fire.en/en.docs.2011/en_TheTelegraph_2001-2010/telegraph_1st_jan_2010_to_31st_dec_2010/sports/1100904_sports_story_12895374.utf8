  - Two late goals by the Nigerian seal WB Polices fate       A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Penn Orji celebrates his second goal against West Bengal Police during their CFL match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: They have heard about Rain dance. The East Bengal supporters are now slowly getting used to Penn dance.         
	Every time Penn Orji scores a goal, he would run towards the corner flag and do a very cute and casual African jig with the supporters roaring in approval.         
	The talented playmaker struck twice, late in the second half as East Bengal beat West Bengal Police 2-0 in a CFL Premier Division match at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Friday.         
	Coach Tervor Morgan had pointed out during his pre-season training that Penns role would be crucial in his scheme of things and the Nigerian didnt disappoint his coach.         
	On the day, the glamour outfit missed lot of chances including an unbelievable one from Robin Singh. He made a mess when all he had to do was to push the ball into an open goal. Till the 78th minute, it looked like the policemen would steal a point from the red-and-gold brigade till Penn turned out to be their Man Friday.         
	The first one was when Police goalkeeper Manoj Shaw barely managed to keep away a Robin left-footer which defender Mehtab Ali Sapui tried to clear. The clearance went to Penn whose powerful right footer deflected off the goalie into the net. In the 88th minute, it was Penns feeble shot that went in after he received a back head from Robin.         
	Apart from scoring the goals, Penn played an active part in winning the balls in the midfield. Along with Reisangmi Vashum on the wide right, the two were instrumental in most of the build-ups.         
	Police captain Himadri Chakraborty playing in the heart of the defence did a praiseworthy job as they defended dourly. Once Himadri was replaced in the 72nd minute, their defence fell apart.         
	Coach Morgan introduced striker Ekene Ikenwa for the last 30 minutes but he will still take some more time to be fully match fit.         
	Meanwhile, East Bengals fourth foreign recruit, Australian striker of Turkish origin Tolgay Ozbey arrived on the day.         
	A former player of NSW league side Blacktown City FC, he was twice awarded New South Wales Premier League Player of the Year award (2006 and 2007).

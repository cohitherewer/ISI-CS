	When Sachin Tendulkar made his Test debut against Pakistan (in Karachi) in 1989, I had a feeling that he was destined for great things. The reason was simple. Even at that young age of 16, he had shown plenty of courage and was hungry to succeed at the top level.         
	His career over the past 21 years and his 50th Test hundred only confirms the volume of talent Sachin has and his commitment towards Indian cricket.         
	Watching him all these years I have no doubt that he is the best batsman in the history of the game. When Sir Donald Bradman was playing people said no one could match his records.         
	When Sunil Gavaskar scored 34 Test centuries, people said no one could break his record. But in case of Sachins 50 Test centuries, I really dont see anyone breaking this record for a long time.         
	 And the way he is going even at an age of 37, he may soon become the first batsman in history to score 100 international hundreds.         
	For Waqar Younis and me our biggest regret remains that for 10 years between 1989 and 1999 there were no bilateral Test series between India and Pakistan. And we never got a chance to bowl against him.         
	Yes, we did play a couple of one-day matches on flat pitches, but the real battle between the bat and the ball comes in Test cricket. Sadly, that was not available although we were ranked the best opening bowling pair at that time.         
	Before India came to Pakistan in 1989, there was a lot of media hype about this teenaged batsman who had set a new world school record with Vinod Kambli.         
	The buzz was so much so that we (Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis) were excited about pitting ourselves against this new talent.         
	In the first Test he didnt leave a big impact. But it was in the match at Sialkot, on a lush green wicket, that we got a glimpse of what Sachin was really about. I remember, the first few balls he faced, I bounced him and he got a cut on his chin. But he scored 50 odd runs and he batted with lot of guts and we knew okay this guy has talent.         
	Then in an exhibition match in Peshawar he hit Abdul Qadir for five sixes. The new kid on the block had shown he was ready to take the fight to the giants.         
	Although I have seen him get frustrated if things dont go Indias way or he is not playing well, Sachin never loses his cool.         
	I know how passionate he is about himself doing well and seeing India win. I can still recall how devastated he was in that 1999 Test at Chennai when India lost narrowly to us despite a fabulous hundred from Sachin.         
	So, there shouldnt be talks about Sachin being a selfish player. But, on second thoughts, all great sportsmen need to be a bit selfish to achieve the impossible and be successful at the top level.         
	When Sachin started his career, he was bit of a half-cock player. Both Waqar and me used to plan to bowl full-length yorkers to start with and then follow it up with bouncers. But whether our plan worked out or not, his wicket was always a prized scalp.         
	Today, Sachin has evolved into one of the most complete batsmen in cricket history. The way he is scoring runs in Test or one-day cricket speaks volumes of his commitment to India and cricket. He is a very very special batsman in my book.         
	And it is because of his superb form I rate India as favourites to win the World Cup.         
	I think the Indian cricket board should let him play as long as he wants to. Because knowing Sachin, no one will need to tell him when to go...         
	The sort of person he is, I have a feeling, Sachin will go gracefully when he feels it is time to hang up his boots. But trust me, the day it happens, cricket is going to lose a lot of fans.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haider warns of fixing network
                                                                                                                       7                                      Haider warns of fixing network
                                  Zulqarnain Haider    
	London: A network of bookmakers trying to fix matches has created an atmosphere of fear and distrust in international cricket, Pakistan wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider said on Friday.         
	Haider fled the Pakistan team hotel in Dubai in secrecy on Monday and flew to London to seek asylum, claiming he received death threats to lose matches against South Africa.         
	He said that international cricket feels dangerous and is plagued by a big mafia working to corrupt the sport.         
	The 24-year-old Haider said he prayed at his mothers graveside for protection when he was selected for the current international series because he feared bad people hovered around the team.         
	Haider said he was approached by an unknown man in Dubai two or three days before the fourth one-day international against South Africa. I was going for dinner at a restaurant, was within walking distance from the hotel, Haider said. The man stopped me. I feel two or three others were around him.         
	He said the threat was delivered coolly. He just talked normally, Haider said. He talked in Urdu, but I cant recognise his accent.         
	Haider said the man was dressed in dark trousers and shirt, with a dark complexion and was clean shaven.         
	He spoke calmly. He wasnt angry or shouting and I just listened. He said if you work with us we will give you a lot of money and if you go back to Pakistan we will kill you and we will kill your family.         
	Haider said he understood that to mean he should try to lose the fourth and fifth ODIs. Haider was in a position to do just that when he came in to bat, but hit the winning runs as Pakistan claimed a one-wicket victory in the fourth match. The purpose of that talk was to disturb me, he said. I was not planning to make the runs before the match.         
	Haider said the threats made the match a difficult experience. It was a crucial time when I went in (to bat). I was hoping the team would lose normally so maybe they (the match-fixers) would be happy (without me doing anything). But when I go in it was a crucial time and I just performed at 150 per cent for my team, my nation, my respect and my family.         
	When you see the first two or three matches, I was very energetic, but in the fourth ODI match you will see my expressions. I was very disturbed. I felt very bad that day.         
	Haider said he was not offered any specific sums. Haider defended his decision not to seek help from his teammates or management instead of leaving the camp. I didnt want to involve them in this problem. I took the stakes on my shoulders. In that situation I dont want to trust anyone. Theres a big mafia all over the world of bookies trying to fix matches.         
	Haider said the scandal surrounding match fixing in the Pakistan camp during the tour of England earlier this year added to his fears when he was approached in Dubai.         
	When I was selected, I went to my mothers graveside to be safe from that mafia of bad people. It (cricket) feels dangerous.(agencies)

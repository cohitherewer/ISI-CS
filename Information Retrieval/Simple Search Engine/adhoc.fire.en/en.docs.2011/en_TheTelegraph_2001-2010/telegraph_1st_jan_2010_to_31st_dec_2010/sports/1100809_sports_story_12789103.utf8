            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Grand Slam champion Leander Paes might be an inspiration for youngsters but the many sacrifices his parents had to make in providing a young Leander with the right environment to succeed, should serve as an eye-opener for the modern day parent.         
	Pushing your child in to sport is fraught with danger, said Vece Paes.         
	The senior Paes words came at a function to announce his new role as the Peak Performance Mentor with the Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association (MSLTA), here, on Saturday.         
	Paes said that he would face no problems in juggling his roles as the Peak Performance Mentor in the MSLTA and as the Anti-Doping Officer with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

            A STAFF REPORTER            Mashrafe Mortaza                           
	Calcutta: Bangladesh speedster Mashrafe Mortaza, who underwent a knee-surgery last August, joined the Kolkata Knight Riders squad in Mumbai on Tuesday.         
	Although his name doesnt figure in the list of 23 registered players, the team management will assess his fitness during the training session Wednesday.         
	In case Mashrafe is found fit to play, he may be registered before they take on the Deccan Chargers on Friday. In that case, Mashrafe will be eligible for a first XI berth.         
	Incidentally, Mashrafe sustained a knee injury in the West Indies last year. He made his international comeback during the first ODI against England in Mirpur recently.

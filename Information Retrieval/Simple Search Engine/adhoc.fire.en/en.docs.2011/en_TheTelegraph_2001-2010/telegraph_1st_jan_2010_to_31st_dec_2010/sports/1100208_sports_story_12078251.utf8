The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sacking captain   to save   player
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sacking captain   to save   player
            Duncan White                                              Fabio Capello      
	Fabio Capello sacked John Terry as England captain for his own protection after growing concerned about the impact the continued media exposure would have on the player.         
	The England manager feared that the growing scandal would only intensify if Terry remained in the role and that it could prove a damaging distraction to Englands World Cup chances. A source close to the England management team said: It was like he was a bleeding fish being pursued by sharks. The sharks were not going to stop until they had the fish.         
	It is understood that the England camp was growing seriously concerned by the strain that Terry was under, as revelations continued to emerge about his private life. Capello is insistent that no moral judgement was made on Terry and that he acted only to preserve the dynamic of the dressing room. Pulling Terry out of the firing line was seen as necessary to that.         
	As captain, Terry would have had to speak to the media and, with Englands next game against Egypt on March 3, Capello was concerned of possible distractions to preparations for the World Cup finals in South Africa. Even worse would be if it followed the England camp into the finals itself.         
	While Capello understands that there will be continued interest in Terrys private life, he is confident his decision to strip him of the captaincy will help defuse the issue and allow him to pursue a business-as-usual approach in the rest of his preparations.         
	The Capello camp is pleased with Terrys response to his sacking. He impressed with his conduct in the meeting at Wembley on Friday and in his determination to fight back.         
	While Capello hopes his ambition to reclaim the captaincy will bring out the best in him, it is a futile hope for Terry. It is understood that Capello will not go back on his decision to sack Terry, even after the World Cup finals. Should Rio Ferdinands injury problems rule him out, then Steven Gerrard, the new vice-captain, will lead.         
	The Terry scandal even managed to overshadow a Uefa media event to mark the draw for Euro 2012.         
	Each country has its own problems, said Uefa president Michel Platini. But what is of enormous interest in the UK is not necessarily of any in Cyprus.         
	Meanwhile, Wayne Bridge, the wronged party in the affair, made his first appearance since the furore erupted in Manchester Citys 2-1 defeat at Hull and was given an unsympathetic reception from the home fans.         
	I think we have to have respect for people, said City manager Roberto Mancini. It was not good, the people did not respect him.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

            FOR KING AND COUNTRY    
	Sheikh 1 Fifa 0               
	Matters came to a head when a freak whistle from the crowd appeared to have distracted the Kuwaiti players while France coolly netted the ball at the 1982 World Cup. The referee allowed the goal and within minutes the indignant Sheikh Fahad had summoned his boys back. He even went down to the pitch (he was the head of their FA after all) to argue the point with a by now stupefied referee. Any way the goal was disallowed and France went on to win 4-1. Of course Fifa had the last word, a princely sum of $8,000 to be paid as fine by the uber rich oil mogul.   
	Off the ball         
	The Germans had gone and lost to Algeria in the 1982 finals and to progress needed a win against Austria who could afford to lose but by a margin of fewer than three goals in which case the poor Algerians would have to head home. Well, the match started and a determined Germany went ahead in the 11th minute. Then they just lost interest in the match, both of them. Now we do know that they speak the same language and live in the same neighbourhood, so it rsquo;s not surprising they had a lot of catching up to do. Only it wasn rsquo;t in the game.             
	Hand in glove?               
	Ramon Quiroga, the Peru goalkeeper was something of a Great Wall of China at the rsquo;78 finals. That was until he met the hosts, when it turned out that he was not much more than just an expat born in Argentina. So nostalgia blurred his eyes and the talismanic rsquo;keeper could do little to prevent himself from fetching the ball out of his net a whole six times. The hosts didn rsquo;t stop there, as you would remember, they went on to win the World Cup.            
	Running dogfight               
	From Maradona rsquo;s hand to Beckham rsquo;s leg, for three decades and more this saga has been utterly physical in its drama. To wit, Argentina captain in rsquo;66, Antonio Rattin, was sent off after 38 minutes for what the German referee, who spoke no Spanish, described as lsquo;violence of the tongue rsquo;. England were of course at home and went on to win the Cup. In 1978, when Argentina were to host the quadrennial, the Englishmen made sure they did not get a nasty reception by the simple expedient of not qualifying. But in rsquo;86 Mexico Maradona got them and later claimed God had a hand in it. To rub salt into their wounds he made sure England were remembered for what is arguably the greatest goal of the World Cup, for no reason other than that they conceded it. The lads nearly got them in rsquo;98 but the England goalie alas was not Jens Lehmann when it mattered most. And so it goes.

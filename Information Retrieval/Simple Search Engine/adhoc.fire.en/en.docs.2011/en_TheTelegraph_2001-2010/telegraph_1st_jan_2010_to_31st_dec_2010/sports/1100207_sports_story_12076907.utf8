The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Much ado about a non-issue

  - Clerical error forced change in Dhaka team list       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Virender Sehwag                                 
	Calcutta: There was a change in Indias team sheet, moments before the toss in the recent Dhaka Test, but that had nothing to do with any dispute between captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and his deputy, Virender Sehwag.         
	The change, according to The Telegraphs sources, became necessary as a member of the support staff had goofed up while writing the XI on the captains behalf.         
	Specifically, instead of Pragyan Ojha, he wrote Amit Mishra (whod played the previous Test, in Chittagong).         
	Dhoni noticed the mistake just before the customary exchange of the team XIs and immediately made the correction with Match Referee Andy Pycrofts permission.         
	Clearly, it wasnt an issue.         
	The change had absolutely nothing to do with Sehwag wanting Mishra to be retained, while Dhoni wanted to bring back Ojha... Sections of the media acted most irresponsibly in claiming that they were involved in a row, one of the sources pointed out.         
	Sehwag had captained in Chittagong, as Dhoni was laid low with a back problem.         
	Dhoni wasnt available for a comment, but its understood he was very upset at the suggestion in some quarters that there was a motive in omitting Mishra, who is Sehwags teammate (Delhi DareDevils) in the IPL.         
	As things turned out, Mishra has made a comeback in the very first Test after Dhaka, in Jamtha. And, yes, Dhoni is captaining...         
	Footnote: Graeme Smith, the South Africa captain, is furious that an English daily with multiple editions described his companion, Brigitte Sarembock, as a plain Jane. Last heard, he wanted to know who wrote the offensive article, as it didnt carry a byline.

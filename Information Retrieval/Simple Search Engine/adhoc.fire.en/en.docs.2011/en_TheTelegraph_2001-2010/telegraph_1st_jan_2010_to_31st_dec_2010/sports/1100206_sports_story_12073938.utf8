The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our mindset is to win, says Dhoni 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Our mindset is to win, says Dhoni 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Nagpur on Friday      
	Nagpur: What a change from the rather chaotic Chittagong, where Team Indias last Test series began three weeks ago.         
	What a change, too, in the manner and content of what the captains said on the eve of that two-match affair  from Bangladesh is an ordinary side to South Africa and Australia being much better than India.         
	It was, to say the least, explosive and provocative stuff.         
	The series beginning on Saturday also features two Tests (for the Jaypee Infratech Cup). Plenty more, though, is at stake.         
	Actually, for all intents and purposes, its like the title-decider of a world championship. And, so, finishing second-best wont mean anything.         
	Both Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Graeme Smith have done their bit to take some of the glare away from the rankings, but the fact is that the two top teams are confronting each other.         
	South Africa rose to No.1 last August, but lost that ranking to India in early December. Actually, little separates the two (a mere four ratings points on the ICC table).         
	A draw would help India retain the top position, while a win for South Africa would take them right back to the summit, this time without Mickey Arthur.         
	Weve never called ourselves anything... Its just that we go with a mindset of winning... We dont believe in tags, of the favourite or the underdog... Its what we do on the field for six hours (each day) that matters, Dhoni pointed out.         
	Smith, it may be recalled, gave India the favourites label within hours of landing here.         
	Former captain and now a member of the interim selection panel, Kepler Wessels, however, had a different take.         
	Id say both teams start evenly... I wouldnt pick a favourite, but (Rahul) Dravids absence does count for much... In a way, its disappointing, as I quite like seeing him bat, Wessels told The Telegraph, at the Pride Hotel.         
	Mentally among the toughest to have played the game, Wessels has come on the tour to help the batsmen and be of help to acting coach Cornelius Van Zyl.         
	The stakes, after all, are high.         
	As Smith put it, winning in India is a goal for his battle-hardened unit. But he stopped short of making it dramatic in the manner of Steve Waugh, who made the last frontier bit so fashionable.         
	If we win, it will be a massive feather in our cap, the captain, who enjoys leading from the front, maintained. The last series, in March-April 2008, ended 1-1.         
	Smith was honest enough to admit that the past week had been tough and the happenings had weighed on his players minds. He was referring to the period when Arthur quit as coach and the Mike Procter-headed selection panel got the boot.         
	Yet, Smith made the point that his team had good plans and good skills to adjust to the demands of the match.         
	Dhoni, who only recently completed five exceptional years of international cricket, is looking for somebody to step up and do the job in the absence of Dravid (and Yuvraj Singh, plus possibly V.V.S. Laxman).         
	As already reported, Murali Vijay is set to bat at No.3, a slot monopolised by Dravid for a good many years.         
	Getting back to Dhoni, not losing sleep over what cant be controlled has been his mantra. Incidentally, his debut as a Test captain (albeit in a stand-in capacity) had been during the last series against South Africa, in Kanpur.         
	Thanks to Sourav Ganguly, India won at the Green Park and managed to square the series.         
	Unlike Virender Sehwag and Shakib-al Hasan in Chittagong, who began a war of words, Dhoni and Smith chose to say the right things.         
	Im a better keeper, hes a better opener, Dhoni quipped. Smith, on the other hand, said his counterpart had earned respect and was a key figure.         
	The pre-match niceties over, its to be seen whether sparks fly on the turf at the VCA Stadium, in Jamtha, and at the Eden Gardens.         
	Surely, a duel to watch out for would be the one between Sehwag and tearaway Dale Steyn, who has needled the India vice-captain on the sensitive issue of short-pitched deliveries.         
	Not that others are going to be pushed off centre stage.

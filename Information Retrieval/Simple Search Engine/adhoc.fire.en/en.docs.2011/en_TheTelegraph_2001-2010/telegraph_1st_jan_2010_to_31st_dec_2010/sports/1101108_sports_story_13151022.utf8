The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fernando brace floors Chelsea

	London: Spain striker Fernando Torres rediscovered his goalscoring touch, on Sunday, with a double enabling Liverpool to stun leader Chelsea with a 2-0 victory that hauled the club into the top half of the Premier League.         
	Torres slipped the ball over Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech in the 11th minute after picking up Dirk Kuyts through ball. The Spaniard added a second just before half time, curling the ball in from a difficult angle.         
	Didier Drogba started on the bench for Chelsea, which looked unimpressive in attack.         
	Liverpools worst start to a season for more than 50 years left the club in the relegation zone last month, but a hat trick of wins have lifted the 18-time champions to ninth.         
	Defending champion Chelsea is now just two points ahead of Manchester United and five ahead of third-placed Arsenal, which lost 1-0 at home to Newcastle.         
	Manchester City joined Arsenal on 20 points with a 2-0 victory at West Bromwich Albion. Mario Balotelli scored twice before being sent off.         
	Andy Carroll headed Newcastle to its first victory over Arsenal in five years.         
	He rose above Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to head Joey Bartons deep free kick into the net on the stroke of half time.         
	What he showed today is the ability hes got  of course what he does have is the prowess in the air, Newcastle manager Chris Hughton said.         
	But he showed also the running ability hes got. Hes still learning the game, hes getting better.         
	Hes had his ups and downs and he gets bullied at times, all of these things, but hes certainly going in the right direction.         
	Despite having more shots on target, Arsenal went down for the second time this season to a promoted side, having been beaten by West Bromwich Albion in September.         
	A looping free kick from Cesc Fabregas hit the cross bar and the captain, who was returning from a hamstring injury, set up Samir Nasri for a shot before half time that Trim Krul pushed over with a one-handed save.         
	At the start of the second half, Arsenal came close again. Theo Walcott collected Jack Wilsheres pass and fired in an angled drive, which hit the underside of the crossbar with Krul beaten.         
	I think against West Brom we were complacent  I dont think we were today, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said.

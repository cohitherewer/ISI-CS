The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Whatmore: Cant afford   to stop now 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Whatmore: Cant afford   to stop now 
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: The crests and troughs of the Kolkata Knight Riders performances in this editions Indian Premier League has not only been a concern for captain Sourav Ganguly, but also for coach Dav Whatmore.         
	That was reflected in his words at the press conference on the eve of their home match against the Kings XI Punjab.         
	Whatmore was straightforward at the Eden on Saturday as he said that the Knights have to make up for their four losses in the meet so far and cannot afford to stop their winning momentum.                 
	The following are excerpts               
	If there are injury worries ahead of the match         
	Its very difficult for me to speak on that I would say that we do have one injury concern. But Im not quite sure if I can elaborate on that. Its not possible to say wholl be played or wholl be.         
	Update on David Husseys condition (he was suffering from a stomach bug)         
	Hussey is perfectly fine. He participated in the net session as well It was for everybody to see. So I dont think there is anything to worry about Hussey.         
	If Brendon McCullum would play on Sunday         
	I am not in a position to speak about that. He is an opening batsman and has done well in that position in Twenty20s. Recently, he got a hundred in a T20 against the Australians. So obviously, if he is discussed, he will be discussed as an opener. And as far as the question of who he will replace if he plays, I cant specify. But he cant be included in place of an Angelo Mathews, who is an all-rounder. So if he plays, it will be in place of someone like Chris Gayle or Hussey.         
	On Gayles form         
	He is a match-winner and match-winners dont perform everyday. But the day they perform, they win you matches.         
	The importance of Sundays home match         
	It doesnt matter whether it is a home or an away tie. The important thing for us at this juncture is that we should continue to win Should continue to press forward. We have to make up for the four losses that we have suffered in the tournament so far. Having won the last match, we simply cant afford to stop now.         
	On the opponents         
	In the current scenario, its fair to say that the Kings XI are struggling. But that also means that they are due for a victory. We must not take them lightly. On paper, they are as strong as any other team in the Indian Premier League. Someone like Yuvraj Singh looked good last night (against the Royal Challengers Bangalore).

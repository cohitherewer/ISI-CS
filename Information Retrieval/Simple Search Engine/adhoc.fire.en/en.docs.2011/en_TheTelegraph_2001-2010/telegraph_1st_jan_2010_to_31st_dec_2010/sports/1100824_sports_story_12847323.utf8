            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Somdev Dev Varman regained his place in the top-100 after improving his ranking by four places to 99. His first round appearance at the Cincinnati Masters following a successful qualifying campaign earned him 35 points and helped his cause.         
	Somdev rose to his career best 96 early this month but his stay in top-100 was short-lived as he got out of the elite bracket following a poor show at Washington event.         
	Rafael Nadal still leads followed by Roger Federer. Serbias Novak Djokovic held on to his third position. A semi-final appearance at the ATP Challenger event in Uzbekistan helped Vishnu Vardhan take a jump of 58 places to 335, the best-ranked Indian after Somdev in the ranking list.         
	In doubles rankings, Mahesh Bhupathi gained a place to lie seventh, after ending runners-up at the Cincinnati Masters with Max Mirnyi. Leander Paes and Rohan Bopanna were static at sixth and 33 rd places, respectively.

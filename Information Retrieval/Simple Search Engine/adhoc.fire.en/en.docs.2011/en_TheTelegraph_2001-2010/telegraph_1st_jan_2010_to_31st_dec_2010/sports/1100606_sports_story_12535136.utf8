	Italy  
	Defending champions Italy will naturally be one of the leading contenders. The only country, along with Brazil, to have won the Cup twice in succession, Italy will be vying to match the performance of their pioneering predecessors in rsquo;34 and rsquo;38. Some of the big names from Germany rsquo;06 are absent for the trip to South Africa but that is hardly going to worry a team that is full of experienced campaigners on the world stage.  
	Road to South Africa            
	 The Azzurri topped Group 8 thanks to their traditional efficiency and pragmatism. In total, they recorded seven wins and three draws, firing 18 goals and conceding seven.   
	Star player  
	 With Fabio Cannavaro marshalling the defence, the team can properly concentrate on attacking. An excellent reader of the game and a fearless leader, how the captain plays would largely determine how the Azzurri perform.  
	Coach  
	 A veritable monarch in the field of coaching, 61-year-old Marcello Lippi is an expert at making changes that yield results, with no fewer than five of the 12 goals Italy registered at rsquo;06 coming from substitutes.   
	Record  
	 Italy have qualified for 16 of the 18 finals, failing to book themselves a place in 1958 and having not opted to take part in the first edition in 1930. They have won the competition on four occasions mdash; rsquo;34, rsquo;38, rsquo;82 and rsquo;06. They also finished runners-up in 1970 and 1994 and claimed third place on home soil in 1990.   
	Fabio Cannavaro  
	Date of birth: September 13, 1973
  Height: 5 ft 9 in
  Position: Defender
  Club: Al-Ahli Dubai
  Goals: 2
  First Int rsquo;l: Vs Northern Ireland in 1997  
	Paraguay  
	Having just put together their best ever qualification campaign, Paraguay are entitled to think big ahead of their fourth consecutive appearance at the World Cup. Under the guidance of Argentinian coach Gerardo Martino, the current Albirroja crop look to have what it takes to build on the progress made by their predecessors at France 1998 and Korea/Japan 2002, where the Paraguayans were knocked out in the round of 16.   
	Road to South Africa             
	Martino rsquo;s side confirmed qualification with a 1-0 defeat of Argentina in September and President Fernando Lugo declared a national holiday to allow the Paraguayans to celebrate the achievement.  
	Star player  
	Roque Santa Cruz needs no introduction after several successful seasons in EPL. His importance remains undiminished despite him being absent for 
  most of qualifying.  
	Coach  
	 Gerardo Martino is yet another Argentinian tactician currently excelling in the South American game. The man they call El Tata made his name in the 1990s as a talented attacking midfielder before moving into coaching in 1998.   
	Record  
	 Paraguay will be making their eighth World Cup appearance and their fourth in a row. But the La Albirroja have never won two games at the same finals and have yet to progress beyond the Round of 16.  
	Roque Santa Cruz  
	Date of birth: August 16, 1981 
  Height: 6 ft 2 in
  Position: Striker
  Club: Manchester City
  Goals: 21
  First Int rsquo;l: At Copa America 1999  
	New Zealand  
	After a disastrous campaign four years ago, New Zealand bounced back in emphatic fashion under coach Ricki Herbert to qualify for their first appearance on the world stage in 28 years following a debut showing at Spain 1982. Herbert, and assistant Brian Turner, were both key figures in the campaign nearly three decades ago and the duo have turned this All Whites side into a team hungry for success.  
	Road to South Africa             
	New Zealand topped their Oceania qualification group comfortably and then had an 11-month wait before a two-legged meeting with the fifth-placed Asian nation, Bahrain, which they won to progress.   
	Star player  
	Captain and centre-back Ryan Nelsen is undoubtedly the one with the best credentials in the squad. The resolute defender has been a regular at Blackburn Rovers 
  for a number of years, and is the only New Zealander to achieve such longevity 
  in the English Premier League.   
	Coach  
	 Ricki Herbert, one of New Zealand football rsquo;s most-famous figures, has formed the All Whites into a solid working unit who produce consistent performances.   
	Record  
	 New Zealand have appeared on the world stage just once, in rsquo;82 Spain.  
	Ryan Nelsen  
	Date of birth: October 18,1977
  Height: 6 ft 1 in
  Position: Defender
  Club: Blackburn Rovers
  Goals: 6
  First Int rsquo;l: Vs Poland in 1999  
	Slovakia  
	Appearing for the first time in a major international competition, Slovakia have been striving to relive the glory years enjoyed by the former Czechoslovakia since going it alone in 1993. Slovakia can rely on a well-organised collective with plenty of admirable qualities. In South Africa, with a lot of determination, which they have, and a little luck, which they need, the team might well spring a surprise or two.  
	Road to South Africa             
	Vladimir Weiss rsquo;s side booked their historic place upsetting a number of predictions that they would struggle to cope with a difficult pool. Needing to prevail in Poland in their final tie, they duly won 1-0.  
	Star player  
	 Solid at the back for EPL heavyweights Liverpool, Martin Skrtel is a central figure for the team. He may not be a Cannavaro or a John Terry just yet, but his Anfield experience will stand the team in good stead.  
	Coach  
	Blessed with a strong personality, former Slovakia international Vladimir Weiss learnt the coaching ropes at Artmedia Bratislava, leading the unfancied Slovakian outfit into 
  the Champions League group phase in 2005/06.  
	Record  
	 While this may be Slovakia rsquo;s first appearance on the global stage, the country's footballing past is naturally tied up with that of the former Czechoslovakia, who participated in eight finals overall.   
	Martin Skrtel  
	Date of birth: December 15, 1984
  Height: 6 ft 3 in
  Position: Defender
  Club: Liverpool
  Goals: 5
  First Int rsquo;l: In 2004

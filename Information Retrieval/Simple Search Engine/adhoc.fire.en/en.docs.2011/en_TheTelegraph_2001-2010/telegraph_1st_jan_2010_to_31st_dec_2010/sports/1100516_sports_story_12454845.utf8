The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Nobody should write us off, says Michael Clarke 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Nobody should write us off, says Michael Clarke 
    - Michael Hussey played an unbelievable innings: Pak coach Waqar           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mike Hussey                                 
	Gros Islet (St Lucia): Having been smashed for 23 in the first five balls of the final over, offie Saeed Ajmal was disconsolate. Destroyer Michael Hussey, on the other hand, was on Cloud Nine with non-striker Mitchell Johnson just as ecstatic.         
	The scenes, indeed, were dramatic as Australia pulled off the near-impossible to stop holders Pakistan from progressing beyond the (second) semi-final of the World Twenty20, on Friday.         
	With as many as 34 needed from the last two overs, few gave Australia much of a chance, but with 16 taken off the 19th, bowled by Mohammed Aamer, 18 were required from the final over.         
	A single by Johnson on the first delivery was followed by Husseys brilliant finish  6,6,4,6... Once described as Mr Cricket, he couldve continued clearing the rope.         
	Mind-boggling at No.7 in a T20 line-up.         
	Clearly, at the crunch, Shahid Afridi blundered by giving the last over to a spinner. Thats why, perhaps, he didnt present himself before the media.         
	Nine times out of 10, teams scoring 191 for six in the last-four of a world event wouldve been able to defend that total. Pakistan failed, despite taking three wickets within eight overs.         
	Its not that we played badly... Australias batting was outstanding... Hussey played an unbelievable innings... Still cant believe it... Now, Australia have the momentum and will be hard to beat in the final, observed Pakistans coach, Waqar Younis.         
	Michael Clarkes emotions were very different.         
	Its a big day in my career, yes... Im excited and looking forward to Sundays final, Clarke, the Australia captain, told The Telegraph.         
	Clarke and MoM Hussey (60 not out from only 24; 3x4,6x6) hadnt really got a hold on their emotions, even after half-an-hour, when they came for the press conference.               
	The following are excerpts from what Clarke said               
	Australia making their first final in three editions...         
	Yes, I can believe the result, because of the guy (Hussey) sitting next to me... It was an unbelievable performance from any cricketer at any level... Weve shown that nobody should ever write us off... Hussey and Whitey (Cameron White) had an unbelievable day... That we havent won this tournament gives us the extra ammo.         
	[For the record, Australia have won the last three World Cups and retained the Champions Trophy last October. Its an awesome record.]         
	What has made the difference this time         
	More experience... Then, weve worked hard and focused on improving in T20... A bit of luck, too, has played its part... We took time in working out our best T20 squad and weve got a mix of quality individuals.         
	Thoughts at the break         
	Frankly, when we came off at the break, Id thought wed given Pakistan 15-20 runs extra... But I was confident, given our batting line-up... We bat deep.         
	Caught chewing his nails towards the close         
	Dont have nails left! I watched the first ball of the final over, saw Mitch (Johnson) take a single and went into the changing room... I heard shouts on the next delivery and the one after that and realised sixes were being hit... I was too nervous.         
	Pakistans batting performance after being made to set a target         
	They batted very well, the Akmal brothers, in particular.         
	Meeting England in the final         
	England have been playing very well and have the confidence... Kevin Pietersen is in form and hell be playing a huge part... Theyve adapted well to the conditions and, probably, were the best side in their group... I expect a great final... Irrespective of the opposition, its a special feeling for the guys.         
	T20 Ashes         
	(Laughs) Perhaps, theres that extra spice... Any opportunity to try and beat England is a good opportunity... I wouldnt compare this with the Ashes as, I think, eight of our guys arent in the Test squad.         
	Final at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown         
	The conditions there will suit us more than St Lucia... The bounce will help our batters and bowlers.         
	The Australian women, too, making Sundays final         
	Hopefully, both of us will get over the line. It will be a super Sunday, for sure.               
	Now, excerpts from Husseys session with the media...               
	Feelings         
	Probably the best Ive felt since getting the winning runs in the Ashes Test in Adelaide (2006-07)... (Adds smiling) I did have my doubts about getting to the target.         
	Thoughts in the last over, when 18 were required         
	Wanted to hit the ball up in the wind... Wanted to hit sixes... Was saying to myself that I should hit off the middle... It was special to see the elation on the faces of my mates.         
	Finally, on T20 cricket...         
	Have always enjoyed T20 and its a great format through which to fall in love with the game... Its an awesome concept, but my first love remains Test cricket.         
	Footnote: Pakistan have got dethroned, but there will be a Pakistani presence in one of the dugouts  former leggie Mushtaq Ahmed is on Englands support staff. I dont need to give him tips... He doesnt need any, Waqar quipped.

	Watford: England striker Wayne Rooney will travel to Switzerland as planned for the teams European Championship qualifier, despite reports about his private life being splashed across British tabloids.         
	Rooney trained as normal with his England teammates on Sunday morning  hours after The News of the World and The Sunday Mirror alleged that the Manchester United player cheated repeatedly on his then-pregnant wife last year with a prostitute.         
	According to The Sunday Mirror, the affair with 21-year-old Jenny Thompson began last June and their last meeting in Manchester was in October, a month before Rooneys wife Coleen gave birth to their first son, Kai.         
	The Rooneys, who married in 2008, have cultivated their fame to become one of Britains leading celebrity couples. Coleen has her own TV series and magazine column and is considered a fashion icon.         
	There was no comment on the allegations from the Football Association or Manchester United, but the Premier League club is willing to provide support to Rooney.         
	The FA insisted that it is business as usual and that Rooney would remain at the team hotel, before flying with the rest of the squad to Switzerland on Monday for Tuesday nights qualifier.         
	He did the full session (on Sunday morning), midfielder James Milner told reporters at the team hotel near London. We had our full training session and back to football is what were here to do.         
	Rooney played a part in all four goals on Friday night as England began their Euro 2012 qualification campaign with a 4-0 victory over Bulgaria at Wembley. Hes a top, top player and we want to put out the strongest team possible, Milner said. The 24-year-old Rooney hasnt scored for England since last September and endured a lackluster World Cup as England were eliminated in the second round.         
	Its important we go out and win matches and control ourselves on the field and off the field as best we can, Milner said. Things are always said in the paper, good things, bad things, about the England team when results are going well and when theyre not going well.

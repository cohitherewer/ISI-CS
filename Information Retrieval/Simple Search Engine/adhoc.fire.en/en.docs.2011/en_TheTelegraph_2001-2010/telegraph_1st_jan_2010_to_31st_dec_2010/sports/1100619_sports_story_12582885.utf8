The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England draw again
                                                                                                                       7                                      England draw again
                      
	Cape Town: An inefficient England were held to a goalless draw by Algeria in their World Cup Group C match, here on Friday.         
	It was their second stalemate  they played a 1-1 draw with the US last week.         
	With a sullen Wayne Rooney scoreless for a seventh straight match, England lacked heart and inspiration, struggling throughout against an opponent fighting to avoid becoming the first to be eliminated from the World Cup.         
	The result set up a Group C finale on Wednesday with England taking on Slovenia and the United States playing Algeria. Slovenia lead the group with four points, followed by England and the United States with two each. Algeria have one point.         
	England looked far from their best even as the team pressed forward.         
	Englands passing was errant, with midfielder Steven Gerrard particularly wasteful.         
	Algeria looked happy to sit back and look for opportunities to counterattack, but Rafik Halliche had to be alert to head clear a cross by Aaron Lennon intended for Rooney.         
	Halliche also blocked a shot by Emile Heskey off a rare England break.         
	Frank Lampard had the best chance of the match in the first half, but his left-footed shot from 12 yards was well saved by Algeria goalkeeper Mbohi Rais Ouhed.         
	England made three changes. David James started in goal, with coach Fabio Capello also restoring midfielder Gareth Barry to the starting lineup.         
	The 39-year-old James returned in place of Robert Green after the goalkeepers blunder allowed the United States to secure the draw in the teams opener. Barry is recalled in place of James Milner after a six-week layoff because of damaged right ankle ligaments.         
	Capellos only other change is Jamie Carragher starting in place of injured central defender Ledley King.         
	Algeria also made a switch in goal, bringing in Rais Bolhi for Fawzi Chaouchi. Ryad Boudebouz takes Rafik Djebbours place in Algerias five-man midfield with the lineup otherwise unchanged from the side that lost 1-0 to Slovenia last week.         
	Earlier, thousands of England fans basked in Cape Towns winter sunshine, dancing to African drums and cheering at arch rivals Germanys 1-0 defeat to Serbia.         
	Complaints that Cape Town had missed the World Cup party so far were silenced when England fans filled up the citys waterfront bars, posing for photos with Algerian fans and hanging flags up wherever they could.

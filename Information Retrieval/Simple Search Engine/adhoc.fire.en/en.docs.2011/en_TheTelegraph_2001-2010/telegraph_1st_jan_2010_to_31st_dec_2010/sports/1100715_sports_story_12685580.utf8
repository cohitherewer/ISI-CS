The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A setback for Lalit Modi
                                                                                                                       7                                      A setback for Lalit Modi
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Lalit Modi received a setback in his fight against the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday when the Bombay High Court refused to stay his suspension as IPL chairman and the disciplinary proceeding against him by the BCCI.         
	A two-member division bench that heard Modis writ petition said that it would only consider the appeal to reconstitute the BCCI disciplinary committee formed to inquire into charges of corruption in the Indian Premier League by Modi.         
	We wont go into all other allegations, Justice B H Marlapalle and Justice Roshan Dalvi observed, while reserving their verdict for Thursday.         
	That means Modi, currently in England, has to appear on Friday in front of the committee which had issued the summons on July 8, the same day the former filed his appeal in the court.         
	Chirayu Amin, a BCCI vice-president and interim chairman of the IPL, Arun Jaitley, BJP leader and Delhi District Cricket Association supremo, and Jyotiraditya Scindia, a Union Minister and head of Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association are the three members on the committee.         
	Interestingly, Modis lawyer Viraf Tulzhapurkar, during the hearing, did not emphasise on the quashing of suspension and disciplinary proceedings and focused on his clients demand for an independent panel.         
	However, when the judges asked whether the BCCI constitution provided for an independent disciplinary committee, Tulzhapurkar answered in the negative.         
	A. Sundaram, counsel for the BCCI, argued that the High Court could not hear the petition as the BCCI was a registered society and the issue was an internal matter.         
	Tulzhapurkar claimed that the disciplinary committee had already made up its mind regarding Modi. The decision of this committee is a foregone conclusion, he said.         
	Arguing against Amins presence on the committee, the counsel said that he was not only a member of the IPL governing council, but could also be biased against Modi since he had revealed his intention to buy stakes in a consortium that bid for the Pune franchise.         
	Tulzhapurkar extended the partiality argument to Jaitley as well, saying the latter was part of the IPL governing council that approved charges of irregularities against Modi.         
	Its impossible to expect honest and impartial decision from the committee, Modis lawyer said.         
	At this point, Sundaram intervened and said that the decision to initiate inquiry and constitute a disciplinary committee was that of the BCCI general body and not that of the governing council.         
	When one of the lawyers for BCCI said that Modis allegations were fanciful, Justice Marlapalle said, in general the game of cricket has become fanciful.         
	Modi has been charged with various irregularities in the IPL and was suspended from all posts in the BCCI on April 26.

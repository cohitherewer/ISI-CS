The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin, Shikhar put team on top
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin, Shikhar put team on top
            OUR CORRESPONDENT            Sachin Tendulkar on way to his 72, in Mumbai, on Thursday                           
	Mumbai: The Mumbai Indians exposed the chinks in Chennai Super Kings armour as they raced to a crushing five-wicket win in the Indian Premier League here on Thursday.         
	After Suresh Raina and S. Badrinath hit battling half-centuries to help the visitors post a competitive 180 for two, the Mumbai Indians overhauled the total comfortably, thanks to a blistering 56 by Shikhar Dhawan and a composed 72 by Sachin Tendulkar.         
	With the Royal Challengers Bangalore suffering a reversal against the Delhi DareDevils at home earlier Thursday, Mumbais fourth win from five outings put Tendulkars side on top of the standings.         
	Dhawan had missed out on a good start against the Kolkata Knight Riders the other day. But Thursday was a different story.         
	The Delhi left-hander announced his intention with a ferocious drive off Balaji to extra-cover all the way to the fence. He then clouted Joginder Sharma for a hattrick of boundaries on the on-side before heaving Balaji for two sixes over backward square leg.         
	Dhawan then welcomed Shadab Jakati with a reverse sweep to point and then smashed him over mid-wicket in his subsequent over. But the left-arm spinner had the last laugh when the batsman top-edged him for a well-judged catch by Raina at mid-on.         
	Earlier, Raina made an unbeaten 83 and Badrinath 55 not out to negate the effect of Matthew Haydens early dismissal.         
	Hayden was in ominous form before he fell to a quicker one by Harbhajan Singh.         
	The Australian wielded his Mongoose bat to brilliant effect as he drove Zaheer Khan for four boundaries  the shots describing a nice arc from third man to long-off  in the second over.         
	But the left-hander was a trifle late in picking Harbhajan and was trapped plumb in front in the fourth over.         
	After the dismissal of Parthiv Patel, the scoring rate dipped a bit but Raina and Badrinath kept the scoreboard ticking with some sharp running between the wickets.

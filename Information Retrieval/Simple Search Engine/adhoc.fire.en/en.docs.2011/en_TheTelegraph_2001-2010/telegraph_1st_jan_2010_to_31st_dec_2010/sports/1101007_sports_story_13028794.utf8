	Calcutta: Sachin Tendulkar moved up one spot, to be at No. 3 in the latest ICC Test batsmen rankings, released on Wednesday. Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara head the list while India opener Virender Sehwag is in second place.         
	Sachins performance in the Mohali Test, which concluded on Tuesday, helped him move up one spot.         
	The 37-year-olds third position is his highest ranking since the Hamilton Test against New Zealand in December 2002.         
	Now, Sachin only trails Sehwag by 13 ratings points. If he can deliver in the second Test, which begin in Bangalore from Saturday, Sachin could potentially put himself in the second place.         
	Indias hero, V.V.S. Laxman jumped four places to eighth position and with it, achieved his career-best rating to date. Rahul Dravid moved up one place to the 22nd.         
	However, Gautam Gambhir and Mahendra Singh Dhoni have fallen to 16th and 37th positions. Zaheer Khan, Doug Bollinger and Ben Hilfenhaus have achieved career-best rankings.

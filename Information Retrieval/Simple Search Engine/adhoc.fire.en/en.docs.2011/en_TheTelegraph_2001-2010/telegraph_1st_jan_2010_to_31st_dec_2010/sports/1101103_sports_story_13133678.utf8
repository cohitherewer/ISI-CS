            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) committee for professional league in India on Tuesday said Mohun Bagan and East Bengal couldnt continue having the same person as the chairman of their respective football teams.         
	According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the six-member AFC committee that met the representatives of the 14 I-League teams in the capital has asked the two clubs to elect separate bosses or to face elimination from the 2011-12 league.         
	To monitor the I-League clubs, the AFC sent a delegation including Tokuaki Suzuki (director of competitions), Maksat Glychmamedov (development manager for professional football), Steve Kim (communications manager), Bryan Kuan Weehooang (director of internal auditing department), Khan Hung Meng (development officer of coach education department) and Mahajan Vasudevan (Sports lawyer of legal department).         
	As per the AFC licensing criteria rule 5 (f), the cross-ownership of the clubs is not allowed. Both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are currently sponsored by a liquor company under different brand names.         
	Among the I-League clubs, Calcuttas Chirag United, JCT, Pune FC, Dempo, Churchill Brothers and Mumbai FC received the nod of the committee for fulfilling the criteria, while the institutional sides like Air India, ONGC and HAL were pulled up for not being able to become separate companies, AIFF sources said.         
	Three others teams  AIFF XI, Salgaocar and Viva Kerala  also couldnt pass the AFC tests of fulfilling the criteria as they did not submit their audited profit and loss statements.

	Guangzhou: Pakistan won their first gold here, on Friday, in the womens Twenty20 final, with a 10-wicket victory over Bangladesh. Nida Rashid scored an unbeaten 51 and took four wickets for 16 runs to lead the country to the first-ever cricket gold medal awarded at the Games.         
	After being sent into bat, Bangladesh was bowled out for 92 in 20 overs. Pakistan had earlier collected a silver in wushu and a bronze in snooker. Earlier, Japan defeated China by seven wickets to clinch bronze.         
	In weightlifting, South Koreas Jang Mi-ran, dubbed the worlds strongest woman, won gold in the super heavyweight class.         
	She lifted 130 kilograms in the snatch and 181 in the clean and jerk to finish with a total of 311. She was unsuccessful in her attempt to lift 188 in the clean and jerk, which would have broken her previous world record.         
	Judo silver medallist Shokir Muminov was the first athlete caught for doping at Guangzhou, with organisers announcing that the 27-year-old from Uzbekistan had been disqualified from the games and stripped of his silver medal after failing a doping test.         
	Muminovs urine test taken after the competition showed traces of the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine. (Agencies)

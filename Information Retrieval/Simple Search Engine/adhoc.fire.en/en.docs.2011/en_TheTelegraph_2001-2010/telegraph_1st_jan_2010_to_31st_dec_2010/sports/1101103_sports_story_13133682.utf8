	New Delhi: Shooter Gagan Narang, who won four gold medals at the Commonwealth Games, will be Indias flag-bearer at the opening ceremony of the 16th Asian Games in Guangzhou, on November 12.         
	Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi, here, announced it Tuesday.         
	We chose Gagan not only because he emerged as Indias best athlete in the Commonwealth Games with four gold medals but also because he has been one of the most consistent performers for India in the past few years, Kalmadi said.         
	The 27-year-old rifle shooter first shot into limelight in the Afro-Asian Games in Hyderabad.         
	Gagan won four gold medals in the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006. In 2008, he won the 10m air rifle gold in the World Cup finals and earlier this year, claimed the bronze in the World championship. He is also ranked No. 4 in the 10m air rifle event in the world, Kalmadi added.

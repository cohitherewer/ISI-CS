The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Saina cruises to the semi-finals
                                                                                                                       7                                        Saina cruises to the semi-finals
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Saina Nehwal after her win in New Delhi, on Friday. (AP)                           
	New Delhi: The moment Mew Choo Wongs forehand return dropped outside the court to confirm Saina Nehwals entry into the semi-finals, the crowd went into frenzy at the Siri Fort Sports Complex on Friday. They were all on their feet, clapping and cheering loudly till their favourite star walked off the playing arena.         
	No doubt, Saina deserved every bit of the applause. Playing against a rival, who had beaten her twice only last year, the girl from Hyderabad dished out one of her best performances in recent times to chalk out a smooth 21-5, 21-13 win in less than half an hour.         
	Even I am speechless by the way I played today (Friday), was Sainas first reaction after the match. I definitely played one of my best matches. Hope I continue to play in the same manner in the next two days.         
	In the semi-finals on Saturday, Saina will play Chinese qualifier Li Xuerui, to become the first Indian, after Dinesh Khanna, to reach the final of the Badminton Asian Championships. Khanna won the title in 1965 and since then it has eluded the Indians, including Prakash Padukone and Syed Modi.         
	But given the way Saina prowled around in the court against Mew Choo Wong, one can definitely hope to see her not allowing the title leave the country. If her every drop shot was a body blow for her Malaysian opponent, Sainas defence was truly impecable. She returned almost everything that was thrown at her and it left Mew Choo exhausted.         
	Initially I was nervous when I walked in, admitted the world No. 6 after her win. After all, she had beaten me before. But I could play perfectly in this match and my defence was excellent.         
	Asked whether she was tired, Saina paused and said: Yes, I was. For three consecutive days I am playing good opponents and beating them in two games         
	On Thursday, the star shuttler talked about having 50-50 chances against Mew Choo. She almost had to say the same thing when asked to comment on qualifier Li Xuerui. The Chinese are all very talented. Lets keep the expectations down, she said.         
	But then, Saina remains Indias lone hope. In the mixed doubles, the much-hyped pair of V. Diju and Jwala Gutta bit dust in the quarter finals against Zihan Qui and Qing Tian of China. Placed comfortably at the start, the Indian duo made too many unforced errors to lose 21-15, 11-21, 14-21.         
	In the womens singles, Aditi Mutatkar went down to Xin Liu of China 14-21, 11-21.

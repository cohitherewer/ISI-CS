            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: The 52nd Winter Bridge Nationals begins Friday at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. The Championship, which ends on December 17, features the most important national events  the Open Teams for Ruia Gold and Silver and two Open Pairs in Holkar and IMP. In addition, two pairs will run in tandem for categorised players and mixed pairs. BAM (Board-A-Match) has been eliminated from the last years format.         
	Unlike last year in Bangalore (156 in Open team event), Calcutta is expecting close to 300 teams. The city last had the record number of entries of 288, way back in 1987.         
	For the record, this will be the fourth time Calcutta is hosting the Winter Nationals.         
	The championship starts with the two-day Swiss league qualifying for the Ruia teams Gold and Silver, which will be held together.         
	A total of 24 teams will qualify for the pre-quarter finals of Gold; the field then progressively gets reduced. The final of the Gold will be held on December 17. For Silver ten teams will move to next stage for round robin play-off on December 13 and 14 to determine the winners.         
	IMP Pairs will be on December 13 and 14 and Holkar starts from December 15, with the final on December 17. Categorised and Mixed Pairs will be held on December 16 amp; 17, respectively.         
	Defending champions of the Ruia Gold, Indian Railways, will have Manas Mukherjee, Rana Roy, Subir Majumder, Debabrata Majumder, Sumit Mukherjee and Amarnath Banerjee in their line-up. However their recent performances havent been very impressive.         
	Other close contenders for the prestigious Ruia Gold are Dhampur Sugar Mills consisting Ashok Goel, Kamal Mukherjee, Pritish Kushari, Suhas Vaidya, Bhabesh Saha and Souren Dutt.         
	The Formidables, the last Indian representation to the Bermuda Bowl in Sao Paolo, comprises Kiran Nadar Subhash Gupta, B Prabhakar, B Satyanarayan, R Venkataraman and Rajesh Dalal. Among others Poddar Developers and Machhars teams looks compact. Recently players from the city like Ashis Malhotra and Hemant Jalan have been doing well in the national circuit. They were in the winning side in the recently concluded Commonwealth Games.         
	It is difficult to pinpoint a clear favourite for the Ruia Gold Cup. Prediction will be risky.

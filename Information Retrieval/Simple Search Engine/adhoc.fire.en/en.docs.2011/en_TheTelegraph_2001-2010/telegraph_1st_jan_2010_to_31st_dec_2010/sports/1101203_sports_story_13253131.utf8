The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | All eyes on the I-League
                                                                                                                       7                                        All eyes on the I-League 
  - Tough test awaits city teams; Dempo will be the side to beat 
            The fourth edition of the I-League kicks off today. The Super Cup, on Tuesday, showed Dempo are still the team to beat. East Bengals brilliant run and Chirag Uniteds purple patch notwithstanding, the city teams have to lift their performance if they want to lay their hands on the trophy. The Telegraph gives a lowdown on the citys three clubs who will feature in the 14-team league.                                      
	MOHUN BAGAN  
	STRENGTHS  
	Mohun Bagans strike force of Jose Ramirez Barreto, Edeh Chidi and Subair Murithala Ali will give a torrid time to the rival defence. Agreed that Barretos age has slowed him down, but still, he remains Bagans main stay up front. Murithala and Chidi together, on their day, can be very lethal. In the midfield, much will depend on youngster Manish Maithani while on the flanks, Snehasish Chakraborty would like to stake his claim for a place in the national team.  
	WEAKNESSES
    
	Mohun Bagan rsquo;s defence have left a lot to be desired. The likes of Karan Atwal, Sagram Mandi, Harpreet Singh and Sheikh Azim do not have the wherewithal to last the distance. They have been so bad this season that even you could fancy your chances. Over dependence on Barreto is another problem for the side. At his age, it will be foolhardy to expect the Brazilian to deliver day in and day out. In the I-league, coach Stanley Rozario rsquo;s tactical acumen will be tested. He hasn rsquo;t showed any maturity till now. The CFL match against East Bengal proved that the amiable Rozario needs more time to settle down. Whether the club is ready for that remains to be seen.   
	PROSPECTS
    
	Bagan do not look champion material. However, if everything goes well, they may finish in the top seven. That will be good enough given the line-up they have. 
  In 2009: Fifth  
	CHIRAG UNITED  
	STRENGTHS
    
	Bengal football has new colours mdash; purple and white. Read the billboard after Chirag United rsquo;s Durand Cup performance. If you think the Chirag officials have gone overboard then you are wrong. Because within a short span of time, Chirag have made rapid strides. Subrata Bhattacharya is the smartest Indian coach, probably after Sukhwinder Singh, and the Durand Cup triumph proved that. In Joshimar they have a good striker and their defence has also looked compact under the leadership of Chika Wali. Mohammed Rafique has impressed fans.  
	WEAKNESSES
    
	Lack of depth in the squad may hinder Chirag United rsquo;s progress in the I-League. Winning a Durand Cup may be easy, but I-League will be a different game altogether. You have to pace your team according to the needs, and, whether Bhattacharya can do that, needs to be seen. Also Bhattaharya rsquo;s inverted snobbery had led to his team rsquo;s downfall. The less he talks, the better it will be for Chirag.  
	PROSPECTS
    
	A top-seven   finish in the I-League is what Bhattachar-ya will be looking at.
  In 2009: Eighth  
	EAST BENGAL  
	STRENGTHS
    
	Mehtab Hussain continues to be the vital cog in East Bengal rsquo;s armour while the central defensive partnership of Uga Okpara and Nirmal Chetri has been in fine form for the red and gold brigade this season. Penn Orji is enjoying his role of an attacking playmaker, while the strike duo of Robin Singh and Tolgay Ozebe have already shown glimpses of what the opponents can expect. Naoba Singh and R Vashum rsquo;s understanding on the right flank makes them one of the most fearsome partnerships in Indian football.
  Coach Trevor Morgan has already grabbed the headlines after East Bengal rsquo;s success in the Federation Cup and Calcutta Football League (CFL). But, the I-league will be his biggest test. After CFL, where the competition is really not that great, the I-League will be a different ball game altogether.

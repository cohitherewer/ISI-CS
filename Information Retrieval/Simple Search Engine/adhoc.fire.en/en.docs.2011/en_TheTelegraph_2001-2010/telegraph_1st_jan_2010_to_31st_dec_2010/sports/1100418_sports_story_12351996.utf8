            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With the race for the semi-final in its last lap and the picture still not clear, a no-holds barred battle is on the cards when the Delhi DareDevils take on the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Kotla on Sunday.         
	Its a now-or-never situation for both the sides as they have 14 points each, courtesy seven wins from 13 outings apiece. DareDevils superior net run-rate places them above the Chargers, but Adam Gilchrist and his men would do everything on Sunday to topple the hosts and clear their passage to the semi-finals.         
	The DareDevils are well-placed but a defeat in the concluding encounter would complicate the situation, while a win would settle the issue.         
	Except for the last match, we have a good track record at home and we hope to wrap it up on Sunday, said DareDevils skipper Gautam Gambhir, on Saturday. However, we need to become more consistent.         
	For the Chargers, winning their last group match may not prove to be enough. Net run-rate is set to play a key role in determining the semi-final line-up, and the Chargers unflattering net run-rate of -0.36 makes it imperative for them to record a big victory on Sunday.         
	The team under Gilchrist, however, would be high on confidence after their four-match winning streak, the latest coming against the Kings XI Punjab in Dharamshala, on Friday.         
	DareDevils are famous for their batting might, but the unpredictable nature of the wicket could once again be a source of trouble not only for the hosts, but also for the visiting side.         
	If the DareDevils boast of having batsmen like Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, David Warner and Paul Collingwood in their ranks, the Chargers, too, with Rohit Sharma, Andrew Symonds and Tirumalasettin Suman in the middle order, are capable of chasing down any target.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies turned into Ashes 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies turned into Ashes 
    - England take 1-0 lead with an innings and 71-run victory             Scyld Berry                             
	Adelaide: The agony of waiting for weather forecasts and warnings of afternoon thunderstorms. The ecstasy of England rolling over Australia before lunch and winning by an innings and 71 runs to go 1-0 up with three Test matches to play.         
	England will not go to Perth for the third Test with Stuart Broad, as he is flying home with his strained stomach muscles, but they will have a mountain of confidence after polishing off Australia here  and making them look second-raters.         
	For half-an-hour on the fifth morning England became ever more twitchy, but that was all, and it was worth the wait. Before an hour-and-a-half had passed, England were huddled in a joyful group, then shaking hands with each other, and thanking their supporters all round the ground with more appreciative claps.         
	In that opening half-hour Mike Hussey  the rock of Australias batting so far in this series  edged a catch behind the wicket off Graeme Swann, and Matt Prior made his first mistake of the series. England grew ever tenser.         
	The second new ball brought relief and the wicket England craved. Only Hussey, of Australias seven remaining players, had the attributes to bat all day and make the big hundred that would give Australia a lead and possibly save them.         
	Then he went to pull Steve Finn  his instincts conditioned at the Waca taking over  but the ball was not short enough, and he lobbed a catch to James Anderson at mid-on.         
	Anderson began to swing the second new ball from the Torrens end. He beat Brad Haddin, then drew him into a defensive push by going wide of the crease and sucking him into edging an outswinger. Prior made gleeful amends.         
	Anderson then bamboozled Ryan Harris with his first ball. How Harris passes as a No.8 is one of the curiosities about this Australian side. Anybody can get a king pair, but Harris seemed capable of not a lot more on the best of days.         
	He was completely suckered. Anderson had been bowling outswingers, and Harris obviously predicted another one, padding up to it in advance. But Anderson bowled an inswinger which pinned Harris in front. The Australians tried a review but it was never more than a forlorn hope.         
	Two wickets in two balls to Anderson, and Hussey gone too. Clouds on the horizon above the Adelaide hills, but only high and wispy ones. And even those seemed to melt away  to the eyes of the England supporters in the ground (there hardly seemed to be any Australian ones)  when Marcus North fell to Swann.         
	Initially North was given not out leg before by Tony Hill, but England appealed  successfully. North was struck on the front pad and trapped in line, before he hit the ball. Norths Test career is one of several on the line in Australias side  and Simon Katich has been ruled out of the rest of this series with his Achilles injury.         
	Swann then went straight through Xavier Dohertys defences  something which Doherty never threatened to do when bowling at England. Another Australian player about to bite the dust.         
	That left Australias last wicket pair of Peter Siddle and Doug Bollinger. Siddle edged a ball from Swann on to his stumps but no bail fell. Only by now, England knew that it was a matter of time alone.         
	The sun was shining, gloriously, when Australias 10th wicket fell  Siddle bowled off-stump by Swann  and England celebrated. It has been one of their finest team efforts, given the loss of Broad, and their efficiency has been capped by the flair of Kevin Pietersen as he hit his highest Test score.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ striker pulls out
                                                                                                                       7                                      NZ striker pulls out
                      
	Wellington: Concerned over security, New Zealand striker Simon Child has pulled out of the hockey World Cup starting Sunday, even though Hockey New Zealand (HNZ) said it was satisfied with the arrangements made by the Indian government.         
	Child said he took the decision because he felt he could not give his best under such heightened security environment during the February 28-March 13 mega-event.         
	Its not an ideal environment to be trying to play your best hockey and to be performing for your country, he was quoted as saying from Perth by the New Zealand Press Association.         
	I think that was the major issue that swayed me when I made up my mind. It was extremely tough, probably the toughest decision Ive had to make in my life.         
	A big part of me, of course, wanted to go to the World Cup, said the 21-year-old striker, who already has 119 international caps to his name in his five-year-old career. (PTI)

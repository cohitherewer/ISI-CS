The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag biggest threat
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sehwag biggest threat
            A CORRESPONDENT            V.V.S. Laxman, Suresh Raina and Ishant Sharma congratulate Pragyan Ojha at the end of Sri Lankas first innings, in Colombo, on Wednesday. The left-arm spinner finished with four wickets. (AP)                           
	Thilan Samaraweera feels Sri Lanka need to dismiss Virender Sehwag early on the third day to harbour hopes of pushing India on the back foot in the third Test. At a press conference he also said that 425 was a good total on this wicket.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	If India were staging a comeback         
	We are still ahead by 250 runs... If we can take a couple of wickets, not couple, one actually, we are in the game... Suraj is bowling really well, and at the moment, its very difficult to play him. Who knows, 250 is a long way to go...         
	Virender Sehwags innings         
	Its one wicket when Sehwag is batting, it becomes another when he gets out... Sehwags the biggest threat. Hes the key man...         
	Sehwags dropped catch         
	Thats part of the game. You can take a wicket any time on this surface. Theres a bit of movement... Two paced. Thats part of the game         
	The game plan         
	We thought that 400-plus is a good total on this wicket as India are batting fourth. Unfortunately, Prasanna and Angelo got out. Suraj is a good player, hes got a first-class hundred After that, it was very difficult to get to 500         
	His innings         
	I concentrated a lot today, and in the first hour, I thought they bowled well with the new ball. With the spinners coming, I was free to play my strokes.         
	This hundred         
	I have got some hundreds at crucial moments When the top-order has not scored runs... Ive got hundreds against Pakistan when we were five for three, and against Bangladesh when we were 20 for four I dont think I have got runs when the top-order has scored. I have scored runs when they were important for the team... This wicket is the real Test, not the one at the SSC. Your skills are tested here... I am happy to get a hundred here.         
	The Indian spinners         
	Ojha bowled really well throughout the innings. Ishant bowled well, too.

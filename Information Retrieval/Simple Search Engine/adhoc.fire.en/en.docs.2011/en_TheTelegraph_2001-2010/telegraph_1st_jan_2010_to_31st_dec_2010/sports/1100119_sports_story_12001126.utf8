The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Cloud over tiebreakers ahead of IPL auction
                                                                                                                       7                                      Cloud over tiebreakers ahead of IPL auction
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The player auction for the 2010 Indian Premier League (IPL) was faced with an eleventh hour controversy as some of the franchises opposed a tiebreaker formula introduced to resolve a deadlock in case two teams bid the same amount for a player.         
	With the franchises having a low spending cap of $750,000, it was anticipated that the ceiling could be easily reached in case of a fierce bidding for a particular player. Consequently, the IPL had come up with the idea of a silent tiebreaker whereby the vying teams could make additional bids to get their target player.         
	However, the extra money above the $750,000 would go to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which owns the IPL, and not to the player.         
	We have some reservations about the tiebreaker. We will discuss it with the IPL authorities tomorrow (Tuesday) morning (before the auction starts at 12 noon), a spokesperson of one of the franchises told The Telegraph on Monday.         
	However, Lalit Modi, the IPL chairman, was stubborn in his stance regarding the tiebreaker concept. Tiebreaker rule will be enforced in case of a tie. Its part of the 2010 IPL auction rules. So anyone not agreeing is a non issue, Modi Tweetted on the eve of the auction.         
	Some other franchises were less concerned about the idea, though. There are going to be 67 players available for bidding whereas only 12 slots have to be filled. Simple permutation and combination says a chance of a tie is very less, Venkatrama Reddy of the Deccan Chargers said.         
	With not many slots to be filled, adding to the fact that the team owners could play it safe since the new contracts would be for only a year, the whole process is expected to be a short affair. I think it will be over in an hour-and-a-half, Reddy said.         
	Amrit Mathur of the Delhi DareDevils said: The teams will be clear about their requirements. So the bidding would be focused and well directed. The players have been split in to eight pools for the auction with Shahid Afridi, Brad Haddin and Graeme Swann getting the highest base price of $250,000.         
	Ashley Noffke and Ben Laughlin (Australia), Ryan Ten Doeschate (Holland), and Kausalya Weeraratne (Sri Lanka) have received the least base price of $20,000.         
	Although Afridi has received the top billing it remains to be seen how much the 11 Pakistan players would be sought after.         
	The spotlight, however, would be on former New Zealand Test paceman Shane Bond who played in the rebel Indian Cricket League but has returned to the main stream.         
	Bond has been fixed a surprisingly lower price of $100,000, though. The Black Caps speedster has already expressed an interest to play under Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the Indian skipper who leads the Chennai Super Kings. And Bond would bolster the Chennai teams bowling which has been their weak link.         
	Mohammed Kaif became the latest addition to the player list after Rajasthan Royals bought out his contract.         
	Nathan Brackens contract has also bought out by his franchise owners, but it was not clear whether the Australian was added to the list.

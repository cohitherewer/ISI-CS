            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Lalkamal Bhowmick converted a penalty in the 24th minute as a lacklustre Chirag United beat Railway FC by a solitary goal in a CFL Premier division match on Saturday.         
	The victory puts Chirag at the top of the table with 20 points from eight games. However, Mohun Bagan, on 18 points, have played two matches less than the current leaders.         
	Chirag winger Soumik Chakraborty was brought down by rival captain Avijit Dutta and referee Rathin Mukherjee promply pointed at the dreaded spot. Lalkamal made no mistake .         
	There was an ugly incident just two minutes before the change of ends when Ashim Biswas of Chirag and Sankha Roy Chowdhury of Railway FC were given marching orders for an off-the-ball tussle. It was Ashim who shoved Sankha and the Railway player retaliated with a rough tackle. Ashim suddenly got up and stamped on Sankhas shoulder with his boots.         
	While the referee flashed a direct red for Ashim, Sankha, too, got his marching orders after earning a second yellow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Overnight shower spoils Bengals day, yet again
                                                                                                                       7                                      Overnight shower spoils Bengals day, yet again
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Calcutta: The second days play between Tamil Nadu and Bengal, in the Ranji Trophy Super League Group A match, was called off on Thursday after overnight rains made the pitch and outfield soggy.         
	The first days play, too, was called off due to heavy showers on Wednesday.         
	With only three more matches remaining in the Group league stage, efforts of former India captain Sourav Ganguly to play in this match to help Bengal improve their position in the points table seem to have gone for a toss as they are likely to share two points with Tamil Nadu if the match ends in a draw.         
	Such an outcome of the match will also affect Tamil Nadu, who have ten points from four matches, and hamper their chances of making it to the next round.         
	However, with bright sunshine and clear sky prevailing on Thursday, the teams can hope that the match would commence on Friday.         
	In Valsad, riding on centuries by skipper Wasim Jaffer (169 not out) and Ajinkya Rahane (126), Mumbai posted a mammoth 544 for three declared and then reduced Gujarat to 121 for two at end of the seconds days play in their Ranji Trophy Super League Group A match, on Thursday.         
	At stumps, Niraj Patel was unbeaten on 60 with Parthiv Patel (17) giving him company.         
	On day two, Rahane and Jaffer shared a 111-run stand to put Mumbai in a commanding position.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Players, AIFF on collision course
                                                                                                                       7                                        Players, AIFF on collision course
            OUR BUREAU            Climax Lawrence may lose out                           
	New Delhi/Calcutta: With the controversy surrounding national coach Bob Houghtons resignation yet to die down, an even bigger one is likely to hit the Indian teams preparations, for the Asian Cup, hard.         
	It wont be a surprise if the top national players go on collision course with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) regarding the proposed salary structure that is being planned for the eight-month period in the lead up to the Asian Cup.         
	According to highly placed sources, it has been learnt that the AIFF brass isnt too keen on giving the players a hike for the proposed period in the coming season when they will be under the aegis of the federation.         
	As of now, the AIFF is planning to take 30 players on its payroll as per the existing contract they have with their current clubs. If the AIFF has its way on the payment issue, it will mean that the top Indian players like Climax Lawrence and Steven Dias, who would have expected a decent hike from the clubs after their performance this year, would have to be content with same amount they are getting this season.         
	It will all depend on what the executive committee members decide on Friday evening .         
	The senior AIFF officials seemed to be very adamant in executing their plan. The executive committee members got in touch with Bob Houghton and have had a discussion on this issue. We will pay the players what the clubs are paying at the moment, a senior official in the know of things told The Telegraph.         
	When he was asked that the players must be expecting a hike, he said: Thats out of question. Isnt playing for the country mean anything? What about the sentiments associated with representing the country? Is money everything? he retorted back.         
	They could have had a problem had we decided on a roll back from their current salaries. But we arent being harsh under any circumstance, he said.         
	When Indian captain Bhaichung Bhutia was asked, he said: I wont be in a position to comment until I am aware about the outcome of the executive committee meeting slated for Friday. I cant comment on a hypothetical situation. I believe, if theres any problem it can be sorted out. But I would expect the AIFF bosses to speak personally with the players on this issue.         
	Some of the players who preferred anonymity are against playing without a hike.         
	What will happen after the Asian Cup? For two years, we will have to play without a hike. Will we then be in a position to bargain with the clubs during the 2011-12 season, one of national team players, who plays for a Calcutta club, fumed.         
	Another player gave an altogether different perspective. Take Subrata Paul or Arindam Bhattacharyas case. Both of them had a good season. Now, isnt it unfair for them not to get a hike? Some of the players have a three-year contract with the clubs. Will they be paid the same amount what they have been paid in 2008-09? he argued.

	One of the most artistic football venues in South Africa, the newly-built Green Point Stadium is situated in one of the much sought-after areas in the city of Cape Town. Green Point Stadium is one of the two semi-final venues for the World Cup. This multi-purpose venue is also going to be used to stage major events and concerts. Fans will be a stones throw from the ocean and the mountains of Cape Town will also provide the backdrop for matches. The location is ideal as it is a short walk from the transportation hub of the city. The new stadium has been partly built on land that was previously used as a golf course. Cape Town has another world-standard stadium, Newlands, but this is primarily used as a rugby union venue.

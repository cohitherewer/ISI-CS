The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bond out of initial squad
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bond out of initial squad
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) have left out three of their foreign recruits  Australian David Hussey, New Zealander Shane Bond and Bangladeshs Mashrafe Mortaza  from their initial 23-member squad that was announced by the Indian Premier League Saturday.         
	The three players will be busy with either national or state commitments. Interestingly, Bonds teammate and last years captain Brendon McCullums name has been announced in the list although he also wont be available till the first week of April.         
	Hussey will be busy with his Sheffield Shield commitments.         
	Since Brendon was last years captain, there would have been a misunderstanding if we wouldnt have named him in the initial squad.         
	 His inclusion was decided at the last moment, a KKR official stated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers ready for RCB test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chargers ready for RCB test
                      
	Nagpur: Fighting to stay in contention for a semi-final berth in the Indian Premier League, defending champions Deccan Chargers will find it tough to stretch their two-match winning streak when they take on second-placed Royal Challengers Bangalore in their adopted home ground here Monday.         
	The Chargers are second from the bottom, owing to a poor net run rate despite being tied on points with the Chennai Super Kings and the Kolkata Knight Riders. The Royal Challengers, on the other hand, sit behind table-toppers Mumbai Indians. They are tied on points with the Delhi DareDevils and the Rajasthan Royals, but a better net run rate puts them above the two teams.         
	After suffering five back-to-back defeats, the Chargers have fought back to stay in the hunt with wins over the Royal Challengers and the Chennai Super Kings and they would hope to maintain the trend Monday.         
	Nothing has really changed for us. We just have to keep winning our remaining games, said the Deccan Chargers skipper Adam Gilchrist after the win over the Chennai Super Kings last night.         
	The Bangalore Royal Challengers also suffered two consecutive defeats before putting it across the Kolkata Knight Riders Saturday night.         
	The Royal Challengers and the Deccan Chargers had clashed only a couple of days ago and Gilchrists men had come out trumps despite chasing a competitive 184.         
	The Chargers strength is their explosive batting line-up but it has been inconsistent all through. They have performed well whenever they have got a flying start from Gilchrist, backed by the power-hitting of all-rounder Andrew Symonds.         
	Herschelle Gibbs didnt click and had to be eventually dropped from the playing XI. Their bowling has been ordinary but the arrival of Australian Ryan Harris has added some zing to the attack. Harris, in fact, was Man of the Match in the Chargers win over the Chennai Super Kings, picking up three wickets Saturday.  
	what the teams need  
	 The Mumbai Indians became the first team to qualify for the IPL III semi-finals after their victory over the Rajasthan Royals on Sunday. Following is a list of what the other teams need to keep their hopes of making it to the semis alive:  
	 Royal Challengers Bangalore: Need 2 wins from 3 matches  
	 Delhi DareDevils: Need 2 wins from 3   
	Rajasthan Royals: Need 2 wins from 2  
	 Chennai Super Kings: Need 3 wins from 3  
	 Kolkata Knight Riders: Need 3 wins from 3  
	 Deccan Chargers: Need 3 wins from 3  
	 Kings XI Punjab: Out of the semis race

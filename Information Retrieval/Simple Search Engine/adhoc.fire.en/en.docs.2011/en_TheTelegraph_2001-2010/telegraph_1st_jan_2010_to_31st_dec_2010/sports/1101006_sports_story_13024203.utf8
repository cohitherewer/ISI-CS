 - Delhi to Mohali, its Gold            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: V.V.S.Laxman, Indias hero on Tuesday, spoke to The Telegraph from Chandigarh a couple of hours after his 73 not out  yet another awesome effort  helped us pull off a truly memorable one-wicket win over Australia.         
	Later, the 35-year-old veteran of 114 Tests left for New Delhi en route to hometown Hyderabad, where hell be spending around 24 hours before boarding a flight for Bangalore.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Whats the state of your back?         
	A (Laughs) After the spasms, its still sore... Im undergoing treatment... Lets see.         
	Are you going to be fit for the second and final Test, in Bangalore, from Saturday?         
	Im aiming to be fit... The support staff, too, is working towards that... The call will be taken in Bangalore.         
	First thoughts after the winning runs...         
	Cant recall the first thoughts, but I became very emotional... Hugged Pragyan Ojha, hugged (runner Suresh) Raina... The match had become so close... One hit wouldve done it for us, whereas Australia needed one ball... After the win, we all felt taller, though.         
	In a departure from your customary behaviour, you lost your cool when Ojha missed a run-taking opportunity. Was it because of the pressure?         
	Look, Id been planning a single on the penultimate ball of that (Ben Hilfenhaus) over, for I wanted to face (Mitchell) Johnson... That had been an important moment... Ojha, however, played well in those last few minutes.         
	Frankly, how confident were you when Ishant Sharma walked in at the fall of the eighth wicket, on 124?         
	Wasnt thinking too far ahead, wasnt really thinking of the target, 216... Ishant and I decided to set small goals, decided to look at building the partnership with 10-run bricks.         
	Ishant again showed hes no mug with the bat...         
	I agree... Ishants contribution was immense... To have batted for close to two hours in a pressure situation is highly creditable... His innings of 31 will remain special.         
	Eleven runs remained when Ishant got out. How did you calm yourself?         
	At that stage, it was all about being sensible and taking as much of the strike as possible... As I had a runner, it was important to communicate well.         
	Getting back to the morning, were you in considerable pain?         
	I was, but once the body warmed up to the challenge, the pain receded in the background. I had to think of the country and the team, not of the back spasms. Im happy I was able to contribute.         
	The days most unforgettable moment...         
	(Laughs) Those two legbyes which took us across the line.         
	You were in acute discomfort in the last Test, too (at the P.Sara Oval, in Colombo)... That was almost two months ago. Surely, you must have worked on the back?         
	Yes, indeed... I did focus on strengthening it... Spent close to two weeks at the National Cricket Academy (Bangalore) and even consulted a specialist in the UK...         
	Are you dedicating this innings to somebody?         
	My wife, Shailaja... Id been quite down after the first innings, but she kept lifting my spirits. So, this one is for her.         
	[Shailaja was in Hyderabad, taking care of the two children  son Sarvajit and daughter Achinthya.]         
	You dont like rating performances, but the one on Tuesday has to be special (remarkable is how captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni put it). Whats your take?         
	One of my best, definitely... Challenging situations bring the best out of me... Obviously, because of the circumstances, such performances get remembered.         
	The ease with which you handle pressure is astonishing. Whats the secret?         
	Dont think theres a secret... Its just that right from my early days for Hyderabad, Ive thrived on challenges... Its in the tough situations that you get to see the best of me.         
	Clearly, the Australians havent been able to work you out...         
	Dont know... But, yes, the satisfaction is a bit more when runs are got against the top teams.         
	As part of the Fab Four, you were consistently underrated. Did you, too, feel that way?         
	For me, nothing matters more than the respect of teammates... Ive never been bothered with what others have thought about me... I know that my teammates respect me and, for me, thats the ultimate.         
	Your Ive had to live with constant scrutiny comment, in Colombo, continues to be talked about...         
	But thats the reality.         
	One remarkable piece of stats is that your seond innings average (50.47) is actually higher than the first (45.67)... Have you been aware of this?         
	No... Look, I dont play for averages... Probably things have been more challenging in the second innings... Its not that I intentionally set out to do better when were batting for the second time... Id only say that the tough situations have got the best out of me.         
	Finally... Are you following the Commonwealth Games?         
	(Laughs) Yes... Im happy that Gagan Narang and his partner, Abhinav Bindra, struck gold today... Gagans from Hyderabad, so Im a little emotional about the achievement.

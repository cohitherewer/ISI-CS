            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With less than six months to go for the start of the Commonwealth Games, most of the big names of Indian badminton, it seems, are not yet ready for the big meet.         
	On Wednesday, to the shock of the huge number of partisan spectators, a majority of the local heroes bit the dust against middle level opponents in Yonex Sunrise Badminton Asia championships. Except for Saina Nehwal, P Kashyap and top-seeded doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and D. Viju, no other Indian could clear the second round barrier.         
	Surely we are disappointed, but thats not the end of the world, said national coach P. Gopichand. Fitness is the biggest problem for most of our players and even the top names are in that list. We are working to overcome the shortcoming, said the former All-England champion.         
	If the national teams Indonesian fitness trainer Atiq Johari, famous for his effective fitness regime, is to be believed, even Chetan Anand would have to work very hard to reach his peak fitness before the Games.         
	Chetan is certainly the best, but he has to go long way as far as fitness is concerned, said the Indonesian coach. The women players, also, will have to work hard, added Johari. Both the coaches informed that the players are now going through various fitness training including yoga.         
	Johari, however, has big hopes on Chetan. He is our best bet in the Commonwealth championship. I am not saying he would be the champion, but dont be surprised it he makes the semi-finals. At the moment he is injured. But once he regains his fitness, Chetan would be a big force.

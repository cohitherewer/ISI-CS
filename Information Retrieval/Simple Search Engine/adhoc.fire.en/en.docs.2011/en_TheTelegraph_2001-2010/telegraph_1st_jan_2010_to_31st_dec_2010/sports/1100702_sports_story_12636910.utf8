The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pele takes another shot at Maradona
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pele takes another shot at Maradona
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                                  Pele        
	Brazilian footballing legend Peles war of words with Argentina coach Diego Maradona has continued as he said the Argentine was not a good coach because of the troubled private life he had led.         
	Pele, who earlier during the World Cup finals said that Maradona had only taken the Argentina coaching job because he needed the money, said Maradonas previous troubles  which included treatment for a cocaine addiction  could only have a bad effect on the team.         
	Argentina, who have won all four of their matches at the World Cup, face an impressive German side in Saturdays quarter final in Cape Town.         
	He (Maradona) is not a good coach, because he had a bizarre lifestyle which cannot go down well with his team, three-time World Cup winner Pele told.         
	By contrast the 69-year-old Pele said there was much to like about the young and vibrant Germany side that destroyed England 4-1 in their last 16 match.         
	This young German team is a pleasure to watch, he said.         
	It is clear to see that something has changed in German football, it was already beginning to happen at Euro 2008 (where they lost 1-0 to Spain in the final) and the youngsters Mesut Ozil and Thomas Mueller, they are like their predecessors Wolfgang Overath and Pierre Littbarski.         
	They can dribble, deliver pinpoint passes, and produce something surprising at any moment, added Pele, who nevertheless feels that they are too young to win at this World Cup.         
	Maradona has been only too eager to oblige reporters with his colourful reactions at this World Cup.         
	Apart from Pele, with whom he seems to share a love-hate relationship, the Argentina legend also had a war of words with French great Michel Platini. That row, however, was resolved before it could become a regular feature at Argentina media sessions.         
	I always had a distant relationship with him, Maradona said about Platini. We would just say hi and goodbye. But we all know what the French are like and Platini is French, he believes he is better than the rest of us.         
	But Maradona reserves his choicest comments for the Black Pearl.         
	Asked how he felt about Peles comment that making him Argentina coach was a mistake, the hero of the 1986 World Cup promptly replied that the Brazilian legend had grown old.

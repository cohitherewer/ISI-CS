The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Flintoff aims at winter return
                                                                                                                       7                                      Flintoff aims at winter return

	Andrew Flintoffs career is again in the balance after he decided to miss the entire English season because of another delay in his comeback from a knee operation.         
	The England all-rounder pulled out of his expected comeback matches for Lancashires second XI against Yorkshire at Crosby this week and has now been ruled out for the rest of the season after consultation with his Countys medical staff.         
	Flintoffs continued absence is bound to cast doubts on whether he will ever play competitive cricket again. Lancashires director of cricket, Mike Watkinson, said Flintoff hoped to play again but feared that another setback might spell the end of his career.         
	He probably realises this is his last chance of a return and he doesnt want to mess it up. I dont think it would benefit anyone if he tried to reach a deadline set months ago and broke down. He would effectively be hanging his boots up, Watkinson said.         
	Its difficult but we are very hopeful. He has done everything he needs to so far to satisfy the surgeon his operation has been a success. But it has been quite a complicated procedure and it does take time to get over. There are no guarantees with this but we still hope he will get back on the cricket field.         
	Flintoff, 32, has not played for almost a year since he helped England win the Ashes in his final Test at the Oval. He had a first operation on his right knee last September and required further surgery in January when Lancashire announced that he would be out of action until at least July.         
	This latest setback means that Flintoff will not play for the Chennai Super Kings, his Indian Premier League franchise (IPL), in next months Champions League tournament, although he has been named in their preliminary squad. Flintoff missed out on a contract worth almost  one million a year, with the Super Kings, when his knee injury ruled him out of this years IPL.         
	No date has been set on a possible return to action but Flintoffs agent, Chubby Chandler, is optimistic that it will not jeopardise a deal to play for Queensland in Australias KFC Big Bash Twenty20 in January and February.         
	The Queensland contract is thought to be worth up to  200,000 and may also involve Flintoff playing Twenty20 cricket in New Zealand for Northern Districts.         
	Flintoff retired from Test cricket last summer but is still available to play for England in one-day and T20 internationals. He signed a three-year contract with Lancashire last winter but has not played for the county since June last year.         
	The key for me is partly his knee and partly Freds desire to come back, said Lancashire head coach Peter Moores. He had a fantastic career, hes got other commitments but if he has still got the desire to come back there is still a lot of cricket if he wants to play.

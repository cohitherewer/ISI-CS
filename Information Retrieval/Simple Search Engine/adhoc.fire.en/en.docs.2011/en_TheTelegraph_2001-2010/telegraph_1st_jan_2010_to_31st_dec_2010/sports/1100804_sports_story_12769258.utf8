	Calcutta: Defending champions Goa entered the Santosh Trophy semi-finals in style hammering Services 4-0 in their final quarter final group league encounter, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Tuesday.         
	Goa needed just a point against Services to clinch the last four berth. But the Goan boys made their intentions clear within the first 15 minutes when they scored twice.         
	The first was as early as the fifth minute when Adil Khan freed striker Milagres Gonsalves with a splitting through on the right edge of the box. Milagres calmly slotted it past an advancing Services custodian Binu T. Purushothaman.         
	The second goal, in the 14th minute, almost killed the contest. Milagres unleashed a 25-yard pile driver that crashed into the net.         
	The best part about Goas game was the manner in which they used the width of the field, with swift attacks from both flanks. The Services defence was always on the tenterhooks and lack of co-ordination was evident whenever the Goans adventured into the rival box.         
	One such error, in the 51st minute gave Goa their third goal. Left-wing back Fulgancio Cardozo overlapped from the left and kept an innocuous cross which the opposition defenders failed to clear. Adil, who was lurking in the box, took advantage of the mistake as he beat Binu with a stinging volley.         
	In the 71st minute, substitute striker Clifton Gonsalves rounded off the tally. Clifton, son of former Goan star player Camilo Gonsalves, shot from the top of the box to make it 4-0.

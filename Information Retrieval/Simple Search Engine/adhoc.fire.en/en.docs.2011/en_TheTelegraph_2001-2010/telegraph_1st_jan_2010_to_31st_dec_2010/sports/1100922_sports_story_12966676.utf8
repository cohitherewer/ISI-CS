	New Delhi: Former IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Kumar Modi on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the BCCIs mala fide disciplinary proceedings against him. He had earlier urged the Bombay High Court to stay the proceedings but was turned away.         
	In his appeal filed against the July 15 High Court order, Modi accused BCCI secretary N Srinivasan of launching a prosecution against him on the basis of media reports and complaints made by rank outsiders and meddlesome interlopers who were neither members of the BCCI nor administrators.

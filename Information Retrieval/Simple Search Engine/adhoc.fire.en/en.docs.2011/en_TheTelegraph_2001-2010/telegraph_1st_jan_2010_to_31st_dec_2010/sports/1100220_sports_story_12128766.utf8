            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A fire cracker partially damaged the artifical turf at the Salt Lake Stadium just before the second half of the CFL Premier division match between Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting .         
	Had it landed some minutes later, it could have hit one of the footballers.

                                                                                                                       7                                        I have no regrets, says Muralidharan
            A CORRESPONDENT            Muralidharan                             
	Muttiah Muralidharan, who will bid adieu to Test cricket after the first Test, against India, in Galle, spoke about his experiences, facing India in his last match and other personal issues at a press conference on Saturday.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q The last Test of his career         
	A I cant say if its a big match Its just another match but it is going to be the last one for me. I have been happy with the way I have played in the last 18-19 years. Hopefully, I will do well here and get a good result for Sri Lanka before I retire. Thats the whole plan.         
	Decision to retire after the first Test, vs India         
	I had planned to retire after the West Indies series, at home, as these Tests had not yet been planned. But once the Test series between India and Sri Lanka was finalised, I thought this was the right time for me to retire. I felt one match was enough. There are other bowlers, young spinners who can play five more Tests at home.         
	If its the right time to leave         
	I think its the right time for me to leave. I decided that I have to go now because enough is enough. A cricketer not only plays a match but also has to do a number of other things to train and be fit. I have done my part. Let me now enjoy cricket and a little of life.         
	On his decision to not play the tri-series         
	I thought of taking a break and not play in the tri-series. The selectors also wanted to give the youngsters a chance, to pick the best combination for the World Cup. If they really want me, and I fit in, I will definitely play. Else, I will be happy to give my place to a youngster as I have nothing more to achieve.         
	His journey so far         
	I never dreamt that I would be finishing my Test career like this. I have done very well in Tests as you cant get such records easily. So many have tried I have no regrets because I feel Im the best at the moment. God has given me everything. I am very happy with what I have achieved and am glad I am leaving when people are still asking me to play. Right now, I am only thinking about the next match. My aim is to finish well and retire properly.         
	The difficult periods in his life         
	Basically, everyone helped me during those times. The public of Sri Lanka, the cricket Board, the captain, the team members Everyone helped me. Thats why I could overcome the difficult periods easily.         
	On his bowling action         
	Every bowler is unique, each has a different style.         
	The other Sri Lankan spinners         
	I think Ajantha Mendis is the No. 1 spinner. The other two who are good are Rangana Herath and Suraj Randiv. They can go a long way. Two of them are very young while one is about 30. They still have a lot of time.         
	The most difficult batsman he has bowled to         
	It is difficult to say. The most difficult batsman is whoever plays well on that particular day. In the cricket world, I admire two people  Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara. I feel they are the most consistent batsmen in my generation.         
	On Arjuna Ranatunga         
	He was helpful, both in 1995 and 98. Ranatunga, the Board, vice-captain Aravinda de Silva and the other players, all played big roles.         
	The future of Lankan cricket         
	The future of Sri Lankan cricket is very bright. We are not winning every game but we are winning a majority of them. Lankan cricketers are going to be the brightest talents soon.         
	On the Lankan batting line-up         
	I dont think our batting line-up is weak. In fact, its one of the best in the world. (Tillekaratne) Dilshan, (Kumar) Sangakkara, Mahela (Jayawardene) have scored more runs in the last one year than most other cricketers. May be, the Indian bowling is slightly hampered by injuries.         
	Sri Lankas chances in Galle         
	If I can take eight wickets in the first innings, Sri Lanka will win easily. It is not going to be easy; Indias batting line-up is good. I will try all my tricks in the middle for the last time. Lets see if it works or not. I am going to enjoy myself, rather than think about how many wickets I am going to take. I wont put much pressure on myself. Five wickets or no wicket, I will still be happy.         
	On Mahendra Singh Dhoni         
	Dhoni is a fabulous captain. That is why we won the last edition of the Indian Premier League with the Chennai Super Kings. He is a very experienced person and I enjoyed playing under him in the IPL. When in the middle, we play hard because friendship is only outside the boundary. In the middle, we all fight hard  take wickets and score runs. Same thing will happen here too.         
	If he would continue to play in the IPL         
	I can play another two of three seasons of cricket. I felt I have served Sri Lanka well for the last 18 years and can thus take a break. As for the IPL, everyone wants to be involved. I would love to play for another 2-3 years, enjoy playing in England, New Zealand and other countries.         
	Future of Tests         
	Every cricketer wants to play Test cricket. I dont know what the public feels but cricketers want to play the longer version. They feel that is the ultimate form of cricket. Spinners are the key in any form of cricket, but in Tests you need them to take wickets on the fourth and fifth days.         
	On his charity work         
	Yes, we did some work to help the people affected by the tsunami. My manager, Kushal Gunasekara, and I got together and built 1000 houses near Seenigama. We are hoping to do a similar project in Vankulam. President Mahinda Rajapaksa has given 50 acres of land there to do what we did in Seenigama.         
	His feelings         
	I would like to thank the cricket Board and the groundsmen for arranging such a great thing in Galle. It is a great honour to retire like this.

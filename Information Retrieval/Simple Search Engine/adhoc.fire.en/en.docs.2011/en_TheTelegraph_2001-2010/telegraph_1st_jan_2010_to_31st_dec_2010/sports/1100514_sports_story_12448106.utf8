            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chandigarh: Sachin Tendulkar Thursday termed disappointing the failure of the Indian cricket team in the World T20 but the maestro was more sympathetic than scathing in his take on the debacle, saying that the players needed support to perform better.         
	The players need to start afresh and look to deliver better performances. It has not happened for the first time. There are uncertainties in the game but we have to try to figure out how to play better, Sachin, who was in nearby Zirakpur for a promotional along with Mandira Bedi, said.         
	There will be ups and downs but you have to have faith in the players because they are the ones who won us the (World T20) Cup earlier (in 2007). The players have been training hard. They know and understand their responsibilities. Sometimes things click, sometimes not, Sachin said.         
	Sachin spoke about the vicissitudes of cricketing fortunes and said that obstacles keep coming, not just in the game but in life too. But the highest run-getter in both forms of the game said there always is room for improvement and advised the team to stay positive.         
	The Indians have been caught short against the rising delivery and Sachin acknowledged there was a problem there but backed the players to come up with an answer to that.         
	Players know their responsibilities well. We have to look for ways to tackle the short-pitched balls.         
	As Dhoni and his band of unsuccessful Caribbean crusaders look to pick up the pieces amid the hue and cry over another poor campaign, Sachin pointed at the direction in which their efforts should lie.         
	The team should focus on the game and not what is happening outside the stadium, Sachin said.         
	The Indian Premier League has once again been singled out as one of the main factors contributing to the poor show but Sachin was not ready to blame the T20 league.         
	I mean there are both advantages and disadvantages and it depends on how you see it. From my point of view, I think IPL gives opportunities to out-of-form players to return to form, Sachin said.

	Trainer Pesi Shroff holds the key to the 1,600m Sir Rahimtoola Chinoy Trophy, the main attraction in Thursdays seven-event race card. The champion trainer has two smart four-year-olds  Angelo and Amore Mio  running for the trophy but the former, who is in a good nick, is expected to concede 6kg and also have the measure of his stablemate. Jockey Chris Hayes partners the Razeen-Alix son.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injured Becks ruled out of World Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                        Injured Becks ruled out of World Cup
            THE TIMES, LONDON            Beckham on Monday. (Reuters)                           
	David Beckham says he is determined to make a swift and full recovery from the ruptured Achilles tendon that has left his dream of playing in a record fourth World Cup finals for England in tatters.         
	The 34-year-old midfielder flew to Finland on Monday to visit Dr Sakari Orava, professor of orthopaedics and traumatology at the Mehilainen Clinic in Turku. Dr Orava confirmed it would take a minimum of four months for Beckham to fully recover from the injury, prompting some to predict the setback could even curtail his illustrious 18-year playing career.         
	Yet Beckham has already set his sights on a return to the game. I am on my way to Finland to see a specialist and have a scan on the injury, Beckham said in a statement released on his website earlier on the day. I am upset but want to thank everyone for their messages of support. I hope to make a swift and full recovery.         
	The injury occurred when Beckham pulled up under no pressure from an opposing player in the final minutes of AC Milans 1-0 victory over Chievo at San Siro on Monday.         
	The former England captain hopped from the pitch in obvious pain and collapsed on the sidelines. He was treated for about five minutes on the touchline before eventually being carried from the arena face down on a stretcher in tears, mouthing its broken, its broken to those on the home bench, while members of Milans backroom staff tried to comfort him.         
	Davids injury makes us sick, Leonardo, the Milan coach, said. When I think of his personal history, everything I know about him, how hard he works, I feel so bad for him. Tonight was a very important win for us, but Davids news definitely puts a downer on the evening. David knew he was injured immediately.         
	Fabio Capello, the England manager, telephoned Beckham on Sunday night to offer his best wishes for a full recovery, but he must now write the 34-year-old out of his plans.         
	Sir Bobby Charlton is one who hopes to see Beckham return to the international arena. I dont know if we will see him in an England shirt again. I hope so, Charlton said. I have known him for a long time and he gets a lot of pleasure out of playing the game. Forget about all the finance and the hyperbole that goes with it, he just loves playing football.         
	If it had happened to me I would have been distraught, Charlton added. I was lucky with injuries. He has got one of the worst kind. It will take such a long time to get right and you dont have much time when you are 34.         
	Beckham is Englands most-capped outfield player with 115 caps. He rejoined Milan in January for his second spell on loan at the club from the Los Angeles Galaxy, during their offseason from Major League Soccer, to safeguard his place in the England squad place.         
	However, he has not been an automatic first choice for Milan and began the Champions League round-of-16, second-leg match away to Manchester United, his former club, last week on the substitutes bench. Now, bearing in mind that he will be 35 in May, he has almost certainly played his last game for England.

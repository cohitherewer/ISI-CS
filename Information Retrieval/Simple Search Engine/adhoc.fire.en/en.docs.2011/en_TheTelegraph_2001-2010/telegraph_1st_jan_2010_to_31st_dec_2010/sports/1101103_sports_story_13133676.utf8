	New Delhi: Chirag United marched into the Durand Cup semi-finals in style, when they outclassed Indian Air Force 5-0 in the concluding group league match at the Ambedkar Stadium, on Tuesday.         
	Chirag will take on East Bengal in the last-four stage.         
	Faced with the situation to win by more than two-goal margin or face elimination, the Calcutta side led by a goal at the breather, before pumping in four more in the second session.         
	Brazilian striker Joshimar, who missed some easy chances, emerged as the hero in the end with a three-goal strike.         
	A delighted Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya said he was happy with his teams performance and added that his boys were ready to take on East Bengal in the semi-finals on Thursday.         
	East Bengal are a great team and on a roll at the moment, Bhattacharya said.         
	I know they have won 18 matches in a row, but that doesnt mean they will always win. The semi-final, I can assure you, is going to be an interesting affair, he added.         
	In the first half, the Chirag coach wasnt as relaxed as he looked in the end.         
	With his team missing innumerable chances despite making relentless raids at the rival goalmouth, Bhattacharya was mostly seen standing at the edge of the technical area and shouting regular instructions to his players.         
	The deadlock was finally broken in the 36th minute by Denson Devadas.         
	The ever agile Jerry Zirsanga sent a cross in the box from the right and Joshimar was quick to chest it down for Devadas to slam home with a perfectly angled left footer.         
	Five minutes after the half-time, Chirag struck again. Air Force defender G.S.Sandhu played a role in conceding the goal as he made a mess of things while trying to block Joshimar.         
	For a moment, it appeared that Sandhu had put the goal in his own net, but the referee credited the goal to the Chirag striker.         
	Thereafter, it turned out to be one-way traffic. While Joshimar got the third and the fifth goal in the 68th and 85th minute, Gauranga Biswas got the other one in the 80th minute.         
	The Chirag coach said his plan worked.         
	Even my substitutions clicked. Jerry was playing well, but I replaced him with Subhas (Chakrbarty) because I wanted to use his runs. It went exactly the way I wanted it to, Bhattacharya said.         
	On Wednesday, Churchill Brothers will face JCT in a semi-final tie.

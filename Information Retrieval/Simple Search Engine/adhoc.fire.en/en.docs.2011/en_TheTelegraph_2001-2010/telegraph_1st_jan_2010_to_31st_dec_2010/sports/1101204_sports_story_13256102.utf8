            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The fourth edition of the I-League may have got off without a sponsor and broadcaster on board, but Calcuttans had no complaints on the opening day as city club, Chirag United, began their campaign on a winning note.         
	But all eyes will be on city giants East Bengal, on Saturday, when they take on ONGC in their I-League opener this season. Coach Trevor Morgans talismanic show has taken the red and gold brigade to new heights. After their Federation Cup win, Morgan guided his side to thump arch-rivals Mohun Bagan for the Calcutta Footbal League title, and though the Super Cup loss to Dempo might break their winning streak, expectations will be high for a better finish in the I-League.         
	East Bengal medios, Sushanth Mathew and Mehtab Hussain, are doubtful starters Saturday, and there is a feeling that Nirmal Chetri might not start, but could come in later into the game.

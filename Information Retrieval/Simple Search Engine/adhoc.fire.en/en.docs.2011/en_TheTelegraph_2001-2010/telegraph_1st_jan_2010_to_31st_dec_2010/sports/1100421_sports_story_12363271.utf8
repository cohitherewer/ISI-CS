The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Asif, Veena in secret wedlock: Reports
                                                                                                                       7                                      Asif, Veena in secret wedlock: Reports
                      
	Lahore: Mohammed Asif now finds himself in a controversy similar to the one colleague Shoaib Malik was embroiled in recently after television channels claimed that the lanky pacer had married actress Veena Malik in London last year before tying the knot with another girl this year.         
	Just three days before he flies to the West Indies for the World T20, Asif is being accused of marrying Veena, with whom the cricketer was entangled in a ugly dispute over money matters until last week.         
	Two television channels reported on Tuesday that the financial dispute was resolved only on the condition that Asif would get his nikah with Veena registered in Pakistan.         
	The problem for Asif is that he got married amid much fanfare to a girl chosen by his family in February after which Veena came out with the claim that the pacer owed her around 15 million rupees.         
	The nikah between Asif and Veena was performed by a Bengali qazi while both were in London last year in May with Zahid Ali Saif present there as a witness, but it was never registered, one channel reported.         
	It claimed that Veena agreed to a settlement with Asif only after she was promised that the nikah would be officially registered and the bowler would make public his marriage to the actress and also divorce his other wife, Hina Bilal.         
	Asif is now facing a tricky situation because he only recently publicly got married and now this claim that he is already married to Veena, one source close to the pace bowler said.

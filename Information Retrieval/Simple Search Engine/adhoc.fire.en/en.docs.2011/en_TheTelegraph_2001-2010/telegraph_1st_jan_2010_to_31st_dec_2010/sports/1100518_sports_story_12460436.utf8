	Houston: Australian Adam Scott ended a two-year title drought by shooting rounds of 66 and 67 on Sunday to win the rain-hit Texas Open at TPC San Antonio.         
	Scott, who was one-under-par for the tournament after his first three holes of the day, in which 36 holes were played, won his first PGA title since the 2008 Byron Nelson Championship with a 14-under total of 274 for a one-shot victory over Swedens Fredrik Jacobson.         
	Indias Arjun Atwal signed off tied 17th after carding a two-under 70 in the final round. The Orlando-based golfer, who has been battling injuries and poor form for quite some time, ended his campaign with a total of seven-under 281.         
	It was the seventh US Tour victory for the 29-year-old, who ended his dry spell on a course designed by compatriot Greg Norman.         
	Everythings coming together, said Scott, who told reporters that a recent putting tip from American veteran Dave Stockton helped him overcome his struggles. (Agencies)

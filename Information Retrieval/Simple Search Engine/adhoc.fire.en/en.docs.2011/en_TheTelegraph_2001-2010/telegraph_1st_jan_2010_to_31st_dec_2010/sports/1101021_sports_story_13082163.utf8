The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big win for Bengal
                                                                                                                       7                                        Big win for Bengal
            A STAFF REPORTER            Arindam Das                           
	Calcutta: Coach Woorkeri Ramans instruction for Bengal players at the onset of the season was simple: Talk less, perform better.         
	It might be too early to surmise whether the gag order on the players would be beneficial in extracting better on-field performance, but Bengals first match under Raman began with a bang.         
	The Manoj Tiwary-led team thrashed Assam by eight wickets in their opening match of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 tournament, in Cuttack, on Wednesday.         
	[In the other match of the day Orissa defeated Tripura by three wickets. Chasing a target of 140, Orissa clinched victory on the last ball.]         
	The victory will be sweeter because Assam had humbled Bengal last year, in this very tournament.         
	Assams decision to bat after winning the toss, at the Ravenshaw ground, backfired. Stifled by some tight bowling by Bengal pacers, Assam lost their first wicket in the fifth over. And thereafter, regular wickets and irregularity of runs made life difficult for Assam as they managed a meagre 99 for eight in their 20 overs.         
	Deepak Sharma top scored for Assam with a patient 40. The rest of the batsmen didnt manage much as Bengal pacer Shami Ahmed claimed four for 24. Manoj, Iresh Saxena and Laxmi Ratan Shukla claimed a wicket each.         
	Chasing 100 for a win, Bengal openers Sreevats Goswami and Arindam Das laid a solid foundation of 54 runs for the first wicket.         
	While Sreevats scored 25, Arindam was unbeaten on 41. The only other Bengal wicket to fall was that of Wriddhiman Saha (13) as they notched up the winning runs in 16.5 overs.         
	Raman lauded his bowlers for restricting Assam to a low total. I was very impressed with our bowling performance They did an excellent job. They fought as a unit and none of them leaked much runs.         
	The fact that they maintained their line and varied their length bore results, Raman said.         
	Bengals next match is against Jharkhand on Friday.

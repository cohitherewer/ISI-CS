The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Guardiola is speechless
                                                                                                                       7                                      Guardiola is speechless
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola has run out of superlatives to describe Lionel Messi following another stunning performance from the Argentinian.         
	Messi hit three goals without reply at Real Zaragoza, his second hattrick in as many league games, to take his tally to 34 in all competitions and 11 in the last five matches  including a midweek double against Stuttgart in the Champions League.         
	The 22-year-old could have had a late fourth but he was tripped in the area and Zlatan Ibrahimovic  despite yet another ineffective performance in a Barca shirt  converted the penalty to secure the Catalans a 4-2 victory.         
	Put in the superlatives yourselves, Im running out, said Guardiola. Its already been a while now that he has been outstanding. Hes more than decisive in every way. That hes capable of doing everything that he does at his age is something impressive, that doesnt make any sense.         
	Messi was a major doubt before the match as he was suffering from a dental abscess. And Guardiola admitted it would have been hard to leave him out.         
	It wasnt an infection in the tooth, it was in the gum. He was in a lot of pain. But in the morning I asked him how he was and he told me that he was better, added the Barca boss.

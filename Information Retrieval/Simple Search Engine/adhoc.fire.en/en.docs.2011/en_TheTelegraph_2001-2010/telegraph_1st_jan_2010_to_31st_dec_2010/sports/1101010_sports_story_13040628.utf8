The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | India whip Scotland, gear up for Pakistan
                                                                                                                       7                                        India whip Scotland, gear up for Pakistan
            ANSHUMAN ROY            Indias Sandeep Singh and Gareth Hall of Scotland vie for the ball, in New Delhi, on Saturday. (PTI)                           
	New Delhi: In a multi-event meet, generally the mens 100 metres sprint is billed as the marquee contest. But, here, at the Commonwealth Games, with the shinning sprint stars like Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell pulling out, the 100 metres race turned out to be a no-show.         
	In that scenario, Sunday evenings hockey match between India and Pakistan is the showpiece event of the XIX Commonwealth Games.         
	Its already a sold-out match, and with both the teams facing a must-win situation, the tie is expected to be a memorable one.         
	Pakistan, who lost to Australia 0-1 at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium on Saturday, are second in Pool A, with six points from three matches, while India are with six points from three matches.         
	Saturday evening saw the hosts beat Scotland 4-0 at the National Stadium, with Dharamvir Singh scoring a brace and Swarandeep Singh along with Sandeep Singh netting one each.         
	India now have scored nine goals and conceded seven, while Pakistan have scored seven and conceded two. Pakistan thus, have a better goal difference, and are in the second spot right now. In case of a draw in Sundays tie Pakistan will be through.         
	Australia have already qualified for the semi-finals with nine points. On Saturday morning, the world champions had to sweat it out to overcome a spirited challenge by Pakistan.         
	Australia got the match-winner in the 33rd minute, when Chris Ciriello converted their second penalty corner with a fierce flick to the right of Shah.         
	Unlike other Pool A teams, the Kookaburras found Pakistan a tough nut to crack, courtesy an exemplary display from the Pakistan backline, led by captain Zeeshan Ashraf.         
	The Pakistani defenders were ably supported by an agile goalkeeper in Imran Shah, who was outstanding under the bar.         
	While the Pakistan defence looks solid, the Indian backline is highly porous. Sandeep Singh, Prabodh Tirkey and Dhananjay Mahadik dont look confident enough and Pakistan will surely look to capitalise on every blunder.         
	At this moment our defence may not be performing, but on Sunday I am sure they will do well, foreign coach Jose Brasa said.         
	Moreover its a India versus Pakistan clash, and nobody will be ready to give an inch. My boys know how important this clash is, Brasa said.         
	Defence and penalty corners have been the main concern for Brasa, and he has often said that unless and until there is improvement in these areas, victory will be hard to come by.         
	Against Australia India got seven penalty corners in the first half itself, but failed to convert those.         
	The Pakistan team had a disappointing World Cup, where they finished 12th.         
	A new coach, who responds to the name of Michel van den Heuvel, is here, and even though he has gone on record saying Pakistan do not have any chance to win the gold, a win on Sunday will give hockey fans back home something to cheer about.         
	We are slowly getting there, Michel said after the match against Australia.         
	On Sunday we will give our best. Its a must-win situation for both of us. So, it will be a match full of drama. I may be a foreigner but I know what it means to beat India in India, the Dutchman said.

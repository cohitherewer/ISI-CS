The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Uncertainty over the list of entries
                                                                                                                       7                                      Uncertainty over the list of entries
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: It is still not known who all are expected to arrive to participate in the Commonwealth Games in Delhi. What is surprising is that not even the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) or the Organising Committee (OC) is sure of the list of participants.         
	The two bodies that are busy in last minute bids to clean up their act for the Games, still do not have a list of the athletes who will arrive finally, for the 12-day extravaganza beginning on October 3.         
	Sources said that rattled by the series of withdrawals by top athletes from some of the leading nations, the CGF has asked the OC not to release the list of participants.         
	The list is being compiled by the OC which has been strictly instructed not to release it for the moment, said the source.         
	 Since athletes have been pulling out almost every day, the CGF feels that names should not be made public before being confirmed by their respective Olympic associations.         
	The Delhi Games have been hit by a series of pullouts by high profile athletes because of security and health concerns, which has taken much of the sheen from the multi-sport gathering which is also battling a raft of other challenges.         
	Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt dealt the first blow in July, when he announced his decision to skip the event, and it was only the beginning of the withdrawals.         
	Bolts pullout was followed by Olympic 100metres champion Shelly-Ann Fraser, Kenyan 800metres record holder David Rudisha, Australian tennis star Samantha Stosur, discus thrower Dani Samuels and a host of other top level athletes.         
	While the CGF president Mike Fennell said that the list was still being prepared, OC sources said many Olympic committees have yet not submitted the names of their athletes with the CGF, as they feel there could be more last minute withdrawals.         
	The athletes will have to sign a letter of confirmation with their respective Olympic associations, said the source.         
	The CGF is yet to receive it from many countries. Thats the reason why the list of athletes has been withheld. We will not be surprised if the number of athletes in the Games comes down considerably in the end.         
	When asked, Fennell said the list is being prepared at the moment.         
	It is going through a process called Delegation Registration Meeting (DRM). Once that is over, we will release the list of athletes.         
	Fennell also denied that the CGF had asked the OC not to make the list of entries public.         
	He, however, did not have a convincing answer when it was pointed out that except for squash and badminton the individual draw for no other game has been released.

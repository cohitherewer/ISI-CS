The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | World No.1s pride Steyn-ed
                                                                                                                       7                                      World No.1s pride Steyn-ed

	Nagpur: If Allan Donald was the White Lightning, Dale Steyn deserves to be called the Greased Lightning. How else can one define the excellence of a man who single-handedly decimated the Indians in their own den on a pitch that had buried the aspirations of bowlers, of all kinds, over the first two days?         
	Steyns supersonic post-tea spell  he took five wickets in 3.4 overs conceding just one run  helped South Africa dislodge India for 233 in the first innings on the third day of the first Test for the Jaypee Infratech Cup, in neighbouring Jamtha, on Monday.         
	At draw of stumps, Mahendra Singh Dhonis team were 66 for two in the second innings, still trailing by 259 runs, after Graeme Smith enforced the follow on. Murali Vijay (27) and Sachin Tendulkar (15) managed to arrest the fall somewhat after openers, Virender Sehwag (16) and Gautam Gambhir (1), were sent back to the hut.         
	Speed and swing are like fuel and fire. But what enhances Steyns achievements is that he pulled off his fast and furious act not on a seamer-friendly track of his homeland, but on a subcontinental pitch that produced individual scores of 253 and 173 the day before.         
	From getting the new ball to swing to effecting reverse movement with the old  Steyn was as loud as a lion on the day. The pacer recorded career-best figures of seven for 51 on the day. His new-ball partner, the lanky Morne Morkel, played an equally crucial role in unsettling the Indians.         
	After the first two days yielded just six wickets, day three, thanks to the industrious South Africans, saw 12 wickets tumble. Unfortunately, all were Indians.         
	Steyns light stood in stark contrast to the Indians darkness, despite a restrained century from Sehwag in the first innings. Gambhir, the No. 1 Test batsman in the world, registered the dubious record of being dismissed twice in a day of a Test match.         
	On the third morning, the VCA Stadium was as hot as an oven. Rather than the climate, it was because of the prospect of a fascinating battle on the pitch between the smoking new ball combine of Steyn-Morkel and the sizzling opening duo of Sehwag-Gambhir. The South African duo won hands down.         
	Armed with a four-over old new ball, both the South African speedsters started spitting venom from the very first over of the day. Gambhir was the first casualty when he edged an away going delivery off Morkel. Vijay followed soon after as his bells went flying when he shouldered arms to an incoming Steyn delivery. Sachin, soon after, got a beauty from Steyn, and edged the away going one to the keeper.         
	The Indians recovered somewhat through Sehwag (109) and debutant Subramaniam Badrinath (56) as the duo rescued India from 56 for three with a 136-run partnership. Sehwag, once again in his own inimitable way, threw his wicket away, chasing a wide Wayne Parnell delivery.         
	When India went to tea at 221 for four, no one could have anticipated the tsunami that would lash the hosts when they come back after the break.         
	Steyn, the 2008 ICC Test player of the year, removed Badrinath, Wriddhiman Saha (0), Zaheer Khan (2), Amit Mishra (0) and Harbhajan Singh (8) in, perhaps, one of the finest exhibitions of fast bowling on Indian soil. Saha, the other debutant, lasted just five balls before walking back to the pavilion.         
	Meanwhile, Proteas keeper Mark Boucher left the field after tea with a lower back strain. However, he was given a clean chit by the doctors after an MRI, and according to the team management, he should be fine before the second Test in Calcutta.         
	South Africas media officer, Michael Owen-Smith, said: A CT scan and an MRI scan at a local clinic gave him a clean bill of health. Its a lower back sprain and he will continue treatment under the supervision of the team physio. Were looking forward to his return to the field and are confident that we will get his services in the Calcutta Test.         
	As of now, in what has been hyped as the world championship of Tests, the No. 1 team, going by their performance, has been stained Or shall we say Steyn-ed?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Butt defends Waqar appointment
                                                                                                                       7                                      Butt defends Waqar appointment
                      
	Karachi: Defending Waqar Youniss appointment as Pakistan coach, despite allegations of match fixing against him, the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ijaz Butt said all those fined on the basis of Justice Malik Qayyums inquiry report 10 years ago have been cleared for national duties now.         
	Butt said the services of players like Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram or Ijaz Ahmed are being utilised after clearance and recovery of fines. Ten years have passed since the Malik Qayyum report came out and they have paid their fines and the International Cricket Council also has no objection to them being given responsibilities by the Board, Butt said in Islamabad.         
	Some former players have criticised the Board for appointing those players on key positions despite being named in the Qayyum match-fixing inquiry report.         
	Waqar, Wasim, Aaqib Javed, Saeed Anwar were among those whom the Qayyum committee fined for not co-operating with the inquiry that lasted for some 18 months. The Qayyum commission also recommended life bans on former captain, Salim Malik and pace bowler, Ata-ur Rehman.         
	Butt disclosed that Waqar would be paid around $7650 monthly salary besides other perks. We think that is a reasonable amount we are paying for his services since former Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer was paid around Rs1.7 million a month by the Board, Butt added.           (PTI)

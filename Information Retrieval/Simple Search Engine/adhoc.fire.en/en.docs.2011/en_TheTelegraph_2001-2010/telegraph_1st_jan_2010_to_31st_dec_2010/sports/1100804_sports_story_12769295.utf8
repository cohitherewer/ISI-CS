The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Drunk locals abuse Yuvi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Drunk locals abuse Yuvi
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Yuvraj Singh in Colombo, on Tuesday                           
	Colombo: If being overlooked for the final Test wasnt bad enough, Yuvraj Singh found himself being abused by inebriated local fans on Day I, at the P. Sara Stadium, here.         
	Matters threatened to get out of hand in the last session, but the security personnel intervened after Yuvraj asked them to tackle the abusive lot. Theyd begun by taunting him drinks boy and, then, started abusing.         
	It had been happening for much of the day, in fact... That section of the crowd had also been abusing Ishant Sharma, Yuvraj told The Telegraph on returning to the team hotel.         
	The abuses came from the area to the right of the dressing room, which houses the bar. Surprisingly, there didnt seem enough security personnel around.         
	Ive lodged an official complaint and that area will be cordoned off tomorrow (Wednesday)... Spectators have no right to behave in such a manner, remarked an agitated Team India manager, Ranjib Biswal.         
	Two-and-a-half months ago, after the early exit from the World T20, a clutch of players, including Yuvraj, had been abused by inebriated NRIs, in St Lucia.         
	Of course, that had been at a pub and the players were censured by the Board for being out late and behaving (reacting, actually) in a manner unbecoming of those wearing the India colours.

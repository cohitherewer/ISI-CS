The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Things are looking up for Somdev
                                                                                                                       7                                      Things are looking up for Somdev
  - Its unfortunate that Sania has to play in lower-tier tournaments       Serve amp; Volley   - Naresh Kumar                                  
	At last a ripple in the still waters of Indian tennis. After 13 years, an Indian, 25-year-old Somdev Dev Varman, broke into the top 100 for a week in the beginning of the month. Now, in the rankings released Monday, hes broken the barrier again. Hes currently ranked No. 99.         
	For two weeks in between, he was ranked within the top 120 in the ATP chart.         
	Chasing a top 100 ranking is the most difficult phase in a tennis players career. You have to fight your way through scores of hungry and talented youngsters from all over the world and you have to do it under very difficult conditions.         
	They all compete with a do-or-die tenacity. Once through the gates of the top 100 the path to better rankings is somewhat easier. It is like crossing the hostile Khyber Pass with the rich fertile plains of India ahead. In the elite 100, you can get a direct entry into tournaments with higher prize money and also earn valuable ranking points.         
	Your game improves and becomes sharper by being tested against a higher class of player. A couple of good victories can boost your confidence and raise your game to a higher level.         
	Or, if you are lucky, you may beat a higher-ranked player nursing an injury or catch a big name on his off day. For Somdev to break through the ranks of physically stronger and much taller competitors is an achievement that deserves a gilded accolade. The level-headed and determined lad from Tripura is now the sheet anchor of Indian tennis.         
	Yuki Bhambri, the lone youngster on the radar, holds much promise but has a long way to go before achieving his potential. He, too, is to be congratulated for getting to the top in junior tennis. Bhambri now faces the biggest hurdle in tennis  a successful transition of a top junior to the mens world.         
	The decline in the womens game continues unabated. Sania Mirzas injuries and other problems have seen her ranking plummet to 160. A number of early losses in singles signal that, physically, all is not well with Sania.         
	The wild card entries to bigger events are no longer coming and she is looking at the depressing necessity of going back to playing in lower tier tournaments at obscure places to collect points for the climb back. She won the first round of qualifiers at Flushing Meadows, Wednesday.         
	For someone who has been a glamorous global star this is, to put it lightly, a very demoralising thought. The dream of a top 20 to 30 ranking, where she really belongs, is shattered. And the ban on Indian origin players with foreign passports is like the straw that broke the camels back.         
	The Uberoi sisters and Sunitha Rao, people who have supported Sania in team events like the Federation Cup, are no longer eligible to play for India. The selection committee has been forced to fall back on the oldies  the 31-year-old Rushmi Chakraborty, who still manages to decimate youngsters, and Nirupama (Vaidyanathan) Sanjeev, a 33-year-old mother of one, are staging a come back.         
	The other member of the team is 19-year-old Poojashree Venkatesh  currently the second-highest ranked Indian in the world.         
	The womens tennis scene reminds me of a listing ship going down with Sania on the bridge and no help in sight. The mens team is stronger but much older. Leander Paes (37), Mahesh Bhupathi (36), Somdev (25) and Rohan Bopana (30) take the average to over 30.         
	They are a good team and can win quite a few medals at the Commonwealth Games, but one cannot fancy their chances in the Davis Cup tie against Brazil from September 17-19, at Chennai.         
	Asian tennis is booming. China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan have collectively 12 players in the top 100 in the mens and womens singles rankings. Quite a few are high-class players with good potential. India is nowhere in the picture.         
	Looking at all these figures, one does not need a crystal ball to predict the future of Indian tennis.         
	The announcement by the All India Tennis Association (AITA) that they will adhere to government guidelines for sporting bodies, especially as regards election and terms of office bearers is great news. Many years ago, I was nominated by the sports ministry to visit and report on the various tournaments held by the AITA.         
	The AITA flatly refused to entertain anybody nominated by the government. Ironically, they did this when no less than the president of India was the AITA president!         
	Sport reflects the image and character of a nation. Both have been assassinated by the Commonwealth Games.         
	Our heads hang in shame before the world. It will take many years before the stigma is wiped out. The government has to act fast and ensure that sports administration is cleaned up.

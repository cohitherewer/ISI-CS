            A STAFF REPORTER            Sandeep Patil in Kalyani, on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: National Cricket Academy (NCA) director Sandeep Patil Tuesday quelled doubts over Indias dwindling pace stock as he said some talented youngsters are waiting in pipeline. On a visit to the Cricket Association of Bengals (CAB) cricket academy at Kalyani, Patil said he has identified youngsters from various academies across India who are capable of making it to the big stage with the help of the NCA.         
	We have good talent in fast bowling. I am not going to name anyone in particular, but there are some good youngsters coming up, Patil said.         
	Injuries to fast bowlers are nothing new, but the wear and tear suffered by the Indian pacers owing to the hectic work schedule worries Patil. The workload today is too much. At NCA, we get almost a couple of cases every week. Its not that injuries werent there 30 years back. If Kapil Dev has played continuously for 15 years , it doesnt mean he never had injuries, he said         
	Patil considered the CABs academy as one of the best in the country . There are 32 academies under the NCA and barring J amp;K, Ive visited all the academies personally. The location (Kalyani) may be a bit too far for players from the city, but the area is very good, Patil said.         
	Kolkata Knight Riders coach Dav Whatmore has been made overall in-charge of the CAB academy and an under-14 camp will start from December 16 in the first phase.         
	Patil, meanwhile, welcomed Anil Kumbles victory in the KSCA polls. We have congratulated him. Hes our NCA chairman. He comes with new ideas, which is required for players of todays era. Patil said.

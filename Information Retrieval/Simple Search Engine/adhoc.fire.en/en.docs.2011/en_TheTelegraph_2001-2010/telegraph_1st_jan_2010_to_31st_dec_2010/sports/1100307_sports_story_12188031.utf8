            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: India women made amends for their loss in the first match as they beat England by 30 runs in the second T20 International at the MCA ground here Saturday.         
	Electing to bat first, the hosts posted 126 for seven with wicketkeeper-batsman Sulakshana Naik laying the foundation with an explosive 36 and Harmanpreet Kaur consolidating the solid start with an equally quick 33 in the middle.         
	The Indians seemed to have learnt from Thursdays narrow loss as they skittled out the visitors for a paltry 96 in 19.2 overs.         
	What we learnt from the last match was to hold our nerves, Mithali Raj, leading the side in the absence of an injured Jhulan Goswami, said.

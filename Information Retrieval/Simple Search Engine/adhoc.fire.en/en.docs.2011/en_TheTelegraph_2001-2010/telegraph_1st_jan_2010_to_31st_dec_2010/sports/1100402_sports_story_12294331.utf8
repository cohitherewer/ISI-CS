The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi wants a psychologist
                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridi wants a psychologist
                      
	Lahore: Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi wants a psychologist to work with the players ahead of the World Twenty20. Afridi said he supported the idea of having a psychologist hold counselling sessions with the players in the training camp underway at Lahore.         
	The last time we had a psychologist work with the players before the Twenty20 World Cup in England it helped a lot, he said on Thursday.         
	But Afridi made the point that it would be useless having a psychologist holding counseling sessions in the camp unless the players were ready to absorb what he said.         
	The Pakistan players had sessions with psychologist Dr Babri before the last World T20 and the Champions Trophy and the feeling was that he had a positive impact on them. Pakistan coach Waqar Younis said he would be speaking to the board high-ups soon about it.         
	The former Pakistan captain said he himself was working hard on lifting the morale of the players after the recent events in Pakistan cricket.         
	The players need to believe in themselves if they want to achieve good results and my focus is on making them gel as a unit and improving their confidence levels, he said.         
	Pakistan manager Yawar Saeed said he had made it clear to the players that there would be a zero tolerance policy as far as discipline was concerned in the camp. (PTI)

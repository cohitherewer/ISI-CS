The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Youngsters lack hunger for Tests: Dravid
                                                                                                                       7                                        Youngsters lack hunger for Tests: Dravid
                  Rahul Dravid                     
	New Delhi: Young players like Suresh Raina and Rohit Sharma lack the all-consuming desperation to do well in Test cricket as they have other options, feels former India captain Rahul Dravid.         
	Dravid said the young Team India players make all the right noise when they talk about Test cricket being the pinnacle of the game, but they dont have the fierce passion of their seniors who would do whatever it takes to do well in the longest format.         
	I think they say the right thing. They talk the talk, theres no doubt about it. But there is no all-consuming desperation for them, like it was for myself or cricketers of my generation, to do well in Test cricket, Dravid told a cricket website.         
	First class and Test cricket were the only cricket we had. Today there are more opportunities.         
	According to Dravid, things would get only worse if Test cricket was not restored to its health.         
	Im not even worried about the Rainas and the Rohit Sharmas today; theyve grown up in an era when Test cricket was important.         
	But I wonder what a 14-15-16-year old today is thinking. I wonder whats going to happen five years ahead, and thats why its important to play more Test matches, Dravid explained.         
	Dravid said the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) should have a set domestic calendar covering a six-seven month period, during which India would play their international home matches, including more Tests.         
	We must have our own domestic calendar, six or seven months which are ideal for us to play cricket. We should play our quota of six Tests and a certain number of ODIs during that period, and then work around that, he said.         
	Dravid said BCCI should use its clout to convince other boards to accept the calendar.         
	Everyone around the world should recognise that Test cricket needs to thrive in India, he said.         
	He also insisted that Indias bilateral Test series should invariably feature three matches and not just two.         
	Three-Test series is ideal. In my whole career, Ive played only one Test series (against West Indies in 1997) which included five Tests, and in the old days, that (five Tests) was the norm, he said.

	Paris: World No. 2 Saina Nehwal survived a scare before prevailing over unseeded Chinese Taipeis Hsian Huan Chen in a thrilling three-game match to reach the pre-quarterfinals of World Championship here on Wednesday. The second-seeded Indian, one of the hot favourites to win the World title, beat Chen 20-22, 21-15, 21-8 in the second round of the womens singles here.         
	Saina, was clearly not in her element in the first game as she blew a 20-18 lead while Chen, playing controlled shots at the nets, won her way through to 22-20.         
	I know I was a little tight in the first game and it normally happens when you play your first match in a World Championship, said Saina. Actually, I should have won the first game after leading by a couple of points but thats the nature of the game.         
	In the second game, Saina didnt take too many risks and cut down on the unforced errors. Her long shots were more controlled and she began dominating the mid-court, an area where Chen was cutting the Indian down.         
	After Chen had taken a 2-0 lead in the second game, Saina slowly got herself back as the lead exchanged hands quite a few times till the Indian led at 13-12.         
	The Hyderabadi then slowly built up the lead to 17-13 and with a beautiful drop shot came within a point of taking the second game. An error from Chen gave Saina the game as she clenched her fists in relief.         
	At that point, I was controlling the rallies and was willing to take a few risks at the net, Saina said. I knew she was tiring a bit and her game wasnt as focused as she had been in the first.         
	Taking advantage of a tiring Chen who was now making too many errors, Saina raced off to a 7-0 lead in the third and deciding game. She used her drop shots to good effect and played seven drop shots in the decider.         
	At 15-2, Chen tried a late revival and won a few points to cut the lead but Saina had her measure up by then and closed off the decider at 21-8. Saina Nehwal will now meet Russias 13th seed Ella Diehl on Thursday.         
	Meanwhile, Indian mens and womens doubles pairs thrashed their respective opponents to sail into the pre-quarterfinals. The womens doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa, seeded 16th in the prestigious tournament, needed jut 18 minutes to thrash Ukrainians Maria Ulitina and Natalya Voytsekh 21-8, 21-10 in their second round match.         
	The Indian duo, who got a walkover in their opening round, will now take on six seeded Korean pair of Jung Eun Ha and Min Jung Kim in the pre-quarter finals.         
	 In the mens doubles second round, the 15th seeded Indian duo of Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas also scored a comfortable 21-14, 21-16 win over South Africans Dorian Lance James and Willem Viljoen in just 23 minutes.         
	Former World and Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia came back from the brink of defeat to book a place in the pre-quarterfinals.         
	The fifth seed Indonesian, dug into his reserves to overcome a tenacious Hsieh Yu Hsin of Chinese Taipei 19-21, 21-19, 21-9. Chinese ace Lin Dan, however, had no such problems as he carved out a 21-13, 21-15 win over Finlands Henri Hurskainen.

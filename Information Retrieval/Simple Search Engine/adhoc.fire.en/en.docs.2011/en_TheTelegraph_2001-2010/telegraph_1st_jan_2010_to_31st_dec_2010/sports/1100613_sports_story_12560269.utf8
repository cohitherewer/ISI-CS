The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fresh move by Morgan on Howard
                                                                                                                       7                                        Fresh move by Morgan on Howard
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Morgan                           
	Calcutta: Under pressure from Australia and New Zealand, the International Cricket Council (ICC) president, David Morgan, is understood to have made a personal appeal to Zimbabwe Cricket to end its opposition to John Howards nomination as the next vice-president of the world body.         
	Whats critical, of course, is that the next man will succeed Indias Sharad Pawar in the top post (too), in the summer of 2012. Pawar takes over from Englands Morgan later this month.         
	According to well-placed sources of The Telegraph, the personal appeal was made during Morgans two-day visit to Zimbabwe, which began on Friday. He was accompanied by Haroon Lorgat, the ICCs chief executive.         
	Morgan met the key players there, top of the list being the controversial Peter Chingoka, who has been calling the shots for a number of years.         
	Till Saturday evening, it wasnt known whether Chingoka gave an assurance on reviewing Zimbabwes position, but few expect a change.         
	Bad news for Morgan, who surely wouldnt like to be remembered as one who lacked influence during his two years as the ICC president.         
	Australia-New Zealands nomination of Howard has been hanging fire for two months when, as a matter of routine, it should have been approved by the ICCs Executive Board, in April itself.         
	The former Australia Prime Minister is facing stiff resistance from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Apparently, from the West Indies, as well.         
	While Pakistans stand is unclear, England may (it would be a truly dramatic shift) take to fence-sitting. Howard, therefore, has the committed support only of the countries which have nominated him.         
	Howard needs the backing of seven Full (Test-playing) members. At this point in time, its inconceivable how he will reach that number.         
	The opposition to Howard is on more than one count, from his stand on Australia touring Zimbabwe to making uncalled for comments on Muttiah Muralidharan.         
	Also, some are just not keen on having somebody of Howards profile in their midst.         
	Speaking exclusively, the head of one of the national boards opposed to Howard bluntly said: Were quite clear that hes not welcome... I dont want to go into details, but our position is firm... Let Australia-New Zealand nominate somebody else, otherwise, they can give up their turn...         
	Clearly, that leaves very little scope for a compromise before the ICCs annual conference, this time in Singapore, from June 27-July 1.         
	For purposes of making a nomination, the Test-playing members have been clubbed as follows: England-West Indies, India-Bangladesh, Australia-New Zealand, Pakistan-Sri Lanka, South Africa-Zimbabwe.         
	Footnote: Zimbabwe Cricket, meanwhile, is looking at a gradual return to Test cricket after the 2011 World Cup.

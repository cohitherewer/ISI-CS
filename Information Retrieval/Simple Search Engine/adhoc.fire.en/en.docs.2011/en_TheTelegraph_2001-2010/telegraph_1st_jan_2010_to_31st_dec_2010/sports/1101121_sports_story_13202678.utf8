                                                                                                                       7                                      Anil: Have a clean heart
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  Anil Kumble        
	Calcutta: Former India captain Anil Kumble, who is challenging incumbent Srikanta Datta Narasimharaja Wadiyar, a Mysore royal, for the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) presidents post, in the elections scheduled for Sunday, spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday.         
	Kumble, the third most successful bowler (619 wickets) in Test cricket, is currently chairman of the Board of Control for Cricket in India-run National Cricket Academy, in hometown Bangalore.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Q Well, whats it like on the eve of the elections?         
	A Im feeling good, Im hopeful... Its an exciting time for me.         
	But are you having that butterflies in the stomach sensation?         
	Indeed, yes... Theres a bit of nervousness, as Im venturing into something new, but its part of the game.         
	Whats been the response of the electorate?         
	Very positive, Id say... The voters have been responding well... Now, its a question of that positive response, from the electorate, translating into votes.         
	Have the voters been asking whether you and Jawagal Srinath, candidate for secretary, would actually find the time to administer the KSCA?         
	They have and the issue has been addressed... (Adds laughing) Only the busy men have time!         
	Vijay Mallya is fighting on your ticket, so to say...         
	Yes, Mallyas with us.         
	[Mallya, owner of the Royal Challengers Bangalore, will make it to the managing committee if the Vijaya Sports Club wins one of the six seats reserved for the founder-institutional members representing the Bangalore zone.]         
	Not just Srinath, but a clutch of other former cricketers like Roger Binny and Venkatesh Prasad are also on board. Quite a coming together isnt it?         
	Weve played together and all have a common objective.         
	What have you been telling the electorate?         
	That my team and I have a clean slate and a clean heart... We have a vision, so allow us to make the KSCA a model association... Lend a helping hand and see the change.         
	The No.1 priority...         
	Our priority is cricket only... Administration, infrastructure, not discriminating between the cities and mofussil areas... No zone-wise discrimination either... We intend improving the KSCA on all fronts. Please note that meritocracy alone will count.         
	You represented the country for 18 years and have stayed in touch with the game through the Indian Premier League... Is that turning out to be a big plus?         
	Absolutely... Fortunately, Ive travelled across the world and seen how the best centres are administered... Seen the infrastructure which exists and the facilities which need to be added... It has been an eye-opener.         
	Is your clean image your USP?         
	Our USP... Look, Ive been campaigning for my team, never just for myself... As in cricket, its the team which has to click, with individuals contributing... People do see me as somebody with credibility and thats been built over 20 years.         
	Have you looked at any individual as a role model administrator?         
	The one I can think of is N.R. Narayana Murthy (the Infosys founder-chairman, now its chief mentor)...         
	Any chance of a last-minute compromise with Wadiyar?         
	No.         
	Lastly, your thoughts on the possibility of administrators without a cricket background, elsewhere, feeling threatened should you and your team, as expected, make it...         
	I wouldnt like to comment... All Ill say is that we have a vision and are confident that we can change things for the better.

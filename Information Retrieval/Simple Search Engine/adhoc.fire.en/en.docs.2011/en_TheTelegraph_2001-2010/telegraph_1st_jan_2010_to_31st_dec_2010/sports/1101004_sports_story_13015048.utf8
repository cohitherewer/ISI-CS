            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: Trainer Pesi Shroffs filly Alice Springs, an even-money favourite, found Vijay Singhs ward, Hall Of Glory, an easy prey in the 2,000m Calcutta Monsoon Derby, Sundays main attraction. Ridden by visiting jockey B. Prakash, Alice Springs was held back in third behind the front-running Hall Of Glory (C. Alford-up) till about the final turn and she went past the leader without much of resistance, inside the last 200m of the race. A couple of hard rides before the Derby had perhaps, taken the steam out of Alford. Prakash, on the other hand, was in a good nick, ending the day with a treble.

	Mumbai: The Delhi DareDevils, already missing captain Gautam Gambhir and Ashish Nehra due to injury, were dealt another blow when their South African pace recruit Wayne Parnell was ruled out of the rest of the Indian Premier League, after picking up a groin injury during warm-up.         
	His (Parnells) condition will be assessed by Cricket South Africa (CSA)s medical team when he returns home this week, said CSAs media officer Michael-Owen Smith, in a media release.         
	The DareDevils are struggling to maintain their form of the first two seasons of the tournament, currently lying sixth with two wins and three losses in the eight-team tournament that concludes on April 25.         
	The DareDevils had managed victories against the Kings XI Punjab and the Rajasthan Royals.         
	Gambhir and Nehra have been sent to Sri Lanka for ayurvedic treatment of their injuries. (PTI)

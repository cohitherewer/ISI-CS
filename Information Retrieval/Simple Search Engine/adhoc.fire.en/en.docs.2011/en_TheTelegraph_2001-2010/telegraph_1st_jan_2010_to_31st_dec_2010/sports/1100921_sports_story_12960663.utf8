  Chirag take on Sesa in Goa                A STAFF REPORTER AGENCIES            Ekene Ikenwa                           
	Calcutta/ Margao: Defending champions East Bengal begin their Federation Cup campaign on Tuesday when they take on Mumbais Air India, in Cuttack.         
	The red and gold brigade, who are on a roll  netting 19 goals in five matches of the Calcutta Football League  should have it easy against the Bimal Ghosh-coached side. Trevor James Morgan has impressed one and all within his brief stay at the helm and, the way his team is playing right now, a goal glut will not be too much to ask for.         
	East Bengals Ekene Ikenwa is a doubtful starter as he is nursing a gash on his right eyelid. He is under medication. The British coach will take a call on him only on Tuesday.         
	If Ekene doesnt make the cut, then Tolgey Ozbey will partner Robin Singh upfront.         
	Robin Singh has been a revelation in the Premier Division matches so far and will definitely like to make a strong impression at the national level as well.         
	After all, this tournament will be closely watched by national coach Bob Houghton, in case he wants to make last-minute inclusions in the India squad.         
	Robin and Tolgey will definitely give a torrid time to the Air India defence, which has Eduardo Coelho at the centre of defence.         
	East Bengals right flank has been very lively so far in the season with lateral back Naoba Singh and attacking midfielder R.Vashum working in tandem. At the centre of the park Mehtab Hossain and Penn Orji have also been impressive.         
	In another match, Pune FC, one of the title contenders, take on HAL, Bangalore.         
	In Vasco, Chirag United will be looking for full points when they take on qualifiers Sesa Football Academy in a Group B quarter final match.         
	Chirag, who finished eight in the last edition of the I-League, have come here without their captain Arnab Mondal who is out with an injury.         
	Goalkeeper Somnath Khara is leading the team.         
	The Calcutta team made an early exit from the tournament in the last edition in Guwahati.         
	The club is focussed on improving their performance this time around and has been working towards it.         
	They have strengthened their team with four foreigners in Junior Elija, Joshimar, Sergey Tokov and Chika Wali.         
	Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya said: Boys are in good shape and will go all out for a win.         
	Sesa have surprised everyone by beating Vasco and Sporting Clube de Goa in the qualifying stage.         
	Sesa coach Clifford Chukwuma said: I am sure my boys will do well and come out victors.         
	The second match will be between Churchill Brothers and Viva Kerala.         
	Churchill Brothers have not won the Federation Cup so far and they are determined to win this time under their new coach Subramaniam. They lost to Lajong FC in the semi-finals last year.         
	Winning the tournament will satisfy us, said the former Singapore national coach.         
	We have played a couple of Pro-League matches as well as friendly matches with encouraging results. The team spirit is good and players are fit and are looking to perform well at this tournament, Subramaniam added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sledging by Symonds makes Yusuf spit fire
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sledging by Symonds makes Yusuf spit fire
                      
	Ahmedabad: The Rajasthan Royals batsman Yusuf Pathan Friday accused Deccan Chargers Andrew Symonds of sledging him during their Indian Premier League match here.         
	Yusuf said the Australians behaviour made him more determined to go for the big shots against the Hyderabad teams bowlers.         
	Yusuf smashed the Chargers bowlers to all parts of the ground to score a quickfire unbeaten 73 off 34 balls to power the Royals to an eight-wicket win over the Hyderabad side. Soon after guiding his side home, Yusuf said that Symonds sledged him while he came out to bat.         
	It inspires you Makes you more determined when the opposition player sledges you. When I went in to bat today (Friday), Symonds exchanged a few words and it made me more determined to score runs, Yusuf said after the match.         
	During his hurricane innings, Yusuf big hitting skills were on full display as he hit as many as eight sixes and two boundaries.         
	I batted well. My parents have been coming for the last two games and I am happy that I scored some runs for them today. The ball was coming nicely on to the bat, the all-rounder, who was selected in Indias Twenty20 World Cup squad on the day, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Double revenge delights Yusif, Uga
                                                                                                                       7                                      Double revenge delights Yusif, Uga
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Guwahati: It might have been just revenge in the headlines, but for foreign recruits Yusif Yakubu and Uga Okpara, East Bengals 2-0 defeat of Mohun Bagan in the Hero Honda Federation Cup semi-final at the Nehru Stadium Thursday was double revenge.         
	After the win, coach Phillippe de Ridder had maintained that revenge was still pending, but Ghanaian forward Yakubu Friday said it was revenge served twice  for their October 25 I-League defeat and exit in last years Federation Cup, after defeat at the hands of the arch-rivals.         
	Defender Okpara, too, felt the same.         
	My main aim was to block (Jose) Barreto and (Edeh) Chidi, which I managed to do to help our side avenge defeats in last years Federation Cup and the I-League, the Nigerian said.         
	Okpara was undoubtedly a factor in the red and gold brigades victory Thursday as the opponents put extraordinary pressure on the East Bengal defence throughout the match.         
	The mood being such, De Ridder, too, was forced to concede that it had eventually turned out to be a revenge although he did add that I never took it that way.         
	It was undoubtedly an important match and people kept asking me from the very beginning, whether victory would be a revenge. I had always replied in the negative because had we taken it as a revenge match, the pressure would have been more, and the players could not have played the way they did, he said.         
	But even after the victory, Ridder refused to call it revenge. It is certainly not (revenge). It would come another day, very soon, if our boys keep up the good work.         
	As to the secret of bringing out the best of a team that was not in the best shape till a couple of months back, Ridder said: Mutual respect among the players and the coachs art of commanding respect help a team to be disciplined. Those improve the spirit, too.         
	I work out the strategy of every match separately, which has so far worked. Besides, we dont take any extra pressure under any circumstances, he added.         
	On their prospects in Sundays final against Lajong FC, star striker Bhaichung Bhutia said it would be wise to take them seriously rather than meeting the same fate as Churchill Brothers who lost to the Shillong greenhorns 0-1 in Wednesdays first semi-final.         
	Lajong are a good team who have already beaten strong opponents like Dempo, Pune FC and Churchill. They are spirited and fast on the ground. They cannot be taken lightly at any cost, Bhaichung said.         
	The players, who went to bed late after celebrating the New Year, went for an outing Friday afternoon after Rahim Nabi, Yakubu and Mehtab Hossain joined them after prayers.         
	The celebration had started on Thursday evening itself with cake and champagne, and the players went to a private party after dinner. There was no practice Friday.

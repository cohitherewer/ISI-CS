The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Soccer City comes alive
                                                                                                                       7                                      Soccer City comes alive
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  A South African fan in Soweto, on Thursday        
	Johannesburg: As the taxi drives towards the Soccer City through the clean and wide roads, you can easily tell why Johannesburg is not just South Africas biggest but also the busiest city. There is a stream of people moving by on either side of the road, which is invariably covered with huge hoardings of the World Cup beginning on Friday. But once the taxi reaches the Soccer City Stadium, the excitement is bound to get you.         
	The magnificent stadium with its traditional calabash design, known as the African pot, has tremendous aesthetic appeal, especially once the lights are on.         
	Located at the southwest of Johannesburg, the stadium stands only a short distance from one of South Africas most football crazy township, Soweto. About 40 per cent of Johannesburgs population live in Soweto and this proximity is bound to make the stadium a hub of activity throughout the 2010 finals.         
	The stadium, first built in 1980, is widely regarded as the heart of football here as it has hosted many important matches and events in the past. The Soccer City hosted the first mass rally of Nelson Mandela after he was released from jail in 1990 and then, six years later, South Africa won the African Nations Cup at the same venue.         
	Back to World Cup, despite the fear of crime and poverty that can have a negative impact on the beautiful game, there is little doubt that South Africa is ready to make the World Cup a great success. As the 32 teams and their 736 players prepare to battle for the 18-carat gold trophy, the air of expectations is thick on the eve of the biggest football event to be held on African soil.         
	People of all shapes and sizes, colours and creeds from Europe, Asia, the US and Australia have descended here for the World Cup that the sceptics and doomsayers predicted would never take place.         
	The streets of Johannesburg are noisy and jubilant with the sound of foreign voices, whose teams are once again expected to dominate the World Cup, though the locals are hoping against hope that the flag of Bafana Bafana would fly high when the hosts meet Mexico in the opener.         
	We are excited, said a volunteer.         
	We have seen stars like Kaka, Ronaldo and Rooney but only on television. This time it will be live, said the petite looking girl with a sweet smile.         
	One thing is for sure that for every South African, being chosen to host the World Cup has come as a nod of international prestige.         
	 After much persuasion, Mandela is likely to attend the opening match on Friday. His grandson, who met the journalists in a sponsored programme this morning, said Mandela will be there for only a few minutes because of poor health.         
	We are ready, reads the slogan. They certainly are.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Australias Leisel Jones was at her best at the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee aquatic pool on Friday.         
	The 25-year-old swimmer won the 100m breaststroke final to become the first athlete to win two Games events three times in a row following her success in the 200m butterfly last Wednesday.         
	With the 4x100m medley relay to come on Saturday, the Olympic 100m breaststroke champion has the opportunity to win her 10th Commonwealth Games gold medal and equal the mark of Australian swimming greats Ian Thorpe and Susie Neill.         
	Id love to, that would be great, Jones said, smiling at the prospect. It would be nice to be up there with those sorts of names ... a real honour.         
	Overall, there was no end to Aussie domination of the pool as they won seven gold medals on the day.         
	In athletics, Kenyan women brought the African nations campaign in long-distance running back on track after their men failed to bag the 5,000m race.         
	Olympic champion Nancy Langat and compatriot Grace Momanyi won the 1,500m and 10,000m races respectively. It was Kenyas fourth consecutive win in the womens 10,000m in the Games.         
	Twenty nine-year-old Langat led the way for Kenya with a new Games record time of 4 minutes and 5:26 seconds, beating New Zealands Nikki Hamblin and Scotlands Stephanie Twell. Momanyi and Doris Changeywo made it a Kenyan one-two in the 10,000m.

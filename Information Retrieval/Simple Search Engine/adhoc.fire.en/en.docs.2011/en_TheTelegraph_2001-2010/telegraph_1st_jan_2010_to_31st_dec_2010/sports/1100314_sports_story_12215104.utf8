            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: After hitting the fastest century in the Indian Premier League on Saturday, Yusuf Pathan said his record could be soon surpassed.         
	When you have good wickets and good ground conditions, lots of runs will be scored and records will be broken, Yusuf said after smashing 100 from 37 balls for the Rajasthan Royals in their match against the Mumbai Indians.         
	I have been in good form and it was a good wicket. I made a slight mistake, else we would have won the match, said the centurion.

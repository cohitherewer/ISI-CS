The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gibbs spills death penalty threat from Delhi Police
                                                                                                                       7                                        Gibbs spills death penalty threat from Delhi Police
 - Proteas opener says he was made to apologise for his comments                  Herschelle Gibbs                     
	Johannesburg: The Delhi Police had intimidated him with the threat of a death penalty, claims South African batsman Herschelle Gibbs, who had been grilled by them for his suspected involvement in the 2000 match-fixing scandal in India.         
	Sir, you had better come clean. We still have the death penalty here, Gibbs quotes a top Delhi Police official as telling him during interrogation.         
	The South African opener doesnt name the police officer in his controversial autobiography To the Point, but describes him as a tough-looking old Sikh gentleman who headed Delhis Murder and Robbery team. This appears to be a reference to A.S. Cheema, who headed the anti-extortion cell of crime branch during the time Gibbs interrogation took place in 2006.         
	[ Our Bureau adds: While Delhi Police officials disagreed that Cheema actually threatened Gibbs with the spectre of death penalty, they said Delhi Police had, at that time, taken up the matter of Gibbs offensive comments with the South African High Commission in New Delhi. Gibbs had apologised for his comments after the High Commission intervened, they added.]         
	After initially refusing to be part of South Africas squad for an India tour for the fear of being arrested, Gibbs, accompanied by his lawyer Peter Whelan, travelled to the country to face grilling by a four-man panel.         
	Needless to say, Peter jumped right in with both feet and threatened to end the meeting right there if they tried this kind of intimidating tactic, Gibbs wrote.         
	Besides facing a hostile grilling, Gibbs also had to apologise to the then Delhi Police Crime Branch Commissioner Ranjit Narayan for publicly calling him hard-arsed.         
	The opener also disclosed that he had indulged in tonsil hockey (deep kissing) with a German girl at the Taj Hotel the night before being questioned by police in the Indian capital.         
	Gibbs wrote about his return to India to face questioning following his role in the Hansiegate saga in 2000.         
	Our flight to India was via Dubai and Peter spent about eight of those hours coaching me on the upcoming grilling I was sure to get, Gibbs wrote in the book. Remember that the King Commission (in South Africa) had been five years earlier and we knew the Indians would be looking for any discrepancies between my testimony back then and what I would have to say to them now.         
	I think the Indians were pretty taken aback when I turned up with both my lawyer and the High Commissioner. I was hustled inside to see K.K. Paul, who had been my Indian nemesis for the past six years. Hello, Mr Gibbs, he said. Im a big fan of yours. Not exactly the reception I had been expecting from him!         
	...A four-man panel, headed by the joint commissioner of the Delhi Police Crime Branch, Ranjit Narayan, bombarded me with questions for about three hours. It was a hostile situation, make no mistake, and it wasnt helped either by the fact that Id publicly said commissioner Narayan was hard-arsed. The commissioner wasnt happy about that at all, and he even brought it up during the questioning. I had to apologise. His arse was not so hard after all, Gibbs wrote.         
	The Proteas opener said he was convinced that the Indian authorities were determined to nail him because they had already banned quite a few of their cricketers.         
	Interestingly, Gibbs also wrote that Rahul Dravid clicked the panic button during the IPL-II final. He tried to play a little paddle against Harmeet Singh and got bowled. In a normal game he would never have tried that shot at that time. There was panic written all over it, Gibbs wrote. To be honest, I still dont know how we, the Deccan Chargers, won the damn thing in 2009.

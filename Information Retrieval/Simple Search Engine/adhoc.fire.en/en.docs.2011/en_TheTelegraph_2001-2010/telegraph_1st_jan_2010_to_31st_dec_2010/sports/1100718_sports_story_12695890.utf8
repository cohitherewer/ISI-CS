	Calcutta/Galle: India will seek to end a 17-year-long wait for a series win in Sri Lanka, when the two sides meet in the first of the three-match Test series, which begins on Sunday.         
	A depleted bowling attack and inconsistent form of the much-vaunted batting line-up is surely a concern for the visitors. The last time India won a Test series in the island nation way back in 1993 under Mohammed Azharuddins captaincy. Since then, their track record has not been too impressive.         
	But Mahendra Singh Dhonis men are determined to change their fortunes this time around and get the better of the hosts in what will be spin wizard Muttiah Muralidharans last Test appearance.         
	Handicapped by the absence of pace spearhead Zaheer Khan and Sreesanth, the Indian bowling attack clearly lacks the bite. But it is the star-studded batting line up which will have to deliver the goods if India, the top ranked Test team in the world, hope to put it across the Lankans, who are a formidable opposition at home.                     
	The Indian batting line-up will be looking to spoil Muralis party in his swansong Test.         
	The Sri Lankan spin warrior will give it all to get those eight wickets needed to complete his 800-wicket tally in the longer version of the game. India have vowed to spoil Muralis party but they are a worried lot since their bowling struggled in the only warm-up game and the batsmen also failed to read Ajantha Mendis.         
	Dhoni and his boys will definitely be relieved that their tormentor Mendis, will not be playing in the first Test.         
	For the visitors, the silver lining among dark clouds is Yuvraj Singhs return to form. Dravid and VVS Laxman may not have played Test matches for quite some time but it would not be a problem for them to get back into the groove. Off-spinner Suraj Randiv or left-arm spinner Rangana Herath will assist Murali in the spin department. The Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara, has many a option in part time bowlers like Tillakaratne Dilshan.         
	But the biggest concern for India is their bowling which will face a stiff challenge from a very strong Sri Lankan batting line-up. Ishant Sharma, who is striving to cement his place in the side, has suddenly been thrust into leading the pace attack in absence of injured Zaheer and Sreesanth. His colleague in all likelihood will be Abhimanyu Mithun. Everything points to the Karnataka pacer making his Test debut on Sunday. It will be a tough ask against world class players like Sangakkara and Jayawardene.         
	Harbhajan Singh is the most experienced bowler in the side and will have to shoulder most of the burden but he will go into the match without much training due to viral fever. Sri Lanka have won eight of the last nine series at home and with players like captain Kumara Sangakkara, Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera and Thilina Kandamby in their ranks, India are in for some serious job.         
	TEAMS         
	India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman, Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha, Ishant Sharma, Abhimanyu Mithun.         
	Sri Lanka (from): Kumar Sangakkara, Muttiah Muralitharan, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Tharanga Paranavitana, Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Angelo Mathews, Prasanna Jayawardene, Lasith Malinga, Rangana Herath, Dilhara Fernando, Dammika Prasad, Suraj Randiv, Thilina Kandamby, Chanaka Welegedara, Lahiru Thirimanne.         
	Match starts: 10 am (IST).

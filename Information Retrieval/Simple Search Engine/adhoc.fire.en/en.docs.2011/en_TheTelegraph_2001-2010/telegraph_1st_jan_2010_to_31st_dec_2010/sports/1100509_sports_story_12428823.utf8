    - West Indies captain on his biggest challenge and more             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            West Indies captain Chris Gayle with the trophy in Georgetown, in the lead up to the World Twenty20                                 
	Bridgetown: Chris Gayle, the 30-year-old West Indies captain (and a Test triple centurion) spoke to The Telegraph the other evening.                 
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Is playing at home an advantage or a disadvantage?         
	A Can be both, you know... I wouldnt say theres added pressure... We do know the conditions, so thats a kind of a plus.         
	But the expectations are more...         
	Sure... The first target (making the Super Eights) has been achieved and, now, its about trying to move ahead.         
	What does it take to be successful in T20?         
	Theres no room for error... In a snap of the fingers, its over and done with... Its critical knowing who can deliver for you in this shortest version of cricket. The right player at the right time will make the difference.         
	Its felt that T20 makes even pretty ordinary batsmen into heroes, that its not all about skills. Your take?         
	Look, T20 has helped a lot of players... Because its such a short game, youre encouraged to take the aggressive route... In fact, you dont have a choice... Im convinced that T20 has worked to the advantage of batsmen and has helped them play freely.         
	Last summer, your comments on Test cricket created a furore. Do you still maintain that the future lies in T20 and that Test cricket is going to dwindle?         
	Im not going to say anything on that... Im focused on the job at hand.         
	Just how different is your approach in T20?         
	How I face the first ball in a T20 match is different from both Tests and ODIs... Because of the nature of the game, more risks have to be taken... The first six overs are crucial, so Ive got to set the tone very quickly. But, like Ive said, theres just no room for error... Its very demanding.         
	Are you enjoying the captaincy?         
	Very much so.         
	Have you had a role model-captain?         
	Not really, Im pretty much my own man... Stephen Fleming is the one captain I admired, though. He didnt have a strong team at his disposal, yet led New Zealand very well. Indeed, he has left quite a legacy, isnt it?         
	As the West Indies captain, whats the biggest challenge?         
	To try and win more matches... As you know, we havent been winning a lot of them and Id like to change the trend... Sometimes, you fail because you arent strong-minded... So, you work towards having the right mindset... The way forward is to lose as few matches as possible... Clearly, our win-loss ratio has to get better.         
	The controversy over contracts didnt present the West Indies players in good light... You had issues, but the feeling was that you were placing money before the country...         
	We had issues... Generally, everybody has issues... However, to say that we put money before the country is uncalled for... That would mean taking a political point of view... Our case wasnt only about money.         
	Has everything been sorted out?         
	Im sure there still are ongoing issues... But, at the same time, being a player, you try not to get too involved with such things.         
	Whats the level of interest in cricket among the youngsters in the West Indies?         
	The attendance at matches may be poor, but the people are still passionate about cricket... Indeed, when we do well, the atmosphere is so different... Sure, sports like basketball and soccer have a huge following, but crickets very much there. I think T20, in particular, will get more youngsters involved.         
	T20, then, is to be a promotional vehicle?         
	Yes, because it gets over in a matter of hours... T20 can take cricket forward, yes.         
	Some questions on batting... What goes on in your mind when you take guard for the first time?         
	To be honest, Im a bit nervous... I try to see off the first couple of balls, for that relaxes the mind... Thereafter, I try to play my natural game.         
	For a stroke-player like you, is it tough to actually build an innings?         
	No... It depends on the approach being taken and how one faces those first few balls.         
	The initial approach must be different in different forms...         
	In Test cricket, youd like to survive the first half-an-hour and, then, get into the act... In T20, its a very different ball game.         
	Is there a contemporary opener whom you admire?         
	I like (Virender) Sehwag... Hes creative, has an aggressive approach.         
	What would you tell the very young openers?         
	Dont try and imitate, try and be yourself... Of course, theres no harm in admiring anybody, but what works for others may not necessarily work for you... So, its important to evolve as an individual and work on your strengths.         
	Lastly... Theres big pressure on a big gun like you. How do you handle it?         
	(Grins) I look at the situation... At the end of the day, cricket is just a sport... Its possible that others look at it differently, but I dont... Its not that Im okay with defeats, but I can only control whats in my hands... Sure, I dont want to be embarrassed on the field, but I dont bother about the things I cant handle... If you try and control the things you cant, then youll be inviting big trouble... So, dont try and control the things you just cant... I dont overdo things... (After a pause) Its important to be true to yourself, though.

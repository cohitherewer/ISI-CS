            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Hockey world governing body chief Leandro Negre was feeling grateful on Wednesday.         
	The Spaniard met Subrata Roy, the Sahara India supremo, to convey his thanks, on behalf of FIH, for bailing out Indian hockey by paying Rs 1 crore towards disbursement to the players in the recent impasse with the administrators.         
	He also found himself expressing his appreciation for the Indian Premier League (IPL) after the organisers agreed to a change of timing that is of some significance to the upcoming hockey World Cup.         
	I am delighted to meet the man who has been a pillar of strength for Indian hockey since early 2000, Negre said of Roy. I have conveyed my thanks for his whole-hearted support to resolve the hockey dispute between the players and Hockey India...         
	The World Cup, to be held in New Delhi, received a shot in the arm Wednesday when the IPL agreed to reschedule the day match of March 13 to ensure there is no clash of timing with the final of the quadrennial event, to be held the same day.         
	Accordingly, the tie between the Mumbai Indians and the Rajasthan Royals, in Mumbai that day, would start at 3.00pm, an hour ahead of schedule.         
	The World Cup hockey final was set to begin at 6.30pm, before the Kings XI Punjab clashed with the Delhi DareDevils in Mohali at 8.00pm.         
	We had finalised the World Cup dates long time ago and actually advanced it by a week after the IPL dates were released. We are thankful they agreed to the change, Negre said.

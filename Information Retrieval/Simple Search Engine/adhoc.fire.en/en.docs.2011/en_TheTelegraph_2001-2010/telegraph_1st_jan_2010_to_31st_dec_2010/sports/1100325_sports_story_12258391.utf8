  - Hosts waste chances galore as Subhas, Yakubu score in 2-3 defeat       A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Yusif Yakubu, who scored the second goal, celebrates with Sanju Pradhan and B. Beikhokhei, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly and East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder have similar woes. There is no dearth of quality in both sides but the X-factor is missing and Lady Luck simply refuses to smile on both teams.         
	Otherwise how does one explain Al Qadsia of Kuwaits 3-2 victory over East Bengal in an AFC Cup group league match on Wednesday when the red-and-gold brigade could have won 5-3. Thus East Bengals winless streak extended to 11 matches (although De Ridder wants to discount the three matches in the EK Nayanar Trophy).         
	But the coach and his players should take heart from the fact that there was no shame in the defeat. Save the first 20 minutes, when Al Qadsia struck twice and left the hosts defence in tatters, the home team gave a good account of themselves.         
	The juniors like B. Beokhokhei, Subhash Singh along with senior pros Yusif Yakubu and Mehtab Hossain tested the Kuwaiti defence time and again and at least a draw would have been a fair result to the effort they put in.         
	It was Qadsias Almotawaa Bader, who scored in the second minute, stabbing home a rebound after East Bengal goalkeeper Priyant Singh thwarted a powerful shot from Al Hussein Jehad.         
	Jehad then got his name in the scoresheet when he cleverly chipped the ball after finding Priyant out of his charge in the 19th minute. Down 0-2, the East Bengal boys went on the offensive rather than withdrawing into a shell.         
	Subhash got his reward when Qadsia custodian Jama Al Rasheed Ali and stopper Alenzi Fayez failed to clear a long ball by Mehtab Hossain. Subhash who was chasing the ball headed it past the duo and then sprinted to tap into an open goal.         
	The pace with which the home team attacked was praiseworthy. Especially Yakubu and Beokhokhei tormented the Qadsia defence with his runs.         
	The home team could have made it 2-2 when Yakubus header off a Beokhokhei cross hit the post in the 38th minute. However the easiest of the lot was in the 46th minute when Yakubu split the defence with a picture perfect through for Syed Rahim Nabi. The East Bengal captain had the goalkeeper at his mercy but his left-footed placement was just off the target.         
	After the change of ends, East Bengal kept the momentum. Yakubus stinging right footer in the 67th minute was saved by the opposition goalkeeper.         
	They got the reward in the very next minute, courtesy Beokhekhei-Yakubu combination. Beokhokhei raced through the right flank, entered the box and kept a pull-back for Yakubu. However stopper Fayez trying to clear the ball lobbed the ball. Yakubu chased and headed home.         
	When it looked that East Bengal would get their first points, Qadsia scored the winner. Bader snatched the ball from an opposition player when left back Saumik Dey was injured with a bleeding nose.         
	While East Bengal players expected the referee to stop the play, he gave an advantage. Bader took a rasping right footer that beat the pint-sized Priyant to crash into the net as De Ridder made angry gestures at the Al Qadsia reserve bench. The damage was done and East Bengal rough patch seemed to continue.

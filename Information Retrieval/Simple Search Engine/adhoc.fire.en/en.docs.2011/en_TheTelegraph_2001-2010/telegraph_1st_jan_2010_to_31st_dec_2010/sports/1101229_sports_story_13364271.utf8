	Groningen (The Netherlands): Grandmaster and former world junior champion Abhijeet Gupta came back into reckoning with a finely crafted victory over compatriot International Master Ashwin Jayaram in the sixth round of the Groningen International Open chess tournament here.         
	After losing to German Arkadij Rotstein in the previous round, Abhijeet was troubled by Ashwin and the game looked headed for a draw before he forced a victory.         
	Shiven Khoslas final International Master norm prospects suffered a slight setback as he went down fighting to Zaven Andriasian of Armenia. The other Indian in the fray, IM Sahaj Grover played out a draw with IM De Jong Migchiel of Netherlands.         
	As many as eight players emerged as joint leaders on 4.5 points. (PTI)

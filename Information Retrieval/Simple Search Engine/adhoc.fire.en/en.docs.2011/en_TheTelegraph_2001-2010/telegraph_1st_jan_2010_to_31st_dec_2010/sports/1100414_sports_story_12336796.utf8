The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I was under no pressure, says Pollard
                                                                                                                       7                                      I was under no pressure, says Pollard
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: After fashioning the Mumbai Indians 39-run win against the Delhi Daredevils on Tuesday, all-rounder Kieron Pollard said his team was peaking at the right time.         
	I think we are peaking at the right time. We won five games in a row and then lost a couple of games. But we worked hard to win the last two games and I think we should carry the momentum through into the semi-finals, he said.         
	Despite hitting a match-winning unbeaten 13-ball 45, Pollard credited his teammates for the victory and said that the top order not firing in the last few games was not a concern.         
	On his own batting, he said: I just tried to push it on I played my natural game. There was no pressure on me from the dressing room.

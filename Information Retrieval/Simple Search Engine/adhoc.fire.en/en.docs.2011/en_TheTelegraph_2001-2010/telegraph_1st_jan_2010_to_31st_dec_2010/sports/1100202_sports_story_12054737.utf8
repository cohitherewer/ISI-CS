The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Door still open for Arindam
                                                                                                                       7                                      Door still open for Arindam
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) brass are now on a damage control mission after the surprise exclusion of Arindam Das and Sourashish Lahiri from the Bengals 20-member probables list for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.         
	Arindamwas Bengals highest run-getter in the Ranji Trophy.         
	Once we had to include him after Sambaran Banerjees committee dropped him from the Ranji Trophy probables list. If we do it again, the selectors as well as office-bearers will cut a sorry figure as many would feel that we are always contradicting ourselves. But we are trying to find a way out, a senior office-bearer said.         
	The CAB is now looking at two options  including players outside the probables list or announce the squad for one or two matches initially.         
	In all, Bengal will play five matches. If someone doesnt perform in the first two matches, Arindam or Sourashish can be suitably drafted in.         
	The Bengal probables camp began at the JU (Salt Lake) ground on Monday. Sourav Ganguly is expected to join the camp on Tuesday, while Subhamoy Das and Sourav Sarkar will miss the camp due to office commitments.         
	The next two days of the camp will feature only 15 players as five will be busy playing League matches.

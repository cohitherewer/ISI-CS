    - Laxman struck by morning blues; BCCI said no to floodlights           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Suresh Raina celebrates the dismissal of Ricky Ponting, in Bangalore, on Saturday                                 
	Bangalore: With both India and Australia having their moments on Day I of the final Test, at the Chinnaswamy, the goodies were almost evenly spread.         
	The advantage would have been with Australia had they crossed the confidence-lifting 300 with half (or more) of their wickets intact. But by being 285 for five when play was called off, with 4.1 overs remaining, they allowed the hosts to put their feet up pretty khush.         
	At the end of the day, hummen kaafi khushi rahi... The way Australia started, it seemed they would definitely reach 300-350, is how vice-captain Virender Sehwag put it.         
	Sehwag was referring to the 99-run partnership between openers Shane Watson and Simon Katich. The opening hour, in fact, produced as many as 60 in 14 overs.         
	In setting the agenda, under a cloud cover, they did a fabulous job, but...         
	The tide turned after lunch, when Katich (43), Watson (57 in 149 minutes, off 88 balls, 9x4) and vice-captain Michael Clarke (only 14) fell in quick succession.         
	Captain Ricky Ponting and the one-time Mr Cricket, Michael Hussey, arrested the slide, but were consumed in the final session which went six minutes over the scheduled close.         
	The 66-run partnership between Ponting (77 in 204 minutes, off 147 deliveries, 12x4) and Hussey (34) ensured that Australia, 0-1 down, have something to fight with.         
	Unless the visitors draw the Airtel series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, they will slide further, to No.5, in the ICC rankings.         
	With the Ashes not far away, nothing would please the old enemy, England, more.         
	Of the five batsmen to get out, some were beaten by the turn, while Ponting paid the price for perhaps underestimating part-time spinner Suresh Raina.         
	Six years ago, Clarke scored a hundred here on his Test debut. Then, three years ago, he registered an ODI hundred. Both were very fine knocks. On Saturday, though, he lasted 26 minutes and 26 balls.         
	Watson, a hundred-getter in the first Test, in Mohali, described the wicket as beautiful, but Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha often got considerable turn.         
	Harbhajan, who injured his left thumb before tea and had to go off for repairs, took two wickets. Ojha, Zaheer Khan and Raina picked up one each. For Raina, it was a first and a big wicket at that.         
	The cherry didnt exactly reverse, but the conventional swing was there.         
	India have to bat last, yes, but Australias sole specialist spinner  Nathan Hauritz  is not the most menacing around.         
	Quite relieved must be Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who lost yet another toss and helped set an unusual record. Had Australia got to 300 and beyond, the heat would have been on India.         
	India, incidentally, began with three changes in the Mohali XI.         
	That Murali Vijay and Sreesanth would be playing in place of Gautam Gambhir and Ishant Sharma, respectively, was known. V.V.S. Laxman, too, had to sit out after he woke up with stiffness in the back.         
	As a result, Cheteshwar Pujara gained, earning his maiden cap. Its a good feeling, he said, in the evening, declining to speak at length as there were instructions to not interact with the media.         
	I underwent a fitness test at the ground, did some running, but the stiffness was a problem... Ive been informed that Ill be fit in about two weeks, Laxman told The Telegraph.         
	What worried the think tank is that even a substitute fielder may have been refused had Laxman played and been forced to come off.         
	Moreover, Ponting had already declared that, if the need arose, he would not agree to a runner being assigned to the Mohali hero. From Australias perspective, the warning had the desired effect.         
	Call it psychological warfare or whatever, but Ponting got it right.         
	The bottomline is that its risky to play someone who has a back problem... Everything was taken into account before the toss, maintained a member of the think tank.         
	At stumps, Marcus North and Tim Paine were at the crease. On them, almost wholly, rest Australias hopes of trying to force the issue.         
	They do not have an enviable job.         
	Dhoni and the rest were not happy when play was called off, with Sehwag revealing that the umpires (Billy Bowden, Ian Gould) had been asked to be consistent in determining the light situation.         
	However, its the BCCI which has to be blamed for not agreeing to the use of floodlights if the conditions so warranted. Australia would have been game.         
	The issue of inconsistency would not have arisen as Mohali is also blessed with floodlights. Surely, the BCCI has to be progressive in its responses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Give them fair chance: Imran
                                                                                                                       7                                      Give them fair chance: Imran
                      
	Karachi: Imran Khan pleaded for the cricketers accused in the spot-fixing controversy in England to be given a fair chance to clear their names, but said if the allegations came out true it would be a big setback.         
	I think the initial impact of this new fixing scandal has shocked all of us. But I think, in all fairness, it would be injustice to brand these players as fixers without first giving them a fair chance to defend themselves, Imran said.         
	I would like to see them given a fair chance to give their side of the story before we reach conclusions, the former cricketer-turned-politician said.         
	Imran was also clear that if the players were found guilty of accepting bribes then they should not be spared and given strong punishment. But first lets be clear about this whole thing because it is not fair to jump to conclusions.         
	Imran had no doubt that if the allegations against the players were proved true it would be a great tragedy for Pakistan cricket. It would be a big setback because we will lose many of our match winners and that definitely would be a big shock to our cricket, he added.         
	The former captain, who led Pakistan to victory in the 1992 World Cup, also feared that if there was truth in the fresh fixing allegations it would have a negative impact on cricket.         
	It would be difficult to draw in crowds and make people believe it was a fair match being played anywhere in the world, he said.         
	Khan said the sport was headed for crisis with the careers of top players in jeopardy over their alleged involvement in a gambling scam.         
	The scandal has cast a pall over the national sport, which has been dogged by fixing allegations since the 1990s as well as charges of ball-tampering.         
	I hope that its not true, Khan said. If, God forbid, it turns out to be true then it will be the biggest setback for Pakistan cricket and, probably, end the careers of the two best bowlers in the world, he said.         
	To me Aamer is potentially the best young talent in the world and I feel sad for him.         
	Butt obviously looked like a bright captain, and if he is ousted then it will create another captaincy crisis for the team, said Khan.           (AGENCIES)

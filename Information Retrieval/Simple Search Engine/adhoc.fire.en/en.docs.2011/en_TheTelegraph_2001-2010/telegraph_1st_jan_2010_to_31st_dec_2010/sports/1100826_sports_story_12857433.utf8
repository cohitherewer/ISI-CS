The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL hit by fresh controversy
                                                                                                                       7                                      IPL hit by fresh controversy
                      
	New Delhi: After being rocked by charges of financial irregularities, the Indian Premier League was Wednesday hit by a fresh controversy with a report claiming that the players auction in 2009 was fixed.         
	According to a news channel, Chennai Super Kings owner and BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan and suspended IPL chairman Lalit Modi could have been involved in ensuring specific players for the Chennai franchise. The Chennai franchise, owned by India Cements, has denied any wrongdoing and said all these reports were deliberate attempt to tarnish Chennai Super Kings and India Cements image.         
	The report, which quoted emails exchanged between Modi and Srinivasan, also raised questions over the authenticity of the auction that took place in 2009 as it was learnt that Srinivasan tried to fix the bid of former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff in his favour.         
	The channel quoted an email purportedly written by Modi to Srinivasan, which read what a nightmare to convince them not to terminate (Sohail) Tanvir and also not to take Flintoff. Warne went off the handle. But have managed it by using stick and carrot strategy. Thus they have $1.875m. Much loved Lalit.         
	It said two days later Flintoff was bought by Chennai Super Kings for a whopping $1.55m, making him IPLs most expensive player. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Shivendra ban reduced

  - India striker available against England on Saturday after FIH ruling       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Shivendra Singh rejoices with a teammate after scoring against Pakistan during Indias opening match in the World Cup                                 
	New Delhi: Suspended Indian hockey star Shivendra Singh had some respite on Tuesday as the jury of appeal of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) decided to reduce his ban in the ongoing World Cup to two matches.         
	The striker, who was earlier banned for three matches by the tournament director, Ken Read of Australia, for deliberately hitting Pakistan midfielder Fareed Ahmed, will now miss Indias next match against Spain.         
	He has already missed the tie versus Australia. He is eligible to play against England on March 6 (Saturday).         
	Pakistan coach Shahid Ali Khan came up with an adverse reaction, saying: Shivendras foul was definitely deliberate. Had the tournament been held outside India, his punishment would have been more severe.         
	While a section of the Indian hockey fraternity alleged Shivendras ban is a conspiracy to weaken the hosts campaign in the World Cup, the appeal jury, comprising Antonia von Ondarza (Venezuela), Hari Kant (Canada) and Johan Wakkie (the Netherlands), concluded that Shivendras action of raising his stick was reckless, but not deliberate.         
	The jury also considered that it constituted physical assault as referenced in the FIH Code of Conduct Guidelines of Offences and Penalties. Stating that it was a Level 2 offence, the jury said it required the minimum penalty of a two-match suspension.         
	The FIH communication manager, Arjen Merjer, dismissed any suggestion that Reads decision was biased, and said: We have the best teams here and we have the best tournament director also.         
	Read is an experienced official, who did duty at the last World Cup as well as the Beijing Olympic Games. I can assure you had the player been an Australian, he would have taken the same decision.         
	We do not like to suspend players; we are here for friendship and fair play. But this case warranted punishment and if any team has any grievances, it can always appeal.         
	That is why we have the appeal jury in place. They can overturn a decision if they find it wrong. In this case, the jury found that while Shivendras action was reckless, it wasnt deliberate.         
	Still it is a Level 2 offence, and that is why he has been suspended for two matches, the FIH official said.         
	Some of Indias former captains like Aslam Sher Khan and Zafar Iqbal criticised the FIH decision, saying it was too harsh.         
	It was a very harsh decision and I dont know on what basis they had given it. There was hardly any protest by the Pakistani players, Zafar said.         
	We, Asian countries, always have to go thorough such incidents, there is no doubt about it. They always think that we deliberately do it.         
	Aslam Sher Khan felt it was a deliberate act to down Indias morale ahead of the match against Australia.

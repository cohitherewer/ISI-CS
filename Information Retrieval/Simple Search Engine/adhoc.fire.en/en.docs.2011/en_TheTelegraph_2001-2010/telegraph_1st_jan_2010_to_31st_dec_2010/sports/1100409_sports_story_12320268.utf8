                                                                                                                       7                                      Iqbal happy with show
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Iqbal Abdullah has been patiently waiting in the wings for the past three seasons. Wednesdays match against the Delhi DareDevils was the 20-year-old left-arm spinners third match for the Kolkata Knight Riders in as many seasons.         
	His performance may not have set the stage on fire but his one for 28 and a crucial run out (Rajat Bhatia) off his own bowling would have certainly made his captain proud.         
	Im happy that I have been able to make some contribution in my teams victory, the former India colts spinner told The Telegraph on Thursday, before leaving for Bangalore.         
	Asked about the pressure on him before Wednesdays match, considering he was replacing senior pro Murali Kartik, who was ruled out due to injury, the youngster replied: At this level, if you think of pressure, you cant perform. Murali bhai is a fantastic bowler. He has bowled really well in the tournament. My job was to ensure that I can keep up the same level of intensity. I had to make sure that I dont let my captain down. Before yesterdays match, I had a played a match where I gave only 12 runs in my two overs. So in a way, I was confident that I wouldnt do badly.         
	Is it frustrating that he has played only three matches in three seasons?         
	Cant help it. Jiske naseeb mein jitney matches khelna likhaa hoga, woh utnahi khelega. Murali bhai is our No.1 spinner. So definitely, I have to wait for my turn. There is no question of frustration. The key to success is working hard and being ready for the opportunities.

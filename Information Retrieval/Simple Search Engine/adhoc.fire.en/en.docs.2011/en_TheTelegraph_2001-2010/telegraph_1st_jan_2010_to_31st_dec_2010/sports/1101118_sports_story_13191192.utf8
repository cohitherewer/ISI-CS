    - A Telegraph EXCLUSIVE 
  - Ravi Shastri on the current India-NZ series and more             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                      Picture by Santosh Ghosh      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Ravi Shastri, in town as a brand ambassador for Audi, which has a stake in FC Bayern Munich, spoke to The Telegraph on Wednesday afternoon.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Have we underestimated New Zealand?         
	A I wouldnt say so... In fact, Id give New Zealand credit for applying themselves so well... Theyve surprised us, yes, with the way theyve played... Most impressive has been how their batsmen have tackled our spinners... Theyve played with soft hands, been patient and executed the waiting game so well... As a team, after the 0-4 thrashing (in the ODIs) in Bangladesh, theyve lifted themselves up superbly.         
	What has made the biggest difference for New Zealand?         
	Application... Look at the way Brendon McCullum, a natural strokemaker, played in the second innings in Hyderabad... He gave respect to the situation and his 225 helped save the Test for New Zealand... Its not easy to bat for over nine hours anywhere, let alone in the subcontinent, yet McCullum did so... He just didnt allow India to build on their 122-run lead. It was a remarkable innings.         
	With the series 0-0, what should India do in the decider, in Nagpur, from Saturday?         
	Look at playing five specialist bowlers... Zaheer Khan is unfit, so the attack could feature Sreesanth, Ishant Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra and Pragyan Ojha... With Mahendra Singh Dhoni at No.7 and Harbhajan, who now has hundreds in consecutive Test innings, at No.8, the think-tank must seriously look at five bowlers... Not in the first Test in South Africa, but most definitely in the last Test of the ongoing series. The No.1 Test team should have this flexibility... Pick horses for courses. (After a pause) Dont forget that each of our first five batsmen has an average of at least 47. Which other line-up has such phenomenal figures?         
	Harbhajans batting...         
	(Grins) Unbelievable... At the start of the series, who couldve predicted that hed be heading Indias averages (147.50; 295 runs) after the first two Tests? Harbhajans got so much talent and, now that hes smelt the coffee, hes going to look for more big scores... Hell be hungry... Today, hes got the confidence to go beyond the 40s and 50s... Imagine the difference Harbhajan can make if he contributes 50s in the upcoming Test series in South Africa.         
	But isnt our bowling cupboard rather bare, especially where spinners are concerned?         
	I agree theres too much reliance on Zaheer... The key, really, is to rotate bowlers and take some of the pressure off Zaheer... The three spinners in the squad, currently, are the best weve got. Im happy with them.         
	Gautam Gambhir finally got back among the runs (54 in the first innings), in Hyderabad...         
	Im glad he did, for he and Virender Sehwag have changed the dynamics of Indias batting... One is a right-hander, the other (Gambhir) a leftie... Thats good for the team and they do complement each other... Youve got to remember Gambhir has come off injuries and quickly regaining rhythm isnt easy.         
	Your take on the Fab Three  Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S.Laxman?         
	Theyre ageless... Just look at the way Laxman has been batting over the past few months... In Sri Lanka, against Australia, versus New Zealand now... Hes been sublime.         
	With the focus on 50 Test hundreds, is Sachin getting weighed down by expectations?         
	Sachin doesnt have a choice, for people will talk about the impending 50th hundred... He cant escape there... It would, in the circumstances, be best for him to get it quickly and move on.         
	Your thoughts on Dhoni as captain...         
	Hes been doing an excellent job.         
	Are you, then, endorsing his field placements?         
	Well, there have been occasions when batsmen have been given too much respect too soon in their innings... Dhoni has been getting defensive, but look at the pitches... Theyve been flat... Such pitches dont help.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten appears to be the most popular man in the India dressing room...         
	Garys made it a happy dressing room... Hes not an in-the-face type, but does his work in the background... He gives the players space and, by all accounts, has made a huge difference. Garys the calm type, uncomplicated.         
	What would be your message to Yuvraj Singh?         
	Keep at it, get big scores in domestic cricket... Given how talented he is, Yuvraj has no reason to be disheartened. Hes really big on talent... He must not lose hope and show that he doesnt lack dedication... Suresh Raina got his chance in Sri Lanka and made the most, then Cheteshwar Pujara, too, made full use of the opportunity in Bangalore (against Australia)... As Ive said, Yuvraj must keep at it.         
	Like you, he has the image of a playboy...         
	Friend, my playboy image didnt get me 11 Test hundreds and 151 Test wickets... I had to work hard for those runs and wickets... As far as I know, only four others (Sir Garry Sobers, Sir Ian Botham, Carl Hooper and Jacques Kallis) have at least 10 Test hundreds and 150 Test wickets... The image may, of course, have got me a few things off the field!         
	Today, which teams would you pick as the top four going into World Cup 2011?         
	India, Sri Lanka, Australia and either Pakistan or South Africa.         
	The final one... Anil Kumble, Jawagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad are among those contesting the KSCA elections, on Sunday... Generally, shouldnt we be seeing more and more former cricketers getting into administration?         
	Look, its good for cricketers to be involved in administration, but not necessarily be administrators themselves. For administration, a different mindset is required... Its a different ball game.         
	Footnote: The Audi 100 CD presented to Shastri when he was adjudged Champion of Champions, 25 years ago, is going to get a makeover in 2011. The needful will be done by the manufacturer.

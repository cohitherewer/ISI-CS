                  Manpreet Singh with his Asian Games silver medal                     
	New Delhi: A first-round defeat in the Commonwealth Games (CWG) hit him so badly that Indian boxer Manpreet Singh lost the will to continue before psychiatric sessions at NIS Patiala revived his confidence and guided him to a silver medal at the just-concluded Asian Games.         
	The imposing heavyweight (91kg) boxer, who returned from Guangzhou with the rest of the team on Sunday, lost in the very first round of the CWG after being handed a couple of warnings and so shattering was the setback, that it took a psychiatrist to lift him.         
	I was so disappointed that I did not stop crying for days. My confidence had been shaken to such an extent that I could only think negative. Then my coaches took me to the NIS psychiatrist, who first took a test in which all my negativity came out. It was a cleansing experience, the 23-year-old said.         
	Then I was asked to close my eyes and think of all the good things that have happened to me. During the sessions, I was asked to take a long breath and say it aloud that I am going to win a gold medal. It lifted my morale, added the former wrestler.         
	The result was that I took a nothing-to-lose approach in the Asian Games and fought with a calm mind, which helped me achieve what I have achieved.         
	Manpreet defeated a Chinese and a Tajik boxer to enter the finals where he lost to a Syrian after fighting with an injured hand.         
	His coaches also recalled the tough time they had in getting Manpreet to believe in himself just a month ahead of the Asian Games.         
	He is an emotional boy So, he took the CWG loss very badly. The entire support staff had to get behind him and make him start thinking positive again, said C. Ramanand, one of the four coaches who accompanied the team.           (PTI)

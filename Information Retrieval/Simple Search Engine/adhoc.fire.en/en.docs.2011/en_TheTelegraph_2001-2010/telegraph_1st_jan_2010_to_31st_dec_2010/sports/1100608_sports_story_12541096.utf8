The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor-made victory for Zimbabwe
                                                                                                                       7                                      Taylor-made victory for Zimbabwe
                      
	Harare: Continuing their giant-killing spree, hosts Zimbabwe rode on Brendan Taylors second ODI ton to pull-off a spectacular eight-wicket win over Sri Lanka in an inconsequential match of the Micromax Cup here on Monday.         
	With both the teams having already made it to the summit clash, Mondays match was of merely academic interest but Zimbabwe proved that their back-to-back wins against India was no fluke as they upstaged Sri Lanka in the dress-rehearsal for Wednesdays final.         
	Sri Lanka could not make the most of a flying start and folded for 236 inside 48 overs.         
	With Taylor (119 not out) extending his sensational form in the tournament, Zimbabwe cruised to 240 for two in 47.5 overs to clinch the match.

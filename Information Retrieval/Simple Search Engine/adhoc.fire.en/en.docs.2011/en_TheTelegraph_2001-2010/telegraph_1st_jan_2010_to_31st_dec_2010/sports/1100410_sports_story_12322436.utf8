The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan face Salgaocar
                                                                                                                       7                                        Bagan face Salgaocar
            A STAFF REPORTER            Bencharifa                           
	Calcutta: Just the other day, Jose Mourinhos return to Chelsea as the Inter Milan coach grabbed the headlines world over.         
	On Saturday, it will be a somewhat identical situation for Salgaocar coach Karim Bencharifa, when his side take on Mohun Bagan in an I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	It will be an emotional encounter for Bencharifa, who was the in charge of the green and maroon brigade in not too distant past. And it will look almost weird when he will be busy plotting the downfall of a team which he had painstakingly built this season, and with whom he had dreamt of winning the I-League.         
	Biswajit Bhattacharya, the new Bagan coach, has a mountain to climb. Thrust into the thick of action in the middle of the season, Biswajit has, ahead of him, the Herculean task of not just lifting the teams sagging performance graph, but also giving a facelift to the plunging morale of the star-studded side.         
	With the likes of Jose Barreto, Edeh Chidi, Marcos and Ryuji Sueoka in the team, its crime if the team fail to get past even the mediocre hurdles posed by the CFL teams. Unfortunately, that has been the case of late.

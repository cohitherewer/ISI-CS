            A STAFF REPORTER            Edmilson                           
	Calcutta: Two goals, a red card and two close calls  that sums up the Chirag United versus Pune FC I-League clash at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday.         
	The 1-1 result kept both the teams stationary at their positions in the points tally. While Chirag are placed third, the Pune side, thanks to their brilliant run in the second phase of the league, are on fifth spot.         
	The home sides hopes of garnering full points received a blow when, in the 23rd minute, goalkeeper Sandip Nandy needlessly invited the red card for handling of the ball outside the box.         
	Till then, the scales were tilted in Chirags favour via the 18th-minute strike by Edmilson.         
	An opportunistic Pune FC restored parity in 35th minute when Jeje Lalpekhula pushed in from close.         
	Teams         
	Chirag United: Sandip Nandy, R Dhanarajan, Kingshuk Debnath, Eduardo, Sukhen Dey, Gauranga Dutta, Jayanta Sen, Denson Devadas, Ashim Biswas (Somnath Khara, 23 rd), Edmilson, Joshimar

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Easy for Venus, Svetlana
                                                                                                                       7                                      Easy for Venus, Svetlana
    - Latvian dark horse Gulbis retires hurt on opening day                           
	Paris: Dazzling blue skies and soaring temperatures greeted the hordes of spectators snaking towards Roland Garros on Sunday as the first of 15 days of sporting theatre served up some tasty appetisers for the drama to come.         
	The wine corks were already popping in the chic bars sprinkled across this leafy quadrant of Parisian real estate as womens defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova walked out on Philippe Chatrier Court, and after a groggy start she reached the second round with plenty of time to shower for lunch.         
	Kuznetsovas form has been terrible this season, particularly on clay, but after losing the first three games to Romanian Sorana Cirstea she eased through 6-3, 6-1.         
	I knew this moment had to pass because I deserve better than that, and I worked harder than these results.         
	I was just concerned about when it was going to pass, Kuznetsova, who had managed just one claycourt win this season, told reporters.         
	Venus Williams has won her opening match at the French Open by beating Patty Schnyder 6-3, 6-3.         
	Venus victory on Sunday was no surprise coming against an opponent who fell to 0-11 versus the seven-time Grand Slam champion.         
	But Venus movement boded well for her matches to come. She attacked aggressively and scrambled after balls, often extending points until Schnyder would blow an easy shot.         
	In another encouraging sign for Venus fans, she played with neither of her often-troublesome knees wrapped. Tricky footing has always made clay Venus worst surface. In 13 previous French Open appearances, she reached the semi-finals only once  when she lost to sister Serena in the 2002 final.         
	The second major of the year is unique with its Sunday start and with a slimmed down schedule and no Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal in action the opening day has the feel of a light entree before the beefy action to come over the next fortnight.         
	That does not stop the crowds, nor the vocal ticket touts, flocking towards a venue which, while beginning to show its age with its dated concrete structures, still ranks as one of the most appealing places to watch tennis.         
	There was plenty of French interest on the menu for home fans although those opting for one extra glass of chilled wine would have missed wildcard Laurent Recoudercs predictable demolition by last years mens runner-up Robin Soderling.         
	The Swedes brutal forehand, which bludgeoned Nadal to a first ever Roland Garros defeat last year, was far too hot for the 25-year-old journeyman who lost the first nine games before eking a modicum of self-respect in a 6-0, 6-2, 6-3 loss.         
	Soderling, the fifth seed, walloped 46 winners, leaving Recouderc swishing at air and threatening to wreak havoc with the beautifully-arranged geraniums lining the rectangle of sun-blasted red clay.         
	Its always nice to have a quick match in the early rounds. I got to hit a few balls. We had a few rallies, so it was a good match, the quietly spoken Swede, whose sensational run last year was ended by Federer in the final, told reporters.         
	There was better news for French hopes in the match that followed.         
	Aravane Rezai, who beat Justine Henin, Jelena Jankovic and Venus to the win the Madrid title last week, crushed Canadas Heidi El Tabakh 6-1, 6-1 with a dazzling display that matched an outfit featuring golden go-faster stripes.         
	Latvian dark horse Ernests Gulbis was the days first surprise casualty, the 23rd seed damaging a hamstring while doing the splits against Frenchman Julien Benneteau and retiring at two sets down.         
	There were no such worries for Croatias Marin Cilic, the 10th seed, who beat Brazils Ricardo Mello 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1.           (AGENCIES)

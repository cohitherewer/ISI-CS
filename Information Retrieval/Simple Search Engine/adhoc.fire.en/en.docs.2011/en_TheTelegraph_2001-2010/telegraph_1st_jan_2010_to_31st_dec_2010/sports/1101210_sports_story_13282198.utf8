The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A new lift for players in Cup?
                                                                                                                       7                                        A new lift for players in Cup?
            A STAFF REPORTER            Andy Atkinson at the Eden, on Thursday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: Calcutta Police have come up with an unique proposal to ensure the players safety during the 2011 World Cup matches in the city  using choppers as the mode of transport!         
	The idea was mooted by the Calcutta Police after the 27-member International Cricket Council (ICC) delegation, that came to inspect the Eden on Thursday, wanted a dedicated traffic lane for teams and delegates during the matches.         
	The ICC officials wanted an uninterrupted route for the players from the airport till the team hotel. So, they had proposed for a separate lane only for the movement of the players. But we have told them that this was not possible in Calcutta. Instead, we proposed that if the ICC wanted, the players can be airlifted, a senior IPS officer, present in the meeting, said on Thursday.         
	A dedicated lane for athletes and delegates was used during the Delhi Commonwealth Games. But it is impractical to have the same in Calcutta as the lanes here are much narrower than in Delhi.         
	Though the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) joint secretary Biswarup Dey said the ICC is yet to take a call on the issue, sources revealed that the proposal to airlift players was not feasible as well. The airlifting process would be costly and it would be difficult to arrange so many choppers to carry the players and their baggage, he said.                   
	Jawed Shamim, joint commissioner of police (headquarters), said: It was the first co-ordination meeting and nothing has been finalised yet. Security of the players would be our prime concern and there would be huge deployments to ensure that.         
	Meanwhile, the CAB got a 15-day extension to finish the renovation work at the Eden, one of the eight World Cup venues in India.         
	The central organising committee, at its October 6 meeting in Bangalore, had decided that December 31 would be the deadline for completion of construction work and playing facilities at all venues. The CAB will now have to finish the reconstruction work by January 15.         
	The delegation expressed their happiness with the facilities especially with the refurbished players dressing room. They (ICC officials) are impressed with the dressing room, especially after what they had seen in January earlier this year. They are happy to see the ground, the wicket and the practice facility. But the stadium work should be completed within January 15, Dey said.         
	Amongst other proposals, the officials have asked for two giant-screens to be installed and that the sightscreen at the club house end to be raised by one-and-a-half feet. The CAB has also been told to keep an option for cultural programmes during recess at the matches.         
	The ICC delegation carried out the inspection in eight groups  construction, security, cricket operations, curator, media, broadcast, accreditation and sponsors.         
	However, Dey informed that another ICC team, with lesser number of officials, might come for a final inspection around January 15.

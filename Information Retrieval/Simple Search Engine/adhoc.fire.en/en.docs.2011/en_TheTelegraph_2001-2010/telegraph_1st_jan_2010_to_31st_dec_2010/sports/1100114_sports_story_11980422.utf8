The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | We wont be pushovers, promises Bangla captain
                                                                                                                       7                                        We wont be pushovers, promises Bangla captain
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR            Shakib-al Hasan                           
	Dhaka: Shakib-al Hasan believes Bangladesh will be no pushovers in the forthcoming Test series against India, and have the ability to spring a surprise or two.         
	That the No.1 team in Test cricket have got their best players for the series against us proves that they arent taking us lightly. I can assure you, we wont be pushovers, the stand-in captain told The Telegraph Wednesday.         
	They could have easily tried out some of their new guys, but they decided against it. We may still be nowhere near India in terms of strength, but weve improved and matured a lot during the last two years, explained the stand-in captain.         
	The first Test begins in Chittagong Sunday.         
	We may still be a long way from attaining full potential but these youngsters have the ability to trouble most top sides. These players are not afraid to fight it out against the opposition.         
	Shakib agreed that the pace bowling department has been weakened significantly after regular captain Mashrafe Mortaza pulled out with injury. The spinners, thus, will hold the key.         
	Yes, Mortazas unavailability will be a handicap, he said. But it will also mean a golden opportunity for the younger lot. The spinners, too, will have a key role to play.         
	What is Bangladeshs target in the two-match series? We havent got the time to discuss such issues, but the obvious thing will be avoiding defeat. For us, a draw will be equivalent to a win, the captain said.         
	Bangladesh achieved their first overseas series win against the West Indies under his leadership last year, and Shakib feels, that is a landmark in their progress. The top players may have been missing from the West Indies ranks but that series gave us the confidence and the belief Weve just got to carry it forward.         
	A top-ranked all-rounder in the International Cricket Councils rankings, Shakib sees a big responsibility on his shoulders.         
	Spin will be our strength, and I will have to lead by example. If we decide to play another spinner, the responsibility can be shared, but Ill have to play my role to perfection.         
	There should be no slip up in batting since that will decide our fate. Previously, weve seen that only one/two batsmen perform and the rest falter. It has to be an all-round effort if were to do well, Shakib said.         
	It remains to be seen how much of a challenge Bangladesh can pose to India.

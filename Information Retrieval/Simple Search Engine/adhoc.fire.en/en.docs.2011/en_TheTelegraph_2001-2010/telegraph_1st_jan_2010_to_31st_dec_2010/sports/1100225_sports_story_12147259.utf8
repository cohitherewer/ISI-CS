The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | This is not the end of me: Brett Lee
                                                                                                                       7                                        This is not the end of me: Brett Lee
            A STAFF REPORTER AMP; AGENCIES            Brett Lee at the SCG, on Wednesday                           
	Calcutta/Sydney: One of the worlds most feared fast bowlers, Brett Lee Wednesday announced his retirement from Test cricket after battling numerous injuries in the last 14 months.         
	Announcing his decision to walk into Test sunset at the SCG, 33-year-old Lee said he was retiring from the longer format to concentrate on ODIs and Twenty20s and spend more time with his family.         
	I am extremely proud to have played Test cricket for Australia. My reason for retiring from this form of the game is so that I can preserve my body and continue to represent my country in the other forms of the game, Lee told a press conference in Sydney.         
	This is not the end of me. Its a cricket choice and its a lifestyle choice, Lee, affectionately called Binga by his team-mates, said.         
	Lee said the highlight of his career was taking his first Test wicket in Melbourne against India in 1999  when he clean bowled Sadagopan Ramesh. I couldve hung up the boots just then, he said.         
	He sent down a 160.8km/hour thunderbolt in 2005, which remains the fastest ever delivery bowled by an Australian and second fastest overall behind Shoaib Akhtar (161.3km/hr).         
	Cricket Australia chief executive officer James Sutherland paid tribute to Lee and his outstanding efforts for the Australian Test team over the last 10 years.         
	Bretts had a fantastic career in Test cricket for Australia over a long period and I take this opportunity to congratulate him on the way he has represented his country and the outstanding contribution he has made, Sutherland said in a release.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Unlucky Chirag bow out
                                                                                                                       7                                      Unlucky Chirag bow out
                      
	Vasco: Churchill Brothers survived a -half scare to hold Chirag United to a goalless draw and enter the semifinals of the 32nd Federation Cup at the Tilak Maidan ground here Saturday.         
	Churchill and Chirag finished with five points each but the Goans qualified from Group B on a better goal difference.         
	Churchill will meet defending champions and Group A toppers East Bengal in the last four in Cuttack.         
	Chirag, who needed an outright win to make it to the next stage, put up an improved performance and held the upper hand, especially in the second half, as they created a handful of chances, but rival keeper Lalit Thapa was equal to the task.         
	He denied Josimar and Jerry Zirsangas efforts in each half to ensure his teams qualification.         
	But Chirag were a bit unlucky as referee Vishnu Chauhan didnt award the Calcutta outfit what seemed like a legitimate penalty after defender Rowilson Rodrigues handled the ball inside the box.         
	Chirag made a couple of chances in the second half as they introduced fresh pair of legs and pressed hard for the elusive goal.         
	They came close to take the lead midway through second half when a long punt from defender Chika Wali saw Mohammed Rafiques back-header going to an unmarked Gouranga Biswas. But Biswass weak attempt did not trouble Thapa.         
	With time running out, Chirag, went all out, but Thapa again came to his sides rescue. He dived to his left to deflect a a low shot from substitute Elijah Junior.         
	In Ludhiana, despite being held to a goalless draw by JCT, I-League winners Dempo managed to book a semi-final berth.         
	In the second match, ONGC, Mumbai, defeated AIFF- XI 2-1.         
	Striker Sandeep Sangha of ONGC opened the account in the 21st minute while Kailash Patel found the target immediately into the second half, to make it 2-0 for the Mumbai outfit.         
	Eleven minutes later, Jeje Lal Pekhlua of AIFF-XI struck to reduce the margin.

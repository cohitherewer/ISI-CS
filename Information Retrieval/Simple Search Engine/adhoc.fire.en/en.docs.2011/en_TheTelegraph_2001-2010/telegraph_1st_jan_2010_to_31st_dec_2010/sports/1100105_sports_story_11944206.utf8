The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No priced tickets in Test vs SA, too
                                                                                                                       7                                      No priced tickets in Test vs SA, too
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has decided that there will be no priced tickets during the February 14-18 India-South Africa second Test, and complimentary passes will be distributed instead, as was done during the India-Sri Lanka ODI.         
	Theres no point in changing what we did during the ODI. Its more or less impossible to make arrangements in order to add a few more seats in a space of just one-and-a-half months.         
	So, we have decided that we will be distributing complimentary passes, as we did last time.         
	With the current available seats, we wont be able to accommodate priced tickets, said a CAB official Monday.         
	However, he added: This has been decided tentatively and a final call will be taken in an emergent working committee meeting which will be held later this week.         
	But according to sources, the proposals acceptance at the working committee meeting is just a formality.         
	In a separate development, the CAB brass has also decided to hire the services of electrical circuit specialists in order to locate the reason behind the power fault during the December 24 ODI.         
	The CAB is not happy with the investigation into the power failure so far.

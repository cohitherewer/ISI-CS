                                                                                                                       7                                      Jeev Milkha faces an early exit
                      
	Clearwater: Jeev Milkha Singh faces an early exit from the PGA Transitions Championship after his poor opening round of three-over 74 placed him tied 105th in the $5.4 million golf tournament .         
	It was back nine blues for Jeev, a 10th tee starter, bogeyed the three of his first nine holes to find himself under pressure at the turn. Jeev parred the first four holes of his front nine before nailing his only birdie on the fifth hole. The next hole, however, cost him a shot and the Indian eventually signed off with a three-over card .         
	Garrett Willis, playing on sponsors exemption, fired six-under 65 to take the lead with defending champion Retief Goosen and former winner Carl Pettersson, along with four others, trailed him from two shots behind.

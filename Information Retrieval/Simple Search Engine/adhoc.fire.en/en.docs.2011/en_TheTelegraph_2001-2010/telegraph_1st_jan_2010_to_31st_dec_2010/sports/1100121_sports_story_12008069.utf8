The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Parting of ways amicable: Ricky
                                                                                                                       7                                      Parting of ways amicable: Ricky
                                Ricky Ponting       
	Melbourne: Ricky Ponting has described the parting of ways with the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) as amicable and has said that the decision allows him to focus full-time on regaining the Ashes and retaining the 2011 World Cup.         
	The consideration being the Australia skippers unavailability for the whole season, the IPL franchise bought out Pontings contract a day before the auction.         
	Principal owner Shah Rukh Khans franchise had paid $400,000 for Ponting in 2008 but after an indifferent first season, the second-highest Test run-getter absented himself for the entire second season of the T20 league.         
	It was an amicable process. I wanted to play for the Knight Riders but was only available for a handful of games. For the all the right reasons the Knight Riders are looking for players who will be available for most, if not all, of the tournament in the hope of gaining more consistency after a couple of lean seasons.         
	I fully understand and accept the situation. In the end it (agreeing to the buyout) was an easy decision because it leaves me totally focused on the Ashes next summer and the World Cup, Ponting told an Australian daily.         
	Sourav Ganguly, who will leadKKR in the third season, agreed with Ponting that the decision was an amicable one.         
	A player like Ricky is irreplaceable. We would not have done that if he were available for the whole league, he said.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Much depends on spinners: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Much depends on spinners: Dhoni
    - INCLEMENT WEATHER MAY SAVE SOUTH AFRICA AND HURT TEAM INDIA           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Calcutta: Having been at the receiving end in the first Test, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is looking to hand out the same treatment to South Africa, at the Eden.         
	Yes, Im feeling much better today than on the eve of this Test, Dhoni told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening, after Day III.         
	Dhoni led from the front during the day, remaining not out on 132, his third Test hundred of the season and third as captain.         
	In fact, Dhoni and V.V.S. Laxman (143 not out) added an India record of 259 runs, unseparated, for the seventh wicket.         
	Asked how soon he expected to wrap it up, Dhoni replied: Much, I suppose, will depend on how our spinners (Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra) bowl...         
	The declaration came with India 347 ahead. By stumps, called early, South Africa had reached six for no loss.         
	Actually, inadequate light (it did drop dramatically) defeated the very purpose of the declaration  to get a couple of wickets with a flat-out assault from Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma.         
	Instead of six overs, South Africa didnt face even one complete over.         
	Only a win will help India retain the No.1 ranking. Whats disconcerting, though, is that there could be thunder showers on Day IV, quite like the one very late on Tuesday.         
	A draw would be enough for South Africa to reclaim the top position, a shade over two months after losing it.         
	Its not clear whether former captain Kepler Wessels, now a member of the interim selection committee and batting coach on the tour, knew of the weather forecast, but he didnt concede much during his interaction with the media.         
	Later, speaking exclusively, Wessels said: Its not that Im alone in being confident (of saving the Test)... Theres confidence in the dressing room... Its a good wicket and the guys want to bat on it...         
	Weather permitting, that is.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Need to get little things right, says Jayawardene
                                                                                                                       7                                      Need to get little things right, says Jayawardene
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Kings XI Punjabs stand-in captain Mahela Jayawardene on Monday refused to concede that his team was out of the reckoning and insisted that getting little things right would put the side back in contention.         
	In T20s, it is about getting little things right. In the IPL, you need to win 50 per cent of those close games. We need some consecutive wins. The points table is still wide open, Mahela said on the eve of the clash against the Mumbai Indians at the Brabourne Stadium.         
	Mahela would be leading the side in place of his compatriot Kumar Sangakkara who has been banned for a match following his teams slow over-rate in the match against the Kolkata Knight Riders.         
	Kings XI coach Tom Moody said that the team should take a leaf out of their rivals if they wished for a turn around in their fortunes. Our game against the Rajasthan Royals was really the impetus to their positive momentum and impetus to our negative momentum. It is important to get on that positive momentum, the Australian said.         
	The thing that positive momentum gives you is to go out there and play without fearing failure. Last night (Sunday) Harbhajan gave the Mumbai Indians the total they felt would win them the match.         
	In a period of negative momentum they would have never got the total they have got and would have been bowled out for 130.         
	Punjab tried out with Yuvraj opening the batting but the move made little impact and, as Moody said, it got swept away by the wave of negative momentum.         
	Jayawardene denied there was any problem in the dressing room but acknowledged that the players needed to take more responsibility.         
	Honestly there is no disunity. We can pinpoint quiet a few places where it is going wrong but in a team environment it is all about momentum, he said. We had good starts at the top of the order, but none of us could continue... Guys are hitting the ball pretty well but are not taking the added responsibility.         
	Moody said that the team expected Shaun Marsh, set to come in place of Sangakkara, to brighten things up. Marsh is a top-order player. Anyone who has that responsibility at the top of the order needs to bat through the innings, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City face upbeat United
                                                                                                                       7                                      City face upbeat United
                      
	London: Manchester City may end up ruing the snow that saw the first leg of their League Cup semi-final against Manchester United postponed by two weeks until Tuesday.         
	Before a deep freeze gripped England, City was on a three-game winning streak without conceding, while United was reeling from an FA Cup humiliation against third-tier Leeds.         
	Now, though, United is back to winning ways in their Premier League title defence and has players returning from injury, while Roberto Mancini has experienced his first loss since taking charge of City a month ago.         
	The 2-0 defeat at Everton was a reality check for Mancini, who must quickly pick up his squad  including Saturdays substituted substitute Robinho. (AGENCIES)

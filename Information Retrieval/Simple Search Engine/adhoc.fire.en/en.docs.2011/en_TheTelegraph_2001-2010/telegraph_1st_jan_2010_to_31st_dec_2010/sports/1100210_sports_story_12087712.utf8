	Dhaka: Shooters Surendra Singh Rathod and Om Prakash and paddler Madhurika Patkar etched their names in the record books as India finished on top with 90 gold, 55 silver and 30 bronze medals to end their dominating journey in the 11th South Asian Games here Tuesday.

	Swimmers followed suit as they shattered 10 new meet records, including two each by Veerdhawal Khade and Sandeep Sejwal, en route to a share of 16-6-2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Modis second hearing today 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Modis second hearing today 
            OUR BUREAU                      
	The disciplinary committee of the BCCI is likely to reject Lalit Modis demand for the recusal of two of its members, Chirayu Amin and Arun Jaitley, at Tuesdays second hearing in New Delhi.         
	The Board has given its views on the matter. I dont know what exactly is said in the communication, but I dont think the panel is going to change, a BCCI source said on Monday. The three-member committee, Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia being the third, had, in its first hearing in Mumbai on July 16, asked the BCCI to give its views on the suspended IPL chairmans demand.         
	Modi, who was allowed to represent himself through lawyers, claimed that Amin, the interim IPL chairman, had reason to be biased against him since he had made public the latters interest in acquiring stake in one of the consortiums that made an unsuccessful bid for the Pune franchise.         
	Modi is expected to again stay away from the meeting. In the case of Jaitley, Modi said that the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association head was part of the IPL governing council which had approved the charges of irregularities against him and hence should not be on the disciplinary panel.         
	Earlier, the Bombay high court rejected Modis appeal for an independent panel comprising retired judges and also refused to quash his suspension from the BCCI and stop the disciplinary proceedings against him. Modi has also asked the disciplinary committee to provide him with minutes of meetings of the special general body and the IPL governing council held after his suspension. In an application to the disciplinary committee, Modi has also asked for a copy of the amended broadcast agreement between the board and Sony-MSM.         
	We have asked for some documents. These are crucial to the proceedings which are already underway as the disciplinary committee and the jurisdiction of the disciplinary committee flows from these documents, Modis legal counsel Mehmood Abdi said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | In-form Indians in for a test
                                                                                                                       7                                      In-form Indians in for a test

	Ahmedabad: For any team to beat Australia in Tests at home or away is a stuff of dreams. India s 2-0 whitewash of Ricky Pontings men to retain the Border-Gavaskar trophy was an appetiser before an action-packed season leading to the 2011 World Cup. And for those who want more reasons to celebrate this Diwali, here are some interesting facts to cheer about in the three-match India-New Zealand Test series for the Airtel Cup beginning here on Thursday.         
	Sachin Tendulkar is just one short of notching up his 50th Test hundred, Rahul Dravid needs 62 more runs to get to 5, 000 runs on home soil (Dravid has 4,938 runs at home, prior to the start of this series), only two more catches will make Dravid the first fieldsman in the annals of Test cricket to get to 200 catches, Daniel Vettori will be playing his 100th Test for New Zealand, and, finally, India will begin the series as worthy leaders in Test cricket with their ruthless mauling of Australia.         
	The hosts are much ahead in the rat race (read Test rankings), and while cricket aficionados will call the rankings a statistical contrivance to measure how India are better than the rest, the fact is, the expectations and demands of victory are more at home than playing abroad.         
	Though India are ready to field their best team against the Black Caps on Thursday, New Zealand will go into the first Test hoping to cash in on the pressure that surrounds MS Dhoni and his men to maintain their status quo at the top.         
	Not much has gone in New Zealand s favour recently, and, while the Daniel Vettori led side is smarting from a 4-0 ODI clean sweep at the hands of Bangladesh, the New Zealand skipper would certainly want to use the India series to get his side on track.         
	An outing in the subcontinent before the World Cup is the best preparation any team can ask for and Vettoris machinating brain must be already at work to get his combination right.         
	For India, of course, the good news is VVS Laxman, Ishant Sharma and Gautam Gambhir are back. The trio had missed the second Test against Australia in Bangalore owing to injuries and their return not only brings balance, but also adds experience to keep the juggernaut moving.         
	Both Laxman and Ishant had played a vital role in India s classic win at Mohali. While Laxman battled back spasms to play a valiant knock and bail India out, Ishant, who limped out with a knee injury, stitched together 81 invaluable runs with Laxman for a photo finish.         
	More importantly, the BCCIs rotation policy to avoid injuries before the World Cup has ensured that players picked for a series are fresh and enterprising. Cheteshwar Pujara, who made a memorable debut with a resolute 72 in the second innings at Bangalore, and Murali Vijay, who vindicated his selection with a hundred at the same venue, have earned the faith of the selectors.         
	In comparison, New Zealand have a problem of plenty. While skipper Vettoris primary duty would be to get the motivation back after their debacle in Bangladesh, it would be important how quickly the players change their gears to get into Test mode against tougher opponents. Much would depend on their batsmen like Brendon McCullum, Ross Taylor, Jesse Ryder and Tim McIntosh as the Motera wicket is notorious for dishing out drab draws.         
	For the record, New Zealand have not made a World Cup final but have been semi-finalists five times. Who knows, a win in this series could well be the tipping point in their crusade for next years world title.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Reina saves the day
                                                                                                                       7                                      Reina saves the day
                      
	London: Pepe Reina produced three excellent saves to help lethargic Liverpool earn a point from a goalless and somewhat predictable Premier League draw at Birmingham City on Sunday.         
	Reina, whose horrible blunder gifted Argentina a goal in Spains 1-4 midweek friendly defeat, produced a man-of-the-match performance in an otherwise forgettable display by Liverpool, who have won only one of their opening four league games.         
	Birmingham, unbeaten at home in the league for almost year and with two draws and a win to from their opening three games, were the more adventurous side throughout, buoyed by their good recent record against Liverpool.         
	The teams previous six league meetings had been draws and though Liverpool chalked up a 7-0 FA Cup win at St Andrews in 2006 their last league victory over Birmingham came six years ago.         
	Reina made his first fine save after 25 minutes, diving low to keep out a Cameron Jerome header. He reacted quickly to deny the same striker and produced a third terrific reaction stop to keep out Craig Gardners point-blank header late in the first half.         
	Birmingham missed another good chance early in the second half when woeful marking left Scott Dann free but his header bounced just over the bar.(REUTERS)

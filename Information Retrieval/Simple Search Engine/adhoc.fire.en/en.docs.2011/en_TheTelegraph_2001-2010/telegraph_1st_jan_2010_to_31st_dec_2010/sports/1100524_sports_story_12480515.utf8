	Shanghai: Olympic Champion Usain Bolt snatched victory in the 200 meters at the Diamond League meet in Shanghai on Sunday with a timing of 19.76s, his second win in as many races this season.         
	The reigning world champion over 100 and 200 meters was never tested, finishing out in relaxed style ahead of Americans Angelo Taylor, who finished in 20.34s, and Ryan Bailey with a time of 20.43s.         
	It was a good run. The feeling was good but it was not easy, Bolt said. I am not in the best of shape, but I enjoyed it.         
	The win builds on an excellent start to Bolts season that began with a years best 9.86s win in the 100 meters on Wednesday at Daegu in South Korea. Also in Shanghai, David Oliver of the United States ran a season-best 12.99s the way to victory in the 110 meter hurdles, leaving hometown hero and former world record holder Liu Xiang trailing in third (13.40s), just behind fellow Chinese Shi Dongpeng (13.39s).         
	 It was a pretty decent result, said Liu, who continues to fight a nagging Achilles tendon injury that forced him to dramatically withdraw from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games at the last minute.         
	I think its great that Im able to maintain this level, Liu said. Carmelita Jeter of the United States claimed victory in the womens 100m with a time of 11.09s, surging past Jamaicas Shelly-Ann Fraser (11.29s) and Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas (11.38s).         
	Jeremy Wariner won the mens 400 meters in a time of 45.41s, followed by fellow American David Neville (45.70) and Britains Michael Bingham (45.84s).         
	For the second race of the year it was pretty good, Wariner said. Janet Jepkosgei Busienei of Kenya claimed victory in the womens 800m in 2: 1.06s, with Britains Jennifer Meadows taking second (2:01.34s) and Kenia Sinclair of Jamaica in third (2:01.87s).         
	The Kenyan women took the first three slots in the 3,000m steeplechase, led by Gladys Jerotich Kipkemoi (9: 16.82s). Milcah Chemos Cheiywa (9:20.63s) and Lydia Jebet Rotich (9:21.38s) took second and third places.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Peoples vote for Gyan
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            Asamoah Gyan                           
	Durban: Asamoah Gyan should consider himself the luckiest footballer to play in the 2010 World Cup. While players around the world are generally castigated for missing penalty kicks in crucial matches, the Ghana striker has been rewarded for injury-time bungle against Uruguay.         
	Ghana had an opportunity to become the first African team to make the semi-finals but Gyan broke the hearts of millions of fans on that fateful Friday night.         
	Even against Uruguay, after missing the penalty in extra time, he went ahead to successfully convert Ghanas first spot kick during the shoot out. Gyan has already said that he is ready to bounce back. I will bounce back, Im strong mentally. I had the courage to take the penalty, but thats normal, Im the penalty taker, he said.         
	The fans, however, appear to have forgiven Gyan for his mistake. The Black Star forward has been voted the best African player of the ongoing World Cup, in a poll conducted by Fifa.         
	Ghanaian goalkeeper Richard Kingson was voted the second best African player.         
	He is followed by playmaker Kevin-Prince Boateng.         
	Even the former South African president, Nelson Mandela has sent Gyan a message after his penalty miss, urging him to remain focussed and reminding him that he has performed brilliantly in the tournament.

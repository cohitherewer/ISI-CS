The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Respect our sentiments, sports ministry tells IOC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Respect our sentiments, sports ministry tells IOC
                      
	New Delhi: Determined to go ahead with the regulation to limit the tenure of sports bosses, the union sports ministry on Wednesday requested International Olympic Committee (IOC) to respect Indias national sentiments and help the government give the country a better deal.         
	The ministry on Wednesday shot off a letter to IOC president Jacques Rogge, explaining why it was necessary to implement the guideline that limits the tenure of the National Sports Federation (NSF) presidents to 12 years.         
	We urge you, to respect our national concerns and sentiments, and assist us, in giving Indian sports, a better deal, in the 21st century, the ministry said.         
	The request was made soon after receiving a letter from IOC that warned the government to take measures against India if the ministry went ahead with the regulation         
	In a letter to sports minister MS Gill, IOC National Olympic Committee relations director Pere Miro welcomed the governments proposal for a dialogue but said the regulation should not be implemented till then.         
	In order to further discuss these issues openly and resolve this matter amicably, we would be very pleased to accept your proposal and to organise a meeting as soon as possible in Lausanne, Miro wrote, saying he was instructed by Rogge to write on his behalf.         
	Nevertheless, until this dialogue is established, it is our understanding that the guidelines which you have issued will not be imposed in a mandatory manner on the organisations of the Olympic Movement in India. Otherwise, we would unfortunately be obliged to consider the protective measures provided for in the Olympic Charter, the IOC official warned.         
	The implementation would mean Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi and various NSF chiefs who have been ruling for more than a decade would have to vacate their posts.         
	Pointing out that IOC itself had changed rules in 1999 in order to have a reasonable age limit of 70 years, a maximum presidential term of 12 years and an office bearers term of 8 years to be followed by a break the ministry wondered why National Olympic Committees (NOC) like IOA were not made to follow the same.         
	Surely, the IOC, while not directing, could in the interest of world sports and the good management of NOCs advise them to consider the IOCs practice, it said.         
	You have indicated that the sole interest you have is to let them function as they may, elect as they will and the national governments or the courts of the countries should not restrain them or guide them. This is a very strange position, the ministry said.         
	Lauding IOCs effort to make a drug-free sports world, the ministry wondered how the governing body could ignore something as significant as clean elections in various NOCs.         
	We are surprised that in such a fundamental matter as good democracy and clean elections in the NOCs, you do not wish to take any position except to say that no matter how unacceptable the situation, the national authorities or courts of the country are not to look their way, it said.

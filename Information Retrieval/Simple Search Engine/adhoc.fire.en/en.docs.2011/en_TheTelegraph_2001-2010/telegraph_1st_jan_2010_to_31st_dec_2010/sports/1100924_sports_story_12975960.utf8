            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Indian athletes get ready to shift to the Games Village in New Delhi, on Thursday. (PTI)    
	New Delhi: Even as Delhi awaits the arrival of the first batch of foreign athletes for the Commonwealth Games on Friday morning, the cleanliness drive taken up at the Games Village is not over yet.         
	Though the Delhi government on Thursday took control of maintenance, house keeping and cleanliness after receiving direction from the Prime Ministers Office, sources in the Indian contingent, a part of whom have already arrived at the Village on Thursday evening, confirmed there was still much to be done in certain areas.         
	Around 150 members of the Indian contingent, including officials, have already taken possession of the rooms in three towers allotted to them in the Games Village. Not all rooms have been properly cleaned yet, one of the athletes revealed.         
	While the archery team that landed from Calcutta was the first to enter the village, members of womens hockey team, gymnasts, the weightlifting contingent, the mens hockey team, the lawn bowling squad and para sport athletes flew in from their Pune camp late in the night.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, one of the athletes said: Out of three towers given to the Indian contingent, one was neat and clean, while the cleaning process was still on in the other two. Hopefully, things should be in order by Friday and one more tower would be given to the Indians when the rest of our athletes check in.         
	One of the OC officials, however, admitted: Though the work is in full swing, we are still far behind the deadline set by Mike Fennell (Commonwealth Games Federation chief). Work will go on throughout the night and hopefully things will be in order before the foreign teams arrive, added the official.         
	Thankfully, for the OC, Fennell, who arrived on Thursday evening, chose not to speak to the media and straightaway drove away for the official hotel from the airport. Though he met senior government officials later, Fennell would visit the Games Village only on Saturday.         
	Despite a series of setbacks, OC chairman Suresh Kalmadi remained defiant and said he was happy with the progress of work in the Games Village and it would be ready by Friday to welcome the first batch athletes and team officials from foreign countries.         
	According to the protocol department of the OC, a 21-member England squad including eight officials will be the first batch of foreign athletes to arrive in the capital on Friday.

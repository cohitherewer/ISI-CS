            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Former India captain Ravi Shastri, on Friday, gave a thumbs-up to selectors decision to rest key players during the upcoming ODI series against New Zealand in order to allow them prepare better for the tour of South Africa in December-January.         
	There is a need for a larger pool. When you have a good bench strength, no one will get complacent, Shastri said during a promotional here.         
	The BCCI has approved a proposal from coach Gary Kirsten to allow the core group of players to skip the ODIs against New Zealand and fly to South Africa instead to get acclimatised to the conditions ahead of a three-Test and five-ODI series.

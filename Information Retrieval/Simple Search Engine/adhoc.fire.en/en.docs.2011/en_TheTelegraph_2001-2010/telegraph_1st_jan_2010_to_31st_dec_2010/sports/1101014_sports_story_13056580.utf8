The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Crowd stops Euro qualifier
                                                                                                                       7                                      Crowd stops Euro qualifier
                      
	London: Crowd violence returned to haunt European football on Tuesday when Italys home Euro 2012 qualifier against Serbia in Genoa was abandoned amid a barrage of flares inside the Stadio Luigi Ferraris.         
	Only six minutes of play in the Group C match was possible before Scottish referee Craig Thomson took the players from the pitch after the kick-off had already been delayed for 35 minutes, when Serbian fans launched flares and scaled partition fences.         
	These ugly scenes completely overshadowed a busy night of action on the continent in which Spain, the Netherlands and Germany all preserved their 100 per cent records.                       (Reuters)

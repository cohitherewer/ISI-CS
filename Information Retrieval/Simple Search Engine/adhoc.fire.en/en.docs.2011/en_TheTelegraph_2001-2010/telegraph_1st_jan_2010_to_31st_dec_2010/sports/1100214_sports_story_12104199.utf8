The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav is for home advantage
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sourav is for home advantage
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has come down heavily on the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) for refusing to prepare a spin-friendly track at the Eden Gardens for the second and final Test between India and South Africa.         
	We should make a turner. Any association should not refuse to make such a wicket if spin is your strength. If (Mahendra Singh Dhoni) wanted a spinner-friendly wicket, then he should have got it. We should get home advantage, Sourav told a TV channel.         
	Sourav, incidentally, is a member of the CAB working committee, the all-powerful body of the association.         
	A portion of the grass was mowed down Saturday but the wicket still has a fair sprinkling of green. Curator Prabir Mukherjee has refused to accede to any further requests.         
	The BCCI had asked the CAB to prepare a turning track after India suffered a humiliating innings defeat against the Proteas in the first Test in Nagpur. However, the CAB refused, saying they have prepared a sporting track, and a turner at such short notice, wasnt possible.         
	Sourav advised Dhoni to go into the match with two pacers and two spinners and threw his weight behind off-spinner Harbhajan Singh, although he isnt in the best of form.         
	I will play with two spinners and two pacers Harbhajan has not been bowling well in the last three-four months. I am sure he knows that himself. But, he is a player who always makes a comeback in such situations, he said.

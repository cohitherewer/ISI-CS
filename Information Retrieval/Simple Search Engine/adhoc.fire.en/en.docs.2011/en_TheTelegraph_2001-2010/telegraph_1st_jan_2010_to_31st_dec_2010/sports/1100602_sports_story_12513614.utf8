            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday defended their anti-doping policy, stating that all its members including the BCCI were Wada-compliant and that it was closer to bringing out a cricket-specific solution to the impasse over the whereabouts clause.         
	The sports world governing body recently came under fire from Wada director general David Howman, who said that it was up to the ICC to make sure that its members fully complied to the anti-doping rules. The BCCI decided last year to reject the Wada Code after the Indian cricketers felt that the whereabouts clause infringed on their constitutional right to privacy and compromised their security.         
	Haroon Lorgat, the ICC chief executive officer, denied that there was ever a problem on the anti-doping or Wada front. Its not an issue of trying to convince the BCCI. The BCCI is Wada compliant, it has a zero tolerance policy to doping. Its just a question of agreeing on the finer details of the whereabouts clause, Lorgat, in the city to take part in a 2011 World Cup Central Organising Committee meeting here on Tuesday, said.         
	Asked for his response to Howmans remark, Lorgat said: Im not sure what he said. In fact he was very complimentary about the progress cricket has made in terms of doping. He is very much with us in terms of putting something specific for cricket.         
	Ratnakar Shetty, the BCCI chief administrative officer and also the tournament director of next years World Cup, said that formulating a cricket specific anti-doping code was the apt solution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina blasts new-ball bowlers
                                                                                                                       7                                        Raina blasts new-ball bowlers
  - Another defeat puts india out of tournament; Team Drop to 3rd in odi rankings       A CORRESPONDENT            Dilshan                                 
	Suresh Raina didnt hide his disappointment after India were sent packing from the tri-series in Zimbabwe, losing their must-win tie against Sri Lanka by six wickets. That the team dropped to No.3 in the ICCs ODI rankings as a result makes the ouster especially unpalatable.         
	Blaming the new ball bowlers for their sloppy display, Raina admitted at the post-match presentation ceremony that his team never looked convincing throughout the whole tournament.         
	On a slow Harare Sports Club wicket, the Indians put up a decent 268 for nine batting first. However, the Lankans easily rode to victory with youngster Dinesh Chandimal striking a strokeful 111. The Indian bowlers did little to trouble the Sri Lankan batsmen who reached the target with 10 balls to spare.         
	Rainas counterpart Tillekaratne Dilshan said that they were confident that the target was chaseable and praised Chandimal for his effort. He also said that Man of the Match Chandimals positive mindset made all the difference.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Dilshan: We didnt want to wait till the next game and so wanted to win this match (to ensure a place in the final) badly. We knew we could reach the target on this wicket We didnt wait for things to happen and were active on the field today. We tried a few things and applied pressure on India. Our fielding was also quite improved today. Im very happy with Chandimals performance. He has a positive approach and a good mindset which helped. It is important for the youngsters to play their normal game. It was a good all-round performance from us. The win today will also allow me to rest a few players in our next match on Monday. We will like to try out the others ahead of the final.         
	Raina: Im not happy with our performance. However, credit goes to Sri Lanka, especially Chandimal, for playing a brilliant game. We may have been few runs short but 268 was a decent total. Our bowlers didnt bowl well Im disappointed with the performance of our new ball bowlers. But Ashwin did bowl some good overs during the later stages. But we didnt look convincing all through the tournament. The toss was an important factor because this surface gets better as the game progresses. However, you have to perform no matter what the outcome of the toss is. We have two more games (Twenty20s) and will have to work on our batting and bowling to do well.         
	Chandimal: It feels good to hit a century. It is a good pitch to bat on. I just played my natural game and would like to continue doing that.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Green light for Vidya Stokes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Green light for Vidya Stokes
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In what could be described as a setback for the sports ministry, the returning officer for Hockey India (HI) elections accepted the nomination of Vidya Stokes for the post of president on Tuesday. Stokes nomination for the July 28 elections came under scanner a day before, when sports ministry said the no objection given to the polls was conditional and would apply only on abiding with the recent age limitation guidelines of the government.         
	As per the guidelines, no person above the age of 70 should be allowed to contest for the posts of president, secretary and treasurer in any of the national sports federations. Stokes, who is also the acting president of HI and had earlier held the post Indian Womens Hockey Federation chief, has crossed the stipulated age; she is 83.         
	However, the returning officer, Justice R.C. Chopra, approved Stokes nomination after HI refused to go by the guidelines, saying the national body was bound by the Societies Act and its own constitution.         
	Meanwhile, HI became the latest sports federation in the country to reject government grant and go ahead with its upcoming elections by defying the sports ministrys age limit guideline on Tuesday. The decision to ignore government funds came to light later in the evening when sports ministry observer SK Mendiratta submitted his report.         
	Narinder Batra (Stokes representative) categorically made a statement before the returning officer that the Hockey India was not asking for any financial grant or facilities from the government and, therefore, the Hockey India was not obliged to follow and implement policy guidelines of the government, the report said.         
	They also submitted that HI was prepared to face the consequences of not following the governments policy guidelines. Taking note of these, the returning officer accepted the nomination of Stokes, by passing a speaking order, Mendiratta said in the letter.         
	HI secretary general Batra doubted governments intention and said the conditional no objection given to them last year does not mention guidelines on age.         
	We duly accept governments guidelines on tenure limitation of two terms of four years each. When we got the no objection from the government in August 2009, age limitation was not there. We dont accept the amendments made in the guidelines in May 2010 because they were not made with clear intentions, Batra told the media.         
	HI seems to have taken a cue from Badminton Federation of India that had earlier defied the government guidelines and re-elected VK Verma as its president for another term. Batra too hinted at adopting the badminton bodys policy.         
	Hockey is our national sport, so if the government stops funding it will be very sad. But numerous lovers of the game still exist in the country who I know will come forward to support the game. If the government stops funding its their wish. It wont affect hockey in the country, reasoned Batra, who will be contesting for the secretary generals post.         
	Former India captain Pargat Singh is also in the running for the presidents post of Hockey India along with Stokes.

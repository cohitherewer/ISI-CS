The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak Board approaches Arthur
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pak Board approaches Arthur
                      
	Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has approached former South Africa coach Mickey Arthur for taking up a full-time coaching job with the national team.         
	Sources in the board said that Arthur has been contacted by the PCB, but he has not responded so far.         
	Arthur recently stepped down as the Proteas coach, after having selection issues with Cricket South Africa (CSA) and its selectors. In his tenure, South Africa climbed up the rankings, which raised his profile as an international coach.         
	Arthurs name was suggested by former Australian captain Greg Chappell, who was initially approached with an offer, but he turned it down politely because of his commitments with Cricket Australia and its academy, one source said.         
	Chappell is a good friend of Wasim Bari, the chief operating officer of the board, and he had made some suggestions regarding best candidates to coach Pakistan team, one source said.

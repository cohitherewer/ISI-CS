	Fort Lauderdale (US): New Zealand beat Sri Lanka by 28 runs in the first of the two Twenty20 Internationals as international cricket made a historic attempt to break into the American market.         
	However, the formats reputation as a carnival of brutal power-hitting suffered on a slow, lifeless pitch at the 20,000-capacity Central Broward Regional Park Stadium at Lauderhill on Saturdaty. New Zealand struggled to a modest 120 for seven off their 20 overs before Sri Lanka were bowled out for just 92.         
	On a day, when condition were tough, only two sixes were hit in the entire match, which was hardly the kind of advertisement the International Cricket Council (ICC) would have wanted.         
	Only two Sri Lankan batsmen managed to adapt to the conditions with skipper Kumar Sangakkara making 17 and Angelo Mathews top-scoring with 27 before the 2009 World Twenty20 runners-up lost their last six wickets for just 30 runs.         
	Experienced medium pacer Scott Styris did the damage with three for 10 off three overs. Styris said: It wasnt too bad, this wicket suited me.         
	Ross Taylor top-scored for New Zealand with 27 off 30 balls with skipper Daniel Vettori contributing 21.           (AGENCIES)

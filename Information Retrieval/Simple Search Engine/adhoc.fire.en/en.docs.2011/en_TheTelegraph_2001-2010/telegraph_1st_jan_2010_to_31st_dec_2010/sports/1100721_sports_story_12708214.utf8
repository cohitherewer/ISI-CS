The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Some shouldnt play Tests, feels Afridi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Some shouldnt play Tests, feels Afridi
                  Shahid Afridi                     
	Karachi: Sparking off a new debate, former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has stated that they were some players in the team who did not deserve to be in the Test side. They were, however, still playing five-day cricket despite not having the ability or commitment for it.         
	Afridi also insisted that he had not quit Test cricket because of problems with fellow players in the team. It was my own decision and it was a spur of the moment decision. I didnt consult anyone, he told a newspaper.         
	I would advise all these players who dont feel comfortable or like playing Test matches to not become a burden on the team and just focus on playing one-day and T20 cricket, Afridi said.         
	Named captain for the entire tour, Afridi suddenly announced his retirement from the longer version of the game after the humiliating 150-run loss to Australia in the first Test at Lords.         
	The flamboyant all-rounder reasoned that he decided to quit Tests because he had lost passion for the five-day game and wanted to concentrate on limited overs cricket.         
	Afridi said it was time for some non-performing players in the Pakistan Test side to ponder their future.         
	As captain I tried to advise some players to avoid playing Test cricket and decide on a future but they insisted on playing Tests. They have not done justice to themselves or the team with their performances, he said.         
	I think the time has come for us to decide who should be playing in the Test, one-day and T20 teams, he added.         
	Afridi said the Cricket Boards (PCB) selection committee would have to make its policy very clear on all the three formats of the game. The former skipper was of the view that they were some very good young players in the side but they need time to settle down.         
	I would advise everyone not to expect too much from this team in Test matches. It will take time. Salman Butt has become captain for the first time and he should seek advice and guidance from the coach and try to keep the team united.         
	England would prove to be a tougher opponent then Australia because at the moment they are playing better cricket, Afridi said.           (PTI)

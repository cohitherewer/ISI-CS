            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Sahara supremo Subrata Roy will decide in the next two weeks whether to enter the race to take a 100 million stake in Liverpool, according to sources.         
	Liverpool have vehemently denied suggestions Roy is one of the half-dozen investors engaged in preliminary talks with Christian Purslow, the clubs managing director, despite reports to the contrary.

                  Defending champion Angel Cabrera of Argentina watches his tee shot on the fourth hole during the first round of the Augusta Masters, on Thursday. (AP)                     
	Augusta: David Toms grabbed the clubhouse lead at the Masters with a 3-under 69 on Thursday as everyone awaited the comeback of Tiger Woods.         
	Also in the early mix were defending champion Angel Cabrera, who defeated Kenny Perry in a playoff last year for his second Major title. The Argentine golfer made the turn with a 33 and was joined at 3 under by Steve Marino.         
	Some of the biggest cheers were for Tom Watson, who nearly became the oldest Major champion in golf history at last years British Open before losing a playoff to Stewart Cink.         
	Now 60 and the oldest player in the field, Watson was 2 under despite knocking his ball in Raes Creek at No. 13. He bounced back from that miscue with a soft wedge shot near the hole, and sank the putt to save par.         
	As the wind picked up and a storm front approached, Toms put up three birdies in a four-hole stretch on the back side, including both par 5s, before a bogey at the tough closing hole ended his round on a sour note.         
	Still, it was quite a start for someone who failed to qualify for the Masters a year ago, breaking a streak of 11 straight appearances at Augusta.         
	Officials at Augusta National insisted that no one player  not even when its the worlds best embroiled in a scandal  would overshadow their tournament.         
	And for a few moments, at least, that was the case as Jack Nicklaus joined Arnold Palmer at the first tee shortly after sunrise for the opening shots.         
	Ive never been up this early at Augusta, cracked the 70-year-old Nicklaus, who won a record six green jackets and agreed to return this year to join Palmer in a ceremonial role.         
	Sentimentality aside, most patrons were eager to get a look at Tiger Woods in comeback mode.         
	Bill Campbell set up his chair along the second fairway, hoping to catch one of the golfers early shots.         
	Im expecting him to be wild off the tee, Campbell said, but I wont be surprised if he pulls off a great round.         
	Mark Felt stationed himself along the third tee, which also afforded a view of the seventh green.         
	Hes going to come back sometime, Felt said. Might as well be here.         
	The 70-year-old Nicklaus, a record six-time champion who last played at the Masters in 2005, agreed to return this year to hit the opening shots with Palmer.         
	They both knocked it down the right side, just off the fairway. Two security guards hustled out to pick up the balls.         
	I hit a rookie tee shot, Nicklaus said with a smile. I didnt put my contacts in, so I had no idea where it went. As long as I didnt hear it land, its OK.         
	Meanwhile, the chairman of Augusta National Golf Club had harsh words for Woods, saying the worlds best golfer disappointed everyone with his sex scandal and didnt live up to expectations as a role model.         
	Billy Payne said on Wednesday that Woods wont be judged in the future solely on his performance as a golfer, but by the sincerity of his efforts to change as a person.         
	Our hero did not live up to his status as a role model, Payne said during his annual state of the Masters news conference.         
	I hope that he realises every kid he walks by would love to have his swing but will settle for his smile.         
	We hope and pray that he will begin his new life in a positive and constructive manner, Payne said. This year is not just for Tiger but for all of us who believe in second chances. Certainly in the future, he will be judged not only by his performance against par, but the sincerity of his efforts to change.         
	Payne declined to answer specific questions about Woods, saying his prepared remarks were all he wanted to say on the matter.         
	They were the strongest words from a Masters chairman since Hootie Johnsons famous quot;point of a bayonet quot; reply to Martha Burk in the summer of 2002 when he defended the clubs right to an all-male membership.

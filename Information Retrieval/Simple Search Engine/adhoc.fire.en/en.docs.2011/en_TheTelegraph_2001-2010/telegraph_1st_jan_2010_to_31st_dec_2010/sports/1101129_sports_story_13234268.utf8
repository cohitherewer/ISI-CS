                                                                                                                       7                                      Ross Taylor: We batted   badly in the   middle overs
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  
	Guwahati: It was a bad day in office for stand-in New Zealand skipper Ross Taylor, but the Black Caps batsman was not entirely overshadowed by the gloom of the 40-run defeat against India in the first of the five ODIs here on Sunday.         
	Taylor played well to score 66 off 69 deliveries after a disappointing outing in the Test series, but he would have preferred to get the better of the result after a disappointing ODI series in Bangladesh.         
	New Zealand fizzled out after their middle-order failed to put up a fight and Taylor felt that the visitors lost grip of the match at various moments. We got to look at several parts of the game. The middle overs were obviously one of these. It was disappointing. Hopefully, Dan (Vettori) and Brendon (McCullum) will be back. We are monitoring them on a day-to-day basis. But, we are here to try a few things and different combinations. I am sure there will be a couple of changes in the next match and we can make a match, Taylor said.         
	The stand-in skipper backed his decision to bowl first after winning the toss. He rued the quicks failed to snare some early wickets and said Virat Kohli and Yuvraj Singh were equally brilliant in stealing the game away from them.         
	I think I am still happy with my decision to bowl first. It would have been a good to take a couple of early wickets when the ball was seaming. But credit to Virat (Kohli) and Yuvraj, the way they batted , he said.         
	According to Taylor, it was wasnt quite a surprise when he was asked to lead the side as there were whispers that Daniel Vettori could miss the first ODI after the three-Test series.         
	Taylor saw no demons in the wicket and felt 250 was par score on the strip. The wicket played pretty well. Probably, it was a 250-wicket. But the way we batted through the middle overs was obviously disappointing. But the wicket played a lot better than I thought, he said.         
	Taylor lauded Virat for placing his innings coolly and slowly going about destructing the bowlers on his way. He batted very well. The way he paced his innings was outstanding ... got good support from Yuvraj.It would have been good to get him out, but I think he deserved the hundred. I have followed his career with great interest. The way he has batted for India in the past 12-13 months has been outstanding. I am sure if he continues like this his Test call-up is a sure thing.

	Wellington: Rookie batsman Kane Williamson and pacer Hamish Bennett were the new faces in New Zealands 15-member Test squad announced Sunday for a three-match series against India.         
	Williamson, who was the only New Zealand batsman to crack a hundred during their 0-4 thrashing by Bangladesh in an ODI series earlier this month, was rewarded for his consistent performance.         
	Bennett, a 23-year-old Canterbury fast bowler, also earned a call-up for the Test series.         
	The squad: Daniel Vettori (captain), Brent Arnel, Hamish Bennett, Martin Guptill, Gareth Hopkins (wicket-keeper), Chris Martin, Brendon McCullum, Tim McIntosh, Andy McKay, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, BJ Watling, Kane Williamson.

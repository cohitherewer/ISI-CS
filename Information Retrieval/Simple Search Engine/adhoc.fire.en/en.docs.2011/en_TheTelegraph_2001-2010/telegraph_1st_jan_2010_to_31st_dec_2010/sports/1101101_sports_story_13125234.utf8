                                                                                                                       7                                      Ian Chappell cautions CA 
                      
	Melbourne: Cricket Australia (CA) should be mindful that Twenty20 is the easiest form of the game to corrupt when it accepts private investment, including from India, in the countrys domestic Twenty20 league from next year, feels former captain Ian Chappell.         
	CA has given the go ahead for private investment in its Twenty20 Big Bash from next year.         
	Cricket Australia needs to be certain of whats motivating the businessmen, many of them from India, to part with their hard earned money. Its imperative that CA retains a percentage of any revenue stream to ensure the game remains strong for future generations of cricketers in Australia, Chappell said.           (PTI)

	Karachi: All-rounder Shahid Afridi will captain Pakistan at this years Twenty20 World Cup in West Indies, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Tuesday.         
	Afridis re-appointment to the captaincy came days after he was fined Rs 3 million and placed on six months probation after being found guilty of ball-tampering on the recent tour of Australia.         
	It is a big honour for me and I will try to live up to the expectations of the board and nation, Afridi told reporters.         
	The 30-year-old Afridi has played 26 Tests, 293 one-day internationals and 27 T20 internationals.         
	He was Pakistans Twenty20 captain until the ball-tampering incident in February during the fifth one-dayer against Australia in Perth for which he was handed a two-match ban.         
	The captaincy was handed to Afridi on the same day he received a top civilian honour, the Presidents Pride of Performance award.         
	It is a big day for me to get the award and also the captaincy, I am very happy, Afridi said.         
	Pakistan won the T20 World Cup under the captaincy of Younus Khan last year in England and Afridi played a key role in the success, winning Man-of-the-Match awards in the semi-final and final.         
	I will try to lead by example and not let down my supporters and fans. We have the capability to defend the title, Afridi said.         
	Senior all-rounder Abdul Razzaq, another captaincy candidate, said there were no hard feelings.         
	I think he is the best choice to lead the team now because he has the ability to lead by example and gel the team. I will give him my wholehearted support. Afridi being captain is a good thing for Pakistan cricket, Razzaq said.         
	The PCB this month banned and fined seven players, including Afridi following the teams poor performances in Australia.           (REUTERS)

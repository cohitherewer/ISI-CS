  - Bengal to play Saurashtra in the quarter finals
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  Sourav Ganguly and Laxmi Ratan Shukla, at the Eden, on Monday. A Telegraph picture        
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly is confident Bengal team will perform well in the National One-dayers for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.         
	The former India captain, who practised with his statemates for the past couple of days at Eden Gardens, feels that Bengal is a better one-day side compared to their performance in the longer format.         
	Our performance during the past couple of seasons has been pretty good. That shows that we have been a better one-day side.         
	There is no reason why we cant repeat our performance, Sourav told reporters after the training session on Monday.         
	Bengal have been runners-up for the past two years.         
	They lost the 2007-08 editions final to Saurashtra while during the last edition it was Tamil Nadu who emerged victorious.         
	The Bengal squad will be leaving for Vadodara on Tuesday where they will play Saurashtra in the quarter finals on Thursday.         
	The Bengal team has directly earned a last eight berth by virtue of being the last seasons finalist.         
	Asked about the teams two loss at the zonal one-dayers, Sourav said: We didnt field well as a few catches went abegging.         
	We have to make sure that we dont repeat our mistakes at the knock-out level, he added.         
	Vice-captain Manoj Tiwary, who was back among runs during the Orissa match with a fluent 86, also feels that team has learnt from the mistakes during the Cuttack leg.         
	We have a balanced side with a nice blend of youth and experience.         
	I am really confident that this time also we wont disappoint, Tiwary said.         
	If one goes by the practice sessions, it is almost certain that two seniors Arindam Das and Sourasish Lahiri will be back in the playing XI against Saurashtra.         
	While Arindam will be Sreevats Goswamis opening partner, Sourasish will replace Iresh Saxena as the teams specialist spinner.         
	The inclusion of Sourasish will also bolster the teams batting in the lower-middle order.         
	The senior offie can also be promoted up the order as a pinch-hitter according to the requirements of the team.         
	Sourav will be coming in at No. 3 where he will get ample opportunity to make use of the PowerPlays if one of the openers is dismissed cheaply.         
	Manoj and skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla will come in at No. 5 and No. 6, respectively with Wriddhiman Saha coming in at No. 7.         
	Meanwhile, in Vadodara, former champions Saurashtra beat Uttar Pradesh by seven wickets in a pre-quarter-final match.         
	Chasing a modest UP target of 204, Saurashtra won with 57 balls to spare.         
	Opener Sagar Jogiyani scored an unbeaten 102 while veteran Sitanshu Kotak struck an unbeaten 69.

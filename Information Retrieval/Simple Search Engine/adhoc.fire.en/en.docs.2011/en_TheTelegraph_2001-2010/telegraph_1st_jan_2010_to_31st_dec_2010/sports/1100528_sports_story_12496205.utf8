The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ivanovics painful exit

	Paris: Watching Ana Ivanovic suffer at Roland Garros made for painful viewing on Thursday as the former darling of Paris slid out of the French Open with barely a whimper.         
	The 22-year-old Serb, whose career has nose-dived alarmingly since winning the title here in 2008, looked almost apologetic at times during a humbling 6-3. 6-0 loss to ruthless Russian Alisa Kleybanova in 66 minutes.         
	A few of the fans who had waited patiently for the rain to finally stop on Court One tried to lift her but after slashing another errant forehand into the net she appeared relieved to be heading back to the privacy of the locker room.         
	The contrast to two years ago could not have been more stark.         
	Then, as the sun beat down, Ivanovic stood smiling on Centre Court as she held aloft the Suzanne Lenglen Cup after defeating Dinara Safina 6-3, 6-4 in the final.         
	That fortnight the winners flowed off her racket and she sliced through the draw for the loss of just one set. Not only did she win what many believed would be the first of many grand slam titles she also climbed to the top of the WTA rankings.         
	Blessed with model looks and a friendly demeanour she was a dream for the WTA Tours marketing chiefs looking for the next pin-up to sell the womens game to the sponsors.         
	Things soon began to turn sour though and an early loss at Wimbledon was followed by a thumb injury that ruled her out of the Olympic Games in Beijing on the eve of the tournament.         
	By the end of 2009 she had dropped to 22 in the rankings and arrived at Roland Garros this year a further 20 places down the ladder despite recently hiring Steffi Grafs former long-term coach Heinz Gunthardt.         
	Ivanovic still managed to smile when she faced the media on Thursday but the sparkle was missing from her eyes.         
	You know I love this tournament, she told reporters. Its still my favourite tournament. I think Im on the right path and Im doing lots of things right.         
	Its been such a long time until I was actually competing and playing lots of matches. Its gonna take some time for it to become a pattern and just being used to competing again at that high level against top players.         
	Some days it might be there, some days it might not.         
	It definitely was not there on Thursday despite winning the first two games of the match. From that moment on she simply could not cope with an aggressive opponent who showed no mercy but who offered some words of sympathy afterwards.

	Calcutta: The first thing that East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder said at the post-match press conference, on Friday, was: I am sorry for the fans. If I stay back, I would just tell the officials to get a few good strikers, the disappointment was writ large on his face.         
	His reaction was expected, after his boys spurned chances like millionaires, to draw 1-1 against the bottom-placed Sporting Clube de Goa in their I-League encounter, at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	The draw took East Bengal to 25 points from 21 matches while Clube now have 21 points from 23 matches. Had East Bengal been able to convert the chances that they got, they could have pumped in at least half-a-dozen goals.         
	Instead, it was left-winger Joseph Perreira who beat opposition right back Saikat Saha Roy, and his angular volley went in. The match was in the 12th minute then. But that was the last time the Clube players were seen in opposition territory.         
	After that, it was a saga of missed chances and some good goalkeeping by Man of the Match Felix DSouza. East Bengal captain Syed Rahim Nabi scored the equaliser in the 39th minute, but should have scored another. Similarly, Yusif Yakubu missed out on a golden opportunity to score a hattrick.         
	The equaliser reflected poorly on Felixs anticipation. He came out of the goal, seeing Nabi chase a long ball from Abel Hammond. That opened the goal for Nabi and pushed it in nonchalantly. Before that, Nabi missed a golden opportunity when he was thwarted by a surging Felix, in the 19th minute. Yakubu missed first of his three chances in the 17th minute when his feeble tap off a Nabi centre was collected by Felix.         
	In the second half, the introduction of Sanju Pradhan increased the intensity of East Bengals attacks. With Hammond looking deadly down wide right, it looked like the red and gold brigade would increase the lead any minute, but that didnt happen.         
	The easiest chance of the day came to Yakubu, in the 59th minute, when Hammond snatched a ball from the midfield and sprinted around 35 yards shaking off a couple of defenders to keep a nice pull back for Yakubu. All Yakubu needed to do was to tap the ball home. To everyones horror, Yakubu could not do that.         
	A couple of minutes later, left back Saumik Deys cross was headed by the Ghanaian veteran but the ball hit the vertical. Sanju, who had a clear sight of the goal could not score from the rebound. His shot was saved by Felix.         
	In the stoppage time, Alvito DCunha missed an open net as his shot sailed over the horizontal. No wonder Clube coach Vishwas Gaonkar said: We are lucky to have escaped with a draw. One point is better than nothing.

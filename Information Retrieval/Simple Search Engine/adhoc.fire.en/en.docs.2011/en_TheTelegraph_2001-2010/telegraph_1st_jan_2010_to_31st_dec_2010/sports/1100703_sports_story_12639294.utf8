The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No ICC event in Pak till 15
                                                                                                                       7                                      No ICC event in Pak till 15
                      
	Karachi: Pakistan will remain in isolation as an international cricket venue with the ICC deciding not to allot any event to the trouble-torn country until 2015.         
	The ICC on Thursday announced its events and host countries until 2015 and Pakistan does not feature in the list at all although the ICC has awarded the next two World T20 events to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in 2012 and 2014.         
	Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board said chairman Ijaz Butt had shown interest that Pakistan should be given at least one ICC event after 2012 but the ICC members didnt respond positively.         
	The 2013 Champions Trophy was on the minds of the PCB but apparently nothing has happened to convince the ICC that international teams can resume touring Pakistan by next year or in 2012, the source said.         
	Pakistan supported the stance taken by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in rejecting the nomination of former Australian Prime Minister John Howard for the post of ICC vice-president.

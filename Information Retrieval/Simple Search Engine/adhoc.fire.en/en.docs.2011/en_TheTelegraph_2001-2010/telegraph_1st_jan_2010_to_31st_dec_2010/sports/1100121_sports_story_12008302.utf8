            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi on Wednesday assured Abhinav Bindras father that a permanent solution regarding the eligibility of a shooters participation in an international meet would soon be worked out.         
	Kalmadi, who met the Olympic gold medallists father, A.S. Bindra, did not, however, come out with a clear answer whether the rifle shooter would be okayed for selection for the Commonwealth Games without appearing in the trials.         
	Abhinavs father has made some requests which we will consider, said Kalmadi.

            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Mumbai Indians were left with prayers on their lips for their inspirational captain Sachin Tendulkar to be fit for the final.         
	Tendulkar injured the webbing on his right hand when he took a low catch of Rahul Dravid in the fourth over of the Royal Challengers Bangalore innings. The catch was ultimately over-ruled by the television umpire.         
	Hope he plays in the final. We all expect him to play. But few things are not in our control, so lets be patient and wait for two days, vice-captain Zaheer Khan said after their 35-run win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the semi-final.         
	Lets see how he shapes up... He needed a few stitches, thats a bit of a worry. We were all jumping around in joy, so we dont know the actual status. But knowing Sachin, I know he will be up for it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Heavy cover for a safe World Cup
                                                                                                                       7                                      Heavy cover for a safe World Cup
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With barely 24 hours to go for the start of the 12-nation hockey World Cup, the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium, the venue, has been converted into a veritable fortress with a multi-layered security blanket thrown over it.         
	Never before has a sporting event in the capital seen such unprecedented security with 10 companies of paramilitary forces guarding a zone of five-kilometre radius around the stadium.         
	A total of 200 Delhi Police commandos have been posted inside the venue. The threat perception is extremely high, claimed a Hockey India (HI) official. The security agencies have adopted a zero tolerance policy for the entire stretch of the competition.         
	Sources in HI revealed that the FIH had agreed in writing to adhere to all the security measures, even asking the participating teams not to venture outside the team hotel without permission.         
	The World Cup is like a test event. Any untoward incident would completely jeopardise future events like the IPL, the Commonwealth Games and the cricket World Cup, he added.         
	Media personnel, too, are having a tough time as they have yet to be allowed inside the stadium.         
	On Saturday, the newspersons boycotted an FIH press conference but that hardly made a difference.         
	All that the FIH president Leandro Negre said was: I am sorry, even I had difficulty entering the stadium.

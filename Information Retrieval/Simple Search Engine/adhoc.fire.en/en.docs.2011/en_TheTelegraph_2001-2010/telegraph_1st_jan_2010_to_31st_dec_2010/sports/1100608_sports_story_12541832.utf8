            BELIEF SYSTEMS                      
	French kiss                   
	The French seem to understand very well that luck is a fickle mistress. For the 98 World Cup, the French imposed upon themselves a rigid code of rituals that included always occupying the same seats on the team bus and listening to Gloria Gaynors 1970s hit I Will Survive in the changingroom. Finally, just before kickoff defender Laurent Blanc would kiss keeper Fabien Barthezs clean pate to make sure nothing went wrong. Lady luck was evidently suitably impressed as the French won the World Cup. In the present side, coach Raymond Domenech is known to take his players star signs into consideration before selecting the team.               
	Finishing touch                 
	Bobby Moore, the England captain in the 1960s and 1970s insisted on being the last person into the changing room to put on his shorts before kick-off. Moores teammate Martin Peters knew just what to do when his captain acted this way. Peters would wait until Moore had put on his shorts, before taking off his own. Moore would respond by taking off his shorts, and waiting until Peters had put his back on.               
	Gum culture                 
	Johan Cruyff, the master of total football had a regimen complete with slapping his goalkeeper in the stomach to spitting his chewing gum into the oppositions half before kick-off. However, Cruyff was to later discourage such practices. Looking back, Cruyff advised managers to ensure that their players are not influenced by superstition. If it does influence them, he cautioned, you cant play them in the next match.               
	Trigger conscious                 
	Gary Lineker, the former England striker never took a shot at goal during his match warm ups because he didnt want to waste a goal. Then, if he wouldnt manage to score in the first half he would change his shirt. If the bad run extended, and he kept on failing to score, he would resort to getting a haircut The striker that he was, his touch thankfully would have returned by the time he resorted to the last.               
	Pee-keeping force                 
	Sergio Goycochea, the Argentina goalkeeper used to urinate on the pitch if he was involved in a penalty shootout. He explained: If you have any natural human urges, you have to go on the field. I was very subtle and nobody complained. His teammates certainly werent as Goycochea went on a penalty saving spree in Italia 90 which was checked only in the final when he failed to keep Andreas Brehmes shot out, although to be fair to him he did come very close to saving it.

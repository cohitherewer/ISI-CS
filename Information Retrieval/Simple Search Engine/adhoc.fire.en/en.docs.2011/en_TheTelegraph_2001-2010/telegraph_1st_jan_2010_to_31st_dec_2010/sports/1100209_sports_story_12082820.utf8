	Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto wore the captains arm-band for the first time during the season on Monday. The Brazilian led Mohun Bagan from the front with couple of fantastic strikes as the city giants whipped BNR 4-1 in a CFL Premier Division match at their club ground.         
	The new coach Satyajit Chatterjee couldnt have hoped for a better start to his new stint at the helm. Branco Cardozo was the other scorer for Bagan with BNRs Sukanta Banerjee scoring an own goal.         
	The win also took Bagan to the top of the table with 21 points from seven matches. Although it was a local league match, but a comprehensive victory will surely be a relief for one and all after back-to-back defeats in the I-League matches in Goa.         
	Bagan surged ahead as early as fourth minute when Branco nodded home a Sheikh Azim floater. Bagans midfield, especially Subha Kumar and Ishfaq Ahmed, performed commendably supplying a lot of balls upfront for Barreto and Branco.         
	However it was BNRs Nigerian recruit Baba Tunde who restored parity against the run of play. Latching on to the ball just outside box, he hoodwinked Sagram Mandi with a swift turn and chipped the ball which kissed the horizontal beating Shilton Paul before entering the net. The match was into its 24th minute then.         
	Barreto, however, set the record straight after a seven minute spell when Bagan suddenly closed the match. In the 36th minute he outjumped his marker with a powerful header.         
	In the 43rd minute, the third goal was a result of proper understanding. Barreto who was lurking around on the left side of the penalty box, passed the ball to Subha Kumar and with a semi-circular run reached the other end of the box. In the meanwhile, Ishfaq receiving a pass from Subha, slipped one between the defenders. Barreto met the ball and his rasping angular volley crashed into the net. Bagan went into the break with a 3-1 lead.         
	After the change of ends, Bagan got their fourth goal in the 60th minute when BNR defender Sukanta Banerjees mis-kick lobbed over BNR custodian Santosh Goswami to enter the net. The green and maroon brigade could have scored a couple of more goals had Branco not missed easy sitters.

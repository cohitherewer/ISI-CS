The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin up by   3 spots
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sachin up by   3 spots
            A STAFF REPORTER                            
	Calcutta: Maestro Sachin Tendulkar has jumped to the third position in the Reliance Mobile ICC Player Rankings for ODI batsmen after belting a record-breaking double century in the second ODI against South Africa, in Gwalior, on Wednesday.         
	Tendulkar has moved up three places and now trails No. 2 Mike Hussey of Australia by 43 points with India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni still sitting at the top.         
	It is Tendulkars highest ranking in two years after he had reached the No. 2 spot following an unbeaten 117 against Australia in Sydney.         
	In the ODI team championship, India has all but cemented the second spot after taking an unassailable 2-0 lead against South Africa. They are now on 123 ratings points while South Africa has slipped to 115 ratings points.         
	The only way India can finish third at the annual cut-off date of April 1 is if they lose Saturdays match and New Zealand make a clean sweep of the five-match ODI series against Australia starting in Napier on March 3.

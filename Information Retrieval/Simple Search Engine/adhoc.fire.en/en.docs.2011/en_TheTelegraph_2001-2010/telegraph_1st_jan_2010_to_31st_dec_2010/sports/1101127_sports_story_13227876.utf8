	Calcutta: When Trevor Morgan walked out of the tunnel an hour before Fridays match, he was greeted with a big round of applause. He raised his hands towards the stands and soaked in the adulation showered by East Bengal supporters.         
	Morgan is not one who plays to the gallery. He ensured it remained one of the most surreal moments of his coaching career with a 2-0 win over Mohun Bagan in return gift.         
	By his own admission, Morgan didnt expect the first goal to come so easily. But he gave due credit to Robin Singh for scoring the opener and netting the second to earn East Bengal the CFL title.         
	The first goal gave us a bit of advantage because I dont think we started particularly well. The goalkeeper dropped a cross and that gave us a bit of breathing space, Morgan said on Friday.                 
	The East Bengal coach described Robin as a youngster teeming with talent and pointed out how damaging he can be when in his elements. Peoples expectations of Robin are very high. When he doesnt play well he probably gets criticised which is unfair. It is his first season in league football.         
	Its a massive step-up from what he had been playing in and hes a young player learning the game. Robins got talent, potential. But you have to realise the potential and the more he realises that and more he gains experience he will become a better player, Morgan said.         
	Robin Singh, playing his first season in league football, was ecstatic with the victory. Todays performance shows my commitment towards my club. I am thankful to Trevor Morgan for his support. He has helped me in getting my positioning right. The first goal was a gift. I am not thinking about playing for India at the moment. I leave it to the national coach to decide, Robin told The Telegraph.         
	According to Morgan, Fridays victory was a part of the germination process that started five months back.         
	Its not just about Fridays game. Its a culmination of 15 games hard work. Although we are the champions tonight, the process started on day one of pre-season training. So its the five months work that the players have put in to achieve what they have got today, he said.         
	With two titles already in his kitty, Morgans next target is the I-League. The Calcutta Leagues over and so its the I-League now. Therere probably five teams that could win the I-League. And I would consider we are one of those, he said.         
	Bagan coach Stanley Rozario refused to blame his players and vowed to bounce back in the I-League. The first goal killed us psychologically today. I wont criticise Shilton as all the players, I believe, have the talent to bounce back. We need a good start in the I-League, Stanley said.

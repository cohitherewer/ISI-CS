            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: With just five days to go before the start of the hockey World Cup at the redesigned Major Dhyan Chand Stadium, the organisers have thrown a heavy security blanket around the event, insulating it from the fans and media alike.         
	So much so that former star Ajitpal Singh, who led India to their only World Cup triumph in Kuala Lumpur in 1975, was stopped by the guards at the Dhyan Chand stadium on Tuesday when he was going to attend a meeting.         
	Ajitpal told the guards who he was but they were not willing to listen. Ajitpal, a member of the World Cup co-ordination commission, then had to call a Sports Authority of India (SAI) official who came to his rescue. The security people said that the hockey veterans name was not on their register.         
	Terming the entire episode extremely humiliating, Ajitpal said he would not come for any World Cup matches if the security continued to behave in the same manner.         
	A few days ago, former international and coach of the 1998 Asian Games gold-winning Indian team, M.K. Kaushik was stopped by the security at the stadium gates. Kaushik is currently the coach of the Indian womens team.         
	Another former India captain, Pargat Singh, has already predicted that the World Cup could be the worst organised event in the history of Indian sports.         
	The way things are moving, I am afraid the World Cup could well prove to be a matter of national shame, he said.         
	A total of nine teams have so far arrived in the capital for the World Cup. While Pakistan, Australia, South Africa, South Korea, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Canada and Argentina have already checked in at the designated hotel for the World Cup teams, Spain, Germany and England are expected to arrive in the next couple of days.         
	The organisers have put a blanket ban on media from entering the team hotel and the teams have been instructed not to talk to them.         
	The media has also been banned from watching the training sessions of the participating teams although the Federation of International Hockey (FIH) said on Tuesday that the restriction could be lifted for the last three days.         
	Australia captain Jamie Dwyer, however, said he was happy with the security measures taken by the organisers.         
	In the hotel we feel very safe, the hockey stadium is great, the pitch is good and in between is good as well, so were very happy, Dwyer said.         
	Meanwhile, India defeated Argentina 2-1 in their first practice match for the World Cup. Drag-flicker Sandeep Singh gave India the lead through a penalty corner while captain Rajpal Singhs field goal sealed the issue. India will next play the Netherlands in their second practice game on Thursday.

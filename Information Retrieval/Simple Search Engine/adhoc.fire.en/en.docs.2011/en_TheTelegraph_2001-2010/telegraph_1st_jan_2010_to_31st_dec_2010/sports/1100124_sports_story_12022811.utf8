	Calcutta: Chirag United will start firm favourites against a depleted JCT in a 11th round I-League encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.         
	Chirag, who are currently fourth in the league table with 19 points from 10 matches, have a chance to move to the top if Dempo fail to win their 11th round encounter against Sporting Clube de Goa on the morrow. If both Chirag and Dempo win their respective encounters both will have22 points but the Goan outfit will perch at the top because of a better goal difference.         
	The good news for Chirag is that Brazilian striker Joshimar who was out of the Dempo match due to double booking will come back to bolster the Chirag attack. Joshimar will have the support of countrymate Edmilson who scored through a swerving free-kick the other day.         
	With Ashim Biswas showing glimpses of old his form, Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya can hope for a lot of firepower upfront.         
	Even coach Bhattacharya feels that Chirag should cash in on the JCT match. We missed three points against Dempo But we should try and get full points against JCT, Bhattacharya said.         
	The JCT team will miss the services of injured Baljit Singh Sahni, Sunil Thakur and Jagtar Singh. JCT have netted 10 points from as many matches.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Fairytale rise of Michael Beer
                                                                                                                       7                                        Fairytale rise of Michael Beer

	There was a barbecue at St Kildas Junction Oval ground on Sunday to mark a reunion of the clubs old boys. It was appropriate timing for a gettogether as the club had plenty to toast with one of their former players the talk of Australian cricket.         
	That is nothing new for St Kilda. After all Shane Warne is a former player, but the inclusion of Michael Beer in the third Ashes Test squad has sparked more comment in Australia than any other selection in recent memory.         
	The front page of the Melbourne Age sports section on Saturday announced Australian cricket had gone Back to the Dark Ages, while former captains and players have lined up to deride the decision to promote Beer from state cricket after only four Sheffield Shield matches.         
	Even Ricky Ponting and Tim Nielsen, the Australia coach, have admitted to never seeing him bowl in person.         
	On the club scene in Victoria, Beer was considered the best spinner for a number of years but even his old colleagues are surprised by the speed of his elevation.         
	It is an amazing story, David Johnstone, the clubs director of coaching said. He has gone from club cricket at the end of last season, then to Shield cricket and now selection for Australia. It is very exciting for the club.         
	I had never thought about him playing for Australia before but always saw in him the potential to play first-class cricket. I saw that a long time ago but the opportunity never came his way until he moved to Perth.         
	Johnstone oversaw a young Warne make a similar journey.         
	If he is picked for Australia this week, Beer will make his Test debut after playing only four Sheffield Shield matches. Warne had played one fewer when he made his Test debut against India in 1992.         
	The difference between the two is that Warne was selected for Victoria, whereas Beer was deemed only good enough for his home states second team and had to move to Western Australia for his chance, in the process giving up a job with Puma and a degree in sports science.         
	He has given hope to all club cricketers and that is very important, Johnstone said. There are two different ways of getting through. The academy system and the club system.         
	Club cricketers like Beery have persevered and worked hard for a chance. He just never gave up. He was the best spinner in club cricket in Victoria for a few years and I am sure he could have made the step up to state cricket a couple of years ago but never got his chance.         
	I am sure he has got a lot to learn. He has only played three or four first-class games but I have looked at a bit of Test cricket and I dont see too many better left-arm orthodox spinners in world cricket who are any better.         
	Beer made his first-class debut for Western Australia in Melbourne and halfway through the match against Victoria he popped down to the Junction Oval, which is a short tram ride from St Kildas seafront, to mingle with his old teammates.         
	He is an experienced cricketer with a few years under his belt and is a level headed guy. He will be nervous but I dont think he will be overawed, Johnstone added.         
	He is confident in his own ability. He has taken a lot of wickets at club level and has shown he can step up already.         
	Beer cites Warne as an influence and will look to chat to his old St Kilda mate before the third Test.         
	He is always at you to make sure you are attacking and trying to get them out, Beer said. His way of thinking was to try and get them out and that is pretty similar to me.         
	They breed their cricketers to be tough at St Kilda and Beer has a reputation as a sharp talker on the field.         
	He gave Kevin Pietersen a withering send off when England played Western Australia at the start of their tour and Johnstone says he will not change if he is picked by Australia this week. He doesnt mind a chat, he said.         
	At St Kilda they hope Beer will play in the fourth Test at the MCG.         
	If the series is still alive after Perth, Cricket Australia will be confident of attracting a crowd close to 90,000 on Boxing Day and Beer would add local interest to persuade a few more through the turnstiles.         
	That really would complete the fairytale.                 THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

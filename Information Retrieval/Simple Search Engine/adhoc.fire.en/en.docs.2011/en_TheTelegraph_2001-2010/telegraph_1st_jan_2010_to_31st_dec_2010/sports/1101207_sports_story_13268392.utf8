	New Delhi: Star golfer Arjun Atwal, who became the first Indian to win a PGA Tour title, will be managed by World Sport Group (WSG) and Blue Giraffe Enterprises (BGE) in Asia.         
	Atwal triumphed in the PGA Tours Wyndham Championship in August and finished tied fifth in the USD 1.25 million Hero Honda India Open Sunday at the Delhi Golf Club.         
	I have played in many events promoted by World Sport Group over the years and have many friends there. So, I feel it is an exciting and sensible option to take.         
	It is important for me to still play in Asia as much as I can, as this is where it all started for me. World Sport Group have an enormous amount of experience here and I feel a lot can be achieved with such a strong partner, Atwal said.

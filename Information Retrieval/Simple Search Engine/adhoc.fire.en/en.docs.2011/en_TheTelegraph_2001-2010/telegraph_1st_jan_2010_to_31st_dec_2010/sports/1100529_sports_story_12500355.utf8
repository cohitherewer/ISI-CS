The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Good show by coaches
                                                                                                                       7                                      Good show by coaches
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The duo of Rituparna Roy and Kathakali Banerjee, representing the senior Bengal womens team, got A in the BCCI-organised Level A Refresher Course for aspiring coaches earlier this month.         
	Samiran Pal and Ghiasuddin Khan also got A upon successful completion of the course. Eight others were classified in Grade B. They are Kunal Basu, Nazar Rahim, Abhijit Chatterjee, Sanjay Das, Mukesh Kumar Sinha, Biswajit Mukherjee, Archan Datta and Tirtha Roy.         
	The most disappointing result, however, was from current member of junior selection committee, Sumit Shome. The former Bengal Ranji Trophy player was the only one who flunked the course, getting a poor Grade D.

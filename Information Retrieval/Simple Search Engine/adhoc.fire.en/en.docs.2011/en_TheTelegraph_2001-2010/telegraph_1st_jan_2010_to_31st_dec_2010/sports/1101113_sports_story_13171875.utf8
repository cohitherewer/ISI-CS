            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: In an effort to boost the cash-starved I-League, the AIFF, on Friday, roped in two top industrialists to head the championship for the 2010-11 season.         
	Postponed for want of sponsor and necessary financial backing this season, the I-League will now start on December 3. As per the estimates, the 14-team I-League this season would cost the AIFF around Rs 10 crore.         
	While steel magnet Sajjan Jindal has been appointed the chairman of the I-League, electronics giant Venugopal Dhoot has been named the deputy chairman by AIFF president Praful Patel.         
	According to AIFF sources, Jindal is expected to lend a helping hand to the AIFF to improve the infrastructure and Dhoot could come in as a sponsor for the league.         
	While some of the I-League clubs welcomed the move, others felt more needs to be done to make the league a professional affair.         
	Apart from scheduling and infrastructure, poor supervision remains the biggest problem, the official said. The referees posting should be strictly monitored and the right people should be there in the committee, he said.         
	East Bengal will begin their I-league campaign on December 3 with a home match against ONGC. The next day, Mohun Bagan will play Pune FC in Pune and Chirag United will take on AIFF XI in Calcutta. The matches between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan will be played on February 6 and March 5.

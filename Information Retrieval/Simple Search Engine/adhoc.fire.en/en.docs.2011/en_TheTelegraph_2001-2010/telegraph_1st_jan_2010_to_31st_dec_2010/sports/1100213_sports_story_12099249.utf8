The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Indians right to ask for a turner: Lance 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Indians right to ask for a turner: Lance 
  - Former SA all-rounder feels Proteas should continue putting pressure on the hosts       K. KUMARASWAMY            Klusener                                 
	Mumbai: Lance Klusener, the former South African all-rounder who decimated the Indian batting with his devastating spell of fast bowling at the Eden Gardens in his debut Test in 1996-97, feels that the Indians are right to ask for a turning track for the second Test.         
	Klusener, 38, in India as a commentator, spoke to The Telegraph about the on-going series, besides recalling his memories of playing in Calcutta as part of the late Hansie Cronjes team.               
	Following are the excerpts               
	Any happy memories of Eden Gardens         
	The thing about the Eden Gardens is its size and it was packed when we played. One of the things I do remember is that for every run and wicket Indians took there would bring a loud cheer and absolute silence when it went against them. It was amazing how so many people could be silent!         
	On his match-winning spell of 8/64         
	I didnt bowl well in the first innings, and Azharuddin was in good touch. But in the second (innings), I got some rhythm and the ball started to reverse. It was that kind of day when everything was going right for me. I could have bowled an orange and got a wicket!         
	South Africas performance in the ongoing series         
	South Africa have done really well. A few things before the series have helped them get the focus back, and they have realised that they have a shot at the No. 1 ranking. If they show the same kind of focus they showed in the first Test, there is no reason why they cannot put the Indians under pressure. Thats really the key.         
	If the home team should have a say about the pitch         
	Thats what home ground advantage is all about. Ideally, the home team should have some kind of say in what kind of wicket would suit them, but not to an extent where it becomes a dangerous pitch or an unfair advantage. If the Indian team wants a turning wicket, they should be allowed that. Its a fine line. The biggest fear of the groundsmen is that the pitch could become unplayable, so they prepare a good (batting) track. But the groundsmen also have a responsibility to players, to give what the team asks.         
	On Indias weakness against fast bowling         
	A middle order without Rahul and Laxman is not ideal. Also, they were up against probably the best fast bowling attack in the world. Coming off a Test series against Bangladesh, the Indians were caught off guard.         
	The 1999 World Cup         
	In that tournament, everything was going in favour of us. I was playing well at that time, and fortunately my form coincided with the World Cup.         
	That gut-wrenching loss to Australia in the semis...         
	My first priority was a four, but if single was on offer why not take it? I hit the ball up the ground and it went past the non-striker, forcing Allan to turn back. At that time I saw the ball going through the gap and took off, but he had his back to me and didnt hear the call. It was the kind of mix-up that cannot be allowed, but he can be forgiven for not hearing the call.         
	His role as one of the coaches at Kwa-Zulu Natal         
	I have been tasked with coaching the players in fast bowling and batting at the death.         
	Can anyone be taught how to bat at the death?         
	I think yes. Some are more natural strikers and clean hitters, and so they are more suited ... Its repetition really, getting into groove. We make the batters hit a lot of balls in the nets. Its about knowing how to go about the chase, in terms of runs per balls  but you need to hit a lot in practice to have the confidence.         
	On IPLs plans to go to the US         
	Ideally, you would want to take it to the US because it is a show-stopper. My problem there is the quality of pitches, although they have some fantastic grounds around there... Maybe they could take it around the world, one year in India, one year in England         
	If IPL could be termed as a domestic competition         
	Its moved on from there. Its become bigger than that ... The Indians are trying to keep it local. I think its time now for a feeder league where couple of retired IPL players can come and play.

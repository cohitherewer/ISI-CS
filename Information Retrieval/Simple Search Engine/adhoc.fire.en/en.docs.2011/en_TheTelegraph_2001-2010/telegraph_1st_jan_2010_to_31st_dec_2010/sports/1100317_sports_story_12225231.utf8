    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  MATTHEW HAYDEN MAKES HIS POINT             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Matthew Hayden                                 
	Calcutta: Matthew Hayden, one of the giants of the modern era, had a one on one with The Telegraph, at The ITC Sonar, on Monday evening. In town for Chennai Super Kings IPL clash against the Kolkata Knight Riders, he spoke for over 45 minutes.         
	With 8,500-plus runs in Tests (30x100) and over 6,000 in ODIs (10x100), Hayden, now 38, is eminently qualified to comment on the game.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q Youre now on the board of Cricket Australia. What exactly is your role?         
	A (Smiles) My portfolio is the development of womens cricket and looking to unearth indigenous cricketers. When I retired (early 2009), you may recall Id talked about cricketers with indigenous roots... Im passionate about the programme for them.         
	Whats TheHaydenWay, your company, all about?         
	Its wrapped around family values, my personal philosophy... The areas of focus are cricket, family and the leisure and lifestyle space... Wed also like to do consultancy work with franchises, CSK, for example... (Adds laughing) It has been a busy year since we last met, in IPL II.         
	As busy as when you were doing duty for Australia...         
	Ive been clear about where I want to go in life and its not about retiring, but stepping up and following the other areas of interest in my life.         
	But have you ever missed playing for Australia, say, when the team hasnt been doing well?         
	I dont regret having retired... Absolutely no regret at all, as Id squeezed out every ounce of potential (as an Australia player)... Im still playing, in the IPL, and could contribute to cricket through my business dealings... Im there to help forge better relationships.         
	What were your emotions when Australia lost the No.1 ranking in Tests, to South Africa, last August? Of course, the No.1 position is now with India...         
	Look, as a player, I was never driven by rankings... I didnt try and achieve a particular ranking... Secondly, I strongly believe that the ICCs rankings are inadequate... To make it meaningful, there must be a Test Championship, possibly every two years... Everybody looks forward to the 50-over World Cup, similarly, there has to be a Championship at the Test-level... There has to be an emotion with the rankings system and that will come through when theres a Test Championship in place. What Ive just told you isnt intended to be a slight on the ICC, but thats the way things are. (After a pause) Your peers and teammates are the ones to best judge just how youve scored an X number of runs or how youve taken an X number of wickets.         
	When could Australia be back as No.1 in Tests?         
	Quite honestly, Australia has very good Test and DI teams, its in T20 that weve struggled... Whatever the rankings say, were very close to again being the best in Test cricket.         
	[Right now, Australias No.3 in Tests and No.1 in ODIs.]         
	Are you in favour of day-night Test matches?         
	Not at all... Dont we already have day-night ODIs and T20 Internationals? The identity of Test cricket, with the challenges it offers, shouldnt change. In fact, if you ask me, Id say Test cricket should be even more traditional. Test cricket stands in a very special space, please allow it to remain there... Just create a lovely window for it... As Ive told you earlier, its a celebration of the game.         
	Your take on T20?         
	It has created a new audience... But if you and I are purists, then weve got to ask wheres all this going... Its very nice to have a product people instantly relate to... There has to be a link between the fan base and the product... Cricket is seeing a three-way split and there has to be a specifically targeted window of opportunities... With T20 coming in, the reality is that the landscape of cricket is being challenged and, so, a form of branding has to be associated with the other forms (Tests, ODIs)... Both other forms need a meaningful programme and weve got to look at Tests on benign wickets. Why would anybody want to go to such matches? Theres still an appetite for cricket at the highest level. Test cricket, where Im concerned, has to be treated with absolute respect.         
	Could the big money offered by the IPL franchises encourage cricketers to focus on T20 rather than aspiring to play at the highest level?         
	Not sure whether it would necessarily be because of the money... Players would like to earn, therefore a meaningful calendar has to be in place.         
	Its with good reasons that youre credited with having redrawn the rules for openers. Hasnt Virender Sehwag taken it to the next level?         
	(Grins) Sehwags one of three Indians in my non-Australia World XI... Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid are the other two... The list will be out in my book... Cricket is about entertainment and Sehwags brand of cricket definitely entertains... Some of the other openers are doing the same thing... Gautam Gambhir, Shane Watson...         
	What would be your message for young openers?         
	Look to challenge the traditional ways of getting at the opposition... Dominate... Adapt...         
	You looked to dominate from the very first ball...         
	My strategy would always be to punch hard first and wait for the opposition to get off balance. I dont know why I wanted to go about it that way, but I felt that to be right... It helped that I had such a good partner (Justin Langer).         
	Your thoughts on Sachin?         
	Sachin and Ricky Ponting are quite alike, in that they keep rebranding themselves... Obviously, Sachin loves the game, otherwise, he wouldnt have been around for 20 years... He has always been an incredibly formidable opponent... Aggressive, but in a non-threatening way... The mark of a truly great player is having the ability to do well overseas... Sachin has been a big performer, both home and away.         
	Nasser Hussain believes Sachin is greater than Sir Donald Bradman; Steve Waughs vote is for Sir Don. Where do you stand in this debate?         
	Such debates are irrelevant. Different eras, different wickets, different bats... What Id say is that a successful player of one era would be (as) successful in another. Sir Don was a special player, Sachin is a special player... Comparisons, though, are pointless.         
	When do you intend using the bionic bat you launched last week?         
	At some point, when I have a particular strategy in mind... The Mongoose bat is an innovative brand... One moves with the times, but the advantage for a batsman should come through the mind rather than other things.         
	Former Australia Prime Minister John Howard will head the ICC from 2012. Your views?         
	Johns a great lover of cricket and is quite traditional... Hell be at the helm at a challenging time and I find that interesting... He knows the value of relationships and can definitely handle (political) issues.         
	The final one: How is your cooking going?         
	(Laughs) Im doing a show back in Australia, its called the Matthew Hayden Home Ground... Ive converted my property (in Brisbane) into a sustainable kitchen garden... Culturally, Australia and India cross and both love food... Its another binding factor.

	New Delhi: The sports minister MS Gill Tuesday found himself in a fresh controversy after he snubbed grappler Sushil Kumars coach Satpal Singh by asking him to step aside during a photo opportunity at his residence here.         
	The incident took place when World Championship gold medallist Sushil, along with his personal trainer Satpal and national team coach Yashvir, visited Gills official residence to meet him after becoming achieving the feat of becoming the first world champion from India, in Moscow, on Sunday.         
	After congratulating Sushil and seeing his medal, the duo went for the photo opportunity and Gill started looking for the coach to stand beside them.         
	When Satpal, who was conferred the Dronacharya award last year, appeared on the scene, Gill told him to step aside and instead called Yashvir, who accompanied the Indian team during the event in Moscow.         
	I want the coach who went to Moscow with him, Gill said before Yashvir stood beside Sushil for the session.         
	Gill, however, later also requested Satpal to join them.         
	The shabby treatment to Satpal did not go down well with Sushil who said the incident was unfortunate.         
	He is my guru and there are around 100 wrestlers who take lessons from him. If he is not respected, then it is natural for a disciple to feel bad. What happened was not correct, he said.         
	He is a good trainer, I have a lot of respect for him. He has trained me since childhood, Sushil added.         
	But Satpal, a gold medallist in the 1982 Asian Games, chose to play down the incident.         
	I did not like it. But this is a happy occasion, so lets talk about Sushils achievement, Satpal said later.         
	A more or less similar incident had happened when shuttler Saina Nehwal had visited the sports minister after her return from the Beijing Olympics in August 2008.         
	At that time, Gill had asked Sainas coach Pullela Gopichand to identify him. Gopichand, a player of repute himself and a winner of many awards, had to face the embarrassment of introducing himself.         
	In the meet, the Olympic bronze medallist, overcame Russias Gogaev Alan 3-1 in the final to clinch the gold.         
	He had defeated Azerbaijans Hasanov Jabrayil in the semi-final of the free style 66kg category event.         
	After getting a bye in the first round, he beat Akritidis of Greece, Martin Sebastian of Germany and Buyan Jav of Mongolia en route to the final.         
	All other Indian contenders had crashed out before the finals in the championship.           (PTI)

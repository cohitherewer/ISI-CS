            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Stuart Broad has been fined 50 per cent of his applicable match fee for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the third days play, in the second Test against Pakistan, at Edgbaston, on Sunday, according to a media release.         
	Broad was charged with a Level 2 offence under article 2.2.7 of the Code which relates to throwing the ball at or near a player, umpire or official in an inappropriate/and or dangerous manner.         
	The right-hander pleaded guilty to the charge and as such, under the provisions of the code, the matter was determined by Ranjan Madugalle of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees without the need for a full hearing.         
	The incident that led to the charge being laid took place at the end of the 63rd over when Broad, after finishing his over, threw the ball inappropriately/dangerously at the facing batsman Zulqarnain Haider who had not moved from his position.

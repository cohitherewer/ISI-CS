                                                                                                                       7                                      Barca close in on Villa, woo Cesc
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Barcelona vice-president Rafael Yuste has confirmed the Spanish champions are closing in on the signing of David Villa and remain hopeful of negotiating a deal for Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas.         
	Barca retained the Primera Division crown at the weekend but have already earmarked potential new signings for next season as they attempt to counteract what could be another summer of heavy spending from archrivals Real Madrid.         
	Valencia striker Villa and Fabregas top their wanted list but Yuste admits the two deals are at different stages.         
	He told a Catalonian radio station: Negotiations are progressing well especially in the case of Villa.         
	The situation with Cesc is different because even if you have the will of the player it is very important to talk to his club and, if you can, find an agreement.         
	But what makes it easier is that both players want to come to Barca.         
	Fabregas, who played alongside Lionel Messi in the Barcelona youth ranks before moving to Arsenal in 2003, sent mixed messages over his future last week when he attended a promotional event in Barcelona.         
	He said: You see your (Spanish) teammates succeeding here (in Barcelona) and it is exciting because you have worked alongside them for so long.         
	I think I would like to go to Barcelona, whether or not they want me is another thing.         
	However, the Spain international  who has a long-term contract with Arsenal  also stressed: I dont know when it will happen. I am happy at Arsenal and I am not in a rush to leave.         
	Barcelona have also confirmed they are in talks with New York Red Bulls over a deal that would see Thierry Henry move to Major League Soccer after next months World Cup.         
	Henry, who joined the Spanish champions from Arsenal in 2007, has played down reports that he has already signed a pre-contract agreement with the Red Bulls - however, Barcelona have revealed that talks are underway.

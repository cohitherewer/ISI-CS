The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi: We do well under pressure
                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridi: We do well under pressure
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	South Africa captain Graeme Smith didnt hide his disappointment after his team bowed out of the World Twenty20 losing to Pakistan by 11 runs in their final Super Eight encounter at the Gros Islet on Monday.         
	South Africa finished last in the group having lost two of their three matches with a dismal net-run rate of 0.62. Stating that he has run out of excuses for defeat, Smith, at the post-match presentation ceremony, admitted that his batsmen lacked fluency.         
	Winning captain Shahid Afridi lauded the Akmal brothers, Umar and Akmal, for their show with the bat. He was also happy with his own performance as a batsman.         
	Man of the Match Umar, who scored a 33-ball 51, said that the support from his coach and captain helped him to do well. Umar also said that the Gros Islet pitch was better than the one at Bridgetown.               
	The following are excerpts                 
	Afridi: I want to thank the Almighty for this victory. I think the boys really performed well. Especially the Akmal brothers  Kamran and Umar. Their partnership (51 runs for the fourth wicket) was an important one in the context of the game. My partnership with Umar was also a vital one. I think any total between 140 to 150 was really a good one on this track. We have always done well under pressure and we have proved again that we can perform when we have our backs to the wall. It was important for me as captain to lead the way and I have been able to do that. The bowlers also performed brilliantly.         
	Smith: We have run out of excuses. The simple fact is that we didnt play well enough to make it to the semi-finals. Its not that our batsmen have been found wanting against the spinners Its just that we didnt bat well enough. We have struggled throughout the tournament. In general, our batsmen lacked fluency. In this tournament, we have struggled to get going in all three departments. However, I cant say we have learnt any lesson from this tournament. But it has been a disappointing tournament for us.         
	Umar Akmal: I dedicate this performance and the victory to the Almighty and my parents. I got full support from the coach and the captain. There was full backing from Shahid bhai and that helped. There was absolutely no pressure on me. The pitch was better than the one we played in Barbados. It was beautiful for batting and I enjoyed hitting the ball.

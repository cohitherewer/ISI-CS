                                                                                                                       7                                      Hayden praise for Raina
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Matthew Hayden, Suresh Rainas teammate at the Chennai Super Kings, has congratulated the latest Indian cricketer to score a century on Test debut, on his Facebook.         
	I want to take this opportunity to personally congratulate my friend Suresh Raina on being an outstanding ambassador for Indian cricket , Hayden wrote.         
	There seemed an inevitability about Sureshs individual success  both making his Test debut for India and now his debut Test century. The star of Raina is a bright one.         
	Hayden added: I am looking forward to seeing him again in a little over a month when we will be together again in South Africa for the Champions League.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hockey stalemate continues
                                                                                                                       7                                        Hockey stalemate continues
  - Striking players walk out of meeting, given 48-hour deadline to resume training     
	New Delhi/Pune: There was no end in sight Tuesday to the worst crisis in Indian hockey after the striking players walked out of a meeting with top officials, to which Hockey India (HI) responded by issuing a fresh ultimatum  for them to either resume training within 48 hours or face axing from the World Cup squad.         
	On a day of hectic meetings and dramatic developments, both the players and HI stuck to their guns and failed to arrive at an understanding on the payments dispute giving rise to the possibility of India fielding a second-string team for next months event in New Delhi.         
	While HI said it did not have the requisite funds to pay the players, the campers appeared in no mood to relent as the meeting ended with no immediate signs of an early settlement.         
	HI president A.K. Mattoo said it was sad that the players chose money over their country with the February 28-March 13 mega-event just round the corner.         
	Any player who is in the complex has to train but it seems for them (players) money is more important than playing for the country, Mattoo told a news conference in Pune.         
	No one has been thrown out of the camp. The players have been given 48 hours to resume training. If they decide not to then the camp will be shut, Mattoo said.         
	Unperturbed by HIs threat to field a fresh team in the World Cup, the defiant players ruled out rejoining the camp unless their demands were met.         
	Captain Rajpal Singh and senior players Prabhjot Singh, Dipak Thakur, Adrian DSouza and Arjun Halappa argued that the HI offer of Rs 25,000 per player would suit a school side but not the national team players who, they said, were mentally prepared to leave the camp.         
	Dismissing the HI allegation that the players put money before national honour, Rajpal said: We came here to practise and not skip training. And its not a crime if we talk about our rights.         
	HI said they dont have money. In that case, we dont want to increase their burden and all 22 players are ready to fund their own World Cup preparations. But, the thing is, they have to give us a written assurance, which they are not ready to do, Rajpal said.         
	Mattoo said a different set of players would be representing India at the World Cup if the disgruntled players did not report to the camp within the stipulated deadline.         
	We arent saying that we are sacking or suspending them, but they will not be able to take part in the World Cup, the HI chief said.         
	I am not suspending the camp, I am closing it for the time being and it will reopen after a few days. India will participate in the World Cup irrespective of whether they (the seniors) play or not. We will look for fresh players, Mattoo added.         
	Mattoo said the players refused to budge despite an assurance that their grievances would be addressed after the HI elections, scheduled for February 7.         
	I told the players that I had an x amount of money in hand. If I gave it to them, Id have to give it to the womens as well as the junior teams.         
	I told them that all their demands would be conveyed to the new body and then we will see what is best for them, he said.         
	International Hockey Federation (FIH) vice-president Antonio von Ondarza expressed shock over the development and said that with just six weeks left for the World Cup, the players should be concentrating on their training.         
	I heard allegations by both sides. Its really a very sad story. If you come to a negotiation and refuse to move, its not going to succeed, Ondarza said.         
	HI has just come into being and its an interim body. How can it commit for the future? With just 10 weeks to go for the World Cup, players should not put pressure on HI. They should concentrate on their training, he added.           (PTI)

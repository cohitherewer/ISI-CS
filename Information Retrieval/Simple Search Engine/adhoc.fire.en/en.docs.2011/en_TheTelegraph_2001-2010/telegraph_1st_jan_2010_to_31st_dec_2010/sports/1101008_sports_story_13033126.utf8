	New Delhi: On a day when their more illustrious compatriots failed to live up to the billing, Indian pistol shooters stole the limelight, winning two more gold medals in the Commonwealth Games.         
	Gurpreet Singh, a 22-year-old from Tarn Taran district of Punjab, was the home teams hero at the Karni Singh range, on Thursday. He first paired up with Vijay Kumar, to bag the sixth shooting gold for India in the 25m rapid fire pistol pairs event and then teamed up with Omkar Singh to win his second yellow metal in the 10m air pistol event.         
	In both the events, Indians broke the Games records set by them four years back in Melbourne. So far, India have won seven gold medals in shooting.                   
	Never in my life had I competed in two events in one day, said Gurpreet later. Here, I was apprehensive about the schedule, but finally managed to win both the gold medals. Tomorrow (Friday), I will again have to compete in two more events in the individual category.         
	In the 25m rapid fire pistol pairs, Vijay (587) and Gurpreet (575) shot 1162 to win the gold ahead of Malaysia and Australia. In 10m air pistol, Omkar (587) and Gurpreet (576) shot 1163 and broke the Games record (1154) set by Indian pair Samresh Jung and Vivek Singh, in Melbourne.         
	However, the double delight in pistol events could not hide the hosts disappointment in double trap. Despite the presence of two leading shooters  Ronjan Sodhi and Asher Noria  the gold medal was clinched by Steve Walton of England. In a close contest, Sodhi, a world record holder, had to remain satisfied with the silver medal in a three-way shoot out, while Asher Noria finished fourth.                   
	Watched by a capacity crowd that included former Olympic silver medallist and defending champion Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Walton won the gold by shooting 190 out of 200, while Noria, Sodhi and Isle of Mans Tim Kneale were tied at 186 for the second place, after the final round.         
	In a three-way shoot-off, Sodhi was on target on all the four attempts to clinch the silver, while Noria buckled under pressure and missed his seventh shot to allow Kneale to bag the bronze. Australias former Olympic champion Russel Mark finished fifth.         
	Given the drama that surrounded the selection of the Indian double trap squad on the eve of the Commonwealth Games, the performance of Sodhi and Noria was a big disappointment. While Rathore was dropped from the squad as he skipped the trials, Noria was specially inducted for his showings in the world junior meet.         
	There is too much pressure on the shooters...everyone is talking about the gold medals only. Thats not a good sign in front of the home crowd, said Marcello Dradi, the famous trap coach.         
	In the womens 50m rifle 3-position event, Indias 50m prone world champion Tejaswini Sawant (568) failed to qualify for the finals as she finished ninth, while her compatriot Lajja Gauswami ended sixth with a total score 666.8.         
	The gold went to Australia.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Navratilova diagnosed with breast cancer
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Martina Navratilova                           
	Martina Navratilova has been diagnosed with breast cancer, describing it as my personal 9/11. The tennis star, nine-time Wimbledon champion, has undergone a lumpectomy and begins a six-week course of radiation therapy next month.         
	Doctors said the disease had been detected early and the prognosis is excellent. She was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a non-invasive form of breast cancer.         
	Navratilov, 53, was diagnosed after a routine mammogram in January revealed a cluster in her left breast. Describing the moment when her biopsy result came back positive, she told an entertainment magazine: I cried. It knocked me on my ass, really. I feel so in control of my life and my body, and then this comes, and its completely out of my hands.         
	It was pure luck that the disease was spotted early because she had missed regular breast screening check-ups, Navratilova said.         
	I went four years between mammograms. I let it slide. Everyone gets busy, but dont make excuses. I stay in shape and eat right, and it happened to me. Another year and I could have been in big trouble.         
	Speaking on an America television show, Navratilova said: I found out February 24  that was my personal 9/11. I was shocked because I was so sure that the calcifications were benign. I found out and I was devastated. Physically I couldnt think, I couldnt move, I was useless... I have been healthy all my life and all of a sudden I have cancer. Are you kidding me?         
	At first she planned to keep the news private, but decided to speak out to urge other women to have regular mammograms. Scrape those last dollars, get that health care insurance, she said.         
	The Czech-born tennis star underwent a lumpectomy on March 15 to remove cancerous tissue.         
	Two weeks later, she took part in a triathlon. She plans to begin her radiation treatment in Paris, allowing her to work as a commentator on the French Open.         
	Mindy Nagle, who is treating Navratilova, said the prognosis is excellent. It was the best-case scenario you could imagine for detecting breast cancer, she said.

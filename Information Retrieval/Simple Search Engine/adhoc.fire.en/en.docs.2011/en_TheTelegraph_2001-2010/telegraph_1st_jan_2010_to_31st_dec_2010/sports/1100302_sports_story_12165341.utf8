                                                                                                                       7                                      Hussey eyes Dhonis spot
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Australia batsman Michael Hussey will have another chance to regain the No. 1 batting position in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship when Australia go head to head with New Zealand in the five-match ODI series, the first match being in Napier on Wednesday.         
	Hussey had briefly claimed the top spot from India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni after a successful series against Pakistan in which he had scored 220 runs.         
	With only 10 points separating the two batsmen, Hussey has a good opportunity not only to retake the top spot position but also retain it for a longer period as India has no ODI commitments until May.         
	In the team rankings, fourth-placed New Zealand can leapfrog India in the second place if they manage a 5-0 clean sweep against the Aussies, who have already secured the No. 1 spot for the annual cut-off date of April 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Full points on Bagans mind
                                                                                                                       7                                      Full points on Bagans mind
            A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: Visiting teams are often satisfied to finish with a point in away matches, but HAL, the new entrants in I-League this year, might be hungry for more. And they have reason enough to aim high as they had sprung a surprise in their maiden match by beating JCT, in their own den.         
	That might be on Mohun Bagans mind when they lock horns with HAL, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday. Bagan, for the record, had to be satisfied with just a point after drawing their opening match, an away tie, against Pune FC. Bagan coach Stanley Rozario will surely be cautious about the surprise element that the underdogs often come up with.         
	However, Pune FC are one of the better teams in the tournament and while a draw against them will keep Bagans morale high, it will be important for the hosts to utilise the home advantage to its fullest.         
	Even though Rozarios aim is to log full points from the match, he is not too pleased with an afternoon start. I-League games should be played under lights. These are important matches and theres no reason why such matches should be played so early (1.45 pm), Rozario said.         
	But such trivial issues cant bog down Rozario. We played well in the last match. This time, well be playing in home conditions and our aim will be to get full points. They are unpredictable but well try and play attacking football, he said.         
	Born and brought up in Bangalore, Rozario is well abreast of HALs style of play. Most of their players are from Manipur, Bangalore and Kerala. They are quite energetic and can run well. Weve to plug them at the right areas and form our attacks, he said.         
	Bagan winger Gouranga Dutta will miss Wednesdays clash (due to marriage) and either Ashim Biswas or Ishfaq Ahmed will replace him. Defender Kingshuk Debnath is injured but Edeh Chidi, who is carrying a hamstring injury, should be available.         
	Bagan will look at Snehasish Chakraborty for his overlapping runs and the strike force of Chidi and Murithala Ali. Jose Barreto and Manish Maithani will keep things mobile in the mid-field, while Harpreet Singh and Rahul Kumar will be the two stopper backs. Dhanarajan and Biswajit Saha will aid them on the sides.         
	Rozario doesnt want to give any space to the HAL striker Abdulla Hamza and hopes to neutralise any threat from former India forward RC Prakash.         
	Maybe, the Bagan coach has reservations about playing in the afternoon sun. But, he wont mind if his team turns up the heat on the visitors to garner three points.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I should be reborn as Viru: Dravid 
                                                                                                                       7                                        I should be reborn as Viru: Dravid 
  - Batting for long hours has taken a lot out of me         OUR CORRESPONDENT             Mahendra Singh Dhoni, on way to his 98, in Nagpur, on Monday                                 
	Nagpur: Rahul Dravid says he doesnt worry about age-related questions but concentrates on giving his best every time he walks out to bat. At a press conference here, on Monday, Dravid also said he is never worried about failure or what people are saying about him.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On being among runs ahead of the South Africa series         
	Its always nice to have runs behind you when you go on a tour like that... The wickets will be different from the last three series we have played at home. While we can take confidence from the fact that weve runs behind us, we got to be aware that conditions are going to be vastly different.         
	Views on his innings         
	I started off a bit rusty in Ahmedabad, but I got my fluency back as the innings progressed. Its satisfying and nice to complete the job You see the end result. Its something I havent done for a while... Credit should also be given to New Zealand... Right through the series, they bowled the right line and length. Other than Viru, none of us have been able to dominate (Daniel) Vettori.         
	On his role in getting India a big lead         
	Its nice... Credit must go to the bowlers because they got them out for 193. We have got 400-plus in nearly every game The bowlers have also batted well. Credit must go to them to help us set this big score. Hopefully, now, we can get them out tomorrow and the day after.         
	His dismissal on 191         
	I was disappointed. I worked so hard to get that far. It would have been nice to get another nine runs. I was trying to lift it over mid-off but... I should have committed myself fully rather than trying to chip it          
	On batting for long periods         
	At any stage in my career, batting for long hours has taken a lot out of me. I love and enjoy batting long periods of time Well I guess, I have to bat long periods of time if I have to score runs I should be reborn as Viru one day That would be nice! Thats the way I play. I like the contest. It does take a lot out of you, physically, mentally, emotionally It always has.         
	If its disappointing to get out to deliveries well outside off stump         
	I got out to the left-arm quicks against Australia 2-3 times. It was a bit disappointing. I knew that it was an area I had to work on. I have put some time at the NCA, with the coaches there, and also Gary (Kirsten) here, just to tighten up my lines a little bit. Worked on trying to hit as straight as possible rather than opening the face of my bat.         
	On the state of the match         
	It still is a good wicket. It was not turning and bouncing a lot It was nice to see that we got some turn at the end of the day. The ball is hard. The first two-and-a-half hour tomorrow is going to be critical.         
	If the age factor plays a part in cricket         
	Its about scoring runs... You do expect the fact that when youre at a certain age and dont do well, people are going to ask questions. You have to accept it. As long as the team is supporting and backing you, thats all you can ask for.         
	On how he copes with age-related questions         
	They dont worry me at all... At the end of the day I can only ask myself whether I am giving my best, whether I am preparing as well as I can whether I am ticking all the boxes, be it physical, technical skills, mental preparation in terms of how I am feeling emotionally and spiritually There are four or five boxes that I need to tick every time. Sometimes you get the results, sometimes you dont. Thats life, thats sport. I dont think about failure or what people are saying. I give my best effort.         
	His views on Suresh Rainas sudden lean form         
	We all recognise that he is a terrific talent. Anyone who bats the way he does I think hes a fantastic player. Test cricket is a hard school; its a learning school. I think he will be better off from these experiences. We have lot of confidence in him. Big knocks are around the corner. He has to just keep his chin up, and, hopefully, he will get it right in South Africa.         
	On taking catch No. 200         
	(Laughs) It will come! My fingers are at the moment in the wars. I am fielding in the places where the ball is not likely to come. I would like to go back to slips because thats what I love and enjoy, but at the moment my fingers are getting a pounding and beating at all sorts of places. So, hopefully, it will come some day.         
	On Anil Kumble and Jawagal Srinath winning in the KSCA polls         
	Its nice that Anil and Sri (Jawagal Srinath), people I have known for so many years, and almost the whole group have won... We have got a good mandate, we respect and recognise the mandate and know that there is lot of work to be done.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag beat Sesa 1-0
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag beat Sesa 1-0
                      
	Vasco: Chirag United scored a hard-fought 1-0 win over Sesa Football Academy in a Group B quarter final league match of the Federation Cup, on Tuesday.         
	The young outfit from Goa, who came through the qualifiers after beating sides like Vasco Sports Club and Sporting Clube de Goa, lost despite giving a tough fight at the Tilak Maidan ground.         
	Matching the fancied Calcuttans, Sesa dictated terms in the second half where they had innumerable chances, but poor finishing cost them the match.         
	Chirag, who enjoyed a prolonged possession in the first half, scored through Denson Devadas. The midfielder could have doubled the lead just before the break, but his attempt hit the post.         
	In another match, a second half brace by Odafe Okolie helped Churchill Brothers to a 4-0 win over Viva Kerala. Churchill opened its account with a controversial goal in the 39th minute by Koko Sakibo. Okolie scored in the 57th and 65th minute and Rouhollah Samieinia put the match beyond Viva Kerala with a strike in the 75th minute.

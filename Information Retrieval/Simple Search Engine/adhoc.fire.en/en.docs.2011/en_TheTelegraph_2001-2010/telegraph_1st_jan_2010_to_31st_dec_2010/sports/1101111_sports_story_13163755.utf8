The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its shameful, says Imran
                                                                                                                       7                                      Its shameful, says Imran
                      
	Karachi: Former captain Imran Khan has called for a clean-up of Pakistan cricket and said wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haiders sudden exit to Britain to seek asylum was a shameful incident.         
	It is really shameful the way he left the team and reached London, Imran said, on Wednesday. At the moment we dont know the facts that compelled him to do this, but nevertheless it is another embarrassing moment for Pakistan and its people.         
	Sadly this incident only gives credence to the feeling our players are linked with bookmakers or are controlled by them. The recent spot-fixing allegations have not been helpful at all for Pakistan cricket, added Imran.         
	Imran said he was never threatened in his 21 years in international cricket. We need to clean up the administration and the team and those players who, if they are involved in corruption, should not be spared, added Imran. I dont think the ICC is against us, he said.         
	Wasim Akram slammed the Pakistan Cricket Board for mismanaging the Haider controversy and said the inability of the Board has left the players vulnerable.         
	I feel that the PCB is not capable of handling Pakistan cricket. It has failed to strike a bond of trust with the players, which has left players insecure and vulnerable.         
	Former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal, too, criticised Haiders decision to leave the team hotel after claiming he was getting threats from match-fixers.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Shock loss for Nikolay
                      
	Valencia: Gilles Simon outplayed Nikolay Davydenko for a 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-3 victory, on Friday, to reach the semi-finals of the Valencia Open.         
	Simon converted five of his six break points, including his only chance in the fifth game of the first set, when the sixth-seeded Davydenko sent a crosscourt backhand wide. Simon saved all three break points he faced in the first set.         
	Simon meets lucky loser Marcel Granollers next after the Spanish player rallied from a terrible start to beat Juan Monaco 1-6, 6-3, 6-4.

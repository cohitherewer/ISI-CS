The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Taylor century lights up day
                                                                                                                       7                                      Taylor century lights up day
                      
	Hamilton: Ross Taylor raced to New Zealands fastest Test century but the hosts failed to support their red hot teammate and the sides finished almost level after the second day of the second Test here Sunday.         
	New Zealand earned a slender 33-run advantage after Taylors 138 off 104 balls took them to 264, a first-innings total which could have been so much stronger, according to Cricinfo.         
	Shane Watson, who survived a reviewed lbw appeal from Brent Arnel, drove well to be 28 while Simon Katich was six as Australia went to stumps at 35 without loss. Bad light ended play 24 overs early, and the visitors will begin day three two runs ahead.         
	While Taylor exploded in a jaw-dropping display, Australia were able to get regular breakthroughs, often through Mitchell Johnson, even though they gave Taylor three lives. Taylor reached his century in 81 deliveries, beating the 82-ball effort of Daniel Vettori against Zimbabwe, and blasted four sixes and 19 fours. He wanted to show his side would not be intimidated by Australia, and he wasnt but not many of his teammates shared the belief.         
	In the first session, Taylor received help from opener BJ Watling, who worked hard over his 46, but that was the second highest score as the rest were unable to contribute more than Tim Southees late 22.

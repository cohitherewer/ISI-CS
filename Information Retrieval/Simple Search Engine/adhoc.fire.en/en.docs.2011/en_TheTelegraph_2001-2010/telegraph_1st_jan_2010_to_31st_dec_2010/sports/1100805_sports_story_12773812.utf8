            A STAFF REPORTER            Bengal players wait in the dugout during the power failure, at Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: A power trip ruined the show at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. But wait a minute         
	If one thinks it was another of those shameful dark episodes when the floodlights blinked and ate away a few minutes of a match, he/she would be spot on.         
	However, fact is, it was not only the voltage, but also 29-time winners Bengal who had a power trip as they successfully transformed a promising start into a rudderless display by the final whistle.         
	Playing their last quarter final league match, against Tamil Nadu, in the 64th edition of the Santosh Trophy, the hosts surrendered a 1-0 advantage to go down 1-2.         
	With both the teams being assured of a semi-final berth even before kick-off (after Delhi and Mizoram played out a goalless draw earlier in the day), the battle was all about group supremacy.         
	And Bengal flunked, quite foolishly at that.         
	Tamil Nadu emerged group toppers and second-placed Bengal will now have to fight it out against the mighty Goans in the semis on Friday. Tamil Nadu will face Punjab in the other semi-final.         
	The start, for Bengal, however, was as bright as their last outing against Mizoram when they ran riot with a 7-1 victory.         
	Jayanta Sen and Denson Devadas co-ordinated well in the middle, Snehasish Chakraborty and Gauranga Dutta looked enterprising enough down the flanks. In short, things were near perfect for Shabbir Alis boys.         
	Repeated forays finally bore fruit in the 16th minute when Jayantas splitting through released Nilendra Dewan at the top of the rival box. Dewan took a quick diagonal grounder that beat keeper Arun Pradeep hands down.         
	But Tamil Nadu struck in the very next minute. V.R. Murugappan flicked one past Sandip Nandy to make it 1-1.         
	Stung by the equaliser, Bengal, instead of launching counter attacks, looked even more paralysed. Tamil Nadu sealed the match in the 79th minute when P.C. Riju played an excellent one-two with M. Elamurugana and dodged past a diving Sandip to slot home in a neat finish.         
	The actual power trip was in the 50th minute and it took 25 minutes for the lights to come back on.         
	Looks like power trip was the theme of the day!         
	Teams         
	Tamil Nadu: Arun Pradeep, V.R. Murugappan, Naveen Kumar, M. Pradeep, Arul Mani (P. Sudhakar, 18), P.C. Riju, K. Satish, D. Ravanan, Parthiban, K.P. Muthu Swamy (C.S. Sabeeth, 90), M Ramesh (Elamurugan, 70)         
	Bengal: Sandip Nandy, Dhanarajan, Anupam Sarkar, Safar Sardar, Rajiv Ghosh, Gauranga Dutta, Jayanta Sen, Denson Devadas, Snehasish Chakraborty (Subhas Chakraborty, 80), Shankar Oraon (Robin Singh, 66), Nilendra Dewan         
	Referee: Pratap Singh

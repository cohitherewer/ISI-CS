The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ronaldinho is left out
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ronaldinho is left out
                      
	London: Ronaldinho was left out of Brazils initial World Cup squad, Francesco Totti and Luca Toni were missing from Italys squad and Jamie Carragher came out of retirement for England.         
	The coaches of the 32 teams headed for next months championship in South Africa faced a Fifa deadline Tuesday to announce provisional 30-man squads.         
	The lists included some walking wounded who hope to be fit for the tournament, and some unexpected inclusions.         
	Ronaldinho, Adriano and Neymar were omitted from Brazil coach Dungas initial 23-man list. They could be among the seven more players to be announced later by Dunga, but would only be on standby in case of injuries. The coach has stuck to most of the players who helped Brazil win last years Confederations Cup and finish top of South American qualifying.         
	These players are winners, Dunga said. There is no doubt that they are prepared to help Brazil reach its goal. They are ready to give their best for the country.         
	Ruud van Nistelrooy was left out of the Netherlands squad despite having recovered from a long-term knee injury. Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk said the 34-year-old former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker was not at a high enough level to play at the World Cup.         
	There was speculation that Totti might also come out of international retirement to help Italy defend the World Cup. When Marcello Lippis squad was announced Tuesday, there was no sign of his name, nor that of Toni, despite seven strikers being picked.         
	Because the final 23 must come from these provisional lists, that means no chance for Totti of Toni unless there is a serious injury to one of the other squad members.         
	Spains Xavi Hernandez, Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres are also carrying injuries but were picked with the deadline for the final squad being three weeks away.         
	Eighteen of the Spain squad of 23 that triumphed impressively at the 2008 European Championship are in this one, too.         
	Carragher quit Englands national team three years ago, complaining he could never get a start under coach Steve McClaren. But the 32-year-old Liverpool defender was in the 30-man squad announced by Fabio Capello. Capello included Gareth Barry even though the Manchester City midfielder is sidelined for three weeks with ankle ligament damage.         
	Switzerland selected their final squad of 23 three weeks early and have included 18-year-old Xherdan Shaqiria, who has only 45 minutes international experience.         
	Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has a largely European-based squad of players that features Didier Drogba, whose 29 goals helped Chelsea win the Premier League.

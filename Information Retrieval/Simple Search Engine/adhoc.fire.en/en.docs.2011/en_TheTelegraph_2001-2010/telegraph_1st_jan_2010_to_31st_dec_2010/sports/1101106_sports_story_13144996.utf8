	Sao Paulo: Red Bull set the pace in the first practice session for the Brazilian Grand Prix, with Sebastian Vettel leading teammate Mark Webber with the fastest time.         
	Vettel clocked one minute, 12.328 seconds at the 4.3-kilometre (2.6-mile) Interlagos track, 0.482 ahead of Webber and 0.517 in front of Lewis Hamilton of McLaren. Hamiltons teammate Jenson Button was fourth, 0.939 behind Vettel.         
	Leader Fernando Alonso of Ferrari was only the 13th fastest and failed to finish the session because of an engine failure as time was about to expire.         
	Five drivers remain in contention for the title  Alonso, Webber, Hamilton, Vettel and Button. Alonso has an 11-point lead over Webber and can clinch his third F1 title at the Brazilian GP. The season-finale will be on November 14 in Abu Dhabi.         
	Alonso slowed down after exiting the first set of corners, stopping his Ferrari at the beginning of the backstraight and leaving the car.         
	He was using an older engine and Ferrari said it was expecting to make a change in his car for the rest of the weekend. The team has been trying to save engines because Alonso was already on his eighth unit this season. His best time was 1.918 seconds slower than Vettels.         
	Ferrari driver Felipe Massa also struggled and was only the 14th fastest in front of his home crowd, nearly two seconds off the fastest time.         
	The morning session was uneventful until the final minutes, with drivers staying on the track under clear skies in Sao Paulo.         
	Earlier, Vettel said he was confident about his chances of winning the Formula One title, despite his non-finish in the Korean Grand Prix, which put a serious dent in his championship ambitions.         
	He dropped to fourth place in the standings after suffering an engine failure while leading with 10 laps to go in Korea. He trails McLarens Lewis Hamilton by four points, teammate Mark Webber by 14 points and Fernando Alonso of Ferrari by 25 points heading into Sundays Brazilian GP.         
	What happened in Korea was a big disappointment, Vettel said. But we learned a lesson. Right at that point I was already thinking about the next race.         
	Vettel said he performed well despite the result, raising his hopes for a comeback in the final two races of the season.         
	It was a very difficult race and I was very proud of the way we handled it, the German driver said. There was a lot of positives. Unfortunately, we stopped because of the engine failure. It was not in our hands, so you have to move on.         
	Vettel feels he needs to win Sundays race at Interlagos to guarantee he will go to the season-finale in Abu Dhabi still in contention for the drivers championship. Ideally we need to try to win both races and then see where we are, he said.         
	Vettel started from pole position nine times in 17 races this year, but won only three times  the Malaysian GP, the European GP and the Japanese GP.         
	The Red Bulls have been the dominant car all year but were not able to capitalise on their chances. (Agencies)

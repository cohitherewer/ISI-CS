The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | French stars in spot of bother

                  Franck Ribery after being shown the red card, on Wednesday                     
	Paris: The police probe into a suspected prostitution ring at a Paris nightspot has cast serious doubt as to whether France footballers Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema will be called into the teams World Cup squad.         
	Ribery has already testified, and Benzema is set to be questioned over alleged sexual relations with an underage prostitute operating out of a trendy Paris club.         
	With France coach Raymond Domenech set to name his squad in about three weeks, the sex scandal could not have come at a worse time for the beleaguered team. It follows a difficult qualifying campaign, during which Ribery was one of the rare players to shine.         
	Domenech favours tranquillity and seclusion at team camps during major tournaments, but the headlines around Europe show no signs of going away. At the World Cup in South Africa, the scrutiny is likely to increase.         
	Domenech already had tense relations with Benzema  reprimanding him for his attitude during a World Cup qualifier against Romania last September  but has always been close to Ribery. Although the affair is only at the judicial inquiry stage and no charges have been filed, the damage to their reputations could be lasting.         
	Questioned by police, the prostitute reportedly said she had sexual relations with Ribery when she was 17, and with Benzema when she was 16, but told both players that she was an adult.         
	If Ribery and Benzema are charged, they would face up to three years in prison and a $60,000 fine. Prostitution is legal in France, but prostitutes must be over 18 years old, and clients are liable if they are not.         
	Riberys lawyer said the footballer provided witness testimony last week for investigators probing a suspected ring operating out of a Champs-Elysees club called Cafe Zaman. Sophie Bottai, Riberys lawyer, said no charges were filed against her client and he was not held in police custody.         
	A lawyer for France teammate Sidney Govou  the third player linked to the affair  declined to say whether his client spoke to investigators.         
	In April, 10 people were taken into custody in the investigation, but none from the national team. Three members of the suspected ring are currently being held for questioning.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AGENCIES            Saina Nehwal with Pullela Gopichand in Hyderabad, on Tuesday                           
	Hyderabad: World No. 3 Saina Nehwal has nothing to complain about, and the shuttler now wants to steer clear of injuries so that she can give her best in the Commonwealth and Asian Games later this year.         
	I only pray that I stay injury free now to focus on the World Championships, the Delhi Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games in China, Saina said at a press conference here.         
	Earlier, Saina, who created history by winning three titles in a row, was given a rousing welcome by admirers, friends and family members at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Shamshabad Tuesday morning.         
	From there, she drove in an open top, flower-decked vehicle in the company of among others, coach Pullela Gopichand.         
	After winning three tournaments in a row, my confidence level has gone up. For me, it is important to stay focused and keep working hard and play selective tournaments so that I can stay injury free and play well said a proud Saina while displaying her medals.         
	The world No. 3 said the ranking has brought new responsibilities.         
	Yes, I am aware that I will be the most studied player from now... But, it doesnt bother me and I will not be shying away from trying new strategies, she said.         
	There are areas in my game, like my defence, which I need to improve. My level of fitness also has to improve. The challenges are bound to get tougher, especially after winning these titles, said Saina.         
	Saina recently rounded a hattrick of international titles by defending the Indonesian Open Super Series trophy in Jakarta. Before winning in Jakarta, which was the 20-year-olds third Super Series title overall, Saina had won the Indian Open Grand Prix and the Singapore Open Super Series.         
	Saina is confident of claiming the top position in the world rankings but knows that she has to work even harder.

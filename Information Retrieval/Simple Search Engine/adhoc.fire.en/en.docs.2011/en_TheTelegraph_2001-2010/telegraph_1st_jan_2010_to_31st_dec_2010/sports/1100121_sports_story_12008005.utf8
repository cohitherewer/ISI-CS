The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ranadeb joins 300-wicket club
                                                                                                                       7                                        Ranadeb joins 300-wicket club
            A STAFF REPORTER          Bose                           
	Calcutta: There is an interesting coincidence involving Ranadeb Bose and Suresh Raina. When Bose scalped his 100th first-class wicket, the victim was Suresh Raina and the occasion a Duleep Trophy match between East Zone and Central Zone.         
	On Wednesday, when Bose completed a coveted 300-wicket haul in first-class cricket, in Amritsar, his victim was none other than Raina. The occasion, once again, a Duleep Trophy tie between East and Central Zones.         
	Bose surpassed former India pacer Subrata Guha to become the highest wicket-taking pacer from Bengal and third in the list of all-time highest wicket-takers in first-class cricket from the state.         
	When I castled Raina, it was an emotional moment for me. When I debuted for Bengal, I never thought that I would be good enough to last the rigours of first-class cricket for 12 years, Bose told The Telegraph over phone from Amritsar.         
	But critics still feel that a lack of pace is the reason why the India cap has eluded Bose.         
	I dont want to talk about what critics feel. To perform consistently at the first-class level you need some ability and I have that. The key to my success is being aware of my limitations, he said.

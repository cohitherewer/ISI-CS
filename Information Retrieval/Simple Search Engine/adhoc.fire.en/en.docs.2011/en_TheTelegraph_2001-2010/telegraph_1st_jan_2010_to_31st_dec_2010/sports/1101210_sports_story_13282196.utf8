The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yuvraj is batting with confidence: Simons
                                                                                                                       7                                      Yuvraj is batting with confidence: Simons
                      
	Chennai: Indias bowling consultant Eric Simons Thursday ruled out any injury concerns but said the hosts might rest some key players in the fifth and final ODI against New Zealand here Friday keeping in mind the upcoming South Africa tour.         
	India enjoy an unassailable 4-0 lead in the series and Simons is currently in charge of the team in coach Gary Kirstens absence.         
	There are no injury concerns. No one is ruled out but if we dont play anybody tomorrow, it will be more of a precautionary measure because we leave for South Africa in a few days time, he said at the pre-match press conference here.         
	Simons was also full of praise for comeback-man Yuvraj Singh.         
	Yuvraj was under tremendous pressure the other day (in Bangalore), but his shot selection were pretty good. I am quite happy with the way he played. He was striking the ball pretty well. He is clearing the boundary with ease and that proves that he is timing the ball well and batting with confidence, he said.

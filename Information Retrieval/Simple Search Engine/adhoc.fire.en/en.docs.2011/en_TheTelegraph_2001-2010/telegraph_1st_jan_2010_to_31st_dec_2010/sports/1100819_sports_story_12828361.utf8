The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sehwag stresses on right effort
                                                                                                                       7                                      Sehwag stresses on right effort
                      
	Dambulla: If Suraj Randivs no ball has caught the Sri Lankans red in the face, Virender Sehwags latest remarks will have them searching for a place to hide.         
	In an apparent jibe at the Sri Lankans on Wednesday, the hero who was denied a century on Monday has suggested that the fear of defeat might have prompted the hosts to abandon playing the game in the right spirit.         
	If we play with energy, poise and unselfishness, we will be playing the game the right way, Sehwag said on his Twitter. India won that match with more than 15 overs left but the Team India vice-captain was denied a century by off-spinner Randiv who bowled a no-ball with the visitors needing one run to win.         
	Just after the incident, Sehwag had tweeted that Randiv had come to his room and said sorry for the ball that has raised such a hue and cry but it seems more than one Lankan owes Sehwag an apology. The Lankan local media Wednesday reported that it was senior batsman Tillekaratne Dilshan who had suggested to Randiv that he bowl the no ball.         
	In another tweet, Sehwag indicated that the Lankans might have been unsettled by thoughts of losing.         
	Worry and fear just make you frazzled and unsettled. And the truth is that win or lose, life still goes on. Right effort has to do with unselfishness and working to benefit the team, he added.         
	With the scores level on Monday night, Randiv bowled a no ball to deny Sehwag who ended the match stuck on 99.         
	The ploy was slammed by all as not being in the spirit of the game.         
	After the match, Sehwag lashed out at Randiv for having deliberately bowled a no ball.         
	Apart from Randiv, the Sri Lanka Cricket officials apologised to the Indian team management which in turn declared the episode closed.         
	The Lankan board also initiated an inquiry into the incident.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Joint aim is to win Australian Open: Paes
                                                                                                                       7                                      Joint aim is to win Australian Open: Paes
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: In life, there are no guarantees, but Mahesh (Bhupathi) and I have come together this time to realise a joint goal  win the Australian Open doubles...         
	Thats what Leander Paes, 37, had to say about the reunion which has caused more than a flutter on the circuit.         
	With good reasons, of course: Leander has 12 Grand Slam titles; Bhupathi, a year younger, has 11. Together, theyve won three  the French Open and Wimbledon in 1999 (their best year) and the French Open again, in 2001.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph over a late breakfast at Flurys, on Monday, Leander said: In the past, whenever weve tried to get back together, either Mahesh had already committed himself to a partner or I had finalised a tie-up... This time, well be together till the upcoming Australian Open and, then, take a call.         
	Leander added: Our partnership resumes with the Chennai Open as that was the first tournament we won together, back in 1997... Also, its in India.         
	The Chennai Open is from January 3-9, with the years opening Grand Slam, in Melbourne, from January 17-30.         
	Clearly, having come together after nine years, both Leander and Bhupathi want to put their best foot forward.         
	Its in the last weekend of the Australian Open that well see whether weve enjoyed the past month... If we can support each other, enjoy going through the highs and lows together, then it wont be about whether we win or lose...         
	If I feel the magic is still there, then Ill play a few more (tournaments) after the Australian Open... But, if I feel that its not working or were not happy, then well obviously again play with different partners, Leander pointed out.

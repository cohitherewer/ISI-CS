                                                                                                                       7                                      HAL test awaits Chirag
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Chirag United will look to make amends in the defence and bag full points when they take on Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bangalore in a Round V I-League match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Thursday.         
	In their last match, Chirag United played out a 1-1 draw against Pune FC. Chirag drew first blood against the Pune side but their lopsided defence allowed the opposition to come back.         
	However, Chirag had missed the services of stopper Arnab Mondal (personal reasons) and right-back Jerry Zirsanga (double booking) for their away tie.         
	With the duo back in the fold, Chirags backline will get a boost, while midfielder Denson Devadas will also return in the starting line-up to bolster the side.         
	However,Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharya is still indisposed and Sanjay Sen will be in charge of the side as they will look to return to winning ways.         
	Against new entrants HAL, who had stunned Mohun Bagan and JCT in away matches, Chirag will have to be on their toes to avoid an upset.         
	We have to get three points... A win is really the need of the hour as it will help us improve our standings on the points table, Sen said.

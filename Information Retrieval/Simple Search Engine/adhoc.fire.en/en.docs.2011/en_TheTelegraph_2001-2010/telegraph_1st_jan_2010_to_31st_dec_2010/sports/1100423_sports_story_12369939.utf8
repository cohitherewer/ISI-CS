	Jeju Island (South Korea): Gaganjeet Bhullar looked in ominous form as he struck a quadruple of birdies before bad weather halted the Indians march, leaving him four-under with two holes to go in the opening round of the Ballantines Golf Championship here Thursday.         
	At the top, Australias Marcus Fraser fired an opening seven-under 65 to take the clubhouse lead.         
	A 10th tee starter, Bhullar was on the eighth hole when play was abandoned due to darkness. Only 36 players managed to complete their opening rounds, while the rest of the field will resume at 7am (local time) Friday.         
	Rest of the Indians in fray  Anirban Lahiri, Jyoti Randhawa, Himmat Rai, C. Muniyappa and Shiv Kapur  were yet to tee off.         
	Fraser posted a blemish-free round for a single-shot lead over Englands Mark Foster, who carded a 66 to take second place at the $2.9m event that is sanctioned by the Asian Tour, European Tour and the Korea PGA.

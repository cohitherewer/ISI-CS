The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods   shines
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods   shines
                            
	Paramus: In his first tournament since his divorce, Tiger Woods played by far his best round of the year Thursday at The Barclays, missing only one fairway and three greens in a 6-under 65.         
	It was Woods lowest round of the year and put him in front with Vaughn Taylor as the early group of players were still finishing the opening round.         
	It feels good to be able to control my ball all day like this, Woods said.         
	If he keeps the lead, it will be the first time he has finished any round at the top since his Australian Masters victory at the end of last year, and the first time on the PGA Tour since the second round of the Tour Championship last year.

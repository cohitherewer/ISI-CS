The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Laxman gets confused   by the Bradman link
                                                                                                                       7                                        Laxman gets confused   by the Bradman link
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            VVS Laxman at the Eden on Tuesday. (PTI)                                 
	Calcutta: Any mention of Sir Donald Bradman and even the India players believe it could only have something to do with Sachin Tendulkar, the senior-most pro in their midst.         
	On Monday, V.V.S. Laxman overtook Sir Donald Bradmans Test tally of 6,996 runs, but he was so focused on the job at hand (in the second and final Test, against South Africa) that he didnt quite note that achievement.         
	So, when a well-wisher texted him congratulations, Laxman thought the reference to Sir Don must be in relation to Sachin and that the message had come to him by mistake.         
	It was on Tuesday, in The Telegraphs presence, that Laxman realised that the message had actually been for him and not the Don of the modern era.         
	Laxman was sporting enough to have a laugh. Of course, after hed made South Africa cry, with another top quality (unbeaten) hundred.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Capello leaves out Walcott 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Capello leaves out Walcott 
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Fabio Capello has left Theo Walcott and Darren Bent out of his England squad for the World Cup, with Gareth Barry recovering enough from injury to make the squad.         
	Capello was able to finalise his 23-man selection once Barry had been passed fit to travel. The Manchester City midfielder was given as long as possible to recover from an ankle injury picked up at the end of the season.         
	However, many had expected Walcott to feature after the Arsenal player started in the final two warm-up games.         
	Walcott said he was very disappointed to miss out but added: I would like to wish the team the best of luck and hope they have a really successful tournament.         
	Michael Dawson, Scott Parker and Adam Johnson were already considered outsiders when named in the provisional squad with only the latter seeing game time in the last seven days. Johnson played less than 10 minutes at the end of Englands stuttering victory over Mexico at Wembley.         
	Barrys fitness  though he will still not be available for Englands opening fixture against USA on June 12  sees Tom Huddlestone surplus to requirements. Stephen Warnock gets the nod over Leighton Baines to be Ashley Coles understudy at left-back, despite having almost no international experience.         
	Aaron Lennon and Shaun Wright-Phillips both get on the plane thanks to Walcotts omisssion, as does Joe Cole whose own place was in doubt after a difficult season with Chelsea in which he was out with a serious injury for a large part.         
	Bent was given the chance to stake a claim by starting the final match but failed to make the most of it against Japan on Sunday with Capello electing to go with the tried and tested Emile Heskey instead.         
	 Hosts South Africa dropped their all-time leading scorer Benni McCarthy and four others as coach Carlos Alberto Parreira settled on his 23 players. The decision to ditch McCarthy was a major surprise but follows criticism concerning the forwards fitness. Parreira also dropped defender Bryce Moon and goalkeeper Rowen Fernandez in two other surprise cuts.         
	Parreira sympathised with the players cut from the squad and thanked them for their commitment. McCarthys omission effectively brings down the curtain on a turbulent international career in which he won 79 caps and netted a record 31 goals.         
	Ivory Coast manager Sven-Goran Eriksson faced the most difficult day in his short spell when he told seven players that they would not be going to South Africa.         
	Experienced players such as Olympique Marseille striker Bakary Kone, midfielder Gilles Yapi Yapo and French-born Emerse Fae were all dropped as Eriksson whittled his squad down from 30 to the required 23.         
	Meanwhile, veteran forwards Nwankwo Kanu and Cuauhtemoc Blanco are headed for their third World Cups.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Honda strikes for Samurais

	Bloemfontein: Keisuke Honda scored in the first half Monday to lead Japan to a 1-0 win over an uninspired Cameroon in Group E of the World Cup.         
	The win is Japans first at the World Cup on foreign soil, and puts the Japanese at the top of Group E along with the Netherlands, who beat Denmark 2-0 earlier Monday.         
	After a sloppy opening 30 minutes at the Free State Stadium, Japan broke the deadlock in the 39th when Daisuke Matsuis curling cross from the right drifted over Cameroon defenders Nicolas Nkoulou and Stephane Mbia and fell to Honda at the back post. The striker neatly controlled the ball and slotted it past goalkeeper Hamidou Souleymanou.         
	As a team we had very little good luck in our warm-up games going into this match, Honda said. But as a team we were thinking: Dont be down. Be positive. Go for it.         
	As to the cross from Matsui, Honda said: I found a good position and the ball was very good. I just told myself to be calm to make it because recently we have missed good chances, so I wanted to be absolutely sure today.         
	Our strength is in our collective effort. To the very end we believed in our strength and we defended our goal, said Honda, who was voted Man of the Match.         
	Despite an attack led by Samuel Eto, Cameroon never really challenged Japan keeper Eiji Kawashima. The Africans struggled to control the ball and generate any rhythm up front. When they did manage to put a few passes together, the build-up was usually wasted by poor crosses.         
	When the game was over I felt great relief, Kawashima said. Cameroon has powerful players and we managed to hold them off. In the last 20 minutes I knew I would be under tremendous pressure. Something was going to happen.         
	Cameroons first shot on goal came in the 37th minute, when Eric Choupo-Moting dropped the ball at the top of the box for Eyong Enoh, but Kawashima easily handled the midfielders low drive.         
	Japans stiff defence frustrated Cameroon and kept Eto in check. Cameroon looked lost in the midfield, and clearly missed the creativity of Arsenal midfielder Alex Song, who coach Paul Le Guen opted to keep on the bench.         
	Eto tried to played a more active role in the second half. Just after the break, the Inter Milan striker deftly skipped through three defenders near the touch line before drawing the ball back for Choupo-Moting. But Coupo-Motings right-footed shot drifted past the left post.         
	We were too nervous in the first half. We lost many, many balls because we were nervous and that is why I am disappointed, Le Guen said. They were not playing to the best of their ability and we were not able to realise our potential this evening and that is really disappointing.         
	Le Guen brought on two strikers  Achille Emana and Mohamadou Idrissou  midway into the second half, but to little effect. Cameroon only began to push forward in search of an equaliser in the closing minutes, and they nearly got it in the 87th when defender Stephane Mbias powerful left-footed drive struck the crossbar.         
	The Japanese win comes eight years to the day since their last victory at the World Cup, when they beat Tunisia 2-0 in Osaka. Japan also beat Russia at the 2002 World Cup.         
	Teams         
	Japan: Eiji Kawashima, Yuki Abe, Yuichi Komano, Marcus Tulio Tanaka, Yuto Nagatomo, Yusuhito Endo, Daisuke Matsui (Shinji Okazaki, 69), Yoshito Okubo, Makoto Hasebe (Junichi Inamoto, 88), Keisuke Honda, Yuji Nakazawa.

	Referee: Olegario Benquerenca (Portugal)           (AGENCIES)

  - Del Bosque hails legacy       JAYDEEP BASU                                        Del Bosque      
	Johannesburg: Finally, the World Cup has new winners and just about nobody  apart from the Dutch, of course  would grudge Spain of their place at the top of world football.         
	Though there was huge difference in the manner in which Spain won the World Cup on Sunday and the European Championships two years ago  as the certain purity about the way the Reds play the game was largely missing when they edged the Netherlands by a solitary extra-time goal  it was just the logical conclusion to their campaign.         
	Classical midfielder Andreas Iniesta was the hero for Spain as he smashed a half volley into the net deep into the extra time to help his team remove the tag of underachievers that has been haunting them for many years. The teams were locked goalless in regulation period.         
	In the process, Spain became the first team to win the World Cup after losing their opening match, but truth be told, neither the team, nor their legion of supporters ever seemed to doubt their abilities. Not when they lost to Switzerland, not when they seemed cagey against Honduras and certainly not when they only managed to win by the skin of their teeth.         
	Spain coach Vicente del Bosque proudly announced: I think our effort, our flairis never ending. This World Cup draws from what we did in 2008 and it is the continuity and continuation of a very good legacy.         
	Del Bosque dedicated the victory to the people of Spain. The nation deserves the triumph. This win goes beyond sport. We have to celebrate and are delighted to be able to offer this victory to all the people of Spain.         
	The Dutch were often accused of deviating from the path of Total Football but what Bert van Marwijks boys played at the Soccer City Stadium was ugly football. That the Netherlands could not end their 32 years of hurt in the World Cup drew few sympathisers among the neutrals as quite stunningly, they reduced the match into a physical battle.         
	English referee Howard Webb handed out eight yellow cards to the Netherlands in an often brushing encounter as well as a red card to John Heitinga and five more to Spain  a record number of cards for a World Cup final.         
	Marwijk defended his boys saying it was only a tactical ploy to win the match but the reality was the Dutch were obviously wary of the Spanish prowess and restored to a kind of football not worthy of the World Cup final.         
	Its unfair to say we played ugly football, said the Dutch coach. We always try to play the game beautifully, but not always we manage to do so. We did a good job tactically on them. Only problem was that the referee did not do a good job.         
	I know there were lot of fouls but that is not our style of play. It is regrettable but after all it was World Cup final and there was lot of emotions out there. You always go out to win a match. I would have loved to have won the match even with not so beautiful football, said Marwijk.         
	The Dutch problem was understandable. Unnerved by Spains passing game and constant threats at their own goalmouth, the Netherlands promptly changed their tactics and restored to fouls. Sadly, Spain got too tried to match their rivals and it only helped the Dutch take control of the midfield, especially in the first half.         
	Despite all the nasty fouls the Dutch committed throughout the match, Del Bosque remained magnanimous and chose to ignore the bitter part of the encounter.         
	Better not talk on those things, he said. I should congratulate our opponents. They made it difficult for us to play comfortably and they, too, had some good chances. Yes, it was rough at times but that is part of football.         
	We won the match because we dominated. And if you ask me why we won the trophy, then I would tell you it was a reward for playing beautiful football, said Del Bosque.

                                                                                                                       7                                      Somdev qualifies
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: It took Somdev Dev Varman an hour and 25 minutes on Friday to qualify for his second Grand Slam main draw round.         
	The 25-year-old got the better of Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 6-4, 6-1 in the final qualifying round of the French Open. Last year, he had made it to the second round in the US Open.         
	I feel really good. I felt like I played well in some tough situations all through the qualifying rounds and Im hoping to continue that in the main draw, said Somdev in an email to The Telegraph.         
	Calcuttas Leander Paes was the last Indian, in 1997, to play in the main rounds at Roland Garros where he lost in the second round.         
	Looking forward, Somdev said he will take one match at a time.         
	I want to take it one step at a time and focus on my next match. Everyone in the main draw is going to be tough.         
	I know if I play well Ill always give myself a chance to win the match, he said.         
	In the first set on Friday, Somdev had to work hard as he lost his serve thrice to the 289th ranked player in the world. But it was a breeze in the second as the Indian swept past his opponent.         
	Somdev is guaranteed Euro 15,000 in prize money and 35 ATP points by virtue of reaching the first round of the main draw. His world ranking is also expected to go up to 105 and winning the first round would catapult him into the top-100.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | US title for Sharath 
                                                                                                                       7                                      US title for Sharath 
                      
	New Delhi: India No. 1 Sharath Kamal notched up the biggest title of his career when he clinched the US Open Table Tennis Championships crown, beating Keineth Thomas of Slovakia at Michigan.         
	The world No. 76 overcame some tough resistance before overcoming Thomas 11-9, 5-11, 8-11, 9-11, 11-8, 11-5, 11-9 in the long-drawn summit-clash to become richer by $ 10,000 and the success would surely boost his confidence when he defends the mens singles title in Commonwealth Games.         
	I am really going along nicely at the moment and happy to beat the Slovakian in the US Open. It was a tough final, said Sharath on his return.         
	I am particularly happy to have come back after losing the second and third sets. Once I took the two subsequent sets, I became confident. Yet the Slovak was too good and kept himself in the game, he added. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Siddique and Rahim delay the inevitable
                                                                                                                       7                                      Siddique and Rahim delay the inevitable
                      
	Chittagong: Zunaed Siddique and Mushfiqur Rahim delayed Englands victory charge in the first Test with an unbroken 81-run stand to help Bangladesh reach 191 for five in their second innings on Monday.         
	Zunaed eked out a patient half-century to remain 68 not out alongside Rahim (47 not out) at the close on the fourth day. The hosts are chasing 513 to win after England declared their second innings on 209 for seven.         
	Coming together around 20 minutes before the tea break, the pair batted out the entire final session to frustrate England, who were hoping for a quick finish after reducing Bangladesh to 110 for five.         
	Tim Bresnan struck twice in the second session before skipper Shakib-al Hasan fell to a controversial lbw decision off Graeme Swann.         
	Bresnan ended a stubborn 54-run third-wicket partnership when he had Aftab Ahmed caught by wicketkeeper Matt Prior for 26 and then bowled Mahmudullah for five.         
	Bangladesh suffered a huge blow when Shakib was given out leg before off Swann, with replays suggesting he got a full glove on his sweep shot.         
	Swann had earlier bowled Tamim Iqbal for 14 in his second over. Imrul Kayes survived strong appeals for lbw and a catch at leg-gully before he finally edged paceman Steven Finn to Prior for 23.         
	England, resuming on 131-5, lost overnight batsman Prior (seven) in the fourth over, but Ian Bell and Swann batted aggressively to help the tourists declare their second innings with an hour remaining in the first session.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manipur in goal rush
                                                                                                                       7                                        Manipur in goal rush
  -Vashum, Subhas make merry vs Rajasthan 
            A STAFF REPORTER            The Manipuri duo of Subhas Singh (left) and R Vashum at the Barasat Stadium, on Friday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: When the match was into its 20th minute, former India striker Bijen Singh, who is accompanying the Manipur team as a mentor, made an apt observation about their opponents, Rajasthan.         
	No matter how many goals you score, playing against these kind of oppositions never gives you a clear picture about the teams form. Its only when you play sides like Goa, Bengal, Maharashtra that you can assess yourself, Bijen said from the sidelines as Manipur walloped Rajasthan 13-0 in a Cluster-IV match of the Santosh Trophy at the Barasat Stadium on Friday.         
	At the Khardah Stadium, Punjab thrashed Pondicherry 7-0 in a Cluster-III encounter, while Nagaland beat Gujarat 4-0 in another match of the same cluster, at the Howrah Stadium.         
	Such was the dominance of Manipur that they led 9-0 at the half-time and scored another four at the change of ends. There was no resistance from the Rajasthan team that comprises mostly of college students, who play part-time football. If thats not enough, their coach B.L. Jeigan is not a qualified coach and works as a physical education teacher in a school.         
	With such pedigree, it would have always been difficult for Rajasthan to contain the fast-paced Manipur boys who boasts of 10 I-League players.         
	East Bengal officials will feel relieved that their prize catch R. Vashum is in fantastic form. The winger, who will don red-and-gold colours in the coming season, found the back of the net as many as five times (15, 18, 25, 44, 64) and missed another four, at least.         
	If Vashums form is a relief for East Bengal, the officials may just regret releasing Subhash Singh, who scored four goals (12, 28, 58, 64). Charan Rai struck twice, while Bisheswor Singh and Nilakumar Singh scored one apiece.         
	Nilakumar, one of the veterans playing his sixth Santosh Trophy, displayed dazzling skills as he had at least six assists. Nilakumar, is the elder brother of Surkumar Singh.         
	Both Vashum and Subhas were ecstatic after the match.         
	Its been a great start for us in the tournament. I hope to continue this form for East Bengal in the coming season. In Churchill Brothers, I played well but there was less pressure. It will be a challenge to play in front of big crowds and absorb the rigorous demands of Calcutta football, Vashum said before boarding the team bus.

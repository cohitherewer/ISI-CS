    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
	   - Back in the hot seat the icon on captaincy             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly, the Kolkata Knight Riders captain (Indias most successful in Tests, by the way), spoke to The Telegraph specifically on captaincy.         
	Sourav is the franchises icon, too.               
	The following are excerpts         
	QYou have the credentials to talk about it... Who makes a good captain?         
	A Somebody who gets a good team, somebody who gets the team right... Somebody able to create the proper atmosphere.         
	Did any captain influence you in a big way?         
	I just did it my way, did what I felt was right for the team. As captain, Sachin (Tendulkar) helped my cricket blossom... He had a lot of faith in my abilities... Actually, both mine and Rahul Dravids, at an important stage in our careers. When I became the India captain, I gave the same confidence to my players... In fact, Im doing just that at KKR as well.         
	How did you approach the India captaincy?         
	Picked the right players (in the XI)... Did what was best for the team.         
	Dont you think that a captain should have a vote, instead of merely being a co-opted member of the selection committee? His neck, after all, is on the line...         
	Captains do have a (big) say.         
	But the buzz is that Mahendra Singh Dhoni, for example, hasnt always got the team of his choice...         
	I think Dhoni gets his team... I got my team when I was the captain... Im sure Rahul had his team when he was captaining. There can be issues over one or two players, but youve got to deal with it. Look, on 85-90 per cent of the players, the captain will get his choice.         
	So, you dont feel its necessary for the captain to actually have a vote?         
	He has a vote, even if its not there in writing. He gets his say.         
	Talking of Dhoni, how has he shaped up?         
	He has done very well... Of course, he is fortunate to have a very good team. So was I, really... Then, hes himself playing well. That helps.         
	Its incredible the way Dhoni remains calm even in tough situations...         
	He doesnt show it, but Im sure he feels the pressure... Hes bound to feel it as, after all, hes only human... He wants India to win and wants to do well himself. So, there will be pressure. The good thing is that he absorbs it.         
	How should captains handle pressure situations?         
	Try and be positive... Not take a step backwards, for that will send the wrong signal.         
	Is Tuesdays face-off then between you and Dhoni, too?         
	(Laughs) Not at all... Hes the current India captain, Im a former captain... The clash is between KKR and Chennai Super Kings and one should leave it at that.         
	How much of your India captaincy was instinctive?         
	Eighty-five per cent was instinctive I did have a plan, yes, but had to change it a number of times. Would depend on the situation.         
	Gut feeling or...         
	Gut feeling... As captain, youve got to adapt, be flexible.         
	During the time you led India, who is the captain you admired?         
	Nasser Hussain.         
	Why?         
	The tactics he employed, the fields he set... Stephen Fleming, too, was a good leader... Ricky Ponting is...         
	Your take on Ponting, specifically?         
	Australian cricket has had tough times in the last few years... However, that happens to every team, particularly when the rebuilding stage is on... Even without some big names, Ponting has done well.         
	What should captains do and shouldnt do?         
	Do what the heart says, do whats best for the team.         
	The donts...         
	Dont regret. Indeed, dont leave room for any regret at all. After a game, dont say I didnt do this or I didnt do that...         
	As captain, what has been your approach in this edition of the IPL?         
	Getting the players to play freely...Ive tried to help create an atmosphere for the team to do well... With a bit of luck, which is needed, we will...         
	Thoughts after two wins on the trot?         
	Definitely feels good... Its fun when the team is winning, not so when it isnt... Depends on the moments.         
	The last one: Shane Bond has arrived... You must be delighted...         
	Its great to have him with us... Bond will give the extra pace thats needed, besides, he can bat. For KKR, hes a good value addition.

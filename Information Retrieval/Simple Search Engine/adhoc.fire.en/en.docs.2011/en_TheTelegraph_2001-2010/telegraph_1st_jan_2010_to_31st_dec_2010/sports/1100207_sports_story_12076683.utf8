            HONKY DORY      
	Mumbai: The Derby weekend started at the Mahalaxmi race course, on Saturday, with usual fanfare, although the crowd on the day was, understandably, insignificant compared to the big day on Sunday. Nevertheless, passion was high among all trainers, jockeys and owners to win a race or two during the two-day racing festival - sponsored entirely by the UB Group.          
	Jockey Imran Chisty scored in that department, winning three, in the 10-event race card, including the afternoons main and the richest event, the 1,400m Kunigal Stud Breeders Produce Stakes. Chisty rode a well judged race on trainer Sorab Sunderjis 9-2 fancy Ocean And Beyond, to present the new heavyweight owners in the sport, R.K. Wadhawan and his syndicate, their third win of the afternoon. Chisty had also partnered their fancied runners, Highland Flame and Sea Shower, to victory early in the afternoon.          
	The UB supremo, Vijay Mallya, and Haresh Mehta, too, had their share of luck, winning a couple of trophies apiece. Among the trainers, Imtiaz Sait and Sunderji ended the day saddling a brace of winners each, leaving the South India racing baron to score in a solitary event.

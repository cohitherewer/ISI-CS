The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kallis, Amla make merry
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kallis, Amla make merry
            SUDIPTO GUPTA                      
	Nagpur: When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions  thats what William Shakespeare had to say in Hamlet.         
	Perhaps, there couldnt have been a better expression to highlight India captain Mahendra Singh Dhonis plight on the first day of the first Test for the Jaypee Infratech Cup against South Africa at the Vidharbha Cricket Association Stadium, in neighbouring Jamtha, on Saturday.         
	First, it was in the form of Rohit Sharma (set to make his debut at the expense of the yet-to-be fit VVS Laxman), who sprained his ankle half-an-hour before the toss, ruling himself out of the match, and giving Bengal wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha the chance to make his Test debut as a specialist batsman. Be surprised or shocked, thats the truth.         
	Next, it was in the form of Jacques Kallis (159 not out) and Hashim Amla (115 not out), who negated a bright start by the Indians, and dissected their bowling with the efficiency of a surgeon, taking the visitors to a commanding 291 for two at the close of play.         
	Kallis, one of the greatest South African cricketers in the post-Apartheid era, slammed his 34th Test century, his third against India, with all three coming on Indian soils.         
	He thus equalled Sunil Gavaskars tally of centuries. Kallis 290-ball innings was studded with 13 hits to the fence, accompanied by two handsome sixes off Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra respectively.         
	If Kallis was the fulcrum of the South African innings, Amla, for sure, played his part to the tee in increasing the efficiency of the lever.         
	His was an innings that complemented Kalliss, weathering the early Zaheer storm and reducing it to a petty breeze by the close of play. His 225-ball knock was decked with 11 boundaries. He amalgamated finesse with power to produce some eye-catching strokeplay. The duo have already added a mammoth 285 runs for the third wicket.         
	Earlier in the day, lady luck betrayed Dhoni in the toss as well, as Graeme Smith won the flip of the coin and decided to take guard on a slow and dry wicket. But Zaheer Khan smoothened some of the wrinkles on his captains forehead when he curtailed both the South African openers stay at the wicket, reducing the Proteas to six for two.         
	Ashwell Prince was the first to go, falling for a duck off a scorching Zaheer bouncer, after the speedster had set him up beautifully. Replays, however, showed that the ball brushed the arm-guard before it was lapped up by Dhoni.         
	If Ashwells was a princely dismissal, Zaheer got rid of Smith with one that was no less royal. Smith, in an attempt to play a defensive shot, found his woodwork rattled as the seaming delivery made its way through the bat and the pad.         
	The wicket, in the first hour, showed a lot of variety  some deliveries didnt carry to the keeper, some had the batsman ducking and some which had swing written all over it. To add a new dimension to that, Dhoni ushered in Harbhajan as early as the 12th over.         
	Both Harbhajan and Mishra extracted considerable turn from the track, in the first session, often foxing the batsmen but, unfortunately, missing the bat as well. As the day wore on, the pitch eased out considerably, making life easier for the batsmen.         
	While Harbhajan conceded 81 off his 21 overs, Mishra gave away 71 off his 26.         
	Dhoni tried almost all the tricks in his bag but the day simply didnt belong to him. He persisted with Zaheer or Ishant from one end for most part of the day, expecting his pacers to deliver the goods via reverse swing; but the hints of the ball reversing remained hints and never blossomed into something threatening.         
	Virender Sehwag as the fifth bowler was no better than ordinary.

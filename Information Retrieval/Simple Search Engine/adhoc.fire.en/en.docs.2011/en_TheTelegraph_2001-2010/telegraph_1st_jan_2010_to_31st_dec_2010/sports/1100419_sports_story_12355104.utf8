	Shanghai: World champion Jenson Button calmly steered through the chaos of a wet Chinese Grand Prix for his second win of the season on Sunday, leading home Lewis Hamilton in a McLaren one-two.         
	The 30-year-old Briton, who took the lead in the overall standings after celebrating his second win of the season and ninth of his career, yelled We really earned that one! on his team radio as he crossed the line.         
	For me, its my best victory, the grinning Button, who had started fifth on the grid, said. It was very tough conditions and the great thing is our pace was good. It wasnt just the luck of calling the weather.         
	Hamilton carved his way through the field from 12th on lap four to finish 1.530 seconds behind his compatriot in the first British one-two since 1999.         
	The 25-year-olds aggressive drive included a clash with Red Bulls Sebastian Vettel in the pit lane and a post-race stewards investigation resulted in reprimands for both drivers for dangerous driving.         
	German Nico Rosberg secured his second successive third place for Mercedes with Spains Fernando Alonso, who earned a drive-through penalty for a jump start, finishing fourth for Ferrari. Button now has 60 points overall, 10 clear of Rosberg with Hamilton and Alonso a point further back in third.         
	McLaren lead the constructors standings with 109 points to Ferraris 90. Pole-sitter Vettel, who won the last race in Malaysia and here last year, could only manage sixth behind Robert Kubicas Renault, leaving the Shanghai race still without a repeat winner after seven years.         
	Renaults Vitaly Petrov passed both Michael Schumacher of Mercedes and the Red Bull of Mark Webber on the last few laps to take an impressive seventh place in the Russians first completed Formula One race.         
	Alonsos premature start, a safety car for a three-car pile up on the first corner, heavy rain and another safety car later in the race contributed to an entertaining but chaotic race.         
	I think we stopped five times to change the tyres, said twice world champion Alonso. Hopefully, next race we have a normal weekend. Weve had only one in Bahrain, and we won the race. So we need more normal weekends.         
	Force Indias point-scoring streak came to an abrupt end with Adrian Sutil finishing 11th while his teammate Vitantonio Liuzzi retired after an opening lap brake problem. Only 17 drivers brought home the car, the last being Hispanias Karun Chandhok.         
	Sutil reckoned strategy was crucial today and felt things could have been slightly different but for the last pit stop which cost him a couple of extra seconds. It was a real strategy race this time. At times it was difficult to know which was the best tyre to be on, as it would rain and then dry and then rain again, Sutil said.         
	Liuzzi was equally upset after a premature end to his race when he spun his Force India into Kamui Kobayashis BMW Sauber and Sebastien Buemis Toro Rosso, bringing out the safety car.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Dinda strikes thrice vs TN
          
	Chennai: Ashok Dinda took three wickets as Tamil Nadu could manage only 126 for four against Bengal at stumps on the third day of their fifth round Ranji Trophy Super League (Group A) encounter at the Guru Nanak College ground.         
	This was an impressive comeback by the medium pacer who had missed a couple of matches due to fever.         
	In-form Subramanium Badrinath (33) was at the crease along with K Vasudevdas (21) after Dinda (three for 33) rocked the top-order accounting for opener Abhinav Mukund (41), KB Arun Karthik (10) and captain Dinesh Karthik (0).         
	After a complete washout for the first two days, only 41 overs of play was possible Friday as Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary elected to field keeping the overcast conditions in mind.         
	Pacer Ranadeb Bose, dismissed opener Anirudh Srikkanth (14) when the opener edged one to the slips and was caught by Arnab Nandi.         
	Arun Karthik didnt last long edging one to debutant wicketkeeper Geetemoy Basu as Tamil Nadu were reduced to 58 for two.         
	Just when it looked that Mukund and Badrinath were steadying the ship, Dinda struck twice in an over. First to go was Mukund, who looked good for a big score.         
	After a couple of deliveries, Dinda sent back Karthik, who has been in woeful form. The Tamil Nadu captain edged one to give Geetemoy his second catch.           (AGENCIES)

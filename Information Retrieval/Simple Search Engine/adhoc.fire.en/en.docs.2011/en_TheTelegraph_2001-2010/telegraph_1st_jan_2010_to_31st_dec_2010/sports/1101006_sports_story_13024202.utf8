The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting: VVS was our biggest worry
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ponting: VVS was our biggest worry
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                V.V.S. Laxman in Mohali      
	Mohali: Australian captain Ricky Ponting said he had warned teammates of a possible threat from V.V.S. Laxman before the final day. His worst fears came true on Tuesday. He spoke at a media conference.               
	The following are excerpts               
	The loss         
	We played a hard Test But all said and done, I would also like to say that we played a very good Test match. The Indians played superbly.         
	Mood in the dressing room         
	The dressing room is a little quiet now. We have a few days before the Bangalore Test. The first session on the first day of the Bangalore Test will be crucial.         
	Comparisons with the Eden Test, in 2001         
	This one hurts more because I am the captain now. Theres no hiding from the fact that this was a tough loss for us. People back home had expected us to win this match.         
	If Bollingers injury complicated things         
	Yeah, it hurts It would have been nice to have Bollinger at our disposal. That would have given us the option of a fresh bowler after lunch.         
	Laxmans performance         
	(Smiles) Would have been better if he was without a runner! I just hope that he has a sore back next week (before the second Test) too! He stamped his class on the match. Along with Sachin (Tendulkar), Laxman has always been a class performer against Australia.         
	If Australia expected such an innings from Laxman         
	I had told some of the younger players in the team that Laxman remained our biggest worry. Maybe, some were thinking that he was injured and so not at his best. But I told them not to count him out.         
	Thoughts on the Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS)         
	Im a big supporter of the UDRS We would have definitely got more correct decisions if it was available.

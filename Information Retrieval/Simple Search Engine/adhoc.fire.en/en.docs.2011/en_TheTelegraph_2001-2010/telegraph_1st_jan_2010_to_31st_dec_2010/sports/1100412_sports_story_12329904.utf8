The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lee Westwood still in the lead
                                                                                                                       7                                        Lee Westwood still in the lead
  - Augusta Masters Tiger Woods six under after two bogeys in the first four holes         NYT NEWS SERVICE AGENCIES            Italian teenager Matteo Manassero at the Augusta National Golf Club, on Sunday. (Reuters)                                 
	Augusta: Fred Couples is making the biggest move among the Masters leaders, while others have already run into trouble at the Augusta Masters on Sunday.         
	Phil Mickelson had a birdie attempt knocked off line by a pollen pod that blew onto the green just before he putted at No. 2.         
	Four-time champion Tiger Woods, playing his first tournament in nearly five months with his private life having spectacularly unravelled at the end of last year, was at six under after two bogeys in the first four holes. Lee Westwood also put his first shot in the trees and took a bogey.         
	Westwood bounced back with a two-putt birdie at the second, reclaiming his one-stroke lead over Mickelson. Couples birdied two of the first three holes to get to 9 under, three strokes behind in a tie with K.J. Choi.         
	Earlier, The golfers were greeted with perfect weather Sunday as they arrived at the Augusta National Golf Club.         
	By noon, hundreds of empty folding chairs were already in position on the sides of the bowl enveloping the 18th green and fans had filled the grandstands overlooking the decisive 13th and 15th holes. The hub of Amen Corner, the 12th tee, was cathedral-like, quiet as it awaited the first golfers of the day with spectators in chairs.         
	Everything was in place for a major golf happening and that included the storylines on the leaderboard. Atop that list is Lee Westwood, who came in as one of the favourites and has not disappointed. Entering the final round at 12-under par 204 and with a one-stroke lead over Mickelson, Westwood is trying to become the first Englishman to win the Masters since Nick Faldo, in 1996.         
	Mickelson is trying to win his third Masters, something done by only seven players previously (Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Jimmy Demaret, Gary Player, Sam Snead, Faldo and Tiger Woods). A victory would rejuvenate Mickelsons career at a time when he could use the boost. He has had only one top-10 finish (an eighth) in the seven events he has played this season.         
	For Mickelson, a victory at his favourite tournament and with his wife and children with him at an event for the first time this year would no doubt be memorable and poignant.         
	Koreas Choi started the day four strokes off the lead. He has been steady with just five bogeys in three rounds. The 50-year-old crowd favourite, Fred Couples, was five strokes back and Hunter Mahan Barnes were next, tied at six under with the flamboyant Ian Poulter.         
	Then there was Woods, the centre of attention since a stealthy practice round one week ago.         
	Woods is seeking his 15th major championship, though this would be his first when he has not had at least a share of the lead after the third round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Van Zyl for a spinner in squad 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Van Zyl for a spinner in squad 
            A CORRESPONDENT                      
	Durban: The focus will be on weather, once again, when India take on South Africa in the second Test at Kingsmead from Sunday.         
	Traditionally, the ball nips around whenever it is overcast at Durban and even though the visitors feel the toss will be a factor, Proteas coach Corrie van Zyl said it is not going to be the most important thing in their minds.         
	On the eve of their second Test in a three-match series, that the hosts are leading 1-0, Van Zyl said: I dont think the toss is going to be the most important thing. It depends on weather conditions. We are not hoping for a green seamer here. So, what Im saying is that the toss is not such a big factor in our minds.         
	Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel had wreaked havoc in Indias first innings after the hosts sent the visitors in. Van Zyl hoped Steyn would be able to replicate his form taking the momentum forward in Durban.         
	Dale Steyn bowled some really fast spells in the previous Test match. There are times when he runs in and bowls within himself, but at Centurion,         
	Dale ran in and bowled some balls 145 kph-plus and thats good in my estimations. I believe that will happen again.         
	The pitch will not determine how quickly he will run in. Hes going to run in, hes a quick bowler and he will do that again, he said.         
	The hosts are upbeat after the lead and the Proteas coach hoped the team would be up for the challenge. There is a good spirit in the camp, even though its Christmas. The team is full of self-confidence. We have prepared well.         
	Momentum is something that you have to earn. We are approaching this game as starting fresh again, having the confidence of the previous win. Momentum is not going to make us win the Test match. Weve to work hard, Van Zyl said.         
	It is not yet clear whether the hosts would go for an all-pace attack. But Van Zyl dropped a hint about retaining a spinner in the squad.         
	Five days is quite long time. You never know what the weather is like, whether it will get really hot. Experience has told us that well most probably have a spinner in the line up for a five-day Test match in Durban.         
	Van Zyl, whose agreement with Cricket South Africa (CSA) ends after the 2011 World Cup, said hes not pondering over the future.         
	I dont give that too much thought. Ive made a decision in my career for specific reasons. That doesnt really occupy my mind at the moment.         
	Im occupied with this series and the World Cup. I dont really have somebody (new coach) in mind. But Im sure that the net will be wide open and the right guy will come, Van Zyl said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Court order gives Terry the blues
                                                                                                                       7                                      Court order gives Terry the blues
                      
	London: A judge lifted a court order on Friday which stopped newspapers from reporting allegations about England captain John Terry. Terrys lawyers were granted the injunction last week after the Chelsea star learned that a newspaper was about to publish a story about his private life. The order even prevented publication that the injunction even existed.         
	But High Court judge Michael Tugendhat lifted the injunction altogether on Friday and said newspapers were allowed to identify Terry. Publication of the allegations could affect Terrys standing with England coach Fabio Capello, who has instilled a strict disciplinary code within the squad. The Italian may take away the captaincy from the central defender if he believes his off-field behaviour can affect the team.         
	The court injunction related to a story about the 29-year-old Terry, who is married, and his ties with another woman whom the judge did not identify. The judge said she was a famous person but not in the world of sport.

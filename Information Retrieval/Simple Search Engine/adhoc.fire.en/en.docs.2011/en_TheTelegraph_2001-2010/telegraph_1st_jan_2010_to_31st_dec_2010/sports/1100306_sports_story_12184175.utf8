The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wawrinka puts Swiss ahead
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wawrinka puts Swiss ahead
                      
	Logrono: Stanislas Wawrinka gave Switzerland a 1-0 lead in their first-round Davis Cup World Group tie against Spain, beating Nicolas Almagro 3-6, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 here Friday.         
	Almagro broke Wawrinka twice to take the opening set. Wawrinka took the second set, but two double faults handed Almagro a break in the third, which he served out.         
	Wawrinka levelled again, taking a close fought fourth set 7-5. Almagro received treatment on his leg in the fifth as the Swiss took the match.         
	In Toulon, France, Gael Monfils defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (5) to give France a 1-0 lead over Germany.         
	Monfils, who claimed his maiden victory in the team competition, served 15 aces and broke his opponent five times. He closed out the match in two hours and 45 minutes on his second match point when Kohlschreiber fired a forehand wide.         
	Monfils, who made his debut in last years World Group playoffs, stretched his unbeaten run over Kohlschreiber to three matches.         
	With this win we put the pressure on the German side, Monfils said.         
	France has a 5-2 record against Germany in the Davis Cup. In their last meeting four years ago, France won 3-2 after leading 3-0. France has won the title nine times, while Germany has won it three times.         
	Ivo Karlovic beat Nicolas Lapentti 6-2,5-7, 6-7 (2), 6-3, 6-4 to give Croatia a 1-0 lead over Ecaudor in Varazdin.         
	Karlovic made an impressive start, winning five consecutive games to take a 5-1 lead in the opening set, but Lapentti fought back to win two following sets.         
	Karlovic recovered to win  but only after sending down 36 aces in a match that lasted nearly four hours.         
	Lapentti, Ecuadors best player, reversed his decision to retire last year, after Ecuador beat Brazil in Davis Cup qualifying. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Albie: Dhoni never shouts
                                                                                                                       7                                      Albie: Dhoni never shouts
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Albie Morkel feels Mahendra Singh Dhoni would have never had the sort of emotional outburst that Sourav Ganguly did after the Kolkata Knight Riders loss to the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Dhoni is very relaxed He is calm and quiet. He can treat the juniors as grown-ups and thats a sign of maturity. He has all the signs of a good captain. I have never seen him shouting at the youngsters. If he is upset, he goes to the coach and speaks, the all-rounder said.         
	Morkel said they were aiming to win all their remaining matches. We are treating tomorrows match as a final in the tournament. We have to win every game to ensure our progress to the semi-final. We are not unduly worried about the net run-rate but we want to concentrate on our winning all the remaining matches to earn the spot.         
	He did not wish to read much into Matthew Haydens poor run. He is not getting runs as quickly as he had been but he is a match winner. You cannot underestimate him. For all you know, he might score a hundred off 50 balls. We all back him to the hilt.         
	Morkel, though, wasnt willing to underestimate the Knight Riders. Both teams are strong on paper and both have match winners. The Knights are a balanced side. Chris Gayle is a dangerous batsman. As a bowler, the very thought of bowling to Chris will give you sleepless nights.         
	He could take the game away in a couple of overs. We need to restrict both Gayle and Brendon McCullum. Their bowling is not as strong as their batting. But, of course, they have Shane Bond and Ajantha Mendis in their ranks. If Super Kings and Knight Riders happen to go to the final, both have a chance of winning the title.

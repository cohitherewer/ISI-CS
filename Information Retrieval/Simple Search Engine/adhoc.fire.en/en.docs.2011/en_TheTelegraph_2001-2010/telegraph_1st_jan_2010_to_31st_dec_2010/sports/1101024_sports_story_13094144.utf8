    - Red and gold brigade record convincing win against kalighat MS           A STAFF REPORTER            Theres no stopping East Bengal and their unique ways of celebrating goals. On Saturday, (from left) Ekene Ikenwa, Sushant Mathew, Tolgay Ozebe and Robin Singh brought alive a scene from the famous Kerala boat race after Robin scored his first and the teams second against Kalighat MS, at the Salt Lake Stadium.

	Calcutta: As the gloom made way for bright light at the Salt Lake Stadium, the smile came back on Trevor James Morgans face.         
	Trailing 0-1  Prasenjit Neogi gave Kalighat Milan Sangha an unexpected lead with a seventh-minute header  East Bengal were living dangerously in their 10th match of the Calcutta Football League.         
	They were not looking their usual self. One Chizoba Christopher was making life miserable for the second string defence, particularly Sunil Kumar and Gurwinder Singh, midfield was not co-ordinating well with the forward line and Morgan was making brisk walk on the sidelines. Something he does when things do not go his way.         
	Then suddenly the light came back in East Bengals life. It stayed till referee Kali Kinkar Banerjee blew the final whistle and the red and gold brigade were all over their rivals, scoring goals at will, missing chances at regular intervals.         
	The final score on Saturday read 5-2 and East Bengal are unbeaten in 15 matches.         
	Ekene Ikenwa headed in the equaliser in the 39th minute, Robin Singh converted a penalty to make it 2-1 in the 41st and, two minutes later, Robins left foot again did the talking, banging into the far corner after getting a loose ball off a melee.         
	The scoreline, which was 0-1 at the 38th minute, was reading 3-1 at lemon break. Just after the change of ends, Tolgay Ozebe made it 4-1.         
	In the 58th, Chizoba reduced the margin off a penalty. Tolgay scored his second and his teams fifth six minutes before regulation time with a smart right footer.         
	East Bengal juggernaut rolls on and how!         
	On Saturday they rested most of the first team player. Mehtab Hossain, Nirmal Chetri and Penn Orji were on the bench, Uga Okpara, Naoba Singh, R. Vashum were in the media box.         
	Still this win showed how much good work Morgan has done with this bunch. Sushant Mathew and B. Beikhokhei worked tirelessly and Sanju Pradhan was brilliant on the day. He was in the thick of action most of the time as his assists got East Bengal the first and fourth goals.         
	The defence, though, left a lot to be desired. Gurwinder and Sunil Kumar, at the heart of the defence, looked shaky throughout and had Chizoba got a little support in the earlier stages of the match, it could have been a different tale altogether.         
	I am not happy with the way our defence played today. But overall it was a satisfying performance, Morgan said after the match. The team is converting the chances and thats what matters in the end.         
	Indeed. Very few will dispute Morgan these days.

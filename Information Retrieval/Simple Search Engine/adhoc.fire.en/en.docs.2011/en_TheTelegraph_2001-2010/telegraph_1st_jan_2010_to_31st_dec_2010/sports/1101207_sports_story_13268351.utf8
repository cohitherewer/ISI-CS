                            Navratilova embarks on her mission 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Tennis legend Martina Navratilova, on Monday, embarked on her climb to the summit of Africas highest mountain, Mt Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania, to raise funds for the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation.         
	Martina is joined on the challenge by a team of 27, including German paralympic cyclist Michael Teuber and British Olympic badminton star Gail Emms and a host of international fundraisers. It will take the climbers six days to reach the summit.         
	Martina, who battled breast cancer earlier this year, is raising funds for the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, a charity which supports community sports projects around the world, which have helped to improve the lives of over one million young people.         
	Speaking as the team were about to depart on their expedition, Martina said: Ive been planning to climb Mt Kilimanjaro since early this year, even before my breast cancer diagnosis, so it feels really great to finally be underway. Im feeling well prepared for the challenge, and although Im sure well all be in for a tough few days of climbing, I am determined to reach the summit. I am really pleased to be joined on the climb by a team of international fundraisers, and I hope everyone will support us.         
	Mt Kilimanjaro is the worlds highest freestanding mountain. The expedition will ascend by the Rongai Route. It starts in a corn field before giving way to alpine forest.         
	The climb progresses to moorlands on a gentle gradient, which then begins to increase through rolling terrain. There are some short, steep, grassy slopes to climb before leaving vegetation behind. The next section is a five kilometre wide, lunar-like desert area.         
	The route to the summit continues up scree slopes made up of loose rock. Once on the rim of the crater, the steep incline gives way to undulations on the way to the summit. At this point there will be ice and snow underfoot.         
	Earlier, Martina visited the Laureus-supported Mathare Youth Sports Association (MYSA) project in Nairobi  the kind of project which will benefit from funds raised from the Kilimanjaro challenge.         
	Based in the largest and one of the poorest slums in Nairobi in which HIV/AIDS and other diseases are widespread, the project has pioneered the use of football as a tool to encourage co-operation and raise self-esteem in the young people of the community.

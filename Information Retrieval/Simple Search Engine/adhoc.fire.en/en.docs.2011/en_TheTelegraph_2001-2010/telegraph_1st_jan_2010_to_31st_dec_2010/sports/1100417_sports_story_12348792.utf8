            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Yusuf Pathan on Friday seconded his senior India teammate Virender Sehwags observation that playing in the IPL was the best form of preparation before the World T20 in the West Indies.         
	All the Indian cricketers are playing in the IPL. It is a really good way of preparing for the World Twenty20. There is a problem when you switch from the 50 overs to T20 format. There you need some time to adjust. But here we are in the T20 mode. So it is giving us a good practice, Yusuf said sitting beside his skipper Shane Warne at a pre-match press conference.         
	Yusuf also rejected the theory of burn-out having continuously played for the past one month. I dont think there will be any burn out issue with us. We are playing 14 matches but not continuously. We are getting gaps to give ourselves rest in between. We are also training and getting all the facilities that should have been provided to us.         
	Asked whether the bowlers have finally sorted his game in this IPL, he retorted back: If they took two IPLs to understand me then its their problem, not mine.         
	Meanwhile, Pakistan player Sohail Tanvir who reached the city on Friday afternoon is expected to drop in at Eden Gardens to watch Saturdays match. Tanvir, incidentally, was the purple cap winner of the first edition. It was nice to meet Tanvir who is a friend of ours. He was a key member during IPL-I. It would have been great had he been around this time also, said Warne.         
	Tanvir arrived in Calcutta after attending the reception of his teammate Shoaib Malik and Indias tennis star Sania Mirza. She is our bhabi now. When she visits our country we will know her even more, Tanvir said.

            SUDIPTO GUPTA                      
	Calcutta: If Shah Rukh Khan and Twitter made the headlines a couple of days ago, it was Sourav Ganguly and his glitter which took centre-stage at the Eden on Thursday.         
	He is often described as the very embodiment of comebacks, the mascot of success when the chips are down. Well, Sourav was once again busy scripting the same old story  authoring a blistering innings which outshone even the mighty floodlights of the Eden.         
	At the battlefront, he led from the front and was instrumental in leading the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to a much-needed 24-run win over the Deccan Chargers. The victory took KKR to fifth on the table.         
	His hurricane 54-ball 88 helped the home team plunder 181 for six  a total which looked defendable. In an innings that should make any cricket enthusiast sit up and take note (not to mention KKR principal owner King Khan), Sourav hit nine exquisitely struck boundaries and five mammoth sixes. Add to that the fact that his innings was almost blemish-free and you know what exactly a captains knock is all about.         
	But the Chargers were very much in the match till the 15th over. True that Adam Gilchrist (9) went back to the hut in as early as the third over, but the defending champions refused to be bogged down by the pressure with Herschelle Gibbs (50) keeping them in the fight.         
	For the record, the visitors were 125 for three after 15 overs compared to the Knights 116 for three at the same stage. With 57 required off the last five overs, the Chargers were very much in contention.         
	But while Sourav and Co. accumulated 65 from the last five, Gilchrists men managed a mere 32. And credit must go to the Knights bowlers for maintaining a tight line and denying the likes of Andrew Symonds (45) any space to slog.         
	At the toss, the former India captains observation was simple  bat first and put up as many runs as you can on the board. However, when Chris Gayle (4), deemed by many to be the Knights saviour, departed in the third over, many would have guessed the outcome of the match  another below-par show from the beleaguered Knights.         
	Well, Sourav had different plans.         
	The most important aspect of the Knights commendable show was that they appreciated the importance of not letting the run rate dip during the middle overs. Having raced to 40 in the first five, the home team maintained the tempo, notching up 40 more from the next five overs.         
	Although Sourav stood firm at one end, wickets kept tumbling at the other, somewhat stifling the run rate between the 11th and the 15th overs.         
	Neither Cheteshwar Pujara (17) nor Manoj Tiwary (5) could last long. Much then depended on Australian David Hussey and he did not disappoint. It wasnt a superlative show but was certainly not short of being one of his better efforts given the need of the hour.         
	His 27-ball 31 ensured the arrest in the fall of wickets and provided his captain with the license to go for the kill. And Sourav butchered the Chargers bowlers with measured aggression.         
	He hit the otherwise impressive Pragyan Ojha for three sixes in the 17th over, which added 21 runs to the Knights total, before holing out to Rohit Sharma in the deep off Ojhas last delivery.         
	The day belonged to Sourav. He won the toss, made runs, his bowling changes produced wickets, he was the Man of the Match and last, but certainly not the least, won the match.         
	What more do you expect from the Knight who retired from the rigours of international cricket two years ago? And as far as his immortal critics are concerned  they must have had a happy April Fools Day!

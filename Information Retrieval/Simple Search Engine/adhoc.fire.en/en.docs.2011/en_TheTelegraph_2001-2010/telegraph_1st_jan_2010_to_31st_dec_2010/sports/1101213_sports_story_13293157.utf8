The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | De Villiers: Indians prestige at stake
                                                                                                                       7                                      De Villiers: Indians prestige at stake
                      
	Johannesburg: The mind games have already started ahead of the India-South Africa Test series with Proteas star batsman AB de Villiers saying that there would be a question mark on the visitors No. 1 ranking if they falter in the three-match series starting December 16.         
	Theres been this feeling and statistics show it, that their batters score bigger and they generally perform better at home  which is normal. This will be a big test for them. Theres always been the label that they struggle in South Africa, De Villiers told a daily.         
	If they dont find success here, therell definitely be a question mark about their No. 1 ranking, he said.         
	De Villiers said he admires Sachin Tendulkar in the Indian team but hoped that the veteran right-hander does not strike form in the three-Test series starting in Centurion.         
	Sachin is a legend of the game and Ill always look up to him. Its great that he is here. It might be his last series in South Africa, so youve got to enjoy having the man around, but Im hoping he doesnt score too many hundreds.         
	The 26-year-old De Villiers has 4540 runs in 63 Tests at an average of over 47 and has been a mainstay of South Africas batting line-up.         
	Talking about his teams chances in the upcoming series, De Villiers said the visitors would gain from having South African Gary Kirsten as coach but the hosts have the quality bowlers to contain their much-vaunted batting line-up.         
	He (Kirsten) has got a lot of knowledge on conditions here. Theyll (Indians) have all the necessary information. They are a class team and they gave us a run for our money the last time they were here. I back our seam bowlers. Dale (Steyn) and Morne (Morkel) will be big danger men. We are playing at home so we should know the conditions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manager to return after tiff
                                                                                                                       7                                      Manager to return after tiff
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Bob Houghton      
	New Delhi: Bob Houghtons worries with the Indian team do not end either with injuries, poor form or lack of international friendlies.         
	On Friday, the Indian team, currently practising in Dubai, was plunged in further crisis after manager Pradeep Chowdhury reportedly had a tiff with the British coach and decided to return home almost immediately.         
	Contacted, AIFF general secretary Kushal Das said: Yes, the manager is coming backhe has some personal health problems. So we have agreed to release him with immediate effect. Mr. Chowdhury may join the team later during the Asian Cup in Doha.         
	AIFF sources, however, revealed that Chowdhury, a former Mohun Bagan and India defender, decided to pack his bags after he developed serious differences with Houghton.         
	Chowdhury called up the federation on Friday morning and said he was returning home. The AIFF officials tried their best to pursue the manager to change his mind but he was simply adamant, said an official.         
	Though neither Chowdhury nor Houghton responded to repeated phone calls and text messages, sources in the Indian team said the manager felt insulted by some of Houghtons remarks.         
	Houghton, who guided India to three titles since 2006, has been in the centre of controversy for the past few months. First, he threatened to resign till his contract was not extended by the AIFF and then he was accused of making racial remarks against an Indian referee in an international friendly at Pune.         
	To add to it, with just four days left for the final registration of 23 players for the Asian Cup, the injury to skipper Bhaichung Bhutia has become another cause of worry.         
	The national captain, who was instrumental in taking India to the Asian Cup finals for the first time in 25 years with a sterling performance in the qualifiers, is yet to recover from the calf muscle injury on his right leg.         
	So much so, Bhutia is now planning to get his personal physician flown to Dubai and hoping to get fit before the start of the tournament. It has got nothing to do with the AIFF. I am trying to get my doctor here on my own initiative, said Bhutia from Dubai.         
	All India Football Federation (AIFF) has already sent a doctor from the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and is awaiting a detailed report from him.         
	Asked what his chances are of playing in the continents premier tournament, Bhutia said: I still give it a 50-50 chance. I went to Chennai a couple of weeks back for treatment and returned to Dubai totally fit. Unfortunately, once again I got injured here, rued the seasoned striker.         
	Bhutia said he was still hopeful of making the squad for the tournament beginning on January 9 next year. This is one tournament I have been looking forward to playing for a long time. I will do my best to return to shape and play the Asian Cup, Bhutia said.

	London: The ban on England players wives and girlfriends until six weeks into the Ashes has not gone down too well with mercurial batsman Kevin Pietersen, who is said to be sulking at the prospect of having to stay away from his family.         
	Pietersen has already made his disagreement with team director Andy Flowers decision by stating, This is not something Im going to comment on. It will get me into trouble.         
	Theyre due to arrive on December 10 or 11. Will I be counting down the days? Definitely. In the last couple of days Dylan has just started to try to sit up. Those are the kind of things you miss, like when he starts crawling, and thats never nice, Pietersen was quoted as saying by an English daily. Its not something Im looking forward to.           (PTI)

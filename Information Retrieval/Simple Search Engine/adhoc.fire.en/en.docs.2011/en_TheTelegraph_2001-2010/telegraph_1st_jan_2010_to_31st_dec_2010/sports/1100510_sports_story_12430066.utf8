The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZ face English test
                                                                                                                       7                                      NZ face English test
                      
	Gros Islet: Almost certain of a semi-final spot with consecutive wins, a buoyant England will be gunning for a hattrick of victory while New Zealand face a do-or-die situation in their last Group E Super Eight stage match of the World Twenty20 here Monday.         
	With victories over Pakistan and South Africa, England are virtually through to the semis and Paul Collingwoods men would be hoping to complete a hattrick of victories on the morrow.         
	Their fine form notwithstanding, it, however, would be far from a cakewalk for the English side as New Zealand have put behind their 13-run loss against South Africa and eked out a thrilling one run win over Pakistan to put their campaign back on track.

            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: The Netherlands coach Bert van Marwijk Monday promised that his team would produce beautiful football in their coming matches in South Africa.         
	Minutes after beating Denmark 2-0 at Soccer City, Marwijk said: I think my team played good football in the first match. Perhaps the boys were a bit tense. We wanted to play beautiful football but we lost the ball too often. In the coming matches, the spectators would get to watch a better game from our side.         
	Calm and composed after their first win, the Dutch coach was not upset when someone suggested that his team took the lead only because of a freak own goal.         
	Yes, I admit we were lucky to get that goal. But we missed too many chances. We should have scored many more goals in the match, said the coach.         
	I have been thinking of this game for a long time, because it is always a tough match and it is so important to get off to a good start, the 58-year-old coach said.         
	We could have won by more. It was a huge relief when the second goal went in. In the second half we started with a lucky goal, so it was up to Denmark to come out but they didnt have the conviction or the force to.         
	I have said a hundred thousand times that sometimes we are arrogant and that sometimes it might backfire on us, and I have told my players from day one that we must not fall into that trap.         
	The absence of Arjen Robben was not felt in this match, said the coach. Let him recover fully and then he will be back in the game, said Marwijk. Today (Monday) we won 2-0, so there you go. You can hardly say that you missed him.         
	Arjen is an exceptional player who on his own can make a difference. But weve got a couple of others and Im really pleased to have them on board. It does give some reassurance that we can call him up when the time is right. As for this match, I thought the cooperation was excellent between Wesley Sneijder, Rafael van der Vaart and Robin van Persie.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kallis knockout punch

  - Hosts take a mammoth 484-run lead; India lose Sehwag, Gambhir             Gautam Gambhir on way to his 80, on Saturday                           
	Centurion: Virender Sehwag (63) and Gautam Gambhir (80) gave a solid start as India staged a spirited fightback after conceding a mammoth 484-run lead on the third day of the first Test against South Africa here Saturday.         
	After South Africa declared their first innings at an imposing 620 for four, India put up a better batting display to reach 190 for two at stumps, still trailing by 294 runs.         
	Rahul Dravid was batting on 28 from 48 balls while nightwatchman Ishant Sharma was unbeaten on seven to raise hopes of saving the game on a pitch, which has eased out considerably. With two full days left in the match, Indian batsmen will have to bat out of their skin to fancy their chances of salvaging a draw in the series-opener. Showing no signs of pressure, Sehwag and Gambhir sought to make amends for Indias batting debacle in the first innings though both were lucky to get a reprieve.         
	Sehwag was let off when he was on 34 with a diving Hashim Amla spilling a difficult chance at short cover off Lonwabo Tsotsobe. Alviro Petersen dropped Gambhir at cover region off Dale Steyn when the southpaw was on 35.         
	The Indian opening pair put on 137 runs before spinner Paul Harris plotted the dismissal of Sehwag to capture his 100th Test wicket.         
	Sehwag, who looked quite comfortable in the middle, went for a mighty heave but failed to get to the line of the ball and spooned a catch to Graeme Smith at long off. Sehwags 63 came from 79 balls and was studded with nine fours and a six.         
	Gambhir seemed to be looking for his 10th Test century and his first on South African soil before he was done in by a Dale Steyn delivery, which kept low without much bounce towards the end of the day. Steyn angled his delivery from round the wicket and it kept a touch low after pitching on off stump. It missed Gambhirs bat and rapped him plumb for a leg before decision.         
	But the day clearly belonged to the in-form AB de Villiers, who smashed the fastest century by a South African taking just 75 balls to complete his hundred. Jacques Kallis (201 not out) also made the day memorable by notching up his maiden double century. Resuming from their overnight score of 366 for two, Amla (140) and Kallis continued from where they had left Friday. The two scored briskly as Indian pacers, Sreesanth and Ishant Sharma, failed to get an early breakthrough with the second new ball.         
	Amla was the more aggressive of the two, who looked unyielding and punished anything pitched short or wide.         
	It was until a poor shot from the Proteas batsman that India could get rid of Amla. He tried to flick Ishant down the leg side sending a nick to MS Dhoni behind stumps.         
	The in-form de Villiers, who joined the action, made his intentions clear by clobbering Ishant and debutant pacer Jaidev Unadkat to the boundary in quick succession.         
	Kallis notched up his maiden double century in Test cricket with a flick off Unadkat. The duo put on a rollicking 224-run fourth wicket partnership before Ishant managed to separate them by removing de Villiers.           (PTI)

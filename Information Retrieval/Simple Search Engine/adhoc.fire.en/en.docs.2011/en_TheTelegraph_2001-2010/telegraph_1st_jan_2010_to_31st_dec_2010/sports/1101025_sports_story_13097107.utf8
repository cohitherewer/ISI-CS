The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand held to a draw
                                                                                                                       7                                      Anand held to a draw
                      
	Nanjing: World Champion Viswanathan Anand was held to a draw by Vugar Gashimov of Azerbaijan in the fifth round of the Pearl Spring Chess tournament.         
	After a disastrous blunder that resulted in a loss against Etienne Bacrot of France from a seemingly drawn endgame, Anand was cautious against Gashimov and repeated moves in the middle game to remain on a 50 per cent score at the half way stage of this six-players double round-robin tournament.         
	With five rounds still to come, Anand is on the third spot on 2.5 points.

	London: Brede Hangeland headed a late equaliser soon after scoring an own goal to secure Fulham a 2-2 draw against Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday, and Andy Carroll scored a hattrick in Newcastles 6-0 hammering of Aston Villa.         
	Hangeland appeared to have gifted United all three points by deflecting an 84th-minute corner from Ryan Giggs into his own net, but he made amends by powering a header past goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar in the 89th.         
	I looked at the clock after my own goal and thought I had five minutes to score at the right end, and fortunately I managed to do it, the Norway defender said.         
	I dont think there was much I could do about the own goal but Im glad I could make up for it.         
	United substitute Nani could have put the game beyond Fulham two minutes after Hangelands own goal, but the Portugal winger had a penalty saved by David Stockdale after Damien Duff was penalised for handball.         
	When you have the lead and you have the opportunity to seal the game with a penalty, you think youre home and dry but Ive got to give credit to Fulham, United manager Alex Ferguson said. His side have not won at Fulham in three seasons.         
	In-form midfielder Paul Scholes gave United the lead in the 11th with a trademark shot from outside the box but Simon Davies equalised for Fulham 12 minutes after half time.         
	England striker Wayne Rooney missed the match because of illness.         
	The low, powerful strike was the 35-year-old Scholess 150th United goal and he looked set to dominate the headlines again with an accomplished midfield performance.         
	Its never easy to score from 20-odd yards. He has a tremendous record and once again hes done it, Ferguson said.         
	Again, he was one of the best players on the pitch.         
	From the outset at Craven Cottage, Scholes was spraying passes along the surface with his trademark accuracy.         
	Rooneys absence enabled Javier Hernandez to make his first United start and the Mexico forward combined well with Dimitar Berbatov.         
	Fulham responded by pressing forward with the confidence of a team that had beaten United on their previous two visits.         
	It took two saves from former Fulham goalkeeper Van der Sar to thwart them. Clint Dempsey flicked the ball onto Dickson Etuhu, whose first shot was blocked by Van der Sars low save and the rebound was tipped over with the Dutchmans outstretched arm.         
	In the match-day program, Fulham chairman Mohamed Al Fayed had warned United to stay away from his players.         
	They cannot go on looking in our window whenever the fancy takes them, Al Fayed wrote, having seen Chris Smalling in the off-season follow Van der Sar and Louis Saha by heading to Old Trafford in recent years.         
	United, thus, failed to keep pace with expected title rivals Chelsea, who are top after beating Wigan 6-0 away on Saturday to follow on from their thrashing of West Brom by the same score on the opening weekend.         
	Chelsea are the only side with two wins from their opening two games, and are two points clear of six teams.         
	Fulham remain unbeaten at the start of their record-setting 10th season in the top flight with two straight draws.         
	Earlier, Newcastle became the third team  after Chelsea and Arsenal  to record a 6-0 win this weekend by taking advantage of some woeful defending by Villa.         
	The match could have taken a different path had Aston Villa striker John Carew converted an early penalty but he smashed his spot kick over the bar and Newcastle dominated after that.         
	Joey Barton and midfield teammate Kevin Nolan put Newcastle 2-0 in front before home-town striker Carroll opened his account in the 34th.         
	Carroll added two more goals after the break to complete his hattrick, before Nolan scored his second deep into stoppage time.         
	Its a great feeling, especially in front of the home fans. Im just over the moon with all three of them, the 21-year-old Carroll said.         
	We expected a very tough game, but once we got the first goal that lifted any fears we might have had and we played some very good attacking football, managed to keep it going and score some very good goals, said Newcastle manager Chris Hughton.         
	The quality and intensity of our play was too much for them.         
	Villa  without a permanent manager after Martin Neill left days before the start of the season  missed the dynamism of midfielder James Milner, who was sold to Manchester City on Wednesday, and failed to build on their opening-day 3-0 home win over West Ham.         
	We started the season well last week so its disappointing to get beaten by a decent Newcastle side, interim manager Kevin MacDonald said. The missed penalty changes things to certain extent.         
	On Saturday, Theo Walcott scored a hattrick as Arsenal routed promoted Blackpool 6-0 to go second in the table on goal difference, and there were also wins for Bolton at West Ham, Birmingham at home to Blackburn, Tottenham at Stoke and West Brom at home to Sunderland. Everton drew 1-1 at home to Wolverhampton.         
	On Monday, Manchester City plays Liverpool.           (AGENCIES)

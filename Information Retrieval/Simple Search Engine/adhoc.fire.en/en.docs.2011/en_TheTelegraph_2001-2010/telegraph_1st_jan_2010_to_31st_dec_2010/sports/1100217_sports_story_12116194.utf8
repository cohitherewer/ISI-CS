                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav: Sehwag among top three all-time India greats
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 
  -  Icon on his first Test at Eden as a former international and more             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Calcutta: Tuesday saw Sourav Ganguly, Indias mindset-changing captain, return to the Eden for the first time in a Test as a former International.         
	He spent around an hour-and-a-half in the lower tier of the Club House, mostly sandwiched between closest buddy Joydeep Mukherjee and Shib Shankar Paul (who is on the mend after knee surgery), before heading towards a VIP box with state minister Asok Bhattacharya.         
	Not that Sourav was there for long.         
	While in the lower tier, Sourav spoke to The Telegraph  the Q amp;A session was, however, interrupted a number of times as there was no dearth of autograph seekers. One question (on V.V.S.Laxman and the Eden) was asked later, on the phone.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On sitting in the stands and not in one of the air-conditioned boxes         
	Thats because the best seats are here (lower tier of the Club House)... To get a real feel of whats happening, this is where you need to park yourself.         
	Watching his first Test at the Eden as a former India cricketer         
	(Pauses) Im okay...         
	Whether he regrets having decided to retire after the 2008-09 home series against Australia         
	No... I know Im still getting runs in different forms of the game, but the circumstances then were different... Id considered everything before making the announcement.         
	State of the ongoing Test         
	For South Africa, its getting tougher by the hour...         
	If it could end in four days         
	Would depend on how South Africa bats.         
	The No.1 ranking being at stake         
	Well, the stakes indeed are high... We need to win, isnt it?         
	South Africa winning big, by an innings, in the first Test (in Jamtha)         
	I wasnt surprised because wed been badly hit by injuries... We just didnt have the best XI on the field.         
	Advice for Wriddhiman Saha, who got dropped after making his debut in the first Test         
	He should just hang in there... Keep working hard.         
	The Eden wicket         
	Its a beautiful Test wicket, though its not turning.         
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni as captain         
	Hes been doing very well.         
	The number of marks he would give Dhoni on captaincy         
	I wouldnt get into that, but hes been doing very well.         
	Sachin Tendulkar going as strong as ever         
	Sachins amazing... In my view, what stands out is his ability... Its of such a high quality that it allows him to stand taller than the rest... Four hundreds in four Tests is quite mind-blowing.         
	Thoughts on Virender Sehwag         
	Virus brilliant... Look at the shots he played yesterday (Monday)... I agree with Sachin that his extraordinary balance and hands make him a very special player... Often, he just stands and cuts loose, with no footwork...         
	Sehwags standing among the all-time India greats in Test cricket         
	Oh, hes definitely in the top three... Sachin, Sunil Gavaskar and Viru... Id place Rahul Dravid fourth.         
	Fifth?         
	(Laughs) The rest follow.         
	Laxmans love affair with the Eden         
	That hes got four hundreds says it all.         
	Whether its Laxman who comes to mind first or Harbhajan Singh, whenever he reflects on the March 2001 epic at the Eden, against Australia         
	Three, in fact... Laxman, Harbhajan and Dravid... The massive match-winning partnership between Laxman and Dravid and Harbhajans hat-trick, a first for India...         
	That Test changing the players mindset         
	Feels nice I was then the captain... That Test and series will remain milestones in our cricket.         
	Shane Bond not being registered in the Knight Riderss initial squad of 23         
	Thats because hes not available for the first match (against the Deccan Chargers, on March 12). Theres nothing else to it.         
	The Knights plans in the lead up to IPL 2010         
	Well be having a full-fledged camp in Calcutta from the end of this month.         
	Shuttling between Calcutta and Cuttack for the national one-dayers         
	Im off again, tomorrow (Wednesday) morning...         
	Finally, what continues to motivate him to play         
	(After a pause) I like playing... I know Im through with international cricket, though.

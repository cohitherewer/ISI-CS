	What is the difference between an off-cutter and an outswinger?              
	(Soven Chakraborty, 15, Calcutta-11)              
	An outswinger is a ball that leaves the right-hander in the air while an off-cutter is one that comes back into the right-hander after pitching. This is assuming a right-arm bowler is bowling to a right-handed batsman.     
	I am a right-handed batsman and often get bowled when attempting the sweep against a leg spinner. Please help.              
	(Sohit Paul, 19, Calcutta)              
	Make sure you get your front foot across when attempting the shot. You are obviously exposing your stumps and picking the wrong delivery to play the shot.               
	I am a right-handed batsman. Very often a sudden lapse in concentration leads to my dismissal after getting past 50. How can I correct this?              
	(Ramen Bhattacharjee, 22, Purulia)              
	Tell yourself you got to start all over again focusing on one ball at a time and keeping the tempo going.               
	I am a right-handed opener. A couple of months back I got hit on the face by a bouncer. I needed stitches. Now I think I am short on confidence when at the crease. Please help.              
	(Biswajit Roy, 19, Calcutta)              
	It can happen. Only way to sort this out is to get back to the nets. Practise getting into good position to play the short ball wearing a helmet with visor.               
	I am a mediumpacer and would like to know the ideal length for pitching a bouncer?              
	(Samar Guha, 25, Calcutta-16)              
	It should be an effort targeted at the throat of the batsman when he is standing in normal position. If you can break a few teeth you have done a good job!               
	I am a 19 year-old left-handed batsman. I find it difficult to negotiate when a leg spinner pitches the ball on the rough. Please help.              
	(Nantu Roy, Calcutta)              
	Get close to the pitch of the ball when going forward. Also watch the ball coming out of the bowlers hand.               
	I am a right-arm medium pacer. I often spray it down the leg-side trying to bowl the delivery that will hold its line. How do I keep a perfect line?              
	(Biltu Pramanik, Calcutta)              
	Keep your head still and dont fall over at the time of delivery. Also work on your wrist position.               
	I am a right-handed batsman. How does one play the googly and identify it when coming out of the bowlers hand?              
	(Samprit Dhar, 21, Calcutta)              
	Very simple... It will come out of the back of the hand.               
	I am left-handed batsman. I often fall leg before to inswinging deliveries. Why does this happen?              
	(Sanjeev Roy, 19, Calcutta)              
	Dont commit yourself by getting too far across. Also wait for the ball to come to you rather than push at it.               
	I am an all-rounder. I have been doing a lot of running and gym during the off season. Is it okay?              
	(Suhat Penang, Gangtok)              
	Very good Combine it with a lot of stretching.

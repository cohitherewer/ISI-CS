The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Woods will be fine, say doctors
                                                                                                                       7                                      Woods will be fine, say doctors
                      
	Los Angeles: Tiger Woods is unlikely to experience any long-term problems because of his lingering neck pain and could feel better by next week, medical experts said on Tuesday.         
	The World No. 1 was forced to withdraw from the final round of Players Championship in Florida and will have MRI scans on his troublesome neck later this week.         
	For Tiger to pull out in the final round, there must have been considerable pain, Dr. Alex Vaccaro, a professor of orthopedics and neurosurgery, said. He must have been having some functional disability with his upper extremity.         
	Fortunately neck pain, back pain, arm pain or leg pain is often very transient, lasting for a few days to a week. The vast majority are better in two weeks. So if he falls within that class, he should be fine next week -- most likely.         
	Dr. Victor Khabie, a sports medicine specialist at Northern Westchester Hospital, felt the games leading player would probably be sidelined from the game for at least three weeks.         
	If the MRI shows there is not major structural damage, meaning there is not a herniated disk, then we are probably looking at three to six weeks, Khabie said. (Reuters)

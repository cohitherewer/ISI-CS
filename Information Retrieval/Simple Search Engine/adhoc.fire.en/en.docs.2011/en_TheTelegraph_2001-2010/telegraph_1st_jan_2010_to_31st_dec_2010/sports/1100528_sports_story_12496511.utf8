	Bulawayo: The World Twenty20 debacle still fresh in mind, a new-look Indian team would look to test their bench strength when they face Zimbabwe in the opening match of a triangular ODI series, also involving Sri Lanka, here Friday.         
	With big names rested for the series, the tournament comes as an opportunity for the youngsters to prove their worth at the international level, especially with the 50-over World Cup just over nine months away.         
	It will also be a test of character for the young Suresh Raina, who will make his captaincy debut after as many as eight senior players, including regular captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, were rested for the tournament.         
	But what might work in Rainas favour is that he will lead a bunch of young, fresh and fit players who are eager to perform at the international arena and be in the reckoning for a place in the Indian team.         
	Raina has an aggressive deputy in Virat Kohli, who would be keen to prove his worth to the selectors after being ignored for the World Twenty20.         
	Left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha and leg-spinner Amit Mishra also have a point to prove after the World Twenty20 snub while Yusuf Pathan, Rohit Sharma and Dinesh Karthik, along with Raina, will form the core of the Indian batting line-up during the series.         
	Other rookies who will be looking to make a mark are off-spinner R. Ashwin and aggressive wicket-keeper batsman Naman Ojha.         
	However, an area which will be a matter of concern for Raina is the pace department. With the likes of Ashok Dinda, R. Vinay Kumar, Pankaj Singh and Umesh Yadav, the Indian seam attack lacks experience and it remains to be seen how the quartet handles the pressure situations.         
	Incidentally, the Raina-led side has a fair idea about Zimbabwean conditions as players like Pankaj Singh, Pragyan and Rohit were part of the A team that toured the African country in 2007. India last sent a full side to Zimbabwe way back in 2005-06.         
	On the other hand, the absence of so many international stars have irked the cash-strapped Zimbabwe Cricket which was banking on this series to revive the game here.         
	With very little international cricket scheduled here, the tri-series is also seen as Zimbabwes last chance to test their abilities before next years World Cup.         
	After hosting Sri Lanka in 2008, Zimbabwe have played minnows like Kenya, Bangladesh and Afghanistan at home and the successful hosting of this series will portray a positive image of the game there.         
	From the tournament point of view, Sri Lanka have also fielded a young team and have rested key players, prominent among them were regular skipper Kumar Sangakkara and the in-form Mahela Jayawardene.         
	Like India, the series also provides Sri Lanka the opportunity to test their resources and allow a few youngsters to gain some international experience.

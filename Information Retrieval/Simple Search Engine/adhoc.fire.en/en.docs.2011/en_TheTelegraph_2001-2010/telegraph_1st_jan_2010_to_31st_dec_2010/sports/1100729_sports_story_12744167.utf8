The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hundred at important time: Sachin 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Hundred at important time: Sachin 
  - It would be nice to join Dadas league, says debutant Suresh Raina       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            
	Colombo: Its a hundred which came at an important time ... Im happy, but the work continues, the talismanic Sachin Tendulkar told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening, shortly after returning to the Taj Samudra.         
	Asked if he and debutant Suresh Raina had taken India to safety, or almost, that is, Sachin grinned a wee bit and replied: Lets wait and see...         
	Complimenting Raina, Sachin said: Hes batted very well... He didnt need a lot of encouragement (to get going)...         
	Sachin, by the way, was surprised to learn that his unbeaten 108 is his first Test hundred in Sri Lanka in 11 years. Oh, I didnt realise it...         
	His last in this island-nation had been 124 not out in the second innings of the Asian Test Championship match, back in February 1999.         
	[In an interview to the TV rights holder, Sachin made the following points: (a) one had to keep working hard on fitness; (b) it would be difficult to replace Muttiah Muralidharan; (c) the responsibility on Ajantha Mendis and Suraj Randiv was huge; (d) the Indian batsmen had sorted out Mendis.]         
	Meanwhile, speaking exclusively, Raina accepted that hed been nervous to start with.         
	Nervousness zaroor tha, but it helped having such a great player at the other end... When I walked in to take guard in a Test for the first time, Sachin reminded me that the moment would never come again and I should enjoy it ... I followed his advice.         
	Raina, wholl be resuming on 66, added: This is a big opportunity for me and Im determined not to let it go ... Im not thinking of a hundred, but it would be nice to join Dada (Sourav Ganguly)s league ... Dekhiye kya hota hai...         
	Sourav remains the last Indian left-hander to post a hundred, 131 as it turned out, on debut. He did so at Lords, 14 years ago.         
	The wicket, Raina maintained, was still good. If were able to consolidate, then it will be interesting to see Sri Lankas body language and the mood in their dressing room.         
	So, fingers crossed ...

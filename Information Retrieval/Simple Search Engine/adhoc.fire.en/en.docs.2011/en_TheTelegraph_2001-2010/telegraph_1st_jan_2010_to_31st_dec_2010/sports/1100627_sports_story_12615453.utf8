The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Its Messi vs Mexico
                                                                                                                       7                                        Its Messi vs Mexico
  - In-form Argentina get ready for Round II clash against Marquez amp; Co.       JAYDEEP BASU            Diego Maradona during a press conference, in Pretoria, on Saturday. (AP)                                 
	Pretoria: The big crowd outside the High Performance Centre waited patiently even though they stood no chance of getting inside. The gates were tightly locked and were guarded by a team of gun-toting policemen, wearing bulletproof vests and eyeing everyone suspiciously.         
	Inside, at the training ground, Diego Maradona and his 23 men were going through their final practice session before the round of 16 encounter against Mexico and no one was allowed to go in.         
	Yet, hundreds of excited Argentine fans, many with Messi written on their jerseys, and scores of journalists and television crew stood there to have a glimpse of the players. Most of them seriously believed they were waiting for the potential champions.         
	To try and predict the winners would be too early but Argentina are surely one of the biggest hits here for many reasons. Their style of play is silky and eye-catching, they have a player called Lionel Messi who is in devastating form and a coach who is still the most sought after man in world football. To add to it, Argentina didnt break a sweat in qualifying for the second round, easing past the resistance Nigeria, South Korea and Greece in their stride.         
	Though Argentina havent been tested seriously so far, which has prompted some people to question their ability to counter bigger teams, Maradonas men have been the most impressive of all.         
	Alarmed by the overwhelming attention his boys are getting, Maradona is trying to play down the success of his team. We came here to fight. Now that we have won three matches on the trot, we have been termed as the most beautiful team. But I am satisfied with what I am. My boys are great fighters, I am proud of them, he said.         
	On Saturday, Maradona divided his squad into two teams during the practice. When someone asked about his possible team, the coach smiled and said: There are too many Mexican journalists around. I am not going to name my team here. After resting seven of his first team players against Greece in the last group league match, Maradona is likely to make quite a few changes in the team. While skipper Javier Mascherano, striker Carloz Tevez and Gonzalo Higuian are set to return, defenders Gabriel Heinze, Walter Samuel and Jonas Gutierrez should also be in the starting line-up.         
	Juan Sebastien Veron, who missed the match against South Korea because of an injury but returned to the side against Greece, may also retain his place. On several occasions, Maradona has described the veteran midfielder as the key executor of his plans on the pitch.         
	Mexico have already been part of two hard-fought games, beating France 2-0 and losing to Uruguay 0-1. They are always a tough side and their wide play and defensive discipline would definitely help them against the Argentines. They have also proved to be quite dangerous on counter attacks.         
	Four years ago in Germany, the two teams met at the same stage with Argentina managing a 2-1 win after Maxi Rodriguez struck in the extra time. The current Argentine team seems to be much stronger with World Footballer of the Year Messi playing devastating football along with Higuian upfront while Gabriel Heinze and Martin Demichelis have done a decent job at the back.         
	In the Mexican team, Carlos Vela might make a comeback after he was replaced midway through the France match because of a hamstring injury. Along with Vela, defender Efrain Juarez would also make a comeback following a pair of bookings. But then, nothing is going to work for Mexico unless they can manage to contain Messi, the man who has the potential to make all the difference against any opposition in the current World Cup. If Messi continues to sparkle in his usual form, Maradona has every chance of emulating the feat of Franz Beckenbauer, the only man in the world to win the World Cup both as a captain and a coach.         
	Likely Teams         
	Argentina (3-4-3): 22-Sergio Romero, 17-Jonas Gutierrez, 2-Martin Demichelis, 13-Walter Samuel, 6-Gabriel Heinze, 14-Javier Mascherano, 7-Angel Di Maria, 8-Juan Sebastian Veron, 10-Lionel Messi, 9-Gonzalo Higuain, 11-Carlos Tevez         
	Mexico (4-3-3): 1-Oscar Perez, 16-Efrain Juarez, 4-Rafael Marquez, 2-Francisco Rodriguez, 3-Carlos Salcido, 6-Gerardo Torrado, 18-Andres Guardado, 5-Ricardo Osorio, 17-Giovani Dos Santos, 9-Guillermo Franco, 14-Javier Hernandez         
	Referee: Roberto Rosetti (Italy)

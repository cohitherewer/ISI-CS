The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bafana Bafana feel the home pressure 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bafana Bafana feel the home pressure 
            JAYDEEP BASU                      
	Johannesburg: About a dozen South African football fans have started fasting with the hope that their team would do well in the World Cup. Some others fans have decided not to indulge in drinking and sexual activities with similar aim on their minds.         
	On Friday, when Bafana Bafana take on Mexico in the World Cup opener, a capacity crowd of 95,000, armed with vuvuzelas, are expected to be at the Soccer City. An equal number of people could be standing outside as they wont get tickets, said an officer at the ticketing centre in the most nonchalant tone.         
	Though the excitements have already reached dizzying heights, South Africas Brazilian coach Carlos Alberto Pereira declared he was unperturbed by the development. In 1994, after leading Brazil to their first World Cup triumph in 24 years, Pereira, disgusted with public criticism, accused his own country of having 40 million coaches.         
	On Thursday, Pereira was in a different mood. Knowing well that a defeat is likely to invite severe criticism of his process of selection and style of coaching, Pereira said he was aware of peoples expectations but wasnt affected by that.         
	I know the World Cup has a degree of hope. You have to understand the feeling of the people. Our team should work for the happiness of the people, he said.         
	On the whole, its given to predict that the hosts in the World Cup always advance from the group stage. Even the US in 1994 and South Korea and Japan in 2002 did the trick despite not being great sides.         
	A lot of people believe that South Africa could prove to be an exception this time. When a local journalist suggested that his team could fail to reach the knock-out stage, Pereira said he was aware of the pressure but has asked the boys to relax and play their own game.         
	Mexico is a good team and anything can happen. Though I have told the boys to enjoy their game, I dont know how far it would be possible, Pereira, considered one of worlds top coach, hastened to add.         
	Knives will be out on Friday if the hosts fail to get past Mexico. Looking at the last four editions of the African Nations Cupheld every two yearsits easy to see why many football observers are skeptical of the Bafana Bafanas chances of making it out of the group stage.         
	The Bafana Bafana have had one win in the last four African Nations Cup, which came in 2002. Also, the South Africans even failed to reach the 2010 edition, failing in the qualifiers, which also served as the World Cup qualifiers.         
	The 2009 Confederations Cup saw the Bafana Bafana get out of a group which featured European champions Spain, Asian champions Iraq, and Oceanic champions New Zealand, and saw them give Brazil a good game in the semifinals.         
	This time, one is not sure whether South Africa would be able to repeat their good show despite the fact the team would enjoy the support of the huge number of spectators. The Mexicans, after all, have enough experience to silence the sound that can threaten to do lasting damage to eardrums around the country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murrays discipline helps him survive
                                                                                                                       7                                        Murrays discipline helps him survive
            CHRISTOPHER CLAREY            Maria Sharapova in Paris, on Tuesday. (Reuters)                           
	Paris: It was not quite self-loathing. It never went as far on Monday as it used to go for Andy Murray, a perfectionist in a game where perfection is simply not an option.         
	Lets call it self-disliking then, and it peaked when Murray  already down two sets to none in the first round of the French Open  tried and failed to serve out the third set against Richard Gasquet.         
	There were mutterings, then more mutterings, then another long, slightly menacing look in the direction of his camp after he rose from his chair and shuffled to the other side of the Suzanne Lenglen court. Terrible, Murray said when he arrived in earshot. Terrible, he repeated. Terrible! he concluded.         
	And so it had been, but clay-court tennis at Roland Garros is a marathon, not a sprint, and Murray, who once had a big junk food habit, has gradually transformed himself into a serious professional athlete in the past three seasons. That transformation played a big role in the comeback to come as Murray rallied to win, 4-6, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-2, 6-1, on a warm and sunny Monday. He changed his world, Gil Reyes, the American fitness trainer, said during a recent interview.         
	Reyes, who helped change Andre Agassis world and has done the same with Fernando Verdasco, says he admires the fitness work that Murray has done.         
	When I knew that Murray had changed was when he started doing this in matches, Reyes said, flexing his right bicep. Murray, who has struggled since reaching the Australian Open final in January, saved his flexing until after he served an ace on match point Monday, but then this was more Davis Cup encounter than Grand Slam encounter with Gasquet, a very flashy Frenchman trying to fight his way back to relevance after missing the last two French Opens.         
	The British might outnumber the French in some parts of Provence, Brittany and the Dordogne, but that was not the case on the Suzanne Lenglen court. Murray was sage enough to avoid letting his body language become too bellicose, though he did complain to the chair umpire about the pace of play.         
	But beating Gasquet was proving difficult enough without the crowd turning nasty. It was tough on Murrays home turf at Wimbledon two years ago, too, when Murray also rallied from two sets down to beat Gasquet in five sets in the fading light on Centre Court in the Round of 16. That, as it turned out, was a pivotal match for both men: part of Gasquets tumble from the top 10 and part of Murrays rise into the top five.         
	When these two 23-year-olds walked on court Monday, Murray was seeded fourth and Gasquet was ranked 68th and unseeded. But Gasquet, once Frances great tennis hope, was flying higher after winning back-to-back tournaments: a challenger in Bordeaux and a regular tour event in Nice last week. He has a new coach this year: the Argentine Gabriel Markus, a former player who liked clay courts the best during his career.         
	Gasquet is also attempting to rebuild his image after last years long-running drama in which he was suspended after testing positive for cocaine. He convinced sport authorities that a kiss at a Miami night club caused the test result.

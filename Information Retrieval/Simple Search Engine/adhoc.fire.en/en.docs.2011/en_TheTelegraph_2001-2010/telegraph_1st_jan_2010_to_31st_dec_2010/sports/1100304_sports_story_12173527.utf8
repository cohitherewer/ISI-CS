	New Delhi: Their bubble having been burst by Australia, India face a must-win situation for Thursdays meeting against Spain in the hockey World Cup.         
	The 2-5 loss to the superbly fit and speedy Australians at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium has jeopardised Indias chances for a last-four berth as they now find themselves reduced to fourth in Pool B, behind group leaders England (six points), Australia and Spain (three each). India, too, have three points from their spectacular win against Pakistan but are behind on goal difference.         
	Despite the setback, chief coach Jose Brasa, who is Spanish himself, remains hopeful about grabbing three points on Thursday. We are not too bothered about Spain. Let them think about us. he said.         
	Spain are the Beijing Olympics silver medallists and strong pre-tournament contenders for a berth in the last-four but their defeat against Pakistan has given hope to the Indians. So much so that veteran midfielder Prabhjot Singh believes India have the strength to get the better of the Spaniards.         
	If we can play the kind of hockey we played against Pakistan, then there is no reason to worry, said Prabhjot. After all, we have a good track record against Spain.         
	India have always done well against Spain although they have not beaten them in recent years. The Spaniards have made rapid progress since 2002 when famous Dutch trainer Maurits Hendriks took over as their national coach. Under Hendriks Spain won the 2003 Champions Challenge, the 2004 Champions Trophy and the 2005 European Nations Cup.         
	Present coach Dani Martin is hopeful that his team would be able to outplay the Indians. They have the advantage of playing at home but we are aware of the situation. The mistakes we committed against Pakistan wont be repeated, he said.         
	Whatever the mood in the Spanish camp, Brasa remains unperturbed. Spain are a good team but they dont have two key players in their side, Santi Freixa and Eduard Tabau.         
	I know the Spanish players, Brasa said. I have trained them for many years. Freixa is not with the current squad due to injury. He is one of the best players in the world. Tabau got injured in the first match. My knowledge of the Spanish team will help India. I am sure we can beat them, he said.         
	But then, more than Spain, it is their own game that India need to worry about. Against Australia, the Indian defence looked pathetic and was completely demolished in the first half-an-hour. Even the midfield and the frontline, sans Shivendra Singh, were not at their best.         
	Brasa has been talking about a mixture of the Indian and European styles but against Australia his game plan was all in a shambles.         
	Thankfully, Spain do not operate at the same pace as the Australians. The Australians are in a completely different league, we are yet not ready to play top teams like Australia. Spain also are a fit team but I am sure the boys can match them in speed, Brasa said.         
	Thursdays matches         
	Pool B: South Africa vs Australia (4.35pm), England vs Pakistan (6.35pm), Spain vs India (8.35pm).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Eden curator livid at Knights official
                                                                                                                       7                                      Eden curator livid at Knights official
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Prabir Mukherjee, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) curator, was livid Tuesday with former Bengal cricketer and Kolkata Knight Riders cricket manager Joydeep Mukherjee for allowing kids to play on the match-pitch after the Kolkata Knight Riders versus Mumbai Indians match on Monday.         
	After the match Joydeep took Shah Rukh Khans son Aryan and some other kids to the centre where they played on the match pitch for a while. Curator Mukherjee, who was not present at the time, is unhappy that Joydeep did not seek his permission on the matter.         
	I have nothing against the kids but Joydeep was a first-class cricketer. He himself should have understood that you cannot use the match strip even if the game is over. I have spoken to him and pointed out that it wasnt the right thing to do, Mukherjee told mediapersons Tuesday.         
	When contacted, Joydeep admitted he had a discussion on the matter with the veteran curator and said that the matter has been amicably sorted out. He is a senior man and was my fathers friend as well. So I have spoken to him on this issue. I guess there are no ill feelings between us, Joydeep said.         
	Incidentally, the curator had an ugly altercation during the Ranji Trophy season with India discard Irfan Pathan when the Baroda pacer invited a scribe inside the ground for an interview much to the dislike of the former.

	New Delhi: The disciplinary committee proceedings against suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi remained inconclusive here on Wednesday.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said in a press release that the cross examination of Peter Griffiths, one of the witnesses, did not conclude after the counsel for Modi requested for more time to conduct his cross examination.         
	The cross-examination of Peter Griffiths is still not concluded. Mr Kotwal, learned counsel for Lalit Modi says he may take some more time. The hearing has been adjourned to September 26, 2010 as earlier scheduled, the BCCI said in a press release.         
	The hearing has been scheduled from September 26 to 28. If need be, the hearing could be extended by a day.

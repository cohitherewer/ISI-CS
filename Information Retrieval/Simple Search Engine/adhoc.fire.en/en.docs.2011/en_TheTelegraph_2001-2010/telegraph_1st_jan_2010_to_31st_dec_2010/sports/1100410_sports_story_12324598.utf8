The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sourav: Why cant people accept that I can perform?
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sourav: Why cant people accept that I can perform?
    -  The KKR captain says he will be around in 2011, too             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE             Sourav Ganguly                                 
	Bangalore: Sourav Ganguly, icon and captain of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), spoke to The Telegraph in his ITC One room at the seven-star Royal Gardenia on Friday afternoon.         
	Right through the 30-minute interview, Sourav, wholl be 38 in three months, kept applying an ice pack to his right ankle.         
	With two MoM awards this season, Souravs been making a significant contribution and is, well, indispensable to the franchise.                 
	The following are excerpts                 
	Q Whats the update on your injury?         
	A Im much better... Im walking... As of now, I should be playing.         
	[Confirmation came later in the day, with coach Dav Whatmore making an announcement at the Chinnaswamy.]         
	Youd looked fine till the presentation ceremony, at the Eden, on Wednesday night. How did you hurt the ankle?         
	I must have done something to it during the match (against the Delhi DareDevils)... On getting to the dressing room, I couldnt even walk... I went to the hotel for treatment by the physio and, then, was driven home... It was so bad then that I had to be carried to the first floor in my fathers wheelchair...         
	The game on Saturday, against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, is another must-win match...         
	It is... The tournament (IPL III) is still wide open... Its a must-win for the hosts, too... From now on, every game featuring KKR, Royal Challengers, DareDevils and the Rajasthan Royals is going to be crucial Only the Mumbai Indians look to be comfortably placed.         
	You seem to have surprised a few with your performances  both with the bat and in the field  this season. Whats your response?         
	(Amused) Ive heard this surprised bit for 15 years... Why cant people accept that I can perform? Why must they be surprised if I do well? I cant understand this... Some would be surprised even when Id perform for India (from 1996-2008).         
	Having lost to Kings XI Punjab, on Sunday, you were under pressure before the DareDevils match. What was the state of your mind?         
	Look, Ive always maintained that in this (T20) format, there are no favourites... Just look at last (Thursday) night, the Deccan Chargers beat the Royal Challengers... So, I didnt take the field thinking that were the underdogs and the DareDevils the favourites...         
	Whats your assessment of your team?         
	Weve struggled in some games, but were a good side... Of course, we need to be consistent and, if we play to potential, then we can beat any team... (After a pause) We shouldnt have lost to the Kings XI after setting them a target of 201... After scoring 200, youd expect to win. Whats more disappointing is that the Kings XI got back to square one in their very next match (losing to the Rajasthan Royals)!         
	In your view, what has made the difference this season?         
	Adequate communication within the team... Last season, that just wasnt there (in the John Buchanan-Brendon McCullum regime)... The players know that only performance counts, nothing else... Ive been making it a point to inform someone being dropped as to why hes not being kept in the XI... If the players are given the reason, then they will remain positive... Its because of adequate communication that weve got a happy dressing room. A proper environment is needed and weve got exactly that.         
	Was it tough leaving McCullum out against the Kings XI?         
	It was... It was also tough to drop David Hussey against the DareDevils... I can field only four overseas players, my hands are tied.         
	Is that your biggest challenge?         
	Its a huge challenge, as is captaining on the field.         
	Do you, then, agree with Whatmore that selecting a national team is actually easier?         
	(Laughs) I do... With there being restrictions, its tough picking an IPL XI.         
	Youve always enjoyed captaincy. After a seasons break, youre back in the KKR saddle... How have the past four weeks gone?         
	It has been good, but a lot of crunch games are coming up.         
	In the first season (2008), youd said that you were learning to captain in T20. With that experience behind you, have you attempted anything different?         
	I think Im handling situations better... Im batting better, too... T20, after all, has to be approached differently... Ive realised that, for me, its best to open.           Its because of adequate communication that weve got a happy dressing room. A proper environment is needed and weve got exactly that         The Difference this season      
	Why didnt you from the very first match?         
	Was trying out combinations, then we won the first two games with a particular opening combination (Brad Hodge, Manoj Tiwary).         
	Did principal owner Shah Rukh Khan request you to open?         
	Shah Rukh and Dav.         
	Most captains feel that theyre only as good as the team at their disposal... Cant you have instances where the captain makes the team shine?         
	Its possible, yes.         
	Like a Shane Warne, who was brilliant against the Deccan Chargers, in Jamtha?         
	But Warne has a good team, make no mistake there.         
	Okay... How do you rate Warne as captain?         
	Hes superb... Warne understands cricket, anticipates well and isnt afraid to take risks... On and off the field, hes done a lot for the Royals.           He rsquo;s   superb... Warne   understands cricket,  anticipates well and isn rsquo;t afraid to take risks... On and off the field, he rsquo;s done a lot for the Royals
    ON SHANE WARNE
      
	How much of your captaincy is intuition-driven?         
	Quite a bit, but it depends on the situation... In the last match, for example, Id thought of opening the bowling with Ashok Dinda and Ajantha Mendis... But Dinda got David Warner in the first over itself and, so, I changed my plans... One has to be flexible.         
	The business end of IPL III isnt far away. Your take on the competition till Thursday?         
	It has been fantastic, with quality cricket being played... (Daughter) Sana watches every KKR game and jumps up and down... She would hardly watch me play for India, but its very different with the IPL... If weve done well, shell be awake to congratulate me, otherwise shell text that I should ask my team to win...         
	A standout performance?         
	The Mumbai Indians have done very well.         
	What has made the difference for them this season?         
	Clearly, the form of Sachin (Tendulkar)... Then, the bowling unit has done well... Zaheer Khan, Lasith Malinga... Some of the youngsters, like (Saurabh) Tiwary, have stepped up... After so many matches at home, its to be seen how the Mumbai Indians fare at other venues.         
	Today, your thoughts on IPL IV?         
	Right now, Im focused on this season, on us trying to make the semi-finals.         
	Its feared that KKRs fan base will dwindle if you hang up your boots...         
	(Smiles) Ill play in 2011... Indeed, if I do well, I may play in 2012 as well... Hopefully, Ill be wearing the same colours (and not that of any other franchise)... With two new teams, the IPL is going to be more demanding, though.         
	Something outside cricket... Whats your reaction to Tiger Woodss remarkable return to golf?         
	Im not surprised... Tigers a champion... The other issues involving him had nothing to do with golf.         
	The last one... What separates champions from lesser mortals?         
	Mind and ability... A combination of both, really.

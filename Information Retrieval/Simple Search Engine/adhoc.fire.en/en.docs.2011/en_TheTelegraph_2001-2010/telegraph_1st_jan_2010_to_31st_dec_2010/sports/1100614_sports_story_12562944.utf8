The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina amp; Co. too good for hosts
                                                                                                                       7                                        Raina amp; Co. too good for hosts
    - Owe it to Kirsten, says India captain             A CORRESPONDENT            Suresh Raina in action, on Sunday. (AP)                                 
	Harare: Captain Suresh Raina led from the front with a blistering 72 as India signed off their tour of Zimbabwe with a comprehensive seven-wicket win over the hosts in the second and final Twenty20 International to win the Micromax Cup.         
	Chasing 141, India made 144 for three in 18 overs at the Harare Sports Club ground with Raina scoring the winning runs hitting Chris Mpofu to boundary. Apart from winning the Man of the Match award, Raina also bagged the Man of the Series award.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Raina: After not doing well in the ODI tri-series, we did come back really well. Full credit to Gary Kirsten for the manner in which he guided us. He inspired us to work hard. Gary never believes in speaking too much but in hard work. That effort paid off. All my players deserve credit. Especially, Rohit and Virat batted well. The bowlers have also done well. This tour has been thoroughly enjoyable. Now its time for the Asia Cup and loads of hard work.         
	Elton Chigumbura: We fell 20 runs short today (Sunday). We batted better than Saturday but still that wasnt enough. It has been a good time leading the side. Especially, in the 50-over format where we did really well. However, when you tend to lose few matches, you start feeling the pressure. But you have to remain cool and continue the good work which is the key. As far as my batting is concerned, I believe, I am just one innings away from getting back to form.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Staying fit is the top priority for Sania
                                                                                                                       7                                      Staying fit is the top priority for Sania
                      
	New Delhi: Sania Mirza, who recently won an ITF tournament in Dubai to end the year on a high, on Tuesday, expressed confidence of a good show in the Australian Open early next year.         
	The 24-year-old, who is now ranked 164th in the world, beat Bojana Jovanovski of Serbia 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 in the $75,000 Al Habtoor Tennis Challenge final, on Sunday, in Dubai.         
	Its really satisfying. Its like a dream come true considering the way I started the season with an injury. In the last six months I have been playing consistent tennis. And going into a Grand Slam with a title and beating a top 40 player gives you a lot of confidence, Sania said.         
	She denied that it was a conscious attempt to play ITF tournament in between WTA tournaments.         
	Now ITF are not considered lower tournaments. Some of the events have higher ranked players than WTA tournaments.         
	Recently, I played a WTA tournament in which the top seed was ranked 75. But in Dubai the top seed was ranked 40th, said Sania.         
	It was a good competition. And since I had missed 6-7 tournaments because of Commonwealth Games and Asian Games, so I needed to play, she added.         
	Asked if she can now break into top 50 considering her current form, Sania insisted, Staying healthy is my priority.           (PTI)

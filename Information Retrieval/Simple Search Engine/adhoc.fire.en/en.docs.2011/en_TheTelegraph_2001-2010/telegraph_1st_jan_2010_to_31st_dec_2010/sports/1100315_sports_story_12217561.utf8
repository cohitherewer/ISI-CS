	Kingstown: Zimbabwe struggled to 161 against the West Indies here Sunday, in the fifth ODI between the teams.         
	On a pitch that offered good bounce, the Zimbabwe batsmen found the going too tough and managed another below-par total. But for a fighting 56 from Charles Coventry, who hade been inexplicably left out of the team so far, Zimbabwe would have struggled to cross even 100.

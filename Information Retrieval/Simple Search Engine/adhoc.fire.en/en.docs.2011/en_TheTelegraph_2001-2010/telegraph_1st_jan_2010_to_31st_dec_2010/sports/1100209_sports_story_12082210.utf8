	London: Plans to form the first global sporting were announced at Lords Monday with Rajasthan Royals of the Indian Premier League spearheading an initiative involving teams from around the world.         
	Rajasthan, captained by Shane Warne, have signed an historic link with Hampshire and are in the final stages of talks with Cape Cobras of South Africa, Trinidad amp; Tobago and an unnamed Australian state side.         
	The new franchise, entitled Royals 2020, was initially revealed by last week and is the first sign of the IPL spreading beyond Indian borders.         
	For Rajasthan, the aim is to grow their fan base and commercial strength with roots in each major cricketing nation. An annual tournament, known as the Royals Festival, featuring the Royals 2020 teams will be announced at a later date.         
	Rajasthan claim that for Hampshire and the other Royals partners the deal opens up commercial opportunities and the potential for knowledge and talent sharing with a central revenue pool from sponsorship part of the long-term plan.         
	Hampshire will now play as the Hampshire Royals in the Twenty20 Cup next season with Cape Cobras and Trinidad also set to agree to the Royals branding. I am delighted to be part of this new innovation, and I am excited by what we can achieve, given what we have already achieved, said Warne, a former Hampshire player.         
	Yet again, the Royals are leading the way. It is bonus that clubs with which I have such deep affection are so involved.

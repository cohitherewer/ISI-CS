The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Murali a wonderful competitor: Taylor
                                                                                                                       7                                        Murali a wonderful competitor: Taylor
  - I have always found him to be a lovely man       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mark Taylor                                 
	Calcutta: Perhaps, nobody except Muttiah Muralidharan could have insisted that 800 was only a number.         
	Having achieved everything, it would not have mattered to him, personally, had his Test career finished with a victim short of that awesome figure.         
	For over three hours on Friday afternoon, it did seem as if a fascinating innings, which drew kudos from Presidents (like Mahinda Rajapaksa) and sneers from an insensitive Prime Minister (John Howard), would actually end on 799 wickets.         
	The script, though, did turn out the way all of Sri Lanka wanted. The 800-moment was delayed, yes, but Murali was not to be denied.         
	It is to be seen what Pragyan Ojha achieves in his career, but he will definitely be remembered as the victim.         
	Somebody may raise the bar ten notches, but at this point in time, it is highly inconceivable that Muralis record is going to be put in the shade.         
	It is, after all, a mind-boggling achievement.         
	Moments after Murali became a former Test cricketer, The Telegraph spoke to Mark Taylor, who was Australias captain when Darrell Hair no-balled the off-spinner for throwing, during the MCG Test, back in December 1995.         
	[Hairs compatriot, Ross Emerson, did likewise  in January 1999, in an England-Sri Lanka ODI at the Adelaide Oval.]         
	Taylor, who is on the board of Cricket Australia and a member of the International Cricket Councils cricket committee, saluted Murali thus:         
	Murali has been a wonderful competitor for Sri Lanka and has certainly played a major role in the development of cricket in his country...         
	I have always found him to be a lovely man, extremely engaging and one who loves talking cricket...         
	There is no doubt Murali will be missed by the Sri Lankan team, not just for his wicket-taking ability, but for the pressure he applied and the number of overs he was able to bowl on each day...         
	I wish him all the best.         
	Very special words those, for sure, from one of the top gentleman cricketers (an icon, really) of all time.

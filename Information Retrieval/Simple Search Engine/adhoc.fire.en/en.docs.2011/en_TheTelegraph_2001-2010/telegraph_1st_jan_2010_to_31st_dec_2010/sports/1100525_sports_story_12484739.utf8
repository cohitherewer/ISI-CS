                                                                                                                       7                                      Atwal ends tied 7th 
                      
	Irving (US): Arjun Atwal secured his careers second-best finish in a US PGA Tour event, signing off tied seventh with an even-par 70 in the final round of the HP Byron Nelson Golf Championship. The Orlando-based Indian, whose last top-10 finish was a tied fourth in the 2006 Buick Invitational, finished with a total of six-under 274.         
	Jeev Milkha Singh, the other Indian in the fray, finished tied 32nd with a total of one-under 279 after returning a two-over 72 in the final round. Atwal, whose career had been going downhill due to a lack of form and injury breakdowns, has received a much-needed boost with this show.         
	Australian Jason Day clinched the trophy by two strokes. Americans Brian Gay (63), Jeff Overton (71) and Blake Adams (72) were locked in a three-way tie for second. (PTI)

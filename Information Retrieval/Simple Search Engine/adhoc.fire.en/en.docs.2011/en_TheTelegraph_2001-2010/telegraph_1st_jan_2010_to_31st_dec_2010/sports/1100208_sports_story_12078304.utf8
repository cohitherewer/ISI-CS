	Bangkok: Rising Indian golfer Gaganjeet Bhullar began his new year with a bang, scripting a sensational come-from-behind victory at the season-opening Asian Tour International here Sunday.         
	Going into the final round, Bhullar was six shots off the pace after three successive rounds of 71.         
	But the 21-year-old Kapurthala pro seemed to have reserved his best for the last, blasting a course record eight-under 64 to aggregate 11-under 277 and deny Hwang Inn-choon (69) the title in the $300,000 event.         
	Japans Tetsuji Hiratsuka (68) was a stroke back, followed by the third round leader Kiradech Aphibarnrat of Thailand who faded with a final round 73, finishing tied for fourth with South Africas Jbe Kruger (69).         
	This was Bhullars second Asian Tour title, following his breakthrough win in last years Indonesian President Invitational tournament, which marked him as one of Asias brightest prospects.         
	It was a flawless display by the youngster, who parred the opening hole before an eagle flew off his club on the par-five second hole at the Suwan Golf and Country Club.         
	That set the tone for a sparkling round and the Indian maintained the tempo. Two par shots later, he reeled off a birdie hat-trick and nailed a birdie on the ninth hole as well to lie six-under at the turn.         
	On his way back, Bhullar birdied the 15th and 18th holes as well, while ensuring it was a bogey-free round, to make it a dramatic come-from-behind triumph.         
	Its amazing. I have no words to describe it, Im totally speechless, a beaming Bhullar later said.         
	When I woke up this morning, I just wanted to shoot a good number. I never ever thought I was going to shoot a 64 and win by one.         
	Its like a dream come true. Win at my first event of the year will give me a lot of confidence, said Bhullar, who pocketed $ 47,550 for his exploits.         
	After the 15th whole, where I made a good curling putt, I told myself to make par on 16 and 17 and make a birdie on 18. Everything happened the way I decided. On 18, it was amazing.         
	I told myself that the putt was to win the tournament. It was a crucial one as I had missed the same putt from nearly the same line on the last two days.         
	I had a bit of an idea that it would come from the right. I just got lucky. Im sure my confidence will go up a long way, said the youngster.         
	Im looking forward to next week (Avantha Masters in Gurgaon).         
	 Its a big event and I love the DLF course as Ive won there twice (on the local circuit). Going back to play in front of the home crowd will give me a great sense of achievement, he added.         
	Bhullar said he also had his fair share of luck which made this win possible.         
	I guess Im lucky the golfing gods were with me. I just told myself to hang in there and keep hitting fairways and greens and if Im lucky, the putts will drop. On the front nine, I had an eagle and four birdies and I just held my nerves coming in.         
	Before starting the day, I wouldnt have thought I would win. I just got lucky, he said.         
	Bhullar thanked all who supported him and said his win underlines the unpredictibility of golf.         
	Last night (Saturday), I was surfing the web and I clicked on the Asian Tour website and they had a poll who do you think will win the Asian Tour International and my name was there. I clicked on my name and I had the highest votes.         
	I told myself that it was a bit of a disappointment that I wouldnt win as I had so many votes. But it shows that anything can happen in golf, the 21-year-old said.         
	On his final putt that sealed the victory, Bhullar said, The putt on 18 was 15 to 17 feet. It was a testing putt. I missed that putt the last two days and I had an idea it would break from the right. I was putting good today (Sunday) and just got luck.         
	I dont know what happened with those dropped shots. I kept finding the hazard, Hwang Inn-choon said after the final round.           (AGENCIES)

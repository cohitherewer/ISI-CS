The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No ban, but no international cricket either, this year
                                                                                                                       7                                      No ban, but no international cricket either, this year
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday decided that no international match will be scheduled at the Kotla till the end of 2010. The governing body did not specifically use the word ban but the ruling implies just that.         
	The ICC said in a statement that following the conclusion of a full investigation into the circumstances leading to the abandonment of the ODI between India and Sri Lanka on December 27 last year, it is confirmed that no international cricket will be played at the ground until the end of December 2010.         
	The release further states: In addition, the ICC pitch consultant will inspect the ground as soon as possible and oversee a programme of remedial work throughout 2010 designed to ensure the pitch returns to the standard required to host international cricket, in particular, matches in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 as planned.         
	The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Delhi amp; Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) would surely have heaved a sigh of relief that the venue had escaped with nominal punishment.         
	As per the BCCIs rotation policy, Kotla is not in contention to host any international match this year. Also, the fact that Kotla will host the Delhi DareDevils home matches in the upcoming IPL-III will give the DDCA a chance to rebuild its image.         
	The decision was taken by the ICC general manager (cricket), David Richardson and chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle after considering all the evidence, including video footage of the match, and the Match Referees report and the submissions from the BCCI. The decision was relayed to the BCCI on Thursday.         
	Richardson said: We understand that turf pitches, by their very nature, are not and cannot be expected to always behave predictably and that an occasional delivery of unexpected steep bounce, while not ideal, especially for limited-overs cricket, is part of the game.         
	In this instance, however, we are of the view that the frequency of the misbehaving deliveries (on average just more than one every three overs)  and the excessive degree of variation  had the potential to inflict serious injury on the batsmen and that therefore the pitch that was prepared for the above match was dangerous and should therefore be classified as unfit.         
	In what was a smart move, the BCCI claimed that no inetrnational matchwere scheduled at Kotla this year.         
	But the fact is that the BCCI has a habit of organising a series at short notice and one cant recall an instance where it had been announced that a particular venue would not be hosting international cricket through the year.         
	DDCA secretary Chetan Chauhan was, understandably, a happy man.         
	I believe that ICC has understood our argument. Since we are not hosting any Test or ODI till December 2010, we dont consider it as a ban. It was a one-off incident.         
	Our new pitch committee under the supervision of Venkat Sunderam is working hard to prepare a good pitch for IPL-III.         
	I hope people will notice that Kotla can produce one of the best strips in the world, the former India opener said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Stiff test for United
                                                                                                                       7                                        Stiff test for United
            Champions League       Injury-hit English team take on in-form Valencia            Barcelonas David Villa and Andreas Iniesta during a training session, in Kazan, on Tuesday                     
	Valencia: Valencia are expecting a stiff Champions League test at home from Manchester United on Wednesday despite the English clubs injury problems, according to midfielder Juan Mata.         
	Wayne Rooney, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes are unavailable for the Group C clash at the Mestalla but Mata said the La Liga leaders were ready for a typically resilient performance from the Three-time European champions.         
	British teams are very physical and the pace of the games is much faster than in Spain, the World Cup-winning Spain international told a news conference on Tuesday.         
	In physical terms, well have to be at our peak, he added. But we also have to stick to our football philosophy and keep possession of the ball and hopefully that will be enough.         
	Valencia began their Champions League campaign with a comfortable win over Bursaspor, thrashing the Turkish champions 4-0 away as United were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Scottish side Rangers.         
	Mata has been in impressive form this season to help Unai Emerys side to the top of the domestic standings, while United have been inconsistent and twice had to come from behind to salvage a 2-2 draw with Bolton Wanderers on Sunday.         
	Mata said Giggs, a fellow left-footer, was one of his boyhood heroes and he was disappointed not to face the 36-year-old Welshman.         
	Ryan Giggs has been a player I have liked very much since I was little, he said.         
	He is a big loss because of his professionalism and experience but for sure whoever takes his place will do their best. Theyll be missing important players but I think they have a big enough squad to cope.         
	Valencia coach Unai Emery had words of praise for his United counterpart Alex Ferguson, saying the 68-year-old was an example for all coaches to follow.         
	I dont know him very well personally but I know his background, career and the trophies he has won, Emery said.         
	Lionel Messi has been included in the squad in Barcelonas trip to Rubin Kazan.         
	Messi scored twice in the 5-1 home victory over Panathinaikos in Barcas first Group D game two weeks ago when former teammate Zlatan Ibrahimovic also bagged a brace for new club AC Milan.         
	Ibrahimovic, cast aside by Guardiola after failing to come out of Messis shadow, netted a double in Milans nervous 2-0 win over Auxerre in their Group G opener at the San Siro and has since scored twice in Serie A to warm up nicely for Tuesdays second match at Ajax Amsterdam.         
	Ive scored four goals so far, all of them were important. I dont know which one was the most beautiful, we should ask the fans, the Swede told reporters before giving an ominous warning for Europes defenders.         
	Im still not fully fit, but Ill be at 100 percent soon. Like I said on my first day at Milan, I came here to win.         
	Another former Barcelona striker, Samuel Eto, is in excellent form for holders Inter Milan and was unlucky not to score again in Saturdays 1-0 defeat at AS Roma in Serie A.         
	A first Champions League home game as Inter boss awaits Rafael Benitez in Group A when Werder Bremen come to town hoping to exploit set pieces just like Twente Enschede did in their opening 2-2 draw with the treble winners.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bring Dravid back in ODIs: Akram
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bring Dravid back in ODIs: Akram
                      
	New Delhi: Senior batsman Rahul Dravid should be called back to Indias ODI team as he still has lot to offer to the country in the 50-over format, feels former Pakistan skipper Wasim Akram.         
	Dravid still has a lot to offer in ODIs. I believe that Dravid should be brought back into the (one-day) team. In the sub-continent, the current batsmen can do well, but on the overseas tours, India need a solid and experienced batsman like Dravid, Akram said.         
	Akram also was not happy with the current bowling line-up of the Indian team. When asked about his reported comments that some of the India players were softies and lazy, the former left-arm pacer said, I was not talking about the whole team. I was only talking about the bowlers.         
	Look at Munaf Patel, Sreesanth, Irfan Pathan and RP Singh. They all were very promising in the beginning. Look where they are now, Akram told a website. (PTI)

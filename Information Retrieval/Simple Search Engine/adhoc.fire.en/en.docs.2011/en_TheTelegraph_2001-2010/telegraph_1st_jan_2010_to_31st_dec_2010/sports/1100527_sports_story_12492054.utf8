            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: East Bengal thrashed Aikya Sammilani by 219 runs to enter the final of the CAB senior division league at the Eden on Wednesday.         
	In reply to East Bengals 444 for five, Aikya Sammilani were all-out for 225. Off-spinner Priyankar Mukherjee and left-arm spinner Shib Sagar Singh grabbed three wickets apiece.         
	In a quarter-final match at the JU (Salt Lake) ground, Town Club trounced BNR by 95 runs.         
	In reply to Towns 360 for nine, BNR could only manage 265. However, three Town players, wicket-keeper Gitimoy Basu, pacer Sami Ahmed and spinner Suvojeet Chakraborty complained of dehydration. Sami and Gitimoy were sent home long before the match was completed as they fell ill. Town will thus play their semi-final against Mohun Bagan on Friday.

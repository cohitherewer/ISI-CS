	Calcutta: Shoaib Malik said on Sunday that Pakistan had learnt from their mistakes during their recent tour of Australia and were hoping for a new beginning in the two T20 matches against England in Dubai.         
	The matches are on Friday and Saturday.         
	We didnt play well but its history now, said Malik, who will lead Pakistan in the T20s following Shahid Afridis ban for ball tampering, in a release.         
	Weve had meetings and talked about what we did in Australia Weve learnt from our mistakes.         
	Malik said that prior to travelling with the squad he appeared before a committee set up in Pakistan to examine why the side failed on its recent tour.         
	Ive answered all those questions, he said. I went to the six-member committee on Saturday and I gave them what I had to.         
	Whatevers happened is for the betterment of Pakistan cricket and Im sure it will help the Pakistan team and players Were looking forward to these two matches and I just want to concentrate on my cricket now, he added.         
	England captain Paul Collingwood, whose side also arrived in Dubai on Sunday, said that despite Pakistans unsuccessful tour of Australia , the world champions couldnt be underestimated.

	Abidjan: Former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has been appointed Ivory Coast coach for this years World Cup finals, the Ivory Coast Federation (FIF) said in a statement on its website on Sunday.         
	The FIF said it had considered a few candidates since Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic was sacked in February after failing to lead the team to the African Nations Cup semi-finals.         
	The executive committee analysed several profiles before choosing Sven-Goran Eriksson, FIF said.         
	His mission will be to guide our team during the World Cup and to make sure it fares honourably, which will be difficult in a competition featuring the worlds best 32 sides.         
	No details were given about the terms of Erikssons contract.         
	The Ivory Coast, one of four African World Cup qualifiers to change coaches in the last nine months, have been drawn in Group G at the tournament in South Africa along with Brazil, Portugal and North Korea.

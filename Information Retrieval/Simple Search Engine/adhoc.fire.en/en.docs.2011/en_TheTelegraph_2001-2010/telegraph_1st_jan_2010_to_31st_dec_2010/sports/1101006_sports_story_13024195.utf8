            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: The issue of ill-fitting kits continues to haunt members of the Indian contingent as the weightlifting squad was warned by the Organising Committee (OC) for not wearing the national colours on Tuesday.         
	According to sources, the secretary general of the Organising Committee (OC), Lalit Bhanot, asked one of the senior officials of the Indian weightlifting Federation to ensure that all lifters go to the competition wearing kits provided for the Commonwealth Games.         
	On Monday, at the Nehru Stadium weightlifting hall, only the members of the Indian team were found in different outfits as all the lifters refused to wear the ill-fitting clothes.         
	The OC wants the lifters to present themselves in national colours during the competition. But the kits are either oversized or too small. While the officials are putting pressure on us, the team management does not want to comply with the request, said a weightlifting federation official.         
	The coaches are also unhappy with the development. Wearing those kits, especially the small-sized ones, will definitely affect the performance, said one of the coaches. We cant do that with the lifters at this crucial stage. If someone wants to wear it on his or her own, I have nothing to say, he added.         
	The majority of the Indian contingent has been issued ill-fitting kits by the OC, which was supplied by a reputed company.

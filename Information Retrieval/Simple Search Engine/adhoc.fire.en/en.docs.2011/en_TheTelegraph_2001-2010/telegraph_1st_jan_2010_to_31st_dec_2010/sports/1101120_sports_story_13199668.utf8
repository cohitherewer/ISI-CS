	Galle: Opener Tharanga Paranavitana missed out on a century as the first Test between Sri Lanka and the West Indies was drawn on Friday after rain washed out the final session on the fifth day.         
	Paranavitana fell for 95 as the hosts reached tea on 241 for four, a lead of 39. No resumption of play was possible after the break.         
	Paranavitana and Mahela Jayawardene dug in with a third wicket stand of 87 on the final day to help secure a draw after Sri Lanka had followed on.           (REUTERS)

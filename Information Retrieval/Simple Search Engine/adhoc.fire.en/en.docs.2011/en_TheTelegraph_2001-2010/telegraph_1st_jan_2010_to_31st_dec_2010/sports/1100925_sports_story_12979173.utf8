	London: Liverpool needs a morale-boosting win over Sunderland at home, on Saturday, to relieve the pressure on manager Roy Hodgson, at the end of a depressing week for the 18-time Premier League champions.         
	After losing to rival Manchester United 3-2 at Old Trafford last weekend, Liverpool went down to an embarrassing League Cup third-round defeat, on Wednesday, to Northampton, a team struggling near the bottom of Englands fourth tier.         
	Hodgson, who only took over in July, apologised to the clubs fans for the mid-week performance but is refusing to panic even though the team is fifth from bottom in the league, with just five points from five games.         
	Wednesday was a really bad result for the club. It has knocked us backwards and has put us in a situation where we are heavily criticised  perhaps rightly so, Hodgson said.         
	Liverpool, which is still looking for new owners, has had a tough schedule so far in the league. The team has already played three of the top four  Arsenal, United and Manchester City  as well as a difficult away match at Birmingham.         
	The fixtures look much easier on paper over the next month, with home matches to come against Blackpool and Blackburn, and Hodgson knows his side will be under the microscope.         
	League leader Chelsea, which is clear at the top by four points from Arsenal and United, visits Manchester City looking to maintain its 100 per cent record.         
	England midfielder Frank Lampard is still missing for Chelsea as he recovers from hernia surgery, while Yossi Benayoun (calf) and Salomon Kalou (thigh) are also absent after sustaining injuries in the team 4-3 loss to Newcastle in the League Cup.         
	Elsewhere on Saturday, second-place Arsenal hosts West Brom at the Emirates Stadium without injured captain Cesc Fabregas (hamstring), bottom side West Ham is at home to Tottenham, Fulham hosts second-bottom Everton, Wigan travels to Birmingham and Blackburn visits Blackpool.

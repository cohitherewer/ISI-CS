    - Dravid, Raina shine with bat, Sachin falls for 98; vvs injury a concern           SUDIPTO GUPTA            Sachin Tendulkar with Suresh Raina, in Mohali, on Sunday                                 
	Mohali: What began like a documentary, ended like a pot-boiler. What was supposed to be a pre-sketched climax, punctured expectations to be a thunderous anti-climax. Yes, the subject of such references is the third day of the first India-Australia Test, at Mohali.         
	Just when the sane man had yawned and anticipated that the Indians, like true hosts, have mastered the home conditions on Sunday, the Australians pinched hard to remind all that sanity is not an absolute necessity in sports.         
	At stumps, on an eventful Sunday, India were bowled out for 405 and conceded a slender lead of 23 runs to the Australians. And yes, the day also left a promise for the remaining two days  a promise of a possible enthralling end to the battle.         
	Quite like the previous two days, the last session on Sunday altered equations. Zaheer Khans late burst on Friday and Virender Sehwags sizzlers on Saturday were followed by a bicycle stand-like collapse of India on Sunday.         
	And what drama! Sachin Tendulkars 49th Test hundred whizzed past him when he fell for 98. VVS Laxman, troubled with a back spasm, hit a new low as he came in to bat at No. 10, the lowest position in which he has ever batted in his career.         
	Mitchell Johnson, who was spraying aimless deliveries like an apprentice for most of the day, suddenly seemed to have hit the jackpot with the reverse swing, claiming five for 64. Mahendra Singh Dhoni (14) was adjudged (by the third umpire) caught by Shane Watson at slips when replays suggested that the benefit of doubt should have been the Indian captains. A delicious day of Test cricket.         
	Talking of Sachin, well, sorry, there arent enough words to explain the genius. His silken cover drives off Ben Hilfenhuas and Doug Bollinger or his patented paddle sweeps off Nathan Hauritz and Marcus North are a lesson in motion. One such beauty, out of a total of 13 on the day, earned him his 1802nd boundary, the most in Tests by any batsmen. He perished when he missed the line of a North delivery and was trapped in front.         
	Suresh Raina justified his selection ahead of Yuvraj Singh with a matured knock of 86, which comprised 14 hits to the fence. However, Raina got two reprieves: one a stumping miss by Paine off North and the other a dropped catch by Johnson off Hauritz.         
	Rahul Dravid rekindled his confidence, which was lacking in the last series against Sri Lanka, with a well-composed 77 before being induced by Bollinger to poke at one and was pouched by Paine.         
	But Johnsons reverse swing stung the Indians as from 354 for five they crashed to 405 all out.         
	The beginning of the day was bland though. While the Australian bowlers, on a deadpan Mohali track, were as lost as a polar bear in Sahara, the overnight Indian pair of Dravid and Ishant Sharma were busy fishing at balls outside the off stump as if there was an incentive for it.         
	However, Ishants 73-minute and 56-ball stay at the wicket, which produced 18 runs, shielded the Indian middle-order from the crucial opening hour of the day.         
	But, Ricky Ponting could have been a bit shrewder with his plans. When Raina was like a cat on a hot tin roof while tackling the short deliveries, instead of letting loose more firepower at the batsman, Ponting presented him with Shane Watsons flowery pace.         
	However, Laxmans injury status is a concern for Dhoni, whose men might have to counter a fifth day wicket with the bat. Team sources say he is not well and if that is the case, all is not well for India.

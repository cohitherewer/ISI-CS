	After dropping sets in each of the first two rounds, the second-seeded Federer advanced 6-2, 6-4, 6-2 in just over an hour and a half on Centre Court on Friday.         
	Federer made only 11 unforced errors and reeled off 29 winners to Clements 17.         
	Federer, who is aiming for his 17th Grand Slam title and seventh at the All England Club, will play 16th-seeded Austrian Jurgen Melzer on Monday for a berth in the quarter finals. The have never met.

However, the third-seeded pair, Leander Paes and Lukas Dlouhy were ousted in the second round. The Indo-Czech duo lost 3-6, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, 5-7 to Lukas Lacko of Serbia and Ukraines Sergiy Stakhovsky.         
	Mahesh Bhupathi and Max Mirnyi brushed aside the local challenge of Jamie Delgado and Joshua Goodall 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to advance to the third round.         
	One day after winning the longest tennis match in history, John Isner lost the shortest mens match at Wimbledon so far this year.         
	The marathon man looked weary from the outset, required treatment for a neck injury and was beaten by unseeded Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands 6-0, 6-3, 6-2.         
	The second-round match was over in just 1 hour, 14 minutes, and the five games won by Isner is the fewest by a male player this week.         
	Ive never been this exhausted before, Isner said.         
	Starting shortly after noon in warm sunshine, Isner received a standing ovation when he walked onto court. He immediately lost his serve  something that didnt happen once in his never-ending fifth set against Mahut.         
	In womens play, five-time champion Venus Williams moved into the fourth round by beating Russias Alisa Kleybanova 6-4, 6-2. Venus was down 3-1 in the first set before taking control with her power game as both players went for big shots from the baseline.         
	Venus took a tumble in the last game as she slipped on the grass, but appeared unscathed. The No. 2-seeded Venus next faces Australian Jarmila Groth, and could eventually meet top-ranked sister Serena in the final.         
	Justine Henin and Kim Clijsters  two Belgians making Wimbledon comebacks  won in straight sets to set up a fourth-round showdown Monday.         
	Clijsters, seeded eighth, beat No. 27 Maria Kirilenko 6-3, 6-3. Henin, seeded 17th, defeated No. 12 Nadia Petrova 6-1, 6-4. Clijsters and Henin will play each other for the 25th time, but the first time in a Grand Slam since 2006.

	That sets up an intriguing fourth-round battle against 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt.         
	The 15th-seeded seeded Australian, enjoying a resurgence after returning from hip surgery, advanced with a 6-3, 7-6 (9), 6-4 win over Frenchman Gael Monfils.

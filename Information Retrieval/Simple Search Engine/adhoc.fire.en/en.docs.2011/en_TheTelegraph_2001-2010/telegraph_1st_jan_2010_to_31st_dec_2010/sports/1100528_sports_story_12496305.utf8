The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lanka object to Howard nomination
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lanka object to Howard nomination
                      
	New Delhi: Former Australia Prime Minister John Howards dream of becoming the International Cricket Council (ICC) president in 2012 received another blow on Thursday with Sri Lanka objecting to his nomination for the vice-presidents post.         
	The Telegraph had reported that Cricket South Africa (CSA) and Zimbabwe Cricket Union (ZCU) had taken the lead in objecting to Howards nomination. The Board of Control for Cricket in India isnt at all unhappy with the ongoing impasse.         
	Howard, an Australia-New Zealand candidate under ICCs region-based nomination system, is in fact one negative vote away from losing his bid to become the vice-president.         
	SLCs interim committee chairman Somachandra de Silva said they would not support anyone without a cricketing background.         
	On principle it is the wrong thing to do to bring someone from outside for the vice-presidency, De Silva told a website.         
	We would support any of the directors from Australia and New Zealand who are representatives of the ICC, but not anyone from outside, he said.         
	At the last ICC meeting in Dubai about two months ago, it was mentioned that Howards name was being put forward for the vice-presidents post, and I was of the opinion that it was wrong. Anyone coming forward for ICC posts should be currently involved in cricket and not be a total outsider. In that respect we would not be supporting the candidature of Howard for the vice-presidency, De Silva said.         
	ICC vice-president Sharad Pawar will assume the presidents post next month when the incumbent David Morgan retires. Howard would succeed Pawar in 2012 if his nomination bid succeeds.         
	It is believed SLCs opposition to Howard stems from the former Prime Ministers chucker jibe at spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, who was so enraged that he skipped his sides 2004 tour of Australia.

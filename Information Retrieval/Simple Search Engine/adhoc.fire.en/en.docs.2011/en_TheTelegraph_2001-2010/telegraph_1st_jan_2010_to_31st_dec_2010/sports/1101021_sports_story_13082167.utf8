The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies must   be consistent   with bowling 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Aussies must   be consistent   with bowling 
                  Gavaskar                                 
	Melbourne: Legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar feels Australia need a good fast bowler and a leg spinner if Ricky Pontings men were to regain the Ashes later this year.         
	The former India captain said Australia have to bring about consistency in their bowling attack, when they take on England in the five-match Test series.         
	They have got to get the attack right. If Peter Siddle is fit, then he brings something to the team. I got the impression, in the two Tests we just saw, that Mitchell Johnson was just too inconsistent, but he got the wickets. They will need consistency in the team, Gavaskar said.         
	I think maybe a leg spinner in the team would make a difference to the team. I thought a leg spinner in the Australian team would have made a huge difference in Bangalore, Gavaskar was quoted as saying by Sydney Morning Herald.         
	Gavaskar was also delighted to be an honoree by the Bradman Foundation at the SCG along with Adam Gilchrist.         
	I grew up hearing about cricketing exploits of Sir Donald and to be honoured by Bradman Museum is huge, an emotional Gavaskar said.         
	Gilchrist said, Anyone in any cricketing nation can relate to the name Bradman. So, to be honoured by a foundation that is in his honour, is something I cherish very dearly.         
	Gilchrist also believes bowling will decide the Ashes and agreed with the observation of Gavaskar.         
	They have a much more settled group, but I agree with Sunny, I think it is going to come down to the bowling.         
	Whichever team keep their bowling unit on the field for the longest  fit, healthy and tearing in, will be the team that comes out on top. Our guys have a few injury concerns, but I think they are going to be right for the first Test. If we have our first-choice unit on the field, we will be very hard to beat, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chance for India to strike gold
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chance for India to strike gold
                  STICKWORK
     Gurbux Singh                      
	The 2010 Commonwealth Games is in the news for all the wrong reasons. There have been so many controversies surrounding the Games that Indias image on the world stage has taken a hit.         
	And for all the mess, Suresh Kalmadi should take the blame. Its ridiculous that this man is still at the helm. He should be put on trial and criminal procedure should be started against him. He was in the loop about all the misdeeds but kept mum. Obviously he did not want to put his men like Lalit Bhanot in trouble.         
	I will also like to mention that the Indian government should have come into the picture much earlier. They should have taken full control by June, at least. Had that happened, this mess could have been avoided.         
	Anyway, the controversies cannot take the sheen out the Games. After all, the athletes are practising hard to shine in the Games and why should the focus be not on them but on the mess?         
	Talking about Indias chances in hockey, one has to admit that we are in a very tough group with Pakistan, Malaysia, Scotland and favourites Australia. The Aussies are the clear favourites and Pakistan are traditionally a difficult proposition. Indias chances of the making it to the last four will depend much on how we perform against these two.         
	In the World Cup we did beat Pakistan but that was in March. Pakistan have regrouped well and India will find it difficult. However, India will have the home advantage to exploit.         
	What India would want is a winning start. In tournaments like this, a win in the first match gives the confidence and coach Jose Brasa will surely want to log full points. A semi-final berth is not impossible and if India can make the grade that will be a commendable show.         
	A peep into the history of Commonwealth Games shows that the Indian men have never been on the podium. The women won the gold in 2002, but the men have never been successful. This will be the best chance for the Rajpal Singhs to put the record straight.         
	Frankly speaking, I am not a big fan of Brasas style of functioning. Before every major tournament, Indian hockey plunges into unnecessary controversies. If a players strike for better pay stalled things before the World Cup, this time Brasa created a furore over alleged maltreatment by Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Hockey India (HI).         
	I have a feeling that this man gets nervous before a big tournaments and things go beyond his control. He always cribs and rakes up issues which can easily be sorted though dialogues.         
	Talking about the Indian team, I feel our defence is the weak-link. Sandeep Singh and Dhananjay Mahadik are good drag flickers but I am not confident about their defensive qualities. They often let in soft goals and so the half-line will have to perform really well. The pressure will be on the likes of Sardara Singh, Gurbaj Singh, Arjun Halappa and Prabodh Tirkey and how well can they gel with the defence and the attack will decide Indias fortune in the Commonwealth Games.         
	Lastly, I will like to dwell upon something which has nothing to do with Commonwealth Games. Last Saturday, I was one of the speakers at a function organised by Dhiren Deys friends and associates to remember the maidan legend on his birth centenary year. I owe a lot to Dhiren da and was really touched by this gesture.         
	Sadly, his club, Mohun Bagan, who should be indebted to him for his contribution towards the club, didnt do anything to remember the person.         
	 Also, the cricket and hockey fraternity could have done something to honour the person on his birth centenary year. Dhiren Dey is one of the pioneers of club administration and his contribution should be honoured and remembered by the sporting fraternity.

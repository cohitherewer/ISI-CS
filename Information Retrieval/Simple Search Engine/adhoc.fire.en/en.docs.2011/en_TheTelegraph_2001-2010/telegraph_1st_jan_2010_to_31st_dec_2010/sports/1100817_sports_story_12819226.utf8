	Dambulla: After a disastrous blow at the hand of New Zealand in their last match, the Indian team on Monday, registered a stunning victory beating the hosts by six-wickets. With this win, India secured a bonus point to leave each of the three sides with a victory at the end of the first round of matches.         
	Sri Lanka prevented Virender Sehwag (99 not out) from scoring a century but could not stop him from steering India to a comfortable win in their tri-series encounter.         
	India needed just five runs to chase down the 171-run target and Sehwag stood just one run short of his century when Lankan spinner Suraj Randiv came in to bowl the 35th over.         
	The off-spinner gave four byes in the first ball, which kept a little low, bowled two dot-balls, and then bowled a big no ball, which Sehwag smashed out of the ground.         
	Since it was a no ball, no runs were added to Sehwags score and he remained not out on 99. It looked like a deliberate no ball since Randivs back foot was where bowlers normally have their front foot while bowling.         
	Skipper Kumar Sangakkaras decision to bat backfired, as Indian bowlers were all over the hosts right from the first ball when Upul Tharanga was cleaned bowled by Praveen Kumar. Indias pacers and spinners rose to the occasion to bundle out Sri Lanka for a paltry 170. The heavy conditions were ideal for bowling and Indian pacers made the best of the situation.         
	Sehwag was the hero of the Indian chase as he batted through the innings in his terrific 99-run knock, which was a mix of control and aggression. Sehwags knock was a responsible one as it came in a tricky situation and under challenging circumstances.         
	Indias top-order had collapsed at the beginning and Suresh Raina (21) also threw his wicket after getting his eye in but Sehwag held the Indian innings together and in company of Mahendra Singh Dhoni (23) steered his side to win.         
	His 99 came off 100 balls with 11 fours and two sixes and Dhoni supported him well with his 38-ball knock which featured two fours. India lost Dinesh Karthik (10), Virat Kohli (0) and Rohit Sharma (0) in quick succession early in the innings.         
	For Sri Lanka, had Suraj Randiv (43) and Nuwan Kulasekara (22) not played defiant knocks down the order, the hosts innings would have been wearing a more miserable look. They put up a 39-run stand, highest of the Lankan innings, for the eighth wicket to help Sri Lanka go past the 150-mark.         
	Tillekaratane Dilshan (45) was the only top-order batsman who showed stomach for fight but fell while going for an extravagant shot when the situation demanded patience.         
	The pace trio of Kumar (2/20), Ishant Sharma (2/32) and Ashish Nehra (1/39) blew away the host top-order to start the devastation of the Lankan innings.         
	The spinners  Pragyan Ojha (3/36) and Ravindra Jadeja (2/34)  broke the back of the hosts with lethal blows.         
	Soon skipper Kumar Sangakkara (2) fell to Nehra and Mahela Jayawardene (4) became second victim of Kumar. Lanky Ishant Sharma got his first wicket in Thilan Samaraweera (7), which was the final touch to the complete dismantling of the Lankan innings.         
	They never recovered from the early shocks and Ojha and Jadeja kept the pressure by taking wickets.           (AGENCIES)

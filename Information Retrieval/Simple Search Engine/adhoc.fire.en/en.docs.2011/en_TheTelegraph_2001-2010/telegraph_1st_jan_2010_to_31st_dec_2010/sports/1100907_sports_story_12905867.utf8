  - Need to discuss with owners on retention issue       A STAFF REPORTER                                  
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) head coach Dav Whatmore is still not sure who are the four players that the Shah Rukh Khan co-owned franchisee will retain for the fourth edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	If one tries to read between the lines of Whatmores views, it is still not sure whether Sourav Ganguly, who has captained KKR in the first and third editions, will be retained or will be up for auction.         
	We can only plan after discussing with the owners. Its only yesterday (Sunday) that the new format has been announced. About the player retention, I will only have a clear idea once I speak to owners Shah Rukh Khan and Jay Mehta. Also, I need to discuss with the team director (Joy Bhattacharjya) and assistant coach (Vijay Dahiya), Whatmore said on Monday.         
	Strangely, he never mentioned Souravs name when he mentioned the above names. When asked about Sourav, he quickly pointed out: Well, obviously hes the captain but you never know whether he will be up for auction.         
	When further quizzed that whether Sourav will be among the four players who would be retained, he said: But we need to discuss who are the players who would be retained. Cant say that right now.         
	[On April 10, this year, in an interview to The Telegraph, Sourav had expressed his willingness to play for KKR in 2011 as well as 2012 (if he does well in 2011).]         
	He was all praise for rookie Pakistan pacer Mohammed Irfan (he toured Sri Lanka with the KKR development squad).         
	 The coach said: He is a fantastic athlete. At 7 ft 2 inches, he has an imposing figure He was really impressive during our Sri Lanka tour.

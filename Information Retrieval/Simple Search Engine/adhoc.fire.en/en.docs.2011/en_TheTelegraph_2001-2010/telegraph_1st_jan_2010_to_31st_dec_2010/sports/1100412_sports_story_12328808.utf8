The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | ICC rebuked me for raising fixing issue: Bacher
                                                                                                                       7                                        ICC rebuked me for raising fixing issue: Bacher
            A STAFF REPORTER            Ali Bacher                           
	Calcutta: Former captain and ex-managing director of the South Africa cricket board Ali Bacher said he was reprimanded at an International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting for raising the issue of match-fixing in the 1990s.         
	On the 10th anniversary of the revelations of match-fixing by the then South Africa captain Hansie Cronje, Bacher said there was casual talk about the issue in the 1990s, which was not seriously addressed by the ICC as no one could provide proof of it.         
	I brought it up during ICC meetings in 1996 and 1999, but the conversation did not last long nor was it recorded in the minutes. But I still remember Sir Clyde Walcott, who was president of the ICC in 1996, saying, where theres smoke theres fire, Bacher told the Sunday Independent in Johannesburg.         
	I also remember being reprimanded after a meeting for having brought it up at least more than once in the public domain, he added.         
	Bacher also admitted that there was a proliferation of one-day Internationals around the world  at times teams would play between 30 and 40 one-day matches a year and it wouldnt matter if they lost two or three away from home.         
	It would not make a difference, nor would the public or administrators question these sudden losses, he said.         
	The malpractice then moved on to spread betting  where the likes of Shane Warne and Mark Waugh were implicated.         
	Bacher said players were naive at that time and got easily lured by money.         
	Players were young at the time and very naive, but the important thing was that they were not getting paid a lot of money for their services, he said.         
	Hence match fixing and involvement with bookies was prevalent at the time, but in a different format, as spread-betting required one to forecast elements in the game such as who would bowl the first ball or who would hit the first six in a game, he added.         
	Bacher admitted that he had initially believed Cronje to be innocent.         
	I was shattered. I asked Hansie if the allegations were true and he denied it. It made me wonder why the Indian police would make such an accusation. Initially, I backed him to the hilt and if later I was proven wrong, so be it, Bacher said.         
	Bacher felt Cronje, who died in a plane crash in 2000, was trying to find a way out of his involvement with bookies by signing up with English county side Glamorgan without consulting South Africas cricket board.         
	We took up the issue with Glamorgan and got him out of the contract, but the questions remain unanswered; why did he do this? Was it because the bookies were blackmailing him? he said.

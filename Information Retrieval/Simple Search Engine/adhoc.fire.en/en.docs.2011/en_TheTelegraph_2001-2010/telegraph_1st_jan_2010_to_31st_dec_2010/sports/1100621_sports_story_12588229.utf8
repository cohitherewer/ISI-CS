The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The Cup is boiling, but not for Africa
                                                                                                                       7                                      The Cup is boiling, but not for Africa
            ROB HUGHES                      
	Pretoria: Maybe a wheel is turning. After so many dull matches, so much denial of the sport soccer can be, the real thing has begun to surface.         
	The United States versus Slovenia was, despite its controversial ending, a superb game of attack and counterattack. Cameroon and Denmark here  on a cold, crisp Saturday night  was even better. The stimuli were fear and pride. The loser was going home, while the victor stood every chance of going to the second round.         
	Cameroon struck first with a clever goal from Samuel Eto. Denmark waited, regrouped and came back with two of the finest goals we have seen, or most likely will see, in the 2010 World Cup, to win, 2-1.         
	Even the sound is changing. We will have to put up with vuvuzelas, but on this night they were accompanied by the pleasing rhythm of drums, beating like a pulse and surely encouraging players to perform more than the uncoordinated din that has served as the background noise to these games.         
	The games flow was marked by a sense of rhythm and the stirring athletic appeal of two sets of players, each true to its own style. In the crowd, a hastily handwritten sign conveyed another subplot of this compelling tournament. We Are Africa United Now, the sign read  meaning that South Africans, aware that their own team is likely to become a non-playing host, are ready to get behind any other team from their continent.         
	But the situation is difficult for the African teams. Cameroon and Nigeria have both lost their first two games, and South Africa has only a single point. Algerias skills were appreciably finer than Englands in their match the night before, but it lacked the belief to go on and win.         
	Ghana still has a fighting chance to move on to the elimination rounds, but Ivory Coast  on paper the team that affords Africa its greatest hope  has a daunting challenge in Johannesburg on Sunday, against Brazil.         
	There is a possibility that all the African teams could be wiped out in the first round. That would cause the event to lose some of its allure. But in an Afrikaner rugby stronghold, which Loftus Versfeld Stadium has been for a century, there was at least one night of soccer fever.         
	Cameroon started in a way it has not since its momentous final match in 1990, when Roger Milla scored and danced his way through a marvelous quarter final against England.         
	Then, as now, Cameroon managed to lose a contest it deserved to win. Then, as now, there was a special centre forward in the Cameroon green and red.         
	Milla has been disrespectful towards Eto at this tournament, but Eto, not only captain but a remarkable player and competitor, did everything humanly possible to lead his team. He played central striker and playmaker rolled into one.         
	Eto is so rich after his years at Barcelona and Inter Milan that he personally gave each member of Cameroons squad a watch worth about $35,000 to commemorate their getting here. He opened the scoring in the 10th minute after Achille Webo pounced on a misplaced pass from Christian Poulsen.         
	Once Webo found Eto in the penalty box, Eto displayed an instant of masterly control. And then he simply struck the ball, with unforgiving accuracy, into the net. It was his 46th goal for his country in 98 international appearances.         
	Now the drums became intoxicating. Now, it seemed, an African team would win.         
	The Danes had other ideas. Gradually, they overcame their poor start. Gradually, their spirit prevailed.         
	The scoring was done; the match was anything but. Again and again, Cameroon bore down on the Danes. Cameroon tried shot after shot, some of them wild. Six of those attempts were met by the inspired Danish goalie, Thomas Sorensen. The best of his acrobatic saves was a one-handed stop, near his right ankle, from a goal-bound volley from Achille Emana.         
	The Cameroon players fired at that goal 23 times, but they couldnt breach it. The Cameroonians apologised for letting Africa down, and pledged to play their final game  against the already qualified Netherlands  with a flourish of pride.         
	But for them, the tournament is over. For Africans, their teams going out one by one, the test is coming. Will they support the World Cup if they have no countries left in the tournament?

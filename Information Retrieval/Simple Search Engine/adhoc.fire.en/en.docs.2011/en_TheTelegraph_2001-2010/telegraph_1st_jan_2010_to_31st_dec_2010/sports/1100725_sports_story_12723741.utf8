                                                                                                                       7                                      Ranadeb skips function
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Bengal fast bowler Ranadeb Bose, on Saturday, decided to skip the annual awards function of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) leaving the senior officials red-faced. Ranadeb was named the Best Fast Bowler of the Year.         
	Although CAB joint secretary Biswarup Dey, who was anchoring the function, announced that the senior pacer was physically indisposed, Ranadeb categorically denied that he was ill. Incidentally, former India captain Sourav Ganguly also skipped the event.         
	Bengal captain Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who is out of station for personal reasons, and batsman Manoj Tiwary also gave the event a miss.         
	I am perfectly alright. Presently, I am out of station, holidaying with friends, Ranadeb said. When asked why he decided to skip the awards functions, he replied: I leave it up to you draw any conclusion you like.         
	Although he didnt go on record, Ranadeb has expressed disappointment in his close circle for being ignored for the Best Cricketer of the Year award, which went to Ashok Dinda.         
	Not many in the Bengal team are happy in the manner Dinda, who has got only eight wickets, was given the award when Ranadeb has got 30 wickets this season.

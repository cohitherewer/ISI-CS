The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Big alarm on slight knock
                                                                                                                       7                                        Big alarm on slight knock
  - Messi niggle gives Maradona a fright       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Lionel Messi                                 
	Argentina superstar Lionel Messi handed coach Diego Maradona a World Cup scare on Friday when he injured his right knee in a training match. Barcelona star Messi immediately left the practice session, but the seriousness of the injury was played down by officials. Messi is fine. It was only a knock and nothing else, said team official Nicolas Otamendi.         
	We all got a fright, said Maradona with a grin later in the day.         
	I didnt see it, my back was turned. He and Masche (Javier Mascherano) clashed knees and then I saw that Messi had stopped. But its nothing, he put ice on it and if he wants to play on Monday (against Canada) hell be on the pitch.         
	Team doctor Donato Villani said on the Argentine Football Association website: It was just a scrape.         
	Messi, Argentinas biggest hope after a brilliant season at Barcelona including top scoring in Spains La Liga with 34 goals, got up and walked from the training pitch after the accident.         
	Juan Sebastian Veron (Estudiantes) and Sergio Agero (Atletico Madrid) both joined up with the squad on Friday. But Walter Samuel and Diego Milito (Inter Milan) and Martin Demichelis (Bayern Munich) were missing as they were taking part in the Champions League final in Madrid on Saturday.         
	Newcastle defender Fabricio Coloccini and Napoli striker Ezequiel Lavezzi missed out on places in Maradonas final 23-man squad this week.         
	Liverpool right winger Maxi Rodriguez, like Coloccini a veteran of the 2006 finals in Germany, was retained as cover for Newcastles Jonas Gutierrez.         
	Argentina, who face Nigeria, South Korea and Greece in Group B, began their countdown on Thursday and are preparing for a warm-up on Monday against Canada. The teams farewell match at the River Plate stadium will double as part of the countrys bicentennial independence celebrations.         
	But the biggest worry for Messi, even more than the wear and tear of a long season, is the mental pressure that comes with being the worlds best striker. But Messi has vowed to prove he does not crack under the weight of Argentinas expectations.         
	The 22-year-old Barcelona playmaker has often been criticised for not reproducing his stellar club form at international level, but Messi said that was not the case.         
	I am going to try and do what I do at Barcelona, Messi recently said, in Buenos Aires. I am full of hope and real desire to do well (in South Africa where the tournament runs from June 11 to July 11).         
	I am used to the pressure. I play for Barcelona who are one of the most important teams in the world and where it is obligatory to always win.         
	Messi said he thought that Argentina could surprise many and lift the World Cup for the third time in their history.

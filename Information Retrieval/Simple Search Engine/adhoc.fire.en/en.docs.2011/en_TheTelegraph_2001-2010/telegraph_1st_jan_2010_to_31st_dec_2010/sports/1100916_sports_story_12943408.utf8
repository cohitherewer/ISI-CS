The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag edge past Port
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chirag edge past Port
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: After a 2-2 draw on Sunday against Mohun Bagan, Chirag United returned to winning ways when they defeated Calcutta Port Trust 1-0 in a Calcutta Football League Premier Division match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Wednesday.         
	Joshimar stepped up to deliver the goods in the 71st minute, after the Subrata Bhattacharya-coached team bungled many an opportunity. The first half saw Chirag creating a few chances but the likes of Junior Elijah, Denson Devadas and Joshimar failed to convert those. Juniors long ranger and Densons header went straight to Port Trusts Sukdeb Ghoshs hands, while Joshimar failed to finish off a simple chance.         
	In the beginning of the second half, Joshimar was tripped by Port Trusts Agu in the box but the referee, Dhanapati Roy, refused to grant a penalty to Chirag and play resumed. Though the second half almost replicated the first, the saving grace came in the 71st minute. Joshimar volleyed Densons cross from the right into the far post to register the match winner.         
	With this win, Chirag now have 10 points from five ties. The only chance for Port Trust came in the 64th minute but Rajib Ekka failed to capitalise with only Chirag goalkeeper Somnath Khara at his mercy. We were denied a penalty because Shabbir Ali, the Port Trust coach, was pressurising the referee. Joshimar was clearly tripped inside the box. And the referee turned a blind eye! Anyway, we are not giving much importance to the CFL. Our main goal is the Federation Cup, Bhattacharya said. Ali denied any wrongdoing and said he felt insulted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Katich avoids surgery
                                                                                                                       7                                      Katich avoids surgery
                      
	London: Opening batsman Simon Katich, who fractured his thumb during Australias recent tour of India, has decided against immediate surgery to make himself available for next months Ashes duty.         
	Scans have revealed a fracture and ligament damage, but the batsman is hoping to be fit before the first Ashes Test in Brisbane from November 25. The specialist said there was no point having surgery because Id be out for some time. So we just have to see how it settles down, Katich told an Australian daily.         
	It (the injury) definitely hindered me during the first Test in Mohali. I felt like I was batting one-handed. It felt better in the second Test but the big problem was that it affected my preparation. I had to stop hitting balls, he added.         
	Katich has enjoyed a rich form since his return as an opener two and a half years ago as he has scored 2,831 runs in 31 Tests at an average of 52.48.         
	Meanwhile, Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson said he wants to make up for his poor performance in the last Ashes and is eyeing to en cash on home advantage this time around.         
	Over there, I definitely built it up in my mind. It was a huge deal for me, like any young guy coming through. But look, I think Ive learned that lesson now. Ive experienced that and now Ive adjusted to the pressures of, I guess, being a leader of the attack as well. So Im looking forward to this series, its something Im very excited about, Johnson was quoted as saying by an English daily.         
	He also made it clear that the only thing the Australians are thinking about is winning.         
	We want to win, thats for sure. We want to win the series and were in our backyard now, Johnson added.           (PTI)

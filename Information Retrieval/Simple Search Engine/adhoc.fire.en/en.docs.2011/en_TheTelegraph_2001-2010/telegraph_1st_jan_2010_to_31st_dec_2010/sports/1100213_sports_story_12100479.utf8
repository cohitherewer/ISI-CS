The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Manoj antics mar victory
                                                                                                                       7                                        Manoj antics mar victory
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sreevats Goswami scored an unbeaten 109                           
	Calcutta: Bengals seven-wicket victory against Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy (East Zone leg) on Friday was soured as premier batsman Manoj Tiwary was handed a one-match ban for showing dissent at umpire Subrata Das.         
	Tiwary was admittedly unhappy after Das adjudged him leg before off medium-pacer Yaju Vendra Krishanatrys bowling.         
	Tiwary, after showing dissent on the field, smashed a windowpane of the team dressing room at the Barabati Stadium. Match Referee Sanjay Raul booked Tiwary for Level 2.1 offence and was banned for a match and docked full match fees.         
	I am frustrated as this is not the first time I have got a bad decision. These are national level matches and Im frequently suffering due to umpiring errors, which have taken a toll on me. I am a human being and I couldnt take it any more, Tiwary told The Telegraph from Cuttack.         
	But the Bengal team management vehemently denied the allegation that Tiwary had smashed a windowpane. It is a false allegation, said skipper Laxmi Ratan Shukla.         
	However, it has been learnt that the Orissa Cricket Association is filing an official complaint with the Cricket Association Bengal.         
	Bengal did pretty well in the match bundling out Jharkhand for 196 in 49.1 overs. Young Sreevats Goswami struck his maiden hundred at the senior level scoring an unbeaten 109 off 118 deliveries with 16 boundaries and a six.         
	Bengal, at one stage, were in trouble as they were reduced to 64 for three. But Goswami, along with Wriddhiman Saha (51 not out), added 133 runs for the undefeated fourth wicket stand to ensure victory.]         
	Goswami was very happy after guiding his team to victory.         
	We really did well as a unit today. We got it wrong against Tripura and it was time that we made amends. This is one of my best knocks at the senior level.         
	I should have got a big score in the last match also, but got run-out after getting set. Today, I didnt want to throw it away. I got tremendous support from my senior partner Wriddhiman Saha, Goswami said.         
	Skipper Shukla is, however, worried that they wont get Manoj in the next match against Assam on Sunday.         
	Not having Manoj will always be a factor in a crunch game, Shukla said.

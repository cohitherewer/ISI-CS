The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Federer wins to equal Petes 64
                                                                                                                       7                                        Federer wins to equal Petes 64
                  Roger Federer after winning his 64th ATP title, in Stockholm, on Sunday                     
	Stockholm: Roger Federer beat Germanys Florian Mayer 6-4, 6-3 to win the Stockholm Open on Sunday, and match Pete Sampras total of 64 career titles.         
	Its amazing that Im there where Petes ended his career on, Federer said. You never know when its your last one, thats why you want to savour every tournament victory.         
	Federer didnt have it all his own way in claiming his third title of the year at the Royal Tennis Hall against the 47th-ranked Mayer. The unorthodox German broke Federer in the seventh game, before Federer started spraying some trademark winners to come back and take the set.         
	Federer showed glimpses of his best form in the second set, mixing power and finesse to outclass Mayer and win the match in 63 minutes.         
	Federer broke with the score at 3-2 in the second with a drop shot and played a sliced backhand that Mayer could only watch as he took the score to 5-2.         
	Since 1968, only Jimmy Connors (109), Ivan Lendl (94) and John McEnroe (77) have won more singles tournaments than Federer and Sampras.         
	Early on, I think that feeling of wanting to prove yourself to the world and all the doubters is a very strong one, so youre very aggressive in your ways of winning and not enjoying them, Federer said. Today, its much more of the enjoyment part because I dont need to prove myself to anyone anymore, except to myself.

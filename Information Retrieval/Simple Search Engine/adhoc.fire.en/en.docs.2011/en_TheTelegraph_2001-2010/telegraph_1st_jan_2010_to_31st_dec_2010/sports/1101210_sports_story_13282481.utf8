The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Makvanas century propels Saurashtra
                                                                                                                       7                                        Makvanas century propels Saurashtra
            A STAFF REPORTER            Lahiri picked up three wickets                           
	Calcutta: Bengal bowlers failed to repeat their good work which helped them scalp six Saurashtra wickets cheaply on Wednesday as the hosts fought back valiantly on Thursday to log 423 runs in their first innings in the Ranji Trophy Group A match, in Rajkot.         
	Kamlesh Makvana notched up his maiden first-class century and shared 128 runs for the seventh wicket with Rahul Dave (72) to propel Saurashtra to a first innings total.         
	In fact, it was Makvana and Dave who had arrested the Saurashtra slide on the first day after they were struggling at 169 for six. Resuming at an overnight team score of 254 for six, the duo continued their defiance adding 43 useful runs to the board. In the process, they also successfully negated the new ball advantage that the Bengal speedsters were looking to exploit.         
	However, individually Dave could add only six runs to his overnight score before edging one off Saurasish Lahiri to keeper Sreevats Goswami.Coming in to bat at the No. 8 position, Makvana scored a patient 108 off 290 balls before retiring hurt.         
	Makvana not only stitched a crucial partnership with Dave, but also combined well with the tailenders to take Saurashtra past the 400-run mark.         
	Saurya Sanandiya, who came in at Daves fall, did a splendid job with the bat. He dominated in a 56-run partnership with Makvana before Saurasish got the better of him. Sanandiya scored 35 invaluable runs for his team.         
	But what hurt Bengal most was perhaps the ninth wicket partnership between Makvana and Jayesh Odedra. With the Saurashtra score at 353 for eight, the visitors had probably hoped that finally they would be putting an end to the hosts resistance.         
	But Makvana and Odedra put up a dogged fight adding 70 runs. For Bengal, Ashok Dinda (3/105) and Saurasish Lahiri (3/64) scalped three wickets apiece while Sourav Sarkar accounted for two rival batsmen.         
	At stumps, on the second day, Bengal were 33 for the loss of one wicket. Opener Arindam Das (4) was the lone Bengal batsman to fall, bowled by Odedra. At the crease were Sreevats, batting on 19, and giving him company was Dibyendu Chakrabarty on 6.

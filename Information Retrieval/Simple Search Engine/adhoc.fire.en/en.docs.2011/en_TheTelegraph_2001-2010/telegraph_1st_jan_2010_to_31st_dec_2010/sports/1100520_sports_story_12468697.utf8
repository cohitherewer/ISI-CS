The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bhajji in the clear; Vijay in the dock
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bhajji in the clear; Vijay in the dock
            A STAFF REPORTER                            Harbhajan Singh      
	Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh has denied his involvement in the pub incident in Gros Islet and said he has not been showcaused by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).         
	In a text message to The Telegraph on Wednesday, Harbhajan said: Am not part of those players who got the show cause. My name is not there. I was not in the pub. I was in my room.         
	While the BCCI refused to come out in the open with the names of the players showcaused, the non-disclosure only added to the confusion.         
	If the BCCI didnt want to name the players, then why go public with the showcause announcement a day before issuing the notices! None of the BCCI bosses came up with a suitable answer when queried on Wednesday.         
	This is an internal issue of the board, was the common refrain.         
	For a board that talks of transparency, the decision not to release the names of the players is amazing, to say the least.         
	The BCCI had issued showcause notices to seven players on Tuesday for the incident at Tequila Joe in Gros Islet, the day India were knocked out of the World Twenty20.         
	According to sources, Ashish Nehra, Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan, Piyush Chawla, Rohit Sharma, Murali Vijay and Ravindra Jadeja have been asked to show cause.         
	The players have been given seven days to reply.         
	The Board decided to showcause the players after the Indian team manager for the tournament, Ranjib Biswal, submitted his report. Biswal didnt take any individuals name in his report and only mentioned players.         
	It was learnt, he mentioned in his report that the players had breached the curfew that was set for 9.30 pm. During the incident, the players retaliated verbally after being abused, the report said.         
	Biswal did not mention any pub incident for Team Indias disgraceful exit, but blamed purely cricketing reasons for the ouster.         
	This is the first instance of the BCCI pulling up so many players in public. Shashank Manohar, the president, has always had the reputation of being a strict administrator, and on this occasion, he possibly felt the board was left with little option but to give a warning to the players considering the World Cup is only nine months away.         
	But by not naming the players, the BCCI has left all in a quandary.

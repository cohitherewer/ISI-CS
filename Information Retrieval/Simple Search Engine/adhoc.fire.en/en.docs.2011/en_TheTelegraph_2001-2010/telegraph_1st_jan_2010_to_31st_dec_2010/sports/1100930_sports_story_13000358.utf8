The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ill-fitted kits for 4 Indian squads
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ill-fitted kits for 4 Indian squads
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: It was a welcome change on Wednesday as the worst critics of the Commonwealth Games showered praise on the facilities and security arrangements. However, members of the Indian contingent had little to cheer about.         
	Among the 4,500 odd athletes in the Village so far, Indians are the only ones not to wear the official kits. This is because they are yet to be distributed by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA). On Tuesday, a section of Indian athletes received the kits, only to find most of them ill fitting.         
	According to sources in the Indian camp, members of at least four teams  netball, gymnastics, weightlifting and boxing  received their official kits but couldnt wear them because of discrepancy in the sizes.         
	The sizes of most of the kits are not accurate, said a member of the weightlifting team. Since we cannot wear them, we have decided to return them. We have been told to go back to the IOA in the next couple of days so that we can get properly tailored dresses.         
	Prepared by a well-known kit-making company, the official kits consist of one tracksuit, two shorts, four T-shirts, a cap, a pair of socks and a bag. Some athletes felt the quality of the kits distributed left a lot to be desired.         
	An IOA official, when contacted, was surprised that most of the tracksuits and T-shirts did not fit the athletes. The orders were placed at least two months ago. I am not sure why the kits were not found to be satisfactory, he said.         
	However, the poorly made kits were not the only problem that the athletes faced on Wednesday. The boxing squads of several countries, including India, who went for their practice sessions at the training venues in Delhi University, had to wait for a long time before they could manage to get an empty ring to start practising.         
	Lack of boxing rings at the training venue was the main problem, said a source. There should have been 10 practice rings to be supplied by a company from Europe. Since the consignment did not reach Delhi in time, two rings from the Nehru stadium were shifted to the training venue. And when at least eight teams landed up for training, all of them had to wait for their turns, confirmed the official.         
	An Organising Committee (OC) official, however, said the rings have already arrived and should be in place in the next couple of days.         
	More Indian squads will check into the Village from Wednesday night. While athletics team will travel from Patiala, they will be followed by the wrestling squad from Sonepat. The badminton team is also expected to arrive on Thursday.         
	The womens wrestling team will not come before Friday as they are currently engaged in a practice series with the visiting Japanese side.

	Ranaghat: Former India cricket captain Mohammed Azharuddin, on Tuesday, said the spot-fixing allegations concerning Pakistani cricketers should be investigated properly by the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	It is a sensitive issue and matter of investigation by the ICC, Azharuddin told reporters here.         
	The International Cricket Council is investigating the matter and the guilty, if found, should be punished, he added.         
	Azhar was at Ranaghat to attend a Congress party meeting.         
	World cricket was rocked by the spot-fixing scam last Sunday after News of the World posted a sting operation video showing an alleged fixer Mazhar Majeed making bowlers Mohammed Aamer and Mohammed Asif bowl deliberate no balls during the fourth Test against England at Lords.         
	The bookie also claimed to have links with Indian bookmakers.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A shot in the arm for unity
                                                                                                                       7                                      A shot in the arm for unity
                      
	Madrid: Spains football team returned home to a jubilant nation and a huge fiesta on Monday, after winning the World Cup, finally giving the Spaniards a break from months of economic gloom, political squabbling and nationalist regions fighting for greater autonomy from the central government.         
	The team was received by King Juan Carlos.         
	There were striking examples of cheering for Spain from unlikely places: The well-off Catalonia region that has long sought greater autonomy and the separatist Basque region where anything pro-Spain is often shunned. At least several hundred thousand fans lined up on Madrids streets to celebrate Spains first World Cup title, after the team beat the Netherlands 1-0 on Sunday in extra time.         
	Dozens of airport workers cheered from the runway as the plane, flying Spanish flags from cockpit windows, taxied to a stop as cars driving by on nearby highways blared their horns to welcome the squad. A special slogan printed along the fuselage of the Iberia plane read, Proud of our National Team. Champions.         
	A roar of delight rose from the airport as team captain and goalkeeper Iker Casillas stepped from the plane and raised the golden World Cup into the air. The crowd chanted Campeones! Campeones! (Champions! Champions! in English). Then the players, wearing their team jerseys, walked from the plane to a waiting Spanish football federation bus without commenting to journalists.         
	Its very important, it helps us forget a lot of things, like the economic crisis, for example, or peoples domestic issues, said Javier Sanchez, a 42-year-old photographer from Madrid.         
	But will the ecstasy last? Could this be Spains moment to unite under a single flag, or is it a fleeting instance of patriotism?         
	The country has been depressed by a debt crisis, 20 percent unemployment and nationalist regions fighting to separate from Spain or at least win the right for much greater autonomy and near-nation status.         
	While the spotlight will be on Madrid when the team is cheered, the win led to a rare sight in Catalonias regional capital of Barcelona: Spanish flags waving side-by-side with Catalonias very own red and yellow flag.         
	About 75,000 people celebrated the win in Barcelona, and about 2,000 people waved Spanish flags and wore the teams football jersey in the Basque city of Bilbao  actions rarely seen because of the violent campaign led by separatist group ETA since 1968 to gain independence from Spain.

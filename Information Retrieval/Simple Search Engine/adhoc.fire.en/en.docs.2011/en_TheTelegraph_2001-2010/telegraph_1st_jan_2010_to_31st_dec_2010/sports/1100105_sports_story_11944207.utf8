The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dilshan does it again

	Mirpur: The runs kept flowing from Tillekaratne Dilshans bat as the dashing opener struck a composed 104 to steer Sri Lanka to a comprehensive seven-wicket win over Bangladesh in the opening match of the tri-series Monday.         
	Chasing 261 to win, the Lankans cruised to the target with 5.1 overs to spare as their top-order batted well to give them a winning start.         
	Dilshans knock, his sixth ODI century, came off 122 balls and included 12 boundaries as he almost batted through the innings.         
	He fell with Lanka needing 19 to win. It was Dilshans third hundred in the last six innings.         
	Dilshans 148-run second-wicket partnership with skipper Kumar Sangakkara (74) laid the foundation for the win as the duo took the match away with their solid batting.         
	Earlier, Mohammed Ashraful struck a responsible 75 and shared vital partnerships with Mushfiqur Rahim (35) and Mahmudullah (45) to help Bangladesh reach a competitive 260 for seven after being put to bat.         
	Chasing, Lanka were off to a breezy start, rattling up 35 runs in the first four overs but Upul Tharanga (14) could not last long and was caught behind off Rubel Hossain.         
	From there on Sangakkara, who almost scored a run-a-ball 74, and Dilshan called the shots.         
	Shafiul Islam broke the partnership by getting Sangakkara caught behind, but it was too late by then.         
	Dilshan, wanting to finish off things quickly, went for a pull off spinner Mahamudullah, but did not get the elevation he was looking for and ended up in the hands of Naeem Islam at mid-wicket.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Arsenal to clash with Barcelona
                  Results of the draw for round 16 of the Champions League at the Uefa headquarters, in Nyon, on Friday                     
	Nyon: European champions Inter Milan will play Bayern Munich in a repeat of last seasons final following the draw for the first knockout round of the Champions League, on Friday.         
	Inter beat Bayern 2-0 in Madrid with two goals from Diego Milito to clinch their first European crown for 45 years but struggled in this seasons group stage, qualifying for the last 16 as a runner-up. Bayern topped their group with five wins out of six.         
	The other stand-out tie paired this seasons favourites Barcelona with Arsenal  the team they beat 6-3 on aggregate in last seasons quarter finals.         
	Barcelona, who also beat Arsenal in the 2006 final, drew 2-2 in London last season before Lionel Messi demolished the Premier Leaguer side, scoring all four goals in Barcas 4-1 second leg win at the Nou Camp.         
	Real Madrid face Olympique Lyon again after losing to the French side at the same stage last season.         
	Tottenham Hotspur will return to the San Siro to face AC Milan, after finishing ahead of Inter in the group phase.         
	In the other ties, AS Roma will play Shakhtar Donetsk of Ukraine, Valencia will play Schalke 04, Olympique Marseille face Manchester United and FC Copenhagen meet Chelsea.         
	First legs will be played on February 15 and 16 and February 22 and 23 with the return legs on March 8 and 9 and March 15 and 16. The final will be at Wembley Stadium on May 28.         
	Real Madrid are now coached by Jose Mourinho, the man who led Inter to the title last season, and they will relish a chance to atone for their mistakes of last term.         
	Last season Lyon won 1-0 in France before going through with a 1-1 draw in Madrid.         
	We still have last years elimination fresh in the memory, said Real sporting director Miguel Pardeza.         
	Its curious to have them two years in succession. It should help us to learn and to make sure we dont make the same mistakes this time.         
	Tottenham came from 4-0 down with a Gareth Bale hattrick before losing 4-3 at the San Siro in October. Darren Eales, Tottenhams director of football administration, said the club would take heart from that comeback when they meet the seven-times winners AC Milan.

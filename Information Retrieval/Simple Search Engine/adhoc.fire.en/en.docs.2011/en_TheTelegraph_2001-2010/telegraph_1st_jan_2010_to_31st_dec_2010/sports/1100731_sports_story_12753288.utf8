	Calcutta: Even the strong anti-biotics could not repress Jhulan Goswamis excitement.         
	Down with dehydration, Jhulan is right now recuperating at a city hospital. Yet the captain of Indian womens cricket team is answering to every call ever since her name was announced for the Arjuna award.         
	I rank this award way above the ICC Best Womens Cricketer Award (which she received in 2007). This is an award given by my country and its every sportspersons dream to get this, she said.         
	I am very happy. Its yet to sink in. But this will have its pride of place in my cabinet, the 26-year-old player added.         
	Jhulan said she never expected to win the award this soon. I never expected to have this award this soon. Its a surprise you can say, she said.

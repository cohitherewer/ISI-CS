The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | EB carry forth burden of hope

  - Fed Cup Disjointed Bagan have a battle on hand; Chirag can spring a surprise       A STAFF REPORTER            Mohun Bagan players during a practice session, at their club ground, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                 
	Calcutta: If winter comes can spring be far behind?  if you are wondering what PB Shelley has got to do with football, well, to be honest, nothing. But the state of Calcutta football is such that one is tempted to take this liberty and, to be honest again, that perhaps is the only way to be optimistic about the games prospect in the city.         
	With the citys prominent three  East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Chirag United  getting into their battle gear to prove their worth in the Federation Cup, there can be only one inference  the only way they can move is forward.         
	In recent years, the baton of dominance in Indian football has moved on to the Goan hands. The Churchill Brothers and the Dempos have outshone the Calcutta clubs. The last city club to win the all-important I-League was East Bengal, way back in 2003-04.         
	However, the Federation Cup narrates a different tale. In the last 10 years, the trophy has come to Calcutta on five occasions. And going by the start-of-the-season form, defending champions East Bengal may once again lift the coveted trophy.         
	Compared to Bagan and Chirag, East Bengal, under the guidance of their British coach Trevor Morgan, have looked sharp  perfect, in fact, by the Indian standards.         
	Check this  19 goals scored in five CFL matches, conceding just one. True, competition in CFL is not as tough as in a national level meet. But an average of five goals per match, at any level, is something to be proud of. A statistical analysis of Bagan and Chirag in the CFL confirms that. Clubbed with Air India, Pune FC and HAL, Bangalore, the red and gold brigade shouldnt face any problem in making it to the semis.         
	Coach Morgan, a shrewd tactician, has his head in place. I am not aware of the other teams Havent seen them. Im banking on the players for some information about them. We havent been tested for the entire 90 minutes during the CFL. The tournament will be a chance to see how we have progressed. We will get a fair idea of our strengths and weaknesses, he said. Thats modesty with a tinge of cleverness.         
	The secret of East Bengals free-flowing football this season lies in their success of recruiting at least two good options for every position. While Robin Singh, Ekene Ekenwa and Tolgay Ozebe have proven themselves as skilful snipers in front of the goal, the trio of Penn Orji, R. Vashum and Mehtab Hossain have done the job of providing ammunition from the midfield to the tee.         
	The picture, however, is not as perfect at Mohun Bagan. While coach Stanley Rozario, so far, has got his combinations wrong, to make matters worse, stars like Jose Barreto, Edeh Chidi and Murithala Ali have flattered to deceive.         
	Speaking about their CFL campaign so far, where they have even lost to Aryan in a match, Rozario said: That will serve as a wake-up call We need to tighten things up for the Federation Cup. Creating chances is of no use if you cannot convert them.         
	Captain Ishfaq Ahmed believes a new squad this season has made things difficult. Half of our first eleven are playing in Bagan colours for the first time. So we need a little time to gel together. But I hope things will be right in the Federation Cup. The fact that playing an under-19 player is not compulsory in the Federation will also help, Ishfaq said.         
	Bagan are in a tricky group where they will have to overcome the challenges of Lajong FC, Mumbai FC and Salgaocar. Each of their opponents are surprise packages and can shock the green and maroon brigade on their day. However, if they dont improve on their co-ordination, Bagan might just get super shocked.         
	For Chirag, it is all about utilising their available talent. Coach Subrata Bhattacharya has got the right mix of some talented youngsters and effective foreign recruits. But Bhattacharya knows that all is not well about his team.         
	We have to improve our game a lot if we harbour high hopes in Federation Cup. But Im confident that more we play, the better we will be, he said. He had further added: In fact, all the teams from Calcutta need to up their performances by quite a few notches for a good show.         
	In a nutshell, the story of the three city clubs resembles the three famous Khans of Bollywood. While East Bengal appear to come with Aamers guarantee, Bagan possess the quality of Shah Rukh. Chirag is more in the Salman mould  unpredictable, but capable of a surprise.         
	Lets wait to watch who delivers the biggest hit.

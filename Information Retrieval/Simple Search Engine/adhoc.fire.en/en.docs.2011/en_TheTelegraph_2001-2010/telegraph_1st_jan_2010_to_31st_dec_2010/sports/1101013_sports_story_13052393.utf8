            BRIEFS                
	New Delhi: Things are beginning to look bright for Bengal para-swimmer Prasanta Karmakar, who has been invited by Rahul Gandhi for a special felicitation at their 10 Janpath residence, on Wednesday. Karmakar created history winning India the first Commonwealth Games medal in swimming in the form of a bronze in 50m freestyle S9 category.         
	Confirming the invitation, Karmakar said, Never in my dream I had thought about this. After the bronze medal (on October 6), tomorrow (Wednesday) will be the biggest day in my life.         
	Coe opinion         
	New Delhi: After a successful Games, India should wait for a while before taking a final call on hosting an Olympic Games, feels legendary British runner Sebastian Coe.         
	I am sure they will want to look at that, but Im not sure that it should be quite yet. Delivering a Games is complicated, but I think that there is an opportunity for India to build on this, said Coe, chairman of 2012 London Olympics Organising Committee.         
	Coe, who is here on an observation visit, also praised the facilities, including the Athletes Village.         
	Player ban         
	New Delhi: Pakistan defender Mohammed Irfan has been suspended for three international matches after deliberately pushing a South Africa player in the Commonwealth Games hockey competition on Tuesday.         
	Brisk business         
	New Delhi: Floating hawkers, who have been able to skirt the heavy security, are making a kill by selling tea, snacks, cigarettes and other things outside the Village. In fact some of them have managed to sell even to the security personnel.         
	Bidding adieu         
	New Delhi: With just two days left for the Games to end, the Games Village, on Tuesday, wore a deserted look with a few bidding their good bye to others including volunteers. Some international delegates and athletes, who were staying here for past few days, have also left.         
	Food problem         
	New Delhi: England table tennis player Paul Drinkhall has blamed his quarter final loss to Singaporean Yang Zi on food available at the Village. Blasting the catering available to athletes in Delhi, he said, My focus went totally wrong and I was really tired because of the tight schedule we players had I couldnt eat properly so there was no energy and it was difficult for today (Tuesday)s game.           (AGENCIES)

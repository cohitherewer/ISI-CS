The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand captures fourth game 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Anand captures fourth game 
  - World Champion has a 2.5-1.5 lead over Veselin Topalov               Viswanathan Anand on Wednesday. (AFP)                             
	Sofia: World champion Viswanathan Anand scored a rampaging victory over challenger Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the fourth game to grab the lead in the 12-game World Chess championship here Wednesday.         
	Anand, who had lost the first game unceremoniously, won the second in sparkling fashion.         
	After drawing the third and winning the fourth game comprehensively, the fans are looking up to him to do what he did to Russian Vladimir Kramnik a couple of years ago in Bonn.         
	The scores are now on Anands side as he leads the 12-game match by a 2.5-1.5 margin.         
	It was a Queens gambit declined once again, something that Topalov has apparently prepared for this match, which is not coming good given the fact that the Bulgarian has lost his second game on the trot with black. Interestingly enough, it was a replica of the 2006 match that Kramnik won against Topalov as the latter went for the same system that he chose against the Russian in the previous match.         
	Surprising as it may sound, Anand won the second game using the pet line of Kramnik, drew the third doing the same and won Wednesday, simply repeating the opening of the 2006 match. All this has been possible after crushing Kramnik in the 2008 clash.         
	As it happened in that game, Topalov won a pawn in the opening, kept it close to himself for a long time and once Anand threatened to open up the king side, he had no answer.         
	The Indian ace came up with a resounding sacrifice of a knight to rip apart Topalovs king side, and once he decided on that, there was no respite for the challenger.         
	Anand simply squeezed out blacks resources with some high quality moves.         
	Down a piece, the world champion created havoc in the Bulgarians territory with some deft manoeuvres and went on to score a memorable victory. After the rest day on Thursday, Topalov will have white in the fifth game and the Bulgarian wont leave any stones unturned for his comeback attempt.         
	Wednesdays game saw another Catalan opening on the board. This is the first opening that was played twice in the match. Topalov was the one to deviate from the second game, as early as on move five, when he played the sharper Bb4+ instead of a6.         
	Similar to the earlier Catalan game, black clutched onto the extra pawn while white tried to take advantage of his faster pieces development.         
	Anand aggressively advanced in the centre to break the opponents pawn formation and open up the files and diagonals. At the same time, Topalov was carefully clearing the queenside in order to reduce the positional pressure.         
	The game appeared to be taking a normal course before Anands sudden knight movement (e3-g4) caught Topalov off guard.         
	Without any hesitation, Anand knocked a piece sacrifice on h6 and picked a strong attack against the black king. Precision was needed in carrying out the assault, but Anand never blinked.         
	Topalov continued for a few moves more, but resigned at the imminent danger of a mate.           (AGENCIES)

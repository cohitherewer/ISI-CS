The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Incredible: Rozario
                                                                                                                       7                                      Incredible: Rozario
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Lajong coach Stanley Rozario termed Saturdays victory over Mohun Bagan as the most memorable in the current season.         
	Full credit to my boys in the manner they played. They were simply outstanding and incredible today.         
	We had to win this match and boys responded brilliantly. To beat Mohun Bagan at Salt Lake Stadium, and that too 4-1, is unbelievable, an ecstatic Rozario said at the post match media conference.         
	However, Rozario was modest in his assessment about the Bagan team. I guess Bagan players did their best. They really tried hard to equalise and created lot of chances.         
	But our goalkeeper had an outstanding game. The best part about this team is that it comprises mostly of local players.         
	There are six to seven boys who are first team regulars and have never played at this level.         
	They are keen to do well and its showing.         
	His opposite number Satyajit Chatterjee didnt have any answer to Bagans woeful show in the return leg.         
	I couldnt believe that we have missed so many chances today. I cant offer any excuses for the misses, Satyajit said.

	 A division bench of Justice B. Bhattacharya and Justice P. Mondal of the Calcutta High Court, on Friday, refused to entertain an appeal moved by two members of Victoria Sporting Club against an order of a trial court, which refused to pass any injunction on the Indian Football Association (IFA)s decision to relegate the club to second division from group B of the senior division football league. Bisweswar Ghosh Dastidar and another member of Victoria Club had first moved to City Civil Court on April 9, alleging IFA had illegally relegated their club to second division. But Anindita Roy Saraswati, the civil court judge, had refused to pass any injunction on IFAs decision.

	Riding Pankaj Mollas twin strikes on Monday, the East Bengal colts beat Mohun Bagan 2-0 in their U-19 I-League match at the Salt Lake Stadium.       
	It was a revenge of sorts for East Bengal as the senior side lost 1-2 to archrivals Mohun Bagan.       
	However, both teams qualified for the national leg of the tournament after finishing first and second in the group.       
	In the national leg, the Bagan juniors are clubbed alongside Sporting Clube de Goa and JCT while East Bengal have Dempo and Pune FC for company.                 
	 Representatives of East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Chirag United Monday expressed their displeasure over an AIFF ruling at a meeting with IFA secretary Utpal Ganguli.       
	Apparently they are unhappy with AIFFs decision to the prune down the foreign quota from three to two players for blue riband tournaments like the Federation Cup.       
	They reasoned that since AFC allows four foreigners (including the Asian quota player), it should be the same for all AIFF-organised tournaments.                
	 Mohammed Shoaib Khan won the State Junior Snooker Championship beating Aniesh Poddar 3-0 at the Bengal Rowing Club on Monday.

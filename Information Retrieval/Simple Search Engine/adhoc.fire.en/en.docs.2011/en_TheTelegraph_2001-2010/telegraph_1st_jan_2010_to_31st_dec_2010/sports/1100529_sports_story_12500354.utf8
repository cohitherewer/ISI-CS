The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Never banned Yousuf and Younis: PCB
                                                                                                                       7                                      Never banned Yousuf and Younis: PCB
                      
	Karachi: As somersaults go, this one takes the cake. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Friday claimed that former skippers Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan were never banned and can be brought back to the side anytime.         
	PCB legal advisor Tafazzul Rizvi said chairman Ijaz Butt had the authority to include Younis and Yousuf in the team whenever he wanted. It is a wrong impression that the inquiry committee had placed both players on life bans. There was no ban. We had recommended that they be not selected for the time being and be monitored, he said. Since they are not banned like Shoaib Malik and Rana Naved for a definite period, they can be restored to the national team anytime the chairman wishes Rizvi said.         
	But it seems this clarification from the board comes a little too late as a disenchanted Yousuf has refused to come out of retirement despite pleas from skipper Shahid Afridi who wanted the senior batsman to be part of the Pakistan team for the upcoming tour of England.         
	Yousuf announced his international retirement in March, after the PCB imposed an indefinite ban on him for indiscipline on the Australia tour for which he was captain.         
	I am still hurting from the words used for me by some board officials and the harsh decision of the inquiry committee. I still feel let down by the events, keeping in mind that I have always given 100 per cent for Pakistan, he said.         
	Yousuf said that although Afridi has been trying to convince him to come out of retirement and play in England he has made up his mind to stick to his decision.         
	I dont know what fate has in store for me but I have no plans to change my decision in the near future. I want to concentrate on other duties, he said.         
	But while Yousuf remains adamant Younis has appealed against his ban and the hearing in his and Maliks case is due on Saturday. Malik is in the list of probables for the Asia Cup but sources say Afridi is not keen to have him back as he fears the all-rounder would create disharmony in the side.

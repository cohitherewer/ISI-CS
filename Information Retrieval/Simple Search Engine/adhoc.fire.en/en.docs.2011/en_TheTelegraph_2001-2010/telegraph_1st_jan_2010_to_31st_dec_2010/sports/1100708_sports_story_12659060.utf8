The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gallas blames Domenech
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gallas blames Domenech
                      
	Paris: William Gallas says outgoing coach Raymond Domenech is chiefly to blame for Frances World Cup debacle because their problems stemmed from his style of man-management.         
	The French team went on strike at a training session shortly before they were eliminated from the tournament at the group stage, prompting sharp criticism of Domenech and his squad from French fans and politicians.         
	If there was a fiasco, there are reasons, Gallas said in an interview with a weekly French magazine And for me you shouldnt pull the wool over your eyes: they stem from the coach.         
	Laurent Blanc has replaced Domenech, but the former Bordeaux coach has inherited a France team devoid of confidence after Domenechs troubled six-year reign ended with public rifts and infighting.         
	The players had refused to train in protest at the treatment of teammate Nicolas Anelka. The striker was sent home for insulting Domenech during the second group match, a 2-0 defeat to Mexico.         
	Gallas, the Arsenal defender who has won 84 caps for France, says the way Domenech handled his players was wrong, which is what led to Anelkas outburst.         
	Domenech kept drumming into us: Put your egos to one side. But I think that he forgot to do so, Gallas said in the interview. Domenech wasnt receptive. A lot of players couldnt speak to him. That was my case.         
	The real problem is the coach... I wasnt good, we werent good. But the coach wasnt good, either.         
	Former France defender Lilian Thuram has called for some players, such as former captain Patrice Evra, never to play for the national team again because of their decision to strike.         
	While many observers were surprised that a team with such talented players failed so dramatically, Gallas said that you can have the best players in the world in your team, (but) if you dont have the right coach, you wont get results.         
	France did not win a game at the World Cup, just like two years earlier, when Domenechs team failed to progress from the group stage at the European Championship.         
	Gallas was also furious with Domenech for handing the captains armband to Patrice Evra prior to a World Cup warm-up match against Costa Rica.         
	Domenech used the words in any case, you wont be a good captain when he made his decision.         
	Gallas was stripped of the Arsenal captaincy nearly two years ago after criticising his teammates.           (AGENCIES)

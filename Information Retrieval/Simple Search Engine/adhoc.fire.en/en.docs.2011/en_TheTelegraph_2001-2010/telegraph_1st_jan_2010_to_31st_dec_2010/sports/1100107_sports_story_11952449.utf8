            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) camp with the domestic players is in troubled waters again.         
	If it was the reluctance of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) to release its players earlier, this time the dates are clashing with East Zone teams preparatory camp for the Duleep Trophy.         
	The camp, scheduled to start on Friday, will continue till January 15 at Eden Gardens. On Friday, however, the KKR players will train at the CC amp;FC as a CAB league match is scheduled at the ground.         
	During the same time, from January 11-15, East Zone players will have a five-day camp at the JU (Salt Lake campus) ground. The CAB was informed of the camp Wednesday.         
	The East Zone team has seven Bengal players. Five of them, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Manoj Tiwary, Sourashish Lahiri, Wriddhiman Saha and Ashok Dinda are contracted with the KKR.         
	Dav Whatmore along with consultant and former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram is expected to be in the city on Thursday.         
	If East Zone selection committee convenor Bikash Baruah has his way, KKRs Bengal players can only attend the IPL camp for three days before they report for the zonal camp.         
	When senior KKR official Joy Bhattacharjya was contacted, he said: We are trying to work out a solution acceptable to all. We will talk to the players and the concerned authorities before taking a call.         
	The Bengal players are still in a dilemma as to what should be done.

	After years in the wilderness, the mirage of a place in the prestigious World Group of the Davis Cup turned into reality. In the simmering heat of Chennai, the Brazilians, leading by 2 matches to 1, were poised to deliver the coup de grace on the third and final day of the World Group playoff tie. Instead, they collapsed where they stood, like a building in a controlled demolition.         
	The crowd watched in disbelief as the world No. 27, left-handed Thomaz Bellucci, conceded the fourth match to a fearless and tenacious Somdev Dev Varman with the score at 7-6, 4-0 in Indias favour. A deluge of errors after the first set had signalled that all was not well with Bellucci. Apparently, Bellucci had difficulty in breathing and the Brazilian captains, Joao Zwetsch, action of putting an ice pack on Belluccis heart during the change over after the first set, signalled the serious nature of the problem.         
	A day of rest after his marathon victory over Rohan Bopanna in the opening rubber was not enough for Bellucci to recharge his batteries. For the Brazilians, it did not seem that all was lost. Ricardo Mello, the world No, 75 ranked left hander, had beaten Indias best, Somdev, on the first day. The Indian camp thought about Bopannas brilliant opening match which he lost to Bellucci after holding three match points and wondered if Bopanna could close out the tie for India by beating Mello.         
	In tennis, there is no tension equal to playing the deciding fifth match in a Davis Cup tie. Would Bopanna choke or would he blast his way through the tough grinder Mello. The answer was emphatic. The 30-year-old Bopanna had at last come of age. The tension was there but it did not inhibit Bopanna from fearlessly going for his shots. He won in three straight sets.         
	At long last, after years of struggle, Bopanna has achieved close to his rich potential. His success in the US Open doubles, where he lost in the final partnering Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi, gave him a measure of confidence and self belief which in essence is the difference between the higher and lower ranked players.         
	Even though Bopanna is 30 years old, there is enormous scope for further improvement. With his prowess in doubles, he could become the sheet anchor of our Davis Cup team in the future. Somdev, at 25, is the jewel of our team. Apolitical, sober and well behaved, he has brought the much-needed stability to the team. His courageous never-say-die attitude is almost Leander Paes-like. These are admirable qualities and can make a team perform at their highest levels.         
	He too, like Bopanna, has yet to achieve his potential. In brief, Somdev needs to get physically stronger and infuse aggression to his service and a power-packed winning shot, or else standing so far behind the baseline, he will become just another baseline grinder. Only working hard may not be enough, Somdev has to find the right track. Having said all this, I must say that I found that Somdev had developed a deeper length on his ground shots. The pivot of the tie was the Leander/Mahesh Bhupathi straight set win in the doubles.         
	Twenty-four consecutive victories in Davis cup play is a mind blowing statistic even though some of them have not been in the strongest Davis Cup Zones.         
	I really enjoyed watching the match from close quarters. The match was dominated by a sparkling display by Paes with unpredictable interceptions at the net, completely baffling the Brazilians who are an established high quality team. The Brazilians could not close out the second set in spite of having four set points. Two sets down, the Brazilians threw in the towel and lost a tame third set.         
	Bhupathi was also impressive, though not at his best. However, when the big points came, he was right there. The Indian Express have coupled together for the next tournament at Bangkok, trying to raise full steam for the Commonwealth Games.         
	One of the things that come to mind is the composition of the current Davis Cup team. It is a beautiful example of national integration  Somdev from Tripura, Bopanna from Coorg, Mahesh from Karnataka, Paes from Calcutta/Goa. The non-playing captain, S.P. Misra is from Hyderabad. A former Davis Cupper, Misra or SP as he is known, deserves the highest praise for steering the team through the earlier turbulent times and bringing about much needed stability to the Davis Cup camp.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Inter romp vs Milan 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Inter romp vs Milan 
                  Diego Milito                     
	Milan: Inter Milan landed a massive blow in the Serie A title tussle on Sunday, going nine points clear when they beat AC Milan 2-0 in a high voltage derby which they finished with nine men.         
	Argentine forward Diego Milito set the champions on their way with a diagonal strike on 10 minutes.         
	They then spent long periods under intense pressure in their own half after Dutch playmaker Wesley Sneijder was sent off for dissent in the 27th minute before Goran Pandev doubled the lead with a free kick in the 65th.         
	Inter keeper Julio Cesar saved a generous stoppage-time Ronaldinho penalty for handball by Lucio, who was also shown a red card.         
	Victory gave Inter 49 points from 21 matches, while Milan are on 40 having played one game less.         
	Im happy to have given my contribution, Julio Cesar said after the match. Its not easy to play practically the whole game with 10. My teammates showed how strong this group is today.         
	Milan went into the game as slight favourites even without injured defender Alessandro Nesta thanks to their strong revival from a poor start in which they lost the early season derby 4-0.         
	But Inter surprised them with an aggressive opening.         
	Sneijder, who recovered from a high temperature to make their starting XI, hit the far post with a long-range effort before blasting a good chance straight at Milan keeper Dida.         
	Milito took advantage of a blunder by Milans Ignazio Abate, who headed the ball into his path when trying to cut out a cross, to give them a deserved lead.         
	Sneijder was shown a red card for giving the referee sarcastic applause when Lucio got booked for diving after a challenge by Massimo Ambrosini and an already intense clash became bad tempered.         
	Palermo climbed to fifth with a 3-0 home win over Fiorentina thanks to a first-half double by Abel Hernandez and Igor Budans acrobatic effort just before the hour.           (REUTERS)

	Chennai: Rohan Bopanna couldnt have asked for a bigger occasion to showcase his big game and prove his reliability as Indias key singles player.         
	The draw for the Davis Cup World Group play-off tie, starting here on Friday, pitted Bopanna in the first singles rubber against Brazils No.1 player Thomaz Bellucci. Indias leading singles hope Somdev Dev Varman will play Ricardo Mello in the second singles.         
	Saturday is dedicated to doubles as usual and Sunday will witness the reverse singles.         
	Bopanna is high on confidence following his maiden appearance in a Grand Slam final at the US Open last week. However, that was in doubles but his singles triumphs in Davis Cup have always had people talking.         
	Indias non-playing captain Shiv Prakash Misra downplayed the significance of the draw and mentioned Bopannas singles victories in Davis Cup. Last year in Johannesburg, the 30-year-old from Coorg beat South Africas No.1 player Rik de Voest and earlier this year in Moscow, he defeated Teimuraz Gabashvili in the reverse singles.         
	But, Misra did admit that he would have preferred if Dev Varman played the opening rubber. It would be okay even if we are 1-1 on the first day. The important thing is that he (Bopanna) would be playing the last rubber. But who knows, we could be 2-0 up (on Friday), Misra said after the draw ceremony.         
	One cannot hide the obvious. In this tie, Brazil are the superior team. Bellucci, only 22, is ranked 27th in the ATP rankings while 29-year-old Mello is ranked 75th.         
	Bopanna, from having concentrated in doubles this entire season, will have to get ready for tough best-of-five sets against baseliners.         
	He has a simple game packed with power. He serves big, serves and volleys, and hits strong ground strokes from the baseline. So his game doesnt change, whether its singles or doubles, Leander Paes said. The key is how Bopanna handles the physical and mental fitness.         
	Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi will be playing on Saturday but they wont be able to take Brazils Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares lightly. The Brazilian pair had defeated the Bryan brothers at the French Open this year.         
	The rubbers         
	Friday (11.30 am start): Rohan Bopanna vs Thomaz Bellucci; Somdev Dev Varman vs Ricardo Mello; Saturday (3.00 pm start): Mahesh Bhupathi/Leander Paes vs Marcelo Melo/Bruno Soares; Sunday (11.30 am start): Dev Varman vs Bellucci; Bopanna vs Mello

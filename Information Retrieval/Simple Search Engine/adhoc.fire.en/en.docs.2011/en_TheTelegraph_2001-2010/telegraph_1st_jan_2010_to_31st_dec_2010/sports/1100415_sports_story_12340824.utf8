                                                                                                                       7                                      ICC has fix for clause dispute
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) Wednesday revealed it was close to finding a solution to the vexed issue of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)s whereabouts clause.         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said, without going into too many details, he expected the executive board to approve a proposal which would solve the problem that has pitted the games world governing body against the apex anti-doping agency.         
	We are very close to resolving the issue of the whereabouts clause. We have found a solution and hopefully the issue will be resolved, Lorgat said on the sidelines of a World T20 function.         
	The ICC executive board is to meet next week. We will present the proposal to our members and, hopefully, we would find a consensus on it, he added.         
	As per the relevant clause of the Wada Code, national teams in every sport have to submit a list of their elite athletes who, for 90 days, have to provide information about whereabouts and availability for out-of-competition testing.         
	Indian cricketers had refused to sign the Wada Code last year citing loss of privacy and threat to security.         
	Meanwhile, on preparations for the 2011 World Cup, which is to be held in the subcontinent, Lorgat said he did not see any problems as regards the Wankhede but admitted that the ICC had a task at hand where Delhis Kotla pitch was concerned.         
	It is important that we get the Kotla pitch up to a certain standard. So from now to the end of the year, we will work with the DDCA, Lorgat said.         
	The only thing we can do is to work with the DDCA.         
	We have got Andy Atkinson, the ICC pitch consultant, to work with them over the coming few months.

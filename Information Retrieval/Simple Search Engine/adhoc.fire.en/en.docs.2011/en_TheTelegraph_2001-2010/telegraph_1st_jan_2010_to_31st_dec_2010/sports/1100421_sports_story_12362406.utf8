The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | 40-hour ride to defend the title
                                                                                                                       7                                      40-hour ride to defend the title
                      
	New Delhi: World champion Viswanathan Anand Tuesday reached Sofia, Bulgaria, after a strenuous 40-hour road journey from Germany as all flights were cancelled due to the volcanic ash floating across European airspace.         
	The 40-year old world champion had requested a postponement of the World chess championship match against Veselin Topalov, by three days, but his appeal was rejected by the organising committee.         
	Not used to travelling such long distances on road along with the refusal to grant a three-day postponement could give Anands challenger, Topalov, a significant advantage.         
	Anand had planned to reach the venue on April 16, which is one week before the first game on April 23. But he arrived four days behind schedule due to factors beyond his control.         
	Anand might miss the press conference but will attend the opening ceremony according to his wife Aruna Anand. Not rescheduling the games will mean Topalov could have the same advantage that Anatoly Karpov enjoyed in the world title match, in Lausanne, in 1998.         
	The news from us is that we reached here safely, said Aruna Anand.         
	Had Alexander Alekhine been in Anands place, he would have sought a postponement of at least a week as world champions ruled and challengers were at the mercy of champions. Sometimes a handicap is a better way to start a match and Anand can turn the disadvantage into a driving force in the 12-game series.         
	Earlier, the organising committee had received an e-mailed request for a postponement from Anand and also a word from Fide about the situation.         
	However, the committee said that the press conference could be postponed but not the opening ceremony scheduled on April 21 because invitations to all official guests, sponsors, politicians, television stations and the media was already sent. Also since many commercial contracts have been signed, there would be serious penalties if any changes were made.         
	The championship is to be formally inaugurated on April 21 with the first of the 14 games to begin on April 23.           (PTI)

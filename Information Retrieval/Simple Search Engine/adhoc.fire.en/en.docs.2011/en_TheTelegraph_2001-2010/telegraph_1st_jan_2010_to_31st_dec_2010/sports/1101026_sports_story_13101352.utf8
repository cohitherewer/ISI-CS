The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CSA keen to use UDRS in India series
                                                                                                                       7                                      CSA keen to use UDRS in India series
                      
	Johannesburg: South Africa are in favour of the Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS) and Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief executive Gerald Majola said they are trying to convince India to use it in the home Test series, starting on December 16.         
	India are not in favour of the UDRS and it was not used in their two-match Test series against South Africa, in India, early this year.         
	The UDRS was not used in Indias recently concluded Test series against Australia, who had no problem in using the technology. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has also ruled out using it in the forthcoming Test series against New Zealand, starting in Ahmedabad, on November 4.         
	Majola said the CSA is having discussions with the BCCI over whether the system could be used during the three-match Test-series.         
	We have to persuade India because at the moment, they dont want it, Majola said.           (PTI)

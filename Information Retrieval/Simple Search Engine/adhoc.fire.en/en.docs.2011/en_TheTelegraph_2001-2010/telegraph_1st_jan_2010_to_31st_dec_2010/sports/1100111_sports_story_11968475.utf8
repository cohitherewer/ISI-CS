The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SRK to visit KKR camp today
                                                                                                                       7                                      SRK to visit KKR camp today
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) principal owner Shah Rukh Khan is expected in the city on Monday to get a first hand account of his franchises ongoing training camp. It has been learnt that Shah Rukh may drop in at the CC amp;FC ground, where Knights camp would be held on Monday, during the afternoon session of the practice.         
	He is expected tomorrow (Monday). However, we are not in a position to divulge any further details about his trip, a KKR official told The Telegraph on Sunday.         
	It was also learnt that Shah Rukh will be present at a get together at the team hotel with the players and support staff.         
	His presence always lifts the spirits. Its been an amazing experience whenever he has interacted with his players. We are really looking forward to meeting him once more, said a player.         
	Meanwhile, there was a lot of confusion regarding the Bengal trio of Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourasish Lahiri and Manoj Tiwary who are supposed to report for East Zones Duleep Trophy preparatory camp at the JU (Salt Lake) ground which commences Monday.         
	Initially, it was decided that the trio would skip first days zonal camp and stay back at the KKR camp as SRK will be in town to meet them.         
	The KKR managements logic was that since East Zone convenor Bikash Baruah is allowing three players  Ranadeb Bose, Arindam Das and Wriddhiman Saha (the last two are attending the KKR camp)  to skip the first days camp due to the J.C. Mukherjee Trophy final, the other three can also join a day later.         
	Accordingly, top KKR officials got in touch with the East Zone coach Subrata Das requesting him to excuse Laxmi, Manoj and Sourasish for a day. However, when the news reached Baruah, who is also the secretary of the Assam Cricket Association (ACA), he turned down the request.

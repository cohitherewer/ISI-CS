The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer injury a concern
                                                                                                                       7                                      Zaheer injury a concern
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Pace spearhead Zaheer Khans stiffness in his quadriceps muscle will definitely be a worrying concern for the team management as it is still not certain whether he would be able to bowl on an all-important final day of the second Test against South Africa on Thursday.         
	Also in question is whether the senior speedster will be able to play in the first two ODIs against South Africa in Jaipur and Gwalior on February 21 and February 24 respectively.         
	Out of the 34.1 overs bowled on the day, Zaheer managed only 5.1 overs before he left the field. The Indian team, faced with a must win situation to retain their No. 1 Test status, will certainly feel handicapped if Zaheer doesnt bowl on the morrow.         
	Coach Gary Kirsten admitted that ice packs are being applied as a precautionary measure.         
	Even Jacques Kallis, who came for the news conference after the days play, said that it will be an advantage for South Africa if India are without Zaheer on the final day.         
	The national selection committee, led by Krishnamachari Srikkanth, may take a call on the pacers fitness by the end of the match.         
	It is a worrying factor that he had to go out today (Wednesday). May be the selectors will take a call on Zaheers availability, for the first two one-dayers, by Thursday evening once the team management provides an update on the pacers fitness, a source told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	In case Zaheer is unavailable for the one day series, then selectors have a few options to bank on.         
	Although Ishant Sharma hasnt been in the best of forms and Sreesanths match fitness is questionable, the two pacers will be in the reckoning considering they have the experience at this level.         
	Rookie Abhimanyu Mithuns name can also come up for discussion.         
	Incidentally, Zaheers teammate Gautam Gambhir has been ruled out of the ODI series due to a groin injury and didnt field in the South African second innings.

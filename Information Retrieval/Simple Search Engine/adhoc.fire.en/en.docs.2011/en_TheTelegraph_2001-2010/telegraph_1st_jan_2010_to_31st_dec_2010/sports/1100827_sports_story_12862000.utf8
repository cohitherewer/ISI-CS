            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Indias Virat Kohli has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee for showing dissent at umpires decision after being given out during the tri-nation ODI match against New Zealand in Dambulla.         
	Kohli pleaded guilty to a Level 1 offence and accepted the proposed sanction from match referee Alan Hurst on Wednesday, according to a media release.         
	He was found to have breached 2.1.3 of the code, which relates to showing dissent at an umpires decision.         
	After being given out in the sixth over, Kohli stood his ground and looked at the umpire for a considerable time before eventually walking back to the pavilion.         
	This was considered to be a show of dissent, a fact accepted by the player himself.         
	The charge was brought by on-field umpires Asad Rauf and Asoka de Silva, third umpire Kumar Dharmasena and fourth official Gration Liyanage.

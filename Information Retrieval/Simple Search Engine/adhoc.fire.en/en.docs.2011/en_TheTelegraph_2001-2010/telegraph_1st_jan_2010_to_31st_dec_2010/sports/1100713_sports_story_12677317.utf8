The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | In Spain, time to celebrate! 
                                                                                                                       7                                      In Spain, time to celebrate! 
                                  Fans celebrate Spains win in Madrid, on Sunday      
	Madrid: A thunderous roar erupted across the Spanish capital and fans danced in the streets chanting Viva Espana! as the countrys first ever World Cup triumph sparked a nation-wide fiesta.         
	The centre of Madrid was a sea of the red and gold national colours as Spain celebrated their nail-biting 1-0 extra-time win over the Netherlands, on Sunday.         
	The deafening sounds of cheering, vuvuzelas, firecrackers and cars horns rang out as the World Cups perennial underachievers won the trophy in their first appearance in the final, thanks to a late goal from midfielder Andreas Iniesta.         
	The dream has come true, said Spains leading daily El Pais on its website.         
	Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said he was happy and emotional at the victory which help would restore some confidence to the country amid its economic crisis. This has been an epic match, I suffered like never before, he told a radio station.         
	In blistering heat, a crowd estimated by Spanish media at more than 250,000, watched the match on massive screens in a giant fan park in a one-kilometre stretch of the citys main thoroughfare.         
	We are very proud and very happy, I thought it would go to penalties, Iniesta saved us, said Raul, 18. We deserved it after winning the European championship in 2008.         
	Said Adolfo, 25, Its an extraordinary feeling, of happiness and nerves.         
	Others crammed into bars or gathered at home for the match, which left the country paralysed for two and a half hours Sunday evening.         
	Most were either wrapped in the Spanish flag, wore the red team shirts or red wigs or had their faces painted red and gold.         
	One young woman was disguised as an octopus, in tribute to Paul, the now famous clairvoyant cephalopod in Germany who predicted Spains victory.         
	Spain, Spain, Spain! screamed the daily El Mundo in a headline on its website. This World Cup has crowned one of the best teams of all time.         
	Iniesta took us up into heaven after an agonising game, said the sports daily Marca. We suffered, but it was worth it.         
	Thousands of fans had earlier poured into the capital from other parts of the country to soak up the atmosphere, many travelling all night and planning to leave the next morning after a night of revelry.         
	Were going to celebrate like crazy, all night, all Monday, until Tuesday morning, said Miguel Angel, 41, who had travelled from the northern city of Bilbao for the match.

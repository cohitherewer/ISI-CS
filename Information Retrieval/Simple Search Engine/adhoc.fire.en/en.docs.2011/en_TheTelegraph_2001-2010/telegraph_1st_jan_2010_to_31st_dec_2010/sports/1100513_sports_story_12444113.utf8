The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Anand: Feel a decade older 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Anand: Feel a decade older 
            OUR BUREAU            Viswanathan Anand                           
	It may not match the ecstasy of retaining the World Championship title but Viswanathan Anand is both delighted and relieved to have snapped a black jinx against his Bulgarian nemesis Veselin Topalov.         
	Both levelled at 5.5 after 11 rounds, Anand weaved a black magic in the decider, conjuring a stunning win over the local favourite to retain the world title in Sofia, Bulgaria.         
	It came as a fitting reply to Topalovs pre-match bragging that he would have the edge against the Indian because of his white pieces.         
	I think I have lost my four or five games against Topalov with black but with white I won my last three. So it was very important to win this with black, Anand said.         
	May be it is fitting in a way that finally I corrected this problem that I have been having with the black pieces, he said.         
	In general, for the last four years we have been beating each other with white, so it was getting a bit one-sided, Anand said.         
	Anand lauded Topalov for great determination and fighting spirit to take the 12-game encounter down to the wire.         
	He is one of the strongest players in the world. Its the toughest match Ive ever played. I cant recall another experience like this I think he is one of the grittiest and I feel a decade older after this match, Anand said.         
	Anands parents said in Chennai that the win was special as Topalov was tamed in his own backyard.         
	It is a special moment for us on many counts. Firstly, we are thrilled that no player had won the title so many times as Anand. Winning the title in 2002 and retaining it since 2007 Baba (as Anand is affectionately called) is the greatest player. We are sure that he will continue to rule the roost at highest levels in the game, the champions parents, Viswanathan and Susheela said.         
	Viswanathan said the triumph shows that his son is mentally strong. Right from his young days he always loves challenges.         
	Anands mother said she was delighted after all the problems that he was forced to confront prior to the tournament. Anand had to travel by road to compete in the world championship as air traffic had been disrupted due to volcanic ash over Europe.         
	We were still very hopeful of his triumph because he has always been focused on his work from his younger days.         
	We were not under any pressure and we do not think that Anand was in any such situation.         
	As usual, we did not talk to him during the tournament. Aruna (Anands wife) gave us information on a daily basis. Our prayers were answered and we are happy that he has defended his title, she said.

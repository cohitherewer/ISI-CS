  - lsquo;Given the pressure, Sachin has been brilliant rsquo;
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sachin Tendulkar                           
	Calcutta: Much has changed since the mid-Nineties Cricketers have come and gone, scandals have erupted, laws have been amended and T20 has arrived in a big way         
	Sachin Tendulkar, though, has been an absolute constant. If anything, its that much harder to dismiss him in 2010 than it was a decade-and-a-half ago.         
	In the mid-Nineties, plotting Sachins downfall had been a priority for Dav Whatmore, then in his first innings as Sri Lanka coach.         
	Hes with a different team now, the Kolkata Knight Riders, an IPL franchise, but trying to get Sachin out early remains a priority.         
	I didnt really think that Sachin would be around a decade-and-a-half later too Hes a champion, Whatmore, who has coached Bangladesh as well, told The elegraph.         
	Sachin, the highest run-getter in both Tests and ODIs (also the one with the maximum hundreds in the two forms), is the Mumbai Indians captain in the IPL.         
	Edition No.3 begins on Friday.         
	The first Knights versus Indians clash, in Mumbai, is on March 22. The return match will be held here, on April 19.         
	Whatmore added: I agree with everything that has been said about Sachin Indeed, theres nothing left to say, except that hes been brilliant in a country where theres so much pressure because of the expectations         
	Asked if he agreed with Nasser Hussain that Sachin was actually greater than Sir Donald Bradman, Whatmore (an Australian) replied: Its difficult to say Difficult to compare They played in such different times Different eras         
	Has there been a change in Sachins game?         
	Oh, hes definitely more consistent, isnt he? Hes probably reached a stage where every innings becomes special After all, you never know when one final injury could stop you from playing, Whatmore said.         
	Sachin, 37 next month, has been turning out for India from November 1989.         
	A Ravindra Jadeja, for example, wasnt even a year old then.         
	For all his awesome achievements, Sachin hasnt got a Test triple (best being 248 not out). Nothing else is, of course, missing from his CV.         
	Is that, then, a surprise?         
	Whatmore answered laughing: Even if Sachin doesnt ever get a 300, I wouldnt mind having him in my team Sure, Id take such a guy any day         
	Oops, oops For that, there would be a queue outside Sachins Bandra residence!         
	Footnote: Whatmore believes that Virender Sehwag, who has modelled himself on Sachin, is the one most likely to break the maestros ODI record of 200 not out. That wont disappoint Sachin, as he wants a fellow-Indian to get past him.

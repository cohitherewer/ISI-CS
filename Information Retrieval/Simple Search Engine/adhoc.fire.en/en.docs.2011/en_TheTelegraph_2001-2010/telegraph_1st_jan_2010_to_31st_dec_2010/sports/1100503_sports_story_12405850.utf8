The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Billy Mayfair is in the lead
                                                                                                                       7                                        Billy Mayfair is in the lead
            NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE            Billy Mayfair at the Quail Hollow Club on Saturday                           
	Charlotte: Billy Mayfair defied conventional wisdom by holding on to the lead after the third round of the Quail Hollow Championship on Saturday, hunting and pecking his way around the brawny course at Quail Hollow Club.         
	His round of 71 left him at nine-under-par 207, two strokes ahead of Davis Love III, who shot a 68, and Phil Mickelson, who shot a 71, and three ahead of ngel Cabrera (73), Dustin Johnson (72) and J. J. Henry (71).         
	As evidenced by those long hitters breathing down Mayfairs neck  every one of whom hits his average drive 20 to 25 yards past Mayfairs  Quail Hollow is a big-boy golf course. It is a 7,469-yard bully, not meant to be finessed into submission. But that is just what Mayfair, 43, did Saturday, and the days before, and he has had a lot of fun doing it.         
	Its fun getting the heart pumping, said Mayfair, a five-time winner on the PGA Tour.         
	The surprising spectacle of Tiger Woodss missing the cut  shooting 79 on Friday by three-putting twice, four-putting once, hitting only two fairways, stringing together three straight bogeys and back-to-back doubles  showed how quickly things can change in golf.         
	Back when Woods was still seemingly invincible, before all the unpleasantness that began about six months ago, many golf experts had already designated 2010 the year of Tiger Woods.         
	The analysis was simple. In his prime at age 34, surgically repaired, strong and healthy and a decade after two of his greatest seasons, with the majors returning to courses that fit him like a tailored suit, Woods would be primed to win the Grand Slam in its purest form  all four major championships in the same year.         
	Now, rather than the stars being aligned for Woods to run the table, they seem to be forming the outline of a crown around the head of his archrival, Mickelson.         
	Mickelson, 39, cleared the first of the four hurdles with his win at the Masters last month. He is playing well and putting with confidence.         
	And with summer on the horizon, he is staring into the very bright possibility of attaining the unattained because, first of all, he is the only one with a chance to win all four this year.         
	There are the three remaining stops on the major championship road  Pebble Beach Golf Links in June, the Old Course at St. Andrews in July, Whistling Straits in August  all pre-ordained as home sites for Woods before last November happened. They now look pretty friendly to Mickelson.         
	Mickelson, of course, did not win the US Open by 15 strokes at Pebble Beach in 2000. That mind-bending feat was accomplished by Woods. But Mickelson has had his moments there, three times winning the AT amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, the last in 2007. He tied for 16th at the 2000 Open there, and has five runner-up finishes in the Open as an additional motivator, should any be necessary.         
	He was asked last week if he had considered the possibility of the Grand Slam, and whether the golf courses suited his game.         
	Somewhat, he said. But for me, I finished second in the US Open five times. Its a tournament  its my national Open. Growing up here, thats a special event for me. So rather than jump ahead to other events, I really want to give myself the best opportunity in the US Open.         
	Before jumping ahead to Mickelsons track record at the British Open and at St. Andrews, it is worth noting that his expanded clichd answer of one at a time may be a key to success.         
	So far, no one  not Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Tom Watson or Woods  has been able to win the modern Grand Slam, which makes Bob Joness feat of winning the original Slam in 1930  the British Amateur and Open and the United States Amateur and Open  all the more impressive.         
	Woods came the closest in 2000 when he won the US Open, British Open and PGA Championship after starting the year with a fifth-place finish at the Masters. In 2001, he won the Masters, to become the only man to hold all four major championship trophies at once.         
	The Tiger Slam, as it became known, was an amazing feat. But it was not the Grand Slam.         
	Each attempt has been swallowed in part by the compounding pressures. Even before the concept of the modern Slam was conceived by Palmer, only two golfers were able to win the Masters and US Open in the same year  Craig Wood in 1941, and Hogan in 1951 and 1953  when Hogan won the first three by adding the British Open, a feat that has not been repeated.         
	Since then, Palmer won the first two in 1960, as did Nicklaus in 1972 and Woods in 2002. None won the British Open.         
	Should Mickelson manage to prevail at Pebble Beach, he will then focus on St. Andrews, where his best finish is a tie for 11th in 2000. And after that? Whistling Straits is a wild card, a big, brawling, windswept links course on a lake that has hosted one previous major  the 2004 PGA, where Mickelson finished tied for sixth.         
	Mickelson has his bona fides in order. Four times he has won four events in a year. He has finished all four majors 10 times, and in 2004 he was first at the Masters, second at the US Open, third at the British Open and tied for sixth at the PGA.         
	It is too early to count him out. He may just have a whole lot more.

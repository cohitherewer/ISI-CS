The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chokers tag unfair, says Steyn 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chokers tag unfair, says Steyn 
                      
	Pretoria: South Africa do not deserve to go into next years World Cup with a reputation for choking, fast bowler Dale Steyn said on Thursday.         
	South Africa have exited the 50-over showpiece tournament in three semi-finals, a quarter final and in the first round of the 2003 event they hosted. In May, they were knocked out of the ICC World Twenty20 in the West Indies in the second group stage despite being one of the favourites.         
	They are still licking their wounds from that disappointment and are attending a conditioning camp at Pretoria Universitys high performance centre but Steyn said the chokers tag struck a nerve because it was unfair on a side with fresh blood in it.         
	For me, to be labelled as chokers really sucks, he said.         
	This team is made up of a lot of young guys who will play for South Africa for a long time. Why are we being called chokers, a lot of us have never been to a World Cup before!         
	Ive played in two T20 World Cups but there was hardly a year between them and you could hardly pick yourself up from the last one. It was extremely disappointing what happened in the West Indies, but we have another opportunity at the end of this season and hopefully we can get this monkey off our back.         
	The worlds No. 1 ranked fast bowler in Test cricket said his team were getting themselves sharp for the World Cup in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, playing just 13 one-day Internationals before their opening match on February 24 against the West Indies in Delhi.         
	Their commitments before the World Cup are three one-dayers against Zimbabwe, five ODIs and two Tests against Pakistan in Dubai and three tests and five ODIs at home against India.

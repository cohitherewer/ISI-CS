            STAR RACER                        
	Calcutta: An action-packed opening day of the monsoon season, on Friday, witnessed trainer Patrick Quinn scoring a priced double through Great Heart and Bella Italiana. The trainer missed a possible treble in view of a false-start in the Glotik Cup. Quinns Ocean Element was the hot-favourite to win the trophy. But Successful won the race which was subsequently declared as null and void. The day was, however, ruled by long-priced winners.

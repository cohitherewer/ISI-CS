            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: One of the most difficult jobs for any performer is to satisfy expectations of the audience. Being good brings with itself the burden of enhancing that to better.         
	When defending champions East Bengal take on Churchill Brothers in the first semi-final of the 32nd Federation Cup, in Cuttack, on Wednesday, the red and gold brigade will have to run that extra yard to get past the Goan giants.         
	East Bengal have been impressive this season. Their smooth on-field operation have triggered hopes of millions of fans. If their dazzling display in the Calcutta Football League was dismissed for the lack of standard oppositions, critics will now have a fairer chance to evaluate the performance of Trevor James Morgans men.         
	To be honest, East Bengal, so far, have lived up to the expectations. Their passage to the semi-finals have been easily carved.         
	Though Churchill sport a new look this season, theres no reason to think that the Calcutta outfits job will be any easier. After all, the man named Odafe Okolie is still very much present in the Churchill ranks. The dangerous striker, who has been ruling Indian football for the past few seasons, possesses the skills and the power to sink any team.         
	In fact, whenever Odafe has failed to fire in the ongoing competition, Churchill havent been at all impressive.         
	Churchills other two foreigners  striker Koko Sakibo and Iranian Rohualla Saminia  will have to assist Odafe accordingly to ensure the Goan teams success.         
	Coming back to East Bengal, it will crucial for their defence to stand tall and deny Odafe. The likes of Uga Okpara will have to be on their toes, literally, to negate the Nigerians firepower.         
	That is because the other departments of the red and gold brigade are functioning at its best. The midfield managers  Penn Orji and Mehtab Hossain  have been perfect providers for the strikers.         
	Coach Morgan has said time and again that the success of his plans lies in the success of Penn. And Penn has seldom disappointed his coach.

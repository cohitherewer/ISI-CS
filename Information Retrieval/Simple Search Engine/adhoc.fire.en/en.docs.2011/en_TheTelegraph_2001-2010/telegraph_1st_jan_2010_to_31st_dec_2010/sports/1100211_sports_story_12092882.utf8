The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pastors advice for Tiger and Elin
                                                                                                                       7                                        Pastors advice for Tiger and Elin
  - Doubts persist on whether the world No. 1 golfer has returned home               Rachel Uchitel has landed a job with a TV channel                           
	New York: What Elin Nordegren discovered about her husband last year almost saw her pack up her bags and leave. Now, it seems that the Swedish former model wants to stay with Tiger Woods, give him one last chance.         
	That being the intention, Rev. Ricky Kirton, their wedding pastor, has advised the celebrity couple to find forgiveness as they go about putting their house back together. Kirton told an American magazine that he has faith that their union can be saved if the troubled pair forgive each other.         
	Kirton, who performed the marriage of Woods and Elin in the swanky Barbados Sandy Lane resort in 2004, believes the Woods can keep their family if they can find a little forgiveness.         
	Be there for each other, and it will work out, he said.         
	Being there, clearly, is the thing to do but in so far as that implies physical proximity, nothing can be said for sure at the moment as to whether the couple are staying under the same roof right now.         
	A celebrity news website doubts whether Woods is back home from sex rehab. Basing their report solely on a lack of sighting of Tiger in his den, the website says that its beginning to appear that Woods was not released from sex rehab, nor has he returned home to assist his wife with her chores.         
	Not that anyone expects the superstar golfer to jump into sporting limelight from the harsh media glare of a few weeks back. But that the world No.1 has not been properly seen ever since the skeletons came tumbling out of the closet seems to be giving open play to all kinds of rumours about his return.         
	In the past few days, Elin has been photographed picking her son, Charlie, up from school and carrying the boy and Sam, their daughter, in her arms. But the public has had no verifiable sighting of Woods since November 27, 2009, the day he had his infamous car crash.         
	There is controversy over the first photo said to be of Woods in sex rehab, with many believing that the photo was of someone else and not the golfer.         
	But Woods continues to remain in the news as do the several mistresses left in the wake of the sex scandal.         
	Rachel Uchitel, one of the earliest to be suspected of being a Woods mistress, has landed a TV job on Extra. Uchitel, who was interviewed by the shows Mario Lopez, will be reporting for Extra on nightlife hot spots.         
	She (Uchitel) so impressed producers that shes been offered a job as a special correspondent, a New York daily quoted a spokesperson as saying. Uchitel will not be discussing her affair with Woods but would be talking about her own life.         
	She wont talk about Tiger, but she talks about how she wants to find a husband and have kids, a show source said.         
	She only has a few real friends left whom she trusts. She is alone a lot and spends time with her two dogs. She seems very vulnerable, the source added. (AGENCIES)

	Cape Town: Spains golden generation face their sternest World Cup test against Portugal on Tuesday, with Cristiano Ronaldo standing in the way of a spot in the quarter finals.         
	The Iberian neighbours have limped into the last 16 scantly looking like the worlds second and third-ranked nations. But they know that one quality performance is all thats needed for an enviable quarter final against either Paraguay or Japan.         
	The match promises to be a tense battle among players who know each other well. Seven of the Portuguese play in Spains La Liga, including captain Ronaldo. And there are 14 holdovers from both squads that met six years ago in their last major encounter  a 1-0 win for Portugal that knocked Spain out of the 2004 European championship.         
	Its all for the winners and nothing for the losers now, Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz said. We are motivated and prepared to leave it all on the field.         
	Xabi Alonso is a doubt for Spain with a right ankle sprain, and 21-year-old midfielder Javi Martinez of Athletic Bilbao may take his place. Playmaker Cesc Fabregas and winger David Silva also are in the reckoning for Spain, who have yet to have a single player booked.         
	Portugal have seven players carrying yellow cards, including Ronaldo, but no suspensions. Midfielder Deco is likely to return from a right hip injury, but speedy forward Danny may be unavailable.         
	Spain entered the World Cup as a favourite, with Ronaldos Portugal not far behind. And in a topsy turvy World Cup, these two teams have made it to where they are supposed to be  despite early hiccups.         
	The Spaniards won their group after a shock opening loss to Switzerland, beating Honduras 2-0 and 10-man Chile 2-1; Portugal finished second in their group behind Brazil after their 7-0 thrashing of North Korea compensated for scoreless draws with the Ivory Coast, and a largely second-string Selecao.         
	Neither team has lived up to their hype, offering only fleeting moments of flair despite their talent.         
	Spain, the reigning European champions, dominate ball possession in a midfield run by Barcelona pair Xavi Hernandez and Andres Iniesta. Its the end product that has been lame, with Fernando Torres particularly wasteful in the group matches as he finds his way back from knee surgery.         
	Portugal, who had previously relied on the guile of Deco and star quality of Ronaldo, is a different team at this tournament.         
	Were playing Cristiano but also a great team, a generation of players that has played together for years, and one of the strongest rivals at this World Cup, Del Bosque said.         
	Portugal may be playing as more of a team, but it will still be Ronaldo that teammates will look to for inspiration. The match against Spain may be Ronaldos last chance to shine at this World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Steyn the strain for India
                                                                                                                       7                                        Steyn the strain for India
  - Dales four wickets leave visitors in trouble; Uncertainty over full days play on Day II, too                             A disappointed Indian top-order: Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman, after their dismissals, in Durban, on Sunday                            
	Durban: Dale Steyn produced another magnificent exhibition of fast bowling, on Sunday, to scythe through the Indian batting on the opening day of the second Test at Kingsmead.         
	The worlds top-ranked bowler followed his seven wickets in South Africas innings victory in the first Test with four for 36. At the close of a rain-interrupted day, India were 183 for six from 56 overs.         
	Bad light ended play just three overs after tea. And it would be a challenge for overnight batsmen, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (20 not out) and Harbhajan Singh (15 not out), to give the teams score a semblance of respectability.         
	Dhoni, who hasnt enjoyed much luck with the spin of coin, lost another toss as India were sent in, in conditions, which were absolutely conducive for seam bowling. It was raining till Sunday evening and unless the Rain God relents, there is uncertainty over a full days play on Monday.         
	After play had been delayed for an hour by drizzle and a damp outfield, Steyn obtained vicious late away movement to have both opening batsmen, Virender Sehwag (25) and Murali Vijay (19) caught behind the wicket.         
	Left-arm seamer Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who had struggled before lunch with two overs for 15 runs, returned after the break to take two for 15 in seven overs. He also pulled off a sensational catch at wide mid-on when he snapped up V.V.S. Laxmans well-struck pull off Steyn with his right hand.         
	Sehwag tried to drive a Steyn delivery that swung late but was anchored to the crease and edged the ball to second slip.         
	Vijay lived dangerously and he was dropped twice in the slip cordon off Steyn, with his score on three and 15.         
	The second miss did not matter, however, as Steyns next ball was a superb delivery that drew Vijay forward before jagging away late to find the edge and give wicketkeeper Mark Boucher a simple catch.         
	After lunch there was immediate success for the home side as Sachin Tendulkar (13) drove at a Tsotsobe delivery that was angled across him, edging a catch for Jacques Kallis at second slip.         
	Rahul Dravid and Laxman both showed their class in a 38-run partnership for the fourth wicket before Steyn produced a delivery that bounced more than Dravid expected. The veteran, who had scored 25, gloved a simple catch to Boucher.         
	Four overs later, Laxman pulled Steyn well, but Tsotsobe stuck out his right hand at wide mid-on and took an extraordinary catch as the ball raced past him. Laxman, who had top-scored with 38, was setting off to run and stood aghast with his hand on his side after realising he was out.         
	Cheteshwar Pujara (19) showed promise during his 54-minute stay at the wicket. He despatched Paul Harris for a cracking boundary and left any thing that teased him on off stump. Pujara even pulled a couple of short ones off Morkel to the fence. However with only three overs left for tea break, he succumbed to a sudden impetuosity.         
	India were then 130 for five when Pujara (19) top-edged a hook at Tsotsobe and Boucher back-pedalled to claim the skied catch.         
	Bad light ended play just three overs after tea. With all the top-order batsmen back in the hut, the onus will be on skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (20 not out) and Harbhajan Singh (15 not out) to give the teams score a semblance of respectability.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Robinho defends Dunga decision
                                                                                                                       7                                      Robinho defends Dunga decision
                      
	Curitiba: Brazil have begun training for the World Cup with most of their 23-man squad gathered in the southern city of Curitiba.         
	The five-time champions are the early favourites along with Spain to win the World Cup. All of Brazils players were on hand Friday, except for three who were to play for Inter Milan on Saturday in the Champions League final  goalkeeper Julio Cesar, winger Maicon and defender Lucio.         
	Brazil coach Dunga, whose side finished top of South American qualifying, is sure to come under pressure for dropping the likes of Ronaldinho, Adriano, Ronaldo and young star Neymar from his squad.         
	But he does seem to have the players on his side.         
	Dunga is an excellent coach and his coaching numbers reflect this, forward Robinho said. Under him we qualified with lots of room to spare.         
	As for the final 23, there will always be critics. It is impossible to satisfy everyone. But I think Brazil is equipped to win the title.         
	Two key players for Dunga, forward Luis Fabiano (Sevilla) and midfielder Kaka (Real Madrid), did not practice on Friday but are expected to participate next week. Both have been slowed by injuries.         
	Brazilian team medical chief Jose Luiz Runco said that the players injuries are improving well and in the time predicted. In Kakas case, there is nothing which is worrying us, he added.

                  Harbhajan Singh celebrates with teammates after dismissing Alviro Petersen                     
	Durban: The low-scoring second Test was tantalisingly poised after the third days play with South Africa needing 192 more runs to win and India also fancying their chances of a remarkable series-levelling victory here Tuesday.         
	Chasing a target of 303 after India scored 228 in their second innings, South Africa were 111 for three when bad light brought an early end to an eventful third days play which saw VVS Laxman miss his century by just four runs.         
	After three days of see-saw battle, the game is now heading for a nail-biting finish with both teams in a position to tilt the balance in its favour on a Kingsmead track which has shown signs of easing out.         
	With two full days left, Indias hopes of levelling the series will largely depend on how well pace spearhead Zaheer Khan and spinner Harbhajan Singh, the chief wreckers in South Africas first innings, bowl Wednesday.         
	The experienced Jacques Kallis (12) and AB de Villiers (17) were at the crease when stumps were drawn on the third day. South Africas push for taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series will largely depend on this pair.         
	If the second days play saw as many as 18 wickets fall, nine wickets tumbled on the third day to set the stage for an engrossing climax.         
	Laxmans sparkling 96 and his vital 70-run partnership with Zaheer for the eighth wicket was largely responsible for India to gain an overall lead of 302.         
	Earlier, resuming at the overnight score of 92 for four, Cheteshwar Pujara (10) was the first wicket to fall this morning when he failed to negotiate the extra bit of bounce from Morne Morkel and was bowled out.         
	Morne pitched the ball around off stump as Pujara looked to ride it, but it bounced higher than he expected and after hitting his bat, trickled on to the stumps.         
	Captain Dhoni, who joined the action after Pujaras dismissal, eased the pressure as he drove past Morkel for a boundary in the 34th over, before picking up two more fours off Dale Steyn at square leg and backward point in consecutive deliveries.

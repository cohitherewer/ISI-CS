            OUR STAFF REPORTERS            Sourav Ganguly was fined $40,000 for slow over-rate                           
	Calcutta: All attention is now focused on Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Gangulys right ankle.         
	The ankle in question got locked after Wednesdays Man of the Match award winning effort against the Delhi DareDevils at Eden Gardens.         
	The Knight Riders won by 15 runs to keep their semi-final hopes alive but in the process, Sourav and the team were fined for slow over-rate.         
	Sourav was in severe discomfort and pain till late on Wednesday night. He felt a bit better in the morning but did not travel with the team to Bangalore by the late afternoon flight.         
	Physio Andrew Leipus said an update will only be given after Sourav is assessed upon arrival in Bangalore on Friday morning. However, he added: Sourav is walking, which is a good sign.         
	It will be interesting to see who leads the Knight Riders in case Sourav is ruled out and Murali Kartik, the unofficial vice-captain, doesnt recover from his injury or fails to make the XI for Saturdays crucial match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore.         
	Wednesday nights euphoria, however, appeared to have come at a price once it was announced that Sourav was fined $40,000 for his team maintaining a slow over-rate against the DareDevils.         
	At the end of the match, the Knights were assessed to be two overs behind the required rate after allowances were taken into consideration.         
	It was the Knights second over-rate offence this season. Each player in the KKR XI was also fined $10,000.         
	Sourav could be banned for a match if the team is found guilty of a third offence.         
	The IPL organisers have been very strict about over-rates during this edition of Indian Premier League.         
	Kings XI Punjab Kumar Sangakkara was banned for a match and had to pay a hefty penalty of $ 50,000 when he committed the offence for the third time earlier during the tournament.         
	Sangakkara was handed out the punishment after his teams 39-run defeat against the Kolkata Knight Riders in Mohali.         
	Mumbai Indians captain Sachin Tendulkar and Delhi DareDevils skipper Gautam Gambhir were also fined as their respective teams failed to complete the overs in stipulated time.         
	Meanwhile, Shah Rukh Khan tweeted his praise for the players. The principal owner and Juhi Chawla werent around to cheer the team as the latters brother, who is a close business associate of Shah Rukh, is very ill.         
	Bobby my friend is stable...the KKR boys did awesome. Actually its all about who wants to win more on the day, Shah Rukh wrote on Twitter.         
	I pray amp; hope KKR keep winning the next few days. We can fight life only with belief in positivity, the Kolkata Knight Riders principal owner added.

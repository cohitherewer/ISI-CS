            A STAFF REPORTER            East Bengals Ekene Ikenwa and Penn Orji celebrate a goal, during a CFL match, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: The East Bengal juggernaut continues to roll as the red and gold Brigade won their seventh CFL premier division match on the trot, and their 12th this season, on Saturday.         
	Flooring a hapless Eastern Railway 6-0, Trevor Morgans men notched up their biggest win this year, thanks to Ekene Ikenwas four goals and a brace from Penn Orji.         
	East Bengal took lead four minutes into the match when Ikenwa tapped in Robin Singhs pass from the right.         
	Ikenwa scored his second goal in the 35th minute, which he considered the best of the lot. The East Bengal striker cut inside from the left, dodging rival defender Dipankar Ghosh and unleashed a powerful right-footer into the rival net.         
	The Nigerian came close to notching up his third in the 42nd minute, but failed to control the ball on the turn. But Ikenwas hattrick goal eventually came four minutes later when he headed home to glory.         
	In the 78th minute, Dipankar Ghosh pulled down Penn inside the box and referee Rathin Mukherjee had no hesitation in awarding East Bengal a penalty. Ikenwa did the job from the spot.         
	Penn netted the fifth goal for his side. Sanju Pradhan, who replaced Reisangmi Vasum after half-time, delivered a neat cross from right and Penn slotted it perfectly through the far post.         
	He scored his second in the extra time, dribbling past Eastern Railways Santanu Bit and placing the ball coolly past rival custodian Tapan Karmakar.         
	East Bengal coach Trevor Morgan looked pleased, but said his team could have done better. We had a lot of chances today (Saturday) and all of them fortunately went to Ikenwa and he scored. But hes probably disappointed that he didnt score more, Morgan said.

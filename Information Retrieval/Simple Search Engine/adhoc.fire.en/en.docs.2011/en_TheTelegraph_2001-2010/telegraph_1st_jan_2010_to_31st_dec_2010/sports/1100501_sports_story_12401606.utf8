The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warner is happy with Aussie preparations
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warner is happy with Aussie preparations
                                  David Warner        
	London: David Warner believes that Australia possess the necessary resources to win the World Twenty20 title in the West Indies.         
	Despite his team suffering a shock defeat at the hands of Zimbabwe in one of the warm-up games leading to the T20 tournament, the Australian said that he was happy to have got some runs under his belt.         
	Its been a good lead-up for myself with a couple of half-centuries in the games just gone.         
	I dont want to waste my runs in the warm-ups, but its always good to get them under the belt, and I hope to put in a good performance on Sunday, Warner told a cricket website.         
	As a team, we are aware of our shortcomings in Twenty20s, but weve played a lot in Australian cricket in the last couple of years, and we know weve got the resources to take it on this year and win.         
	He also refused to read too much into the warm-up defeat. Twenty20 is a funny game. Anyone on their day can come out on song and roll a few teams over, or be a superstar with the bat.         
	Were looking forward to the contest, weve got the depth in bowling and batting to take on any side in this tournament, and we hope to do that, the explosive batsman said.         
	We didnt bowl too well that day and they got away from us, but we played positive cricket right up to the end.         
	The pitches have been pretty slow and low, and weve been playing on big grounds with a lot of wind around, so weve been running a lot of twos and threes which is a bit different for Twenty20 cricket, he added.         
	Personally, Ive learned that time at the crease is vital. With wickets in hand at the end, you can have an onslaught for the last five or six overs.         
	My game is not just to bat in the top six overs, its to bat through and maintain my momentum through the innings, Warner said.           (AGENCIES)

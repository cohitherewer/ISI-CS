	Mumbai: Air India moved into the relegation zone when JCT defeated the Mumbai outfit 1-0 in a 23rd round I-League clash at the Cooperage on Thursday.         
	Emmanuel Okoro scored the winner in the 66th minute when he sneaked his way past Peter Odafe and Uttam Singh and found the net with a crisp left-footer.         
	The victory took JCTs tally to 31 points helping them retain their seventh place in the I-League table. On the other hand, the loss meant Air India are now in the drop zone with 25 points from 23 matches.

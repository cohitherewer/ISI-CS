                                                                                                                       7                                      A break for Akram
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Kolkata Knight Riders consultant Wasim Akram left for home on Monday to spend a few days with his sons, Taimur and Akbar. Akrams wife, Huma, passed away last year.         
	According to the team management, the former Pakistan captain will be back before the Knight Riders next match. Sourav Gangulys men next take on Kings XI Punjab in Mohali on Saturday.         
	As the Mumbai Indians batsmen punished the KKR bowlers at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, Akrams absence was badly felt.

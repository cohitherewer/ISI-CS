The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Well play for pride: Raman
                                                                                                                       7                                      Well play for pride: Raman
            OUR BUREAU                       
	Calcutta/New Delhi: If Bengal had come to Delhi hoping to bolster their chances for a Ranji knockout berth, they were struggling to avoid an innings defeat against Railways, thanks to some mindless batting display on the penultimate day.         
	At 105 for six in their second innings, Friday, the visitors were groping to save the match still 39 runs adrift from the 144-run first innings deficit.         
	As if their poor show with the bat was not enough, two Bengal players  Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Dibyendu Chakrabarty  were reprimanded by match referee Gursharan Singh for Level One offence.         
	While Shukla was guilty of excessive celebration after he had Murali Kartik caught by Anustup Majumdar in the Railways first innings, Chakrabarty earned the match referees wrath for showing dissent after being declared caught at slip.         
	Both players were summoned by the match referee and were verbally reprimanded. The Bengal team management, however, felt Chakrabartys dismissal was debatable, as the ball had hit his shoulder before it carried to Bangar.         
	When asked to analyse what went wrong with Bengal, coach W.V. Raman said his team had lost the initiative on the first day. They (Railways) went ahead and we had to take the back seat, Raman said.         
	However, the Bengal coach said his boys would play for pride to stave off defeat on the final day. Well play for pride. Well try to make best use of the situation, Raman said.         
	Bengal, who had Sourav Ganguly in their ranks, would have liked the former India skipper to fire. But Sourav got out measly in both innings.         
	Asked if he was expecting Sourav to play a longer innings, Raman said: These type of things do happen in cricket. You cannot say for sure what will happen in a match but do remember, we have four more wickets in hand.         
	Railways captain Sanjay Bangar said they would look for an outright win.         
	My boys are deserving winners. They played good cricket from the first day. There is nothing wrong with the wicket those who got out cheaply had their own problems.

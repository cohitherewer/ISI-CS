	Shanghai: World No. 3 Roger Federer beat Novak Djokovic 7-5, 6-4, on Saturday, to set up a Shanghai Masters final against a resurgent Andy Murray.         
	Serbian second seed Djokovic had hoped to secure his second title of the week after winning the China Open, on Monday, but squandered four break points in the first set against the Swiss.         
	Federer, 29, has faced Murray twice this year, beating him in the final of the Australian Open but losing out to the Briton for the Toronto Masters title in August.         
	In mens doubles, Leander Paes and Jurgen Melzer snapped Mike and Bob Bryans 20-match winning streak with a 7-5, 6-1 win over the Americans to make it to the summit clash.         
	The Bryan brothers were aiming to win their fifth successive tour-level title, following triumphs in Toronto, Cincinnati, the US Open and Beijing. It is only their second defeat since reaching the Wimbledon quarter finals in July.         
	Third seeds Paes and Melzer will fight it out with sixth seed Polish pair of Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski, who beat compatriot Lukasz Kobot and Austrias Oliver Marach 7-6(7), 1-6, 10-6 in their semi-final.         
	Paes and Melzer had defeated Indias Rohan Bopanna and Pakistani Aisam-ul-Qureshi 6-7(6), 7-6(6), 10-4 in the quarter-finals.         
	Indias Mahesh Bhupathi was also in contention along with his Belarussian partner Max Mirnyi but the fifth seeded pair lost 4-6, 6-3, 6-10 to Kubot and Marach.         
	Federer broke twice more in the second set to seal the match, his 11th victory over Djokovic in 17 meetings. I think the first set could have gone either way today, Federer said.         
	It was really an open battle. I got the better of him at the end of the first set. I think for 10 minutes he was a bit out of it and I was able to take advantage of that, he added.         
	Djokovic, who had been attempting to capture back-to-back titles in China after winning last week in Beijing, said that losing the first break was the key to the match.         
	The start of the second set, I lost my focus a little bit, my energy dropped, he said. Yeah, in a blink of the eye, I was two breaks down at 4-1.         
	Meanwhile, after his 6-4, 6-1 semi final win over Argentine Juan Monaco, Murray said, I do really enjoy playing Roger and wouldnt mind playing him (again). Its a great experience every time.         
	When I played him in the Toronto final, I was a lot more aggressive and didnt give him many chances to dictate the points, especially on my serve. Thats something that I need to do against him if I want to beat him, he added.         
	Murray, recovered from a recent illness, has yet drop a set in the tournament.         
	Several times, he drew Monaco to the net before launching booming backhands or lobs towards the exposed baseline, even breaking his racket strings after one return to foil the stunned Argentine

  -Tiger Woods is at tied 40th after Round II

	Elmont: With his strength and tournament lead both slipping away, Matt Kuchar turned things around on the inward nine Friday, birdieing four of the last eight holes to retain a share of the lead with a one-over-par 72 in the second round of the BMW Championship.         
	Kuchar, who has an illness but is uncertain whether it was caused by a viral or bacterial infection, took antibiotics prescribed by a local physician. He struggled at the outset, making five bogeys and a birdie through 10 holes at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club, before his closing kick tied Charlie Wi (69) atop the leader board at six-under 136.         
	Its probably the worst feeling Ive had out here, Kuchar said.         
	One round that exceeded respectable by a wide margin was a 65 shot by the Australian Marc Leishman, who moved within a stroke of the lead at 137 after starting the day eight strokes behind. Tied for fourth at four under were the Britons Ian Poulter (72), Paul Casey (69) and Luke Donald (70), the South African Retief Goosen (71) and the American Dustin Johnson (70).         
	In all, 22 players broke par on a course made hazardous by a breeze, difficult hole locations and bumpy greens.         
	Tiger Woods moved up five spots into a tie for 40th with a round of 72, but in order to get into the top 30  and the Tour Championship in two weeks  he needs to finish in the top three, according to the current playoff point projections.         
	Leishman loves Cog Hill, and with good reason. His round was the best of the day by three strokes, and he tied for second here last year, his best PGA Tour finish.         
	But his affection for Cog Hill  a public-access course that was redesigned at a cost of $6 million two years ago in a so-far unsuccessful effort to lure a major championship  has not been widely shared by many of his colleagues. Some have been quite vocal in their criticism.           NYT NEWS SERVICE

	Kingston: Jamaica and West Indies cricketer Jerome Taylor has been charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest after a confrontation with officers in a bar he was drinking at, police said on Thursday.         
	Taylor, 25, was released on bond on Thursday following the incident late on Wednesday at Junction, St Elizabeth, a rural town southwest of the Jamaican capital of Kingston.         
	The fast bowler, who returned from the West Indies recent Test tour of Australia after suffering back strain, is due in court on January 12. He was also charged with improper conduct. If convicted of any of the charges, Taylor could be fined or spend up to six months in prison.         
	Police said Taylor was drinking in the bar late on Wednesday when officers went in to order closure after the operator had gone past the legal closing time. Taylor tried to prevent them from closing it and verbally abused them, police said.         
	Taylor, a native of St Elizabeth, has taken 82 wickets from 29 Test matches for the West Indies. (REUTERS)

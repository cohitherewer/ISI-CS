            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Calcutta: Noted adventurer Mike Horn, a South African who has settled in Switzerland, gave the Indian cricketers a pep talk over dinner on Friday.         
	According to The Telegraphs sources, the 43-year-old Horn came on an invitation from coach Gary Kirsten and with the approval of the Board of Control for Cricket in India.         
	Horn was amazing... The way he spoke about confidence and the way the mind functions was incredible... It was quite an experience, one of the sources pointed out.         
	Among other achievements, Horn has travelled around the world alone (in 17 months), without motorised transport, and completed the circumnavigation of the Arctic Circle with nobody for company.

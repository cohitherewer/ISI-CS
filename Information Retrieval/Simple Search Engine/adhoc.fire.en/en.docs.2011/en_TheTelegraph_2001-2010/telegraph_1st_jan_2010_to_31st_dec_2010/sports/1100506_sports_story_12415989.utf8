	Ipoh: Defending champions India would be looking to fight off the mostly new-look squads of the other contenders and clinch a fifth Sultan Azlan Shah title when one of Asias premier hockey meets gets under way on Thursday.         
	India play China in their campaign opener on Thursday and clash with traditional rivals Pakistan a day later on Friday. But there are bigger threats looming ahead. India will have to find an answer for the superior style of world champions Australia and Asian champions South Korea.         
	The Indian squad is well balanced with Sreejesh and Bharat Chetri guarding the goal. The deep defence is in the hands of Dhananjay Mahadik, Bharat Chikara and two rookie drag-flickers  18-year old Amit Prabhakar and Rupinder Pal Singh  while the versatile Sardara Singh is expected to bring stability in his dual roles of defender and playmaker.         
	The midfield welcomes back Ravi Pal Singh and former skipper Prabodh Tirkey. They will join Gurbaj Singh, Arjun Halappa, Vikas Pillay and Danish Mujtaba as India look for a repeat of last years show. The attack will be spearheaded by captain Rajpal Singh with Shivendra Singh, Mandeep Antil, Tushar Khandker and Sarvanjit Singh.

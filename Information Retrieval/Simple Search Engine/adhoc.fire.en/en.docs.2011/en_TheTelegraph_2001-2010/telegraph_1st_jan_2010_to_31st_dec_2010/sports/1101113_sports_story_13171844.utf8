  - Tim shares 147-run partnership with martin guptill
            SUDIPTO GUPTA            Tim McIntosh celebrates his century, in Hyderabad, on Friday. (AFP)                           
	Hyderabad: Expecting New Zealand to excel against Mahendra Singh Dhonis men, at their own den, was like expecting someone with a learners license to give Michael Schumacher a run for his money.         
	Yet, so far in the three-Test series, Daniel Vettoris ordinary (the common perception) side have drove with the elegance of a Rolls Royce. Not only have they countered the bumps laid on their path by the Indians, but also, at times, their counterattack have pushed the No. 1 Test side off the track.         
	At the close of first days play of the second Test, in Hyderabad, the newest Test venue, the Black Caps left the field with their head held high. And why not? With 258 for four on the board, they were the deserving lords on Day I. While Jesse Ryder was batting on 22, Gareth Hopkins was yet to open his account.         
	However, the men who put New Zealand on the driving seat were least expected to put up such a sterling show.         
	Tim McIntosh and Martin Guptill combined to erect a much-needed partnership and sparkled individually as well. While McIntoshs lean form had critics gunning for his head, Guptill was making a comeback to the side. The duos 147-run second wicket stand ironed out the day for the visitors while providing Dhoni with plenty of fodder to ponder about.         
	McIntoshs journey from a pair in Ahmedabad to a hundred in Hyderabad was terminated for his own fault when he failed to move his feet while attempting a drive off Zaheer Khan, with the inside edge crashing on to the stumps. But it was not before he had spent 376 minutes at the crease and negotiated 254 balls registering his second Test century.         
	Exercising caution early on, the left-handed opener grew in confidence with the day as he choreographed his steps to perfection to counter the spinners. On one such occasion, he charged down the track to loft Pragyan Ojha over mid-wicket for his only six.         
	Guptill, on the other hand, was living a charmed life. First he was out off a Sreesanth no ball and was called back at a time when the dressing room was nearer to him than the 22-yard strip. Then Dhoni failed to latch on to tough chance off Harbhajan Singh. Perhaps bolstered by the dose of good luck, Guptill unleashed an array of strokes which included some fabulous drives. He missed a three-figure score when he was trapped by Ojha on 85.         
	At the onset of the day, Sreesanth unearthed whatever trifle there was in the track for the bowlers and triggered deliveries loaded with disturbing bounce and destructive swing.         
	The speedsters eagerness and accuracy to land the ball on the seam, just short of good length, made the New Zealand batsmen search for the edge time and again.         
	Brendom McCullum was Sreesanths first success after repeated forays into the batsmens yard.         
	The Black Caps opener was forced to poke at a delivery that pitched on the off-stump, held its line and climbed up awkwardly.         
	And when it appeared that Sreesanth had gobbled up Guptill, in the eighth over of the day, with another of his probing deliveries, destiny deprived him.         
	As Dhoni celebrated pouching Guptills edge and Sreesanth was busy relishing the accolades of teammates, umpire Kumar Dharmasena consulted the third umpire on the legitimacy of the delivery. With replays showing that the pacer had crossed the line of control, Dharmasena stretched his hand to signal a no ball and called back Guptill to resume his innings.         
	The Indians finally collected some points in their kitty when two important New Zealand wickets  McIntosh and Ross Taylor (24)  fell in the last half of the day. But then, it was more of the visitors self-imposed failure than the hosts hard-earned triumph.         
	The days play invited some questions for Dhoni and Co. What is the difference between Harbhajan Singh/Pragyan Ojha and a Jeetan Patel (quality being the criteria)? What was the logic behind cutting down the budget for close-in fielders when the spinners were operating? And most importantly, what is the secret of such unique performance against the No. 8 side of the world?         
	Well, the Black Caps may possess a learners license as far as Test cricket is concerned. But on the road of life, it is the blare of horns that keep you awake. With a tough tour to South Africa up next, hope Dhoni wouldnt treat this as noise pollution!

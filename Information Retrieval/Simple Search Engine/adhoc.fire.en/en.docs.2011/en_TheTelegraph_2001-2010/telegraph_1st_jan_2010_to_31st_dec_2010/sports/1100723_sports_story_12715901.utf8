  - Ibobi Singh likely to meet M.S. Gill and discuss the imbroglio today       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT            M.K. Kaushik                                 
	New Delhi: The alleged sexual harassment issue involving Manipur woman hockey player Ranjitha Devi and coach M.K. Kaushik has taken political overtones. Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh is likely to meet the union sports minister M.S. Gill to discuss this matter.         
	The Manipur chief minister is coming to Delhi today for the National Development Council meeting, but he may also speak about the problems faced by the woman player from the state, depending upon the outcome of the report from the four-member committee, said a source from the government of Manipur.         
	The source also confirmed that the chief minister is likely to meet the union sports minister, along with the Manipur Olympic Association (MOA) president Bijoy Koijam, who is already camping in the capital.         
	On Tuesday, Hockey India (HI) announced the formation of a four-member committee after Ranjitha Devi, a national-level player from Manipur, lodged a written complaint saying that the long-time national coach had asked her for sexual favours and repeatedly used abusive language against her.         
	Ranjithas allegations have been backed by 30 other women from the team, who also signed a letter in support of their teammate.         
	Kaushik, who has written to the enquiry committee on Thursday, however, maintained he was framed by a group of players and officials from the team. Ranjitha also narrated her side of the story in a written report to the committee.         
	I cant belive someone can stoop so low. The allegation was brought because I did not select her. I always select a player based on his or her performance, the venerable coach had told the newspersons, on Wednesday.         
	The Indian hockey fraternity, on the other hand, remained divided on this issue. While former players like M. M. Somayya, Joaquim Carvalho and Mir Ranjan Negi were reluctant to believe the allegations, former India captain Helen Mary and Dronacharya awardee coach Baldev Singh felt Kaushik should have been brought to book long ago.         
	The conduct of some of the enquiry committee members soon after they spoke to Kaushik and Ranjitha Devi also came under criticism.         
	It was not right on the part of Zafar Izbal (a committee member) to openly lend his support to Kaushik, said a HI official. It definitely sent a wrong signal to everyone associated with the game.         
	The official also hinted that a couple of members in the enquiry committee felt that a bigger probe was needed to unearth the truth.         
	The allegations are huge and have been supported by the entire team. We hope the sports ministry takes the right steps in this matter, the official said.

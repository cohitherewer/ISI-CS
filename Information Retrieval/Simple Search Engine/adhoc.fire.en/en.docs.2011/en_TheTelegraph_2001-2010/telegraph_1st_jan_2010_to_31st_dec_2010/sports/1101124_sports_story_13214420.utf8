The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Top-class win for No. 1 side
                                                                                                                       7                                      Top-class win for No. 1 side
            INDRANIL MAJUMDAR                      
	Nagpur: Twenty eight minutes past noon, when Ishant Sharma knocked off Chris Martins stumps and burst into a celebratory jig, it signalled the end of New Zealands feeble resistance. There werent any wild celebrations, though, only an I told you so look on the face of the Indian players.         
	No one predicted such an early end. By Mahendra Singh Dhonis own admission, a finish little late into the fourth day was expected. But as the Indian spinners got into their rhythm from the third over of the day, courtesy a couple of umpiring howlers, the visitors application and the will to fight vanished into thin air.         
	Pragyan Ojha (2/67) began the slide with Harbhajan Singh (3/56) and Suresh Raina (2/1) joining in, and it was left to Ishant (3/15) to polish off the tail. It was like bowling in familiar territory for the spinners, for the only time in the Airtel Cup, and they didnt disappoint.         
	The match was as good as over in the first session as seven wickets tumbled for the addition of 116 runs. The innings and 198-run victory reaffirmed Indias status as the No.1 side and they will go to South Africa with an enviable record of having not lost any of their last nine series.         
	What is it that makes Dhonis team so successful? Besides cricketing skills and experience, it is of course the rejoicing in a teammates accomplishments, the relishing of achievement as a shared thing and backing each other to be triumphant.         
	A perfect gift to Gary Kirsten on his 43rd birthday, whose untiring efforts and backroom work has also played a significant role in this success story.         
	New Zealands batsmen adopted the wrong tactics of trying to get the fielders out of the face by being aggressive. What they had not budgeted for was the bounce and turn on the wicket and the bowlers persistent probing line and accuracy.         
	Brendon McCullum was the first to pay the price as he played back to a straighter from Ojha and was plumb in front. Then came the first of the blunders as Martin Guptill was given out leg before by Simon Taufell to one from the left-arm spinner that pitched outside the leg stump.         
	Ross Taylor rode his luck, surviving a plumb leg before decision as he missed a sweep, and then was wrongly given out caught when the ball had only come off the pads. The batsman was so amused by Nigel Longs decision that he almost laughed all the way back to the pavilion.         
	The calls for the introduction of the Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS) will only intensify as such umpiring errors can also turn out to be Indias nemesis. Perhaps it is time for the Indians to take a fresh look at their reluctance to use the UDRS.         
	New Zealand, however, will struggle to find a scapegoat in their defeat. Their batsmen batted poorly, never showing the zeal to survive with poor shot selection in both the innings.         
	Gareth Hopkins could hardly do much as Gautam Gambhir pulled off a stunner at forward short leg, two balls after he was hit by a full-blooded sweep from Taylor. The nightwatchman was looking to drive, and as he got an inside edge onto the pads, the ball popped up to the right of Gambhir, who stretched and latched it with one hand.         
	Jesse Ryder, who came in with a runner, was the only one who looked in control, reading the spinners flight and variation in pace perfectly. Never for a moment was he unnerved by the regular fall of wickets around him. The introduction of Raina encouraged him to take some leeway, and that undid all the good work as he holed out to mid off.         
	The alarm bells were ringing as Dhoni and Co. sniffed victory. Tim Southees late cameo wasnt of any help as the innings folded up in only 227 minutes.         
	New Zealand can take some solace from the fact that they werent whitewashed and were successful in pushing the Indians to the hilt.

	Port of Spain: Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Narsingh Deonarine hit contrasting half-centuries to lift the West Indies to 252 for six in the fifth and final one-day International against South Africa at the Queens Park Oval.         
	Chanderpaul top-scored with 67 of 103 balls while fellow Guyanese left-hander Deonarine struck a run-a-ball 53 not out.         
	Left-arm seamer Lonwabo Tsotsobe claimed two for 31 to lead the South African attack while left-arm spinner Roelof van der Merwe took one for 27 from 10 miserly overs.         
	The West Indies, who were looking to avoid a whitewash in the series, chose to bat after winning the toss but lost openers Dale Richards (19) and captain Chris Gayle (12) as they slipped to 45 for two in the 11th over.         
	Richards struck two fours and a six before edging a catch to slip off Tsotsobe, and Gayle followed when he dragged a pull at Ryan McLaren to mid-on.         
	Chanderpaul shared restorative stands with the Bravo brothers, Darren and Dwayne.         
	The experienced left-hander put on 51 off 83 balls with left-hander Darren, then 41 off 58 deliveries with Dwayne.         
	Darren Bravo laboured to 17 off 47 balls before he lofted Van der Merwe to extra cover where wicket-keeper Mark Boucher leapt and took a magnificent catch.         
	The West Indies made 82 runs off the final eight overs.           (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Afridi says sorry
                                                                                                                       7                                      Afridi says sorry
                      
	London: The captain of Pakistans limited-overs teams, Shahid Afridi, has apologised to fans for the controversy that erupted after three of his teammates were suspended on suspicion of fixing.         
	Afridi said Saturday that the players in the squad for the remaining two Twenty20 and five one-dayers against England were upset by the allegations, which the International Cricket Council (ICC) has called the most serious to hit the sport for a decade.         
	On behalf of these boys  I know theyre not in this series  I want to say sorry to all cricket lovers and all cricketing nations, Afridi said.         
	Crickets ruling body suspended Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer this week while it investigates them for various offences under the sports anti-corruption code.         
	The ICC has not detailed the charges, which followed accusations by a British tabloid that a middleman accepted payment in exchange for deliberate no-balls against England last week.         
	Its very bad news, Afridi said ahead of Sundays first Twenty20 in Cardiff. Its a big challenge for me as captain but were all ready. The coach and I are not talking about the issue  we are here to play cricket.         
	The trio were released without criminal charge after being questioned by London police on Friday but could be banned from cricket for life if found guilty.         
	The Pakistan Cricket Boards legal adviser said Saturday that Butt, Aamer and Asif have denied knowledge of any alleged wrongdoing by the middleman, agent Mazhar Majeed.         
	The players have informed the police that the man was their agent, but they had no knowledge about his alleged wrongdoing, Tafazzul Rizvi told private television channels in Pakistan.         
	British tabloid News of the World has accused Majeed of acting as a middleman, accepting money in exchange for getting Asif and Aamer to bowl intentional no-balls.         
	Players and officials are waiting to see if the tabloid follows its initial report.         
	Ive told the boys, dont read the newspapers, Afridi said.         
	After winning the four-match Test series 3-1, England are also trying to focus on the matches ahead.         
	Its going to be interesting to see what happens, batsman Paul Collingwood said. Thats out of our hands as players. Weve just got to mentally prepare ourselves to play tomorrow (Sunday).         
	ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said Friday the allegations that Asif, Aamer and Butt conspired with bookmakers was the most serious case of corruption since South Africa captain Hansie Cronje was banned for life 10 years ago.         
	Cronje admitted to forecasting results in exchange for money from a London bookmaker, prompting the ICC to create its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU).         
	But the fallout from the case is spreading, with Pakistans top diplomat in Britain accusing the ICC of bias and banning the players only to cover up shortcomings in its own procedures.

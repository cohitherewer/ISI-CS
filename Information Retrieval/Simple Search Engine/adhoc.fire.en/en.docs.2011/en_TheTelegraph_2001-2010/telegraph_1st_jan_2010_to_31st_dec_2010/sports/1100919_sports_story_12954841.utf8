The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warriors remain unbeaten
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warriors remain unbeaten
                      
	Port Elizabeth: Openers Davey Jacobs and Ashwell Prince shared a 147-run partnership off just 94 ball to help Warriors beat Central Districts by six wickets in their Champions League Twenty20 Group A match here, Saturday.         
	After Central Districts opted to bat, Warriors restricted them to 175 for three in 20 overs and then chased down the target with five balls to spare at the St Georges Park.         
	Skipper Jacobs (74) and Prince (64) laid the foundation for Warriors successful run-chase.         
	With three wins in as many matches, Warriors have now virtually progressed to the semi-final, while Central Districts, who have failed to win even a single match in the tournament, have been eliminated from the race for a final-four berth.         
	Chasing 175, Warriors started aggressively and reached the 50 run-mark in just five overs, with Jacobs and Prince smashing the Districts bowlers.           (PTI)

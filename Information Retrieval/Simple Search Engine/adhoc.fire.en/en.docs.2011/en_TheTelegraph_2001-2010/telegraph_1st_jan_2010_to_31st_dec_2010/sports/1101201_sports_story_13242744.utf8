The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chirag United go past Kalighat
                                                                                                                       7                                        Chirag United go past Kalighat
            A STAFF REPORTER    
	Calcutta: Chirag United have been the most underestimated side this season. And that is because they have been patchy inspite of boasting of one of the most talented squads.         
	On Tuesday they were once again in their on-off mode as they earned a 3-1 victory over Kalighat Club, in a Calcutta Football League Premier Division tie, at the Salt Lake Stadium.         
	With the title already in East Bengals pocket, the win will only help the men in purple to be in the right rhythm before they begin their I-League campaign, against the AIFF XI, on Friday.         
	With plenty of talented footballers on the ground, and on the reserve bench as well, Chirag should have done better than accumulating just 28 points from their 15 matches in the CFL so far.         
	That theres no dearth of potential was evident from their Durand Cup triumph where they got the better of teams from all over the country.         
	Against Kalighat, Chirag began the match brightly as the Subrata Bhattacharya-coached team controlled the proceedings with better possession.         
	Their persistent attacks materialised when Junior Elijah found the net in the 32nd minute. His strike partner Joshimar set it up nicely for him off a Lalkamal Bhowmick free-kick.         
	Chirag pumped in two more in quick succession after the breather. First it was Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, in the 47th minute, who tapped it in from close with Lalkamal once again being the provider.         
	Two minutes later, Jerry Zirsanga outpaced the rival defenders with a 30-yard run down the left-edge of the box before putting it past an advancing Kalighat keeper.         
	But Chirags zeal vanished after they went 3-0 up. Kalighat clawed back and pulled one back in the 60th minute when Prasenjit Das took an excellent diagonal shot to beat Chirag keeper Somnath Khara.         
	Buoyed by the goal, Kalighat thereafter displayed a better brand of football as Chirag were left to defend for most of the remaining time.         
	Teams

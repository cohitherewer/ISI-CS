            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Deposed Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) president K.P.S. Gill is likely to attend the Hockey India (HI) elections on February 7 as the representative of the Delhi state body.         
	Gill, who headed the Indian Hockey Federation for 15 years before the body was dissolved in 2008 by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) for Indias failure to qualify for the Beijing Olympics, has been named member in the newly-formed Hockey Delhi (HD), which was Monday granted affiliation by HI.         
	We are not sure whether Delhi would send Gill to cast their vote in the elections.         
	But his name figures in Delhis managing committee, said a HI official.         
	Gill represented Himachal Pradesh in the erstwhile IHF.         
	Announcing the date for the much-awaited elections, HI president A.K. Mattoo said the Punjab state body, too had been granted affiliation.

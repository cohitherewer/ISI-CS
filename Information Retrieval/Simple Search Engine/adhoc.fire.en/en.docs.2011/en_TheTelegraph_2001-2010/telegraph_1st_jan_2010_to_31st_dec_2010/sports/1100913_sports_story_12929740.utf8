	Calcutta: If you treat gravy as a beverage, you cannot hope for a satisfying burp. Mohun Bagan, too, got their recipe wrong as Chirag United stole a point from under their nose in a CFL Premier Division match, at the Salt Lake Stadium, on Sunday.         
	The 2-2 result was a summary of Bagans miscalculations and Chirags resilience. While one team were busy creating chances and floundering them, the other kept coming back with renewed gusto.         
	Add to that Bagan coach Stanley Rozarios strange ploy of using Snehasish Chakraborty as a left back. According to the coach, the idea was to use the speedy wingers overlaps during counter attacks. Snehasishs runs, coupled with Ishfaq Ahmeds sudden bursts, could have worked wonders for Bagan. Unfortunately, wonders are a rarity these days.         
	Lady luck, too, dumped Bagan on the day. First, Edeh Chidi messed up a spot kick in the 33rd minute. And then, a knee injury at the stroke of half-time robbed Bagan of Chidis services. Rozario responded to the crisis by shifting Jose Barreto upfront from the midfield. That effectively brought curtains to Bagans midfield moves and good passes seemed a lottery for the strikers.         
	Bagan, however, had got the opening notes right when Murithala Ali stole the lead as early as the seventh minute, capitalising on some woeful defending by Chirag. After failing in his first attempt to strike off a Edeh Chidi header, Murithala placed it neatly on his second chance as the defenders failed to clear the ball.         
	The joy was shortlived though as a brilliant side volley from Chirags under-19 winger Munna Mallick restored parity a couple of minutes later.         
	Two more goals were scored, both in the second half, one each by either side. First it was Bagans man for all seasons, Jose Barreto, whose clinical header in the 59th minute made it 2-1. Then Chirags Denson Devadas responded in a similar fashion, in the 67th minute, nodding in the equaliser.         
	Both the teams found the woodwork on a few occasions. But most of them were accidental, and not deliberate ones.         
	However, Man of the Match Munna deserves a special mention. The youngster looked promising with his speed and ball control. Possessing the right mixture of energy and skills, he can turn out to be Chirag coach Subrata Bhattacharyas ace in the long run.

	New Delhi: Local favourite Shiv Kapur had to be content with the second place in the SAIL Open as Swede rookie Richard Karlberg blasted a sizzling six-under 66 for a sensational wire-to-wire victory in the $300,000 Asian Tour golf tournament here on Friday.         
	Kapur and Karlberg went into the final round with identical 14-under 202 but the Swede, an India first-timer, rode on a blistering front nine to blast six-under 66 and run away with the title with an aggregate of 20-under 268.         
	Kapur signed off with a modest one-under 71 to aggregate 15-under 273 as his second Asian Tour title remained out of bounds.         
	Pre-tournament favourite Jyoti Randhawa (274) turned in his third successive round of four-under 68 to finish third, two strokes ahead of Calcutta pro S.S.P. Chowrasia (68).         
	Local lad Shamim Khan (278) went one-over 73 to finish fifth, one stroke ahead of compatriot and rising star Gaganjeet Bhullar who carded 71.         
	Unheralded Sanjay Kumar (282) turned in a stunning six-under 66 to finish seventh, two strokes ahead of Rahil Gangjee (284), who carded 70. (PTI)

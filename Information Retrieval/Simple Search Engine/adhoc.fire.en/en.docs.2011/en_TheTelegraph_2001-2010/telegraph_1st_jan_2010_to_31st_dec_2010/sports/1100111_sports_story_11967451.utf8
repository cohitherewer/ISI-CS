	Guwahati: Chetan Anand and Trupti Murugunde of Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) won the mens and womens singles titles respectively at the 74th Senior National Badminton Championship which concluded on Sunday. Chetans wife Jwala Gutta won double crown as she annexed both womens doubles and mixed doubles titles.         
	Gutta partnered Ashwini Ponnappa of Karnataka to win the doubles while she won the mixed doubles with her India teammate V. Diju.         
	Gutta and Ponnappa faced some challenge to overcome Aparna Balan and Shruti Kurien (PSPB) 21-15, 22-20. Gutta-Ponappa duo had a comparatively easier first game before Balan-Kurien put up some resistance in the second game.         
	Chetan came back from a game down against fellow shuttler Anup Sridhar to clinch the final match 16-21, 21-19, 21-10 in a 55-minute battle.         
	Murgunde, on the other hand, faced little challenge from Sayali Gokhale of Air India in the first game but had a roller coaster ride in the second to win the title with a 21-17, 21-7 victory.         
	 She won the title for the first time in her senior nationals career since 2001.

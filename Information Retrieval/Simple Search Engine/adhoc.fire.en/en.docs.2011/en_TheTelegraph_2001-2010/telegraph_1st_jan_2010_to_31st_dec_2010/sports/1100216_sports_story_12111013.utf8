The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru showed whos boss: Deep
                                                                                                                       7                                      Viru showed whos boss: Deep
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Some of the former international cricketers, who were present at the Eden on Monday, were amazed at the contrasting styles of centuries by Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.               
	The following are excerpts (alphabetically):         
	Deep Dasgupta: Virender Sehwag showed Paul Harris whos the boss. He tried to frustrate Sehwag with a negative leg-stump line and Sehwag started to play the reverse sweep to good effect. Both Sehwag and Sachin complemented each other really well. Sachins innings also showed what we mean by concentration of the highest order. What worked for India was that both remained positive and played their shots just when South Africans got the better of Murali Vijay.         
	Devang Gandhi: No praise is enough for Sachin. It is simply amazing that even after 20 years of international cricket, he has the same hunger for runs. His application is something that everyone can learn from. He is the elder statesman in the team and makes sure that everyone looks up to him. He is a mentor for not only cricketers in India but across the world. Sehwag, on the other hand, is someone whose methods cant be replicated. Only he can play those amazing shots with regularity. It was a privilege to watch both the centuries.         
	Robin Jackman: Both are amazing talents. One cant compare the two centuries. If Sachins innings was a work of art, Sehwags was about pure hand-eye co-ordination.         
	Pranab Roy: What an entertaining days cricket we have had! In Sehwag, we got the flavour of Twenty20 and one-day cricket. In Sehwag, we find a reflection of Viv Richards. When Sachin batted, the ones like us who vouch for Test cricket, got to see a different brand of batting. So calm, yet so effective and classy.

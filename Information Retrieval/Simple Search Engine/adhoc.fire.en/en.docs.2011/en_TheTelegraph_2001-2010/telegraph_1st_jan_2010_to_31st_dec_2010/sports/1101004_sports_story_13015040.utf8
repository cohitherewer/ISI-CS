The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rest in full control
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rest in full control
                      
	Jaipur: Jaidev Unadkat (4 for 41) and Piyush Chawla (3 for 70) shared the spoils as Rest of India piled on the agony of Mumbai by taking a huge 394 first innings lead on the third day of the Irani Trophy cricket match at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here Sunday.         
	In reply to RoIs mammoth total of 668, Mumbai were bundled out for 274 with Unadkat and Chawla featuring as the main tormentors.         
	Instead of forcing the follow on, Rest of India preferred to bat again and were 45 for 1 at the stumps, to extend their lead to 439 runs with nine wickets still intact.         
	Captain Yuvraj Singh, desperate to regain his spot in Indian Test team, was unbeaten on 10, while the century maker of the first innings Abhinav Mukund was on 19 at the draw of stumps.         
	Yuvraj was impressive during his 32-ball stay at the crease, cracking two boundaries. Shikhar Dhawan, however, holed out to Kukreja at square leg off Dhawal Kulkarni for 13.         
	Earlier, Resuming at 26 without loss, Mumbai gave a spineless batting display. Barring captain Wasim Jaffer (71) and the ninth wicket partnership of 70 runs between Iqbal Abdulla (33) and Dhawal Kulkarni (32), there was nothing to mention in the Mumbai batting.         
	Mumbai batsmen struggled to the disciplined bowling of Unadkat, Chawla and R Ashwin. Opener Marathe (7) was the first to depart when he tried to pull a short ball from outside the off stump.         
	Ajinkya Rahane (41) too was tentative in the beginning as he played and missed, but soon they adjusted to the slow pace of the wicket, which tended to hold the ball.(PTI)

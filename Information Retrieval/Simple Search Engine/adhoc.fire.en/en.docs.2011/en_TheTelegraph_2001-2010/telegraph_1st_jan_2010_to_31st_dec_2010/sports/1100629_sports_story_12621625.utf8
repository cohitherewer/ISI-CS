                                                                                                                       7                                      Bacher: Modis an opportunist
                                Bacher    
	Johannesburg: Suspended Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi is paying the price for his autocratic style of functioning and his potential downfall is a lesson for administrators in similar position, according to former South African cricket boss Ali Bacher.         
	Bacher said Modi had no doubt played a part in making the IPL an extraordinary success but his tendency to take unilateral decisions ultimately paved his downfall.         
	There is no doubt that the IPL is an extra-ordinary success but his style of functioning created a lot of resentment among the other Board members. You cannot ignore the others for too long. You cannot vest all the powers on one person, Bacher said here.         
	He (Modi) was an opportunist and his potential downfall is a lesson for persons in similar position. He is paying the price for all that now, he said.         
	Bacher also criticised Modi for trying to take credit for innovating the Twenty20 format of the game. (PTI)

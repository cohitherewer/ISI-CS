	New Delhi: Those who thought the top-seeded duo of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi would have a cakewalk against Sri Lankas Thangarajah Dineshkanthan and Amresh Jayawickreme, were in for a rude shock.         
	The Sri Lankans, unknown to every one, did not go down without a fight in the tennis event of the Commonwealth Games, at the R.K. Khanna Stadium, here on Tuesday. Even though the scoreboard read 6-3, 6-3 in favour of the Indians it did not give the real picture. Agreed they have entered the quarter finals, but Bhupathi, in particular, never looked at home against a pair, who are yet to enter the ATP ranking chart.         
	Bhupathi struggled with his first serve and backhand returns which gave the Sri Lankans quite a few points. Had they been a bit more experienced, this match would have been very close.         
	Bhupathi agreed at the post match conference. We were really surprised by their performance today. And Leander confirmed: They pushed us. These boys are really talented.         
	Indias womens doubles pair of Nirupama Sanjeev and Poojashree Venkatesh also cruised to the quarter finals after demolishing Maldives Aminath Irufa Mahir and Aminath Maleela Solih 6-0, 6-1.         
	Earlier, top seed Somdev Dev Varman entered the second round of the mens singles event beating Devin Mullings of the Bahamas 6-4, 6-2.         
	Mullings surprised everyone by taking a 4-1 lead in the opening set but Somdev clawed his way back by winning five games in a row.         
	The left-handers thunderous forehands had left Somdev gasping but the Delhi heat took a toll on Mullings. Otherwise the second day of the tennis event would have witnessed a huge upset.                 Virdhawal Khade      
	Mullings took a medical time out in the seventh game of the first set and from there on Somdev did not have to look back. Two long forehands gave Somdev two break chances and the Indian converted the second with a stunning double handed backhand winner.         
	Unforced errors again, this time a double fault, handed Somdev a break in the third game of the second set.         
	Mullings, however, was not ready to give in without a fight. He earned two breakpoints in the sixth game but Somdev saved first with an ace and second with a forehand winner.         
	In badminton, P. Kashyap made a winning Commonwealth Games debut while Saina Nehwal continued her rampaging run as India demolished a lowly Barbados 5-0.         
	The world No. 11 pair of Jwala Gutta and V Diju started the rout, thrashing Thorpe Dakeil Jonathan and Watson Shari Latoya 21-3, 21-8 in just 11 minutes. Kashyap beat Reifer Nicholas Colin 21-14, 21-6 in 17 minutes.         
	Saina dumped Eastmond Mariama Ayanna 21-3, 21-6 in just 13 minutes to give Indians an unassailable 3-0 lead over Barbados.From Wednesday, it will get tough. Thats why I tried to play all my strokes and played long rallies. Wednesday we have two matches. I would like to play both but I know it would be too tiring, so may be Aditi (Mutatkar) will play one singles, she added.         
	Sanave Thomas and Rupesh Kumar then streamrolled Reifer and Thorpe 21-4, 21-9 in 14 minutes, while Aparna Balan and Ashwini Ponnappa completed the formalities with a 21-8, 21-8 win over Eastmond and Watson in a 13 minute match.         
	Indian boxers opened their campaign in style with Amandeep Singh (49kg) and Manoj Kumar (64kg) advancing to the pre-quarter finals. While Commonwealth Championships gold-medallist Amandeep got the better of Kenyas Peter Warui 6-2 for the second successive time this year, Manoj was so dominant against Sierra Leones Daniel Lassoyo that the referee stopped the contest at 17-1.         
	Virdhawal Khade kept Indias swimming hopes alive, making it to the mens final of the 50m butterfly. He finished sixth clocking 24.38 seconds.         
	Indian paddlers scored easy victories on Tuesday. While Indian women spanked Ghana 3-0 to enter the quarter finals of the team event, the men thrashed Guyana by an identical scoreline.         
	However, it was curtains for India in the singles event of squash. National champions Saurav Ghosal and Joshna Chinappa lost their respective pre-quarter matches.

	Singapore: Still basking in the glory of a career-reviving victory on the US PGA Tour, Arjun Atwal will join a star-studded field in chasing his second trophy of the season at next weeks $6 million Barclays Singapore Open.         
	Atwal, who topped the Asian Tour Order of Merit in 2003 before furthering his career in the United States, will be chasing a first prize of $ one million in the joint richest event on the European Tour outside of the Majors and the World Golf Championships.         
	Singapore holds a lot of good memories for me and I am delighted to be playing in the Barclays Singapore Open, said Atwal. My victory in the US has given me a lot of confidence and I am hungry for more wins.

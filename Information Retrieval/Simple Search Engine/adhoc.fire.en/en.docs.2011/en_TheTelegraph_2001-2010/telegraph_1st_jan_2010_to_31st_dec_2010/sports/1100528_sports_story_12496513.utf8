	London: Jonathan Trott, fighting to preserve his place, anchored Englands first innings on Thursday with a second consecutive home century on the opening day of the first Test against Bangladesh at Lords.         
	Trott came to the crease after only 26 balls when Alastair Cook was dismissed for seven. He was still there at the end of the day with 175 beside his name after nearly six hours at the crease.         
	At the close England were 362 for four after being asked to bat on a day which began under dark cloud cover and ended in sunshine, which had sapped any early life and lift from the pitch.         
	Trott scored 119 in the second innings of his Test debut at the Oval last year, a century which helped England regain the Ashes and earned him a spot on Englands two off-season tours.         
	After a promising start in his native South Africa, the runs dried up and he subsequently struggled against the Bangladesh spinners in a two-match series.         
	Englands decision to rest their successful Twenty20 captain Paul Collingwood to aid his recovery from an injured shoulder gave Trott a reprieve.         
	He took full advantage with some handsome drives, reaching his century with his 12th four, before he became becalmed for 60 balls during which he failed to find the boundary.         
	Andrew Strauss fell 17 short of a fifth Test century on the home ground of his county Middlesex after adding 181 for the second wicket with Trott.         
	Strauss, returning as captain after sitting out the Bangladesh tour, took 14 balls to get off the mark with a single.         
	His second scoring shot was a six over mid-wicket and he soon settled into a familiar rhythm with a century looking increasingly inevitable before he chopped a delivery from off-spinner Mahmudullah on to his stumps after reaching 83.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | From Laxman, a gem   in the Emerald Isle
                                                                                                                       7                                      From Laxman, a gem   in the Emerald Isle
    - Feels great i finished it off with a six: suresh raina             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                  
	Colombo: Nine years after an epic 281 at the Eden Gardens, which dehydrated him so much that he had to be put on drip, V.V.S.Laxman crafted a truly fabulous 103 not out to help India level the series against Sri Lanka.         
	Class tells and how!         
	Despite the pain, because of back spasms, Laxman didnt come off the P.Sara Oval. Instead, on 60, he requested a runner (Virender Sehwag) and completed the job assigned to him.         
	Yet again, then, the 35-year-old broke the pain barrier. All for the tricolour.         
	Laxmans first hundred in Sri Lanka, his 16th overall, took India past the 257-run target with plenty to spare. Around 20 minutes remained for tea, on Day V, when the five-wicket win made it 1-1 in the three-Test Micromax Cup.         
	Hes a very special player and played another of his special innings. Hopefully, there will be more such, praised captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	As for Laxman, the MoM, he said that coach Gary Kirstens exhortation that it was a day to do something made him more motivated. Listening to Kishore Kumar hits on his iPod, in the dressing room, helped him relax.         
	We came with the goal of winning the series and, while we didnt do that, this team showed character by bouncing back after losing in Galle, is how Kirsten, highly respected by his wards, summed it up.         
	This win will, of course, remain special for Dhoni  the first after marriage, to Sakshi. At one level, theres no difference... But, yes, this is a post-shaadi first, Dhoni told The Telegraph, grinning.         
	Not that the First Lady of Indian cricket was at the ground. Shes kept herself away from the matches, spending time in the hotels, Dhoni confirmed.         
	He didnt reveal whether that advice had gone from him.         
	The result didnt quite please Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lanka captain. We had our chances... A 1-1 result is 1-1, thats it... The moral victory isnt Indias...         
	Sangakkara added: We scored more runs than India and we took more wickets. He was right on the runs (2,321 to 1,773), yes, but wrong on the business of wickets. Both teams took 45 apiece.         
	Having reduced India to 62 for four, Sri Lankas best chance came and disappeared just a while after nightwatchman Ishant Sharmas dismissal  when Sachin Tendulkar was dropped on 18 (67 for four) by Tillekaratne Dilshan, with Suraj Randiv the sufferer.         
	The Sachin-Laxman partnership had barely begun then and the result may have gone differently. Usually, Dilshan doesnt put any down, but this proved costly.         
	Sachin and Laxman posted 109 for the fifth-wicket, putting the Test beyond Sri Lankas reach. Their stand ended after a hold up, which saw Laxman being treated by physio Nitin Patel and Sehwag turning up as his runner.         
	It was all a distraction and, within minutes, Sachin was out, to a neat catch at the wicket. The champion bat became Randivs fifth victim.         
	Sachin scored 54 (186 minutes, 122 balls, 3x4).That he struck only three boundaries is indicative of how superbly he responded to the challenge, keeping the teams interests uppermost.         
	Eighty six runs remained when Sachin got out, but Suresh Raina played without fear and made the most of having the licence to absolute freedom.         
	Clearly, the find of the series, Raina got the winning runs with a six off Chanaka Welegedara. He was not out on 41 (73 minutes, 45 deliveries, 4x4, 1x6).         
	In the foreseeable future, theres no chance of Yuvraj Singh winning back his berth at the expense of the Test centurion on debut.         
	Speaking exclusively, Raina said: Looking back, it feels great that I finished it off with a six... Im happy that I made a contribution (in both innings)... By Gods grace, the series went off well for me... Now, its time for the next challenge  the tri-series.         
	The other big pluses for India have been (a) Ishant regaining most of his confidence; (b) Abhimanyu Mithun showing that hes a good investment.         
	We neednt dwell on Sachin, Laxman and the MoS, Virender Sehwag, who drove off with a Fiat Linea.         
	That an inexperienced attack  no Harbhajan Singh in the final Test and no Zaheer Khan throughout  could help level the series, indeed, is creditable.         
	India have extended their lead at the top of the ICC Test rankings, but Kirsten insisted that the team hadnt been concerned about it. That was never an issue, really... The focus was on following the process and playing good cricket...         
	The next Test series is at home, against Australia.

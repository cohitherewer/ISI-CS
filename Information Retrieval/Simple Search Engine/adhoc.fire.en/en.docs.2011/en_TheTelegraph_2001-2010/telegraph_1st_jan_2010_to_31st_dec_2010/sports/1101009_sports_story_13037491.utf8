The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | A sniff of tight security
                                                                                                                       7                                      A sniff of tight security
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Bangalore: Its routine for sniffer dogs to board a team bus and help sanitise it. Security personnel here, though, arent content with that.         
	So, the Innovas assigned to the two teams, just in case a player/official wishes to leave the hotel early or return early from the Chinnaswamy, are also being subjected to anti-sabotage checks.         
	On Friday afternoon, for example, one saw the sniffer dogs holding centre stage in the Innovas. Later, a manual check by hand-held detectors was done, too.         
	Initially, the Australians had some reservations, so were doing everything possible, a security official told The Telegraph. He added: Its all the same for our Indian players... Why take a chance?

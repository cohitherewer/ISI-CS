            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Come December, aspiring Indian tennis talents will get to rub shoulders with Grand Slam champions like Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, thanks to the Indian Premier League (IPL)-inspired Indian Tennis League (ITL).         
	Taking a leaf out of the billion-dollar T20 cricket tournament, the All India Tennis Association (AITA) has decided to tap into the franchise-oriented concept which might be seen as a desperate attempt to revive Indian tennis.         
	The concept is still in its infancy but Anil Khanna, the AITA executive vice-president and Asian Tennis Federation president, provided an outline after an executive committee meeting here on Friday.         
	The ITL, to begin with, would have five city-based franchises with plans to expand to it to eight in the following years.         
	As in the IPL, the ties would be played on home and away basis. Each tie would have five matches  mens and womens singles, doubles and mixed doubles. The league will have a simultaneous championship for the junior players.         
	We have been inspired by the IPL. Notwithstanding the recent controversy, its been a great success story, Khanna told reporters.         
	Teams would have 10 players each, including two international stars, four current Indian players and four juniors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Identical cards by Shiv, Jyoti
                                                                                                                       7                                      Identical cards by Shiv, Jyoti
                      
	Turin: The Indian duo of Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur returned identical cards of two-over 74 to get off to average starts in the BMW Italian Open golf tournament here.         
	Shiv Kapur stumbled on the front nine where three bogeys and a double bogey on the fifth hole, as against a couple of birdies, left him three-over at the turn.         
	On his way back, the youngster nailed two birdies and bogeyed the 15th to sign off with a two-over card. In contrast, Randhawa did well in his front nine but was done in on his way back, dropping three shots in the back nine to find himself in trouble.         
	First rounds play was halted with 30 golfers still to complete their round and Graeme Storm, Robert Rock, Marcus Fraser and Paul Lawrie shared the lead at five-under 67.         
	But all eyes were on young Italian sensation Matteo Manassero.         
	The 17-year-old, who last month became the youngest player to make the cut at the US Masters, teed off in his first event as a pro with Colin Montgomerie as a partner and had a solid two-under-par 70 to show for it.         
	It was a really steady round and I really liked how I played today, Manassero told reporters on Thursday.         
	I didnt putt really great but then I didnt have that many close chances.         
	I was a little nervous on the first tee, like always at big tournaments but fortunately Im getting used to it.         
	Manassero played alongside Europes Ryder Cup captain Montgomerie and the young Italian added: It was nice talking to Colin. We got to know each other.         
	Their conversations were largely restricted to the tee because the eight-time European No.1 was rarely on a fairway as he slumped to a 76.         
	He was very impressive and he has a good future, Montgomerie said of his playing partner.         
	Of his own performance, the 46-year-old Briton added: My golf is non-explainable.         
	Europes captain is struggling to make the halfway cut, lying nine strokes behind the leading quartet.           (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bowling is an area of concern: Dhoni

	Centurion: Mahendra Singh Dhoni said at a press conference that bowling was an area of concern, although the team were shot out for a paltry 136 in the first innings of the first Test at the SuperSport Park in Centurion on Monday.         
	South Africa took a little less than six overs on the final day to wrap up the last two Indian wickets and clinch the high profile series opener with a resounding innings and 25 runs victory.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Areas of concern         
	One of the things was we still couldnt get them all out although we all said the wicket was different to first day But you have bowled on flatter tracks and youre still expected to get the sides out, so thats an area of concern because to win a Test you have to get 20 wickets There were positives too. Most of the batsmen got a good start, which we will need in Durban. Another area of concern is the over-rate because we were five-and-a-half overs down at one situation.         
	Conceding 225 runs in one session on Day III         
	Youre supposed to either take wickets or not let the opposition score at five runs an over in a Test match. Of course the conditions are difficult out here, its not like in India where its turning and the ball doesnt come on. So you can tie the batsmen down and not let them score at a brisk pace. But over here scoring is quite easy, in the sense that once youre set, the ball comes on nicely and you can score on both sides of the wicket. Our scoring rate, despite losing wickets, was quite good.         
	If losing the toss proved crucial         
	In the first two sessions the wicket was very different, and as I said, the toss was crucial. Winning the toss is only half the job done. They bowled well after that. They got us out and got a good wicket to bat on... Still they batted well and the openers got them off to a good start and the middle-order capitalised         
	The task ahead         
	The first and foremost priority is to level the series. Then think about the last Test. The next Test is very important, well look to win and if we can win the Durban Test the series will be level.         
	The way forward         
	Its not a situation where we need to panic... What is important is to stick to your basics, to your plans. Thats what is important, thats what will win you games..         
	The batting performance         
	Apart from the first day, I think we batted really well. When we were supposed to bat in the second innings with more than 400 runs in arrears, you are under pressure It may be a flat track but handling that pressure is very difficult.         
	If Suresh Rainas performance is disappointing         
	To some extent, yes. At the same time you need a bit of experience to play under these conditions. What really happens is you tour once in four-five years. The last time he came here was in 2006, and he was not part of the side. After that he played some ODIs and T20s, which is a completely different format         
	The bowlers showing         
	It was difficult because there was not much help from the wicket. Our bowlers are not express quick. They dont generally bowl 140-plus. They have to be very precise with their line and length.         
	Zaheers fitness         
	Zaheer hopefully should be fit. Hes been bowling for the last few days, and hopefully hell be back.         
	Sachin Tendulkars 50th Test hundred         
	He is great, he is a legend. Getting his 50th hundred is a milestone, but the passion he has got for cricket after 21 years is the same. I made my debut in 2004, I saw him practise during nets, it is the same five years down the line. Twenty years down the line, I think most of the cricketers who have played with him feel that he has got the passion to continue and keep going. Thats what is great about Sachin Tendulkar. I think it was a great innings under pressure.         
	His partnership with Sachin         
	The plus point is I dont think too much ahead. Take it one delivery at a time, which means you are moving forward towards a long term goal. What we said was be in the present. Think about the little things that we can do.         
	On what they spoke about during their partnership         
	Thats a very tough one. We dont want to elaborate on what we talk. Whenever two batsmen get together in the middle and talk, often from outside you think they are talking something very intelligent. Its not always the case. I was with him when he scored 200 in Gwalior, and now his 50th. It is always good to bat with him because he is one batsman who helps the batsmen on the other side to perform. Thats a remarkable quality, but that doesnt mean others dont have that quality. He is a great guy to have in the side.         
	Comparing Sachin with Donald Bradman         
	I dont believe in comparisons. Second of all, I have never seen Bradman bat. I have seen Sachin. I am a new-age cricketer. I have played with him, and I have always idolised him. And I dont compare. Both of them were great. Bradman did really well, Sachin is doing really well. Of course, the different thing about Sachin is he has seen the format change, from Tests to ODIs, from ODIs back to Tests where result is very important. Now on to the T20 format... Its two eras that we shouldnt really compare because the dimension of the game has changed.         
	Indias tendency to start a series poorly         
	In most of the series, the first Test has often gone bad, but after that we have come back really well. Hopefully, we will cope with that in the coming two games.

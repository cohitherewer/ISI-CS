            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sunil Gavaskar will be honoured by the Bradman Foundation                           
	Bangalore: Getting to 14,000 Test runs is like being the first on a planet... I guess that would be the best way to describe Sachin Tendulkars achievement, is how Sunil Gavaskar, Little Master I, saluted the accumulator of records.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph on Monday, Gavaskar, the first to enrol in the 10,000 club, way back in March 1987, added: Yes, people did say Id conquered Everest... Theres no peak which is higher and we humans have already gone to the moon... So, the 14,000 has to be equated with being the first to land on a planet...         
	According to Gavaskar, the world had gone overboard when he launched the 10,000 club, in a drawn Test against the Imran Khan-led Pakistan, as nobody had ever touched five figures.         
	Since then, the 10,000 clubs membership has grown to eight  Sachin, Ricky Ponting, Brian Lara, Rahul Dravid, Allan Border, Jacques Kallis and Steve Waugh being the others on its list.         
	Gavaskar, meanwhile, will be honoured by the Bradman Foundation on October 20. Im going to be inducted into the Hall of Fame... Ill be the first overseas player to be so recognised by the Foundation, he said.         
	The invitation mentions Gavaskar, a former India captain, as the first international honouree.         
	As per the communication received by Gavaskar, the function is going to be held at the SCG, with the whos who from different walks of life expected to be in attendance.         
	Its because of the Bradman Foundation engagement that Gavaskar wont be doing commentary on the TV, in the second ODI, in Vizag.         
	Richie Benaud is the Foundations patron.

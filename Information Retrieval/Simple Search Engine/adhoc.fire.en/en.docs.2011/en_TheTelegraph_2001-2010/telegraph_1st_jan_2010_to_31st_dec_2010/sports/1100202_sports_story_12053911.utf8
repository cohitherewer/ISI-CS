	Nagpur: Aiming to reclaim their No. 1 status in the International Cricket Council Test rankings, South Africa will start their tour of India when they take on the Board Presidents XI in a two-day practice match commencing here Tuesday.         
	Mumbai batsman Rohit Sharma will lead the Board Presidents XI in the match before the two-Test series, in which a 2-0 win will ensure that the Proteas replace India at the top of the rankings table.         
	A 1-0 result, however, will see both the parties level on 123 rating points.         
	The Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium here will host the first Test from February 6, followed by the second match at the Eden in Calcutta from February 14.         
	Second-ranked South Africa was recently wrecked by a controversy when Mickey Arthur stepped down as the coach citing differences with the cricket Board last week.         
	The entire selection committee, headed by former all-rounder Mike Procter, was also sacked following a 1-1 draw in the Test series with England at home.         
	Graeme Smiths men, however, would try to put these bitter memories behind and go all out to regain the No. 1 Test team status.         
	Smith said the game comes as an opportunity for his side to acclimatise with the tricky Indian conditions ahead of the Test series.         
	We are excited to play the series and we have five days to go. The two-day match will be important as it would be an opportunity to acclimatise ourselves, make our brain work in the right way, Smith said.         
	National high performance coach Corrie van Zyl has been appointed as the interim coach for the visitors for the Indian tour which also includes three-match ODI series.         
	On the other hand, young Indian players like paceman Abhimanyu Mithun, who have already got a call into the Test squad, Manpreet Gony and Shikhar Dhawan would also like to prove their mettle in the match.

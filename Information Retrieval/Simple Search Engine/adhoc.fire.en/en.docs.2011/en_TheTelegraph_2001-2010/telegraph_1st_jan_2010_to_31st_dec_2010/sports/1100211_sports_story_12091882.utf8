                                                                                                                       7                                      Feeling good about form, says Jeev
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Gurgaon: Jeev Milkha Singh is looking to add to the joy of the birth of a baby boy by winning the Avantha Masters that begins Thursday at the DLF Country and Golf Club.         
	One of Asias most decorated players, the Chandigarh-based golfer said he was more concerned about the baby than his game. I have spent more time in the hospital than on the golf course, admitted Jeev.         
	But then, I have been working with my coach this week and am feeling good about my form. Its always nice to win at home and I will go out there and do my best. I am going to try to win this week but I am actually more excited about the baby, he said.         
	Jeev is aware of the fact that he has not done well at home in a long time and was confident that he would give his fans something to cheer about this week.         
	All top Indian golfers are part of the field, he said. It just could not get bigger. All of them are capable of pulling off surprises, he added.         
	His strategy, Jeev said, would be to remain patient and get the best result. The course is in very good condition but wind might be a factor. I think the ninth, 14th and 17th holes would be the key. Im otherwise an aggressive player but I would adopt a rather conservative approach here, he said.         
	I think patience and course management would be crucial. Most golfers would take a look at the course and think they can hit a five or six-under, which is not going to happen.         
	The par-five holes may look reachable but you might err there. The trees have grown since I last played here and you cannot be overly aggressive here, Jeev explained.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Carlo stays super calm
                                                                                                                       7                                      Carlo stays super calm
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	Carlo Ancelotti insists there will be no panic buys at Chelsea following their dismal build-up to the new season, which culminated in a 3-1 defeat to Manchester United in the Community Shield.         
	Aside from Ramires, who is expected to join the London club imminently, the Chelsea manager insists he is happy with the resources at his disposal and that recent results reflect only the lack of time he has had to work with his World Cup players.         
	Furthermore, the Italian laughed off the possibility of making further signings as a response to his sides current form. I think that there is time to come back to win, Ancelott said.

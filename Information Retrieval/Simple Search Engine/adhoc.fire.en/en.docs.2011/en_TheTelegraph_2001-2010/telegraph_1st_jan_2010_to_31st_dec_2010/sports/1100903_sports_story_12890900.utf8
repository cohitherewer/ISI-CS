The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | IPL meeting on Sunday
                                                                                                                       7                                      IPL meeting on Sunday
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The IPL governing council is expected to decide on the number of matches for next years edition when it meets here on Sunday. Yes, the (governing council) meeting is on Sunday. Hopefully there will be a decision (on the number of matches), a source said on Thursday.         
	The IPL had failed to arrive at a consensus on the format for the 2011 season which will see 10 teams competing, following the addition of Pune and Kochi franchises to the fray.         
	If the existing home-and-away concept was to be adhered to, it would mean 94 matches  including the knock-out stages  being squeezed into a two-month period.         
	The fact that the tournament would be played in peak summer in April-June, and that too soon after the World Cup, had led to concerns about player burn-out and overkill.         
	However, the franchises have rejected a proposal to split the teams into two groups which would bring down the matches to just more than 60.         
	The number of players that teams could retain during the grand player auction later this year is another prickly issue that has to be sorted out yet but, given the impasse over the format, it remains to be seen whether it would be taken up for discussion at all.

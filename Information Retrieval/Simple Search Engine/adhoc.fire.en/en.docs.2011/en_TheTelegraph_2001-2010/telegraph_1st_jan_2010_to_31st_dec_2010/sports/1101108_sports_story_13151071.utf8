The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin is better than Bradman: Abbas
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin is better than Bradman: Abbas
                  Sachin                     
	Karachi: While most former players would rank Sachin Tendulkar as the greatest batsman after Don Bradman, former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas has rated the Indian icon as the best of all time, even above the legendary Australian.         
	People keep calling him (Bradman) the greatest. I never saw him bat but I know, somehow, that he couldnt have been better than Tendulkar, Abbas, considered one of the finest batsmen Pakistan has ever produced, said.         
	This boy (Tendulkar) has certainly gone a step ahead of Sir Don. Just look at the guy I mean, he has been playing for 21 years, has scored thousands of runs, dozens of centuries but is still as hungry as a debutant. Its such an inspiring sight to see him go out there and still bat like he batted as a teenager. Our batsmen should learn from him, Abbas said.         
	Abbas lamented he was not playing in the current era and said he envied Tendulkar because of his never-ending appetite for runs.         
	I am proud that I am the only Asian to have scored over 100 first-class hundreds But after 16 years of international cricket, I just played 78 Tests. I wonder if I was born in the seventies, I could have played twice as many Tests and have scored so many more runs. Probably, I was born in the wrong era, he said.         
	Tendulkar is so good and so lucky to be born at just the right time,said Abbas. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | No pressure on Tintu, says Usha
                                                                                                                       7                                        No pressure on Tintu, says Usha
            ANSHUMAN ROY            P.T. Usha with protege Tintu Luka                           
	New Delhi: P.T. Usha is not putting any extra pressure on her protg Tintu Luka for a medal in the womens 800 metres event of the Commonwealth Games.         
	According to her, even had all the other stars been competing in Delhi  Caster Semanya included  Tintu would not have fared badly.         
	I am not liking this idea, that Tintu has a chance to win a medal only because her event is depleted due to pull outs. After her show in Split (Croatia), I am confident that Luka is ready for a bigger show. But, even if she doesnt win a medal here, I wont mind. Our aim is to produce an Olympic champion by 2012 and we are working on that, Usha told The Telegraph on Wednesday.         
	Tintu clocked 1:59.17, to break Shiny Wilsons 15-year-old national record of 1:59.85 in the Inter-Continental Cup, in Split early September.         
	What is her mentors advice for the Commonwealth Games?         
	Tintu should just do normal things and not put undue pressure on herself. She has already timed below two minutes. She can only get better from here, Usha said.         
	Usha felt that even after all the star pullouts, the field was very strong. Its not fair to give Tintu a medal even before she runs.         
	Tintu, daughter of a daily wage labourer, came to the Usha School of Athletics some nine years ago.         
	She was so weak but had the hunger to train hard. And look at her today. We are already talking about Tintu, the Arjuna awardee said.         
	In fact some six years ago, Usha used ask every reporter she knew of, writing something good about her 21-year-old protg.         
	Very few wrote. And now, the same people are calling me to get a few quotes on Tintu. I think Tintus hardwork is paying off, she said.         
	Usha also spoke highly of discus thrower Krishna Poonia, triple jumper Renjith Maheshwary, shot putter Om Prakash Singh and long-jumper Mayookha Johny.         
	All of them are doing well and are medal prospects, she added.         
	Usha, however, is not sure whether any one can end Indias 52-year gold medal drought.         
	That depends on how the athlete performs on that given day, she said before signing off.

            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH                      
	While Patrice Evra has promised he will explain last weekends fiasco, the countrys footballing fraternity has given its views on the countrys disastrous Cup campaign .         
	The following is what they had to say (alphabetically):         
	Fabian Barthez: It seemed a feverish France team from the outset. When you dont consider the essentials you crash straight into the wall. Theres nothing to say  it was anything but football.         
	Aime Jacquet: Who is not sorry? In sporting terms, we have lost. What happened off the pitch is inexplicable.         
	Jean-Pierre Papin: We were laughing stock of this tournament. Raymond Domenech has been disrespectful to the coach of South Africa         
	Emmanuel Petit: If Jean-Pierre Escalettes (FFF president) wont resign then we need to kick him up the a***. First and foremost, we need to know what happened.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Play Proteas on turning tracks: Kapil
                                                                                                                       7                                        Play Proteas on turning tracks: Kapil
                  Kapil Dev                     
	New Delhi: Turning tracks, not pace-friendly pitches, is what India should play South Africa on when the teams meet in the forthcoming two-match Test series that gets underway on February 6, feels World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev.         
	Basing his view on the observation that the Mahendra Singh Dhonis dont possess a formidable arsenal when it comes to fast bowling, Kapil said India should rely on the spin department in the home series.         
	Our strength is spin bowling and the wickets for the upcoming two Tests have to be prepared accordingly. Also, right now, we dont have a quality pacer other than Zaheer Khan who can make an impact, Kapil said.         
	There is no point having a pitch that assists fast bowlers more than spinners since South Africa have a much better pace attack as compared to the hosts, Kapil said during a panel discussion on a TV news channel.         
	Nagpur will host the first Test followed by the second, from February 14, in Calcutta.         
	Kapil said he was worried by Ishant Sharmas recent loss of form. Ishants strength is his in-swinging delivery and if you lose your natural ability then, definitely, it is a cause for concern. Maybe the batsmen have started reading him better now, but he has to find ways to outwit them, Kapil observed.         
	Meanwhile, New Zealand pace legend Richard Hadlee, who also took part in the discussion, said Indian fast bowlers should focus on Test cricket rather than the three formats.         
	My observation on the Indian pace attack is that they certainly are quality bowlers who have it in them to take wickets and win games. However, they have to get out of this rut (of playing all three formats) very quickly. It is actually very tough for pacers to play all the three formats and deliver consistently, Hadlee said.         
	They will be a little bit tired, injured or jaded and there will be a loss of form. They need to be better managed, perhaps sit out for a few games to freshen up and be fired up for Test cricket, he added.         
	Some pacers perform exceptionally well in their debut year and then fade away. However, some of them stay, like Zaheer and Glenn (McGrath). Those who fade away can also blame the amount of cricket that is played these days. They have to perform day in and day out, which is certainly not an easy task, said another fast bowling legend, Australian Dennis Lillee.

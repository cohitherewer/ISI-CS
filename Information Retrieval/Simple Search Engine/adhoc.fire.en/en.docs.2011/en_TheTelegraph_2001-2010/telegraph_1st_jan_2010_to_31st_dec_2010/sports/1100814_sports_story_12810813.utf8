The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Majola is in big trouble after violating norms
                                                                                                                       7                                        Majola is in big trouble after violating norms
    - An Internal matter of CSA, says the BCCI           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            The victorious Deccan Chargers players with the IPL 2009 trophy, in Johannesburg. A file picture                                 
	Calcutta: Gerald Majolas continuation as the chief executive of Cricket South Africa (CSA), a position he has held for close to a decade, appears to be bordering on the untenable.         
	The image of CSA is in tatters... Having violated accepted norms of good governance, I dont think Majola can continue as its chief executive... Theres no end to the embarrassment felt across the country, a close watcher of sport in South Africa told The Telegraph, from Johannesburg, on Friday evening.         
	Majola is in the dock after an expose in the countrys premier Afrikaans daily revealed that the chief executive had paid himself hefty bonuses out of the hosting fees/bonus received from the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the International Cricket Council (ICC).         
	They pertained to the staging of the IPLs second edition, in April-May 2009, and the ICC-run Champions Trophy in September-October of the same year.         
	While a comment from the ICC is awaited, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which owns the IPL, is clear that the issue is an internal matter of CSA.         
	Speaking exclusively from Pune, the BCCI president, Shashank Manohar, said: As per the contract with CSA, the IPL gave Rand 3.3 million (around Rand 7.28 to a dollar) as a bonus for hosting the event... How that sum got distributed is an internal matter of CSA.         
	Why the bonus? Because CSA had to work in the off-season.         
	An agency report on Thursday had incorrectly reported that the amount was paid by Lalit Modi, the suspended chairman and commissioner of the IPL. Of course, its quite possible that he gave that impression.         
	It couldnt be immediately confirmed, but Majola is understood to have inked a bonus-specific contract with the IPL without taking the CSA board into confidence.         
	Quite like Modi signing deals arbitrarily.         
	Its hardly a secret that at least one affiliate of CSA, Gauteng, had demanded transparency in dealings with the IPL. The bad blood generated then, between the province and CSA, persists.         
	Majola, one learns, pocketed Rand 1.2 million from the IPL. Don McIntosh, who quit as the chief operating officer earlier this month, kept Rand 800,000. The balance was disbursed among 38 other CSA employees.         
	In CSA, bonuses are decided by the Remuneration Committee. Majola and McIntosh, however, kept it in the dark. Both took home the lions share of the Rands received for the Champions Trophy as well.         
	The lid was blown off the scam by CSAs external auditors, Deloittes. Now, an independent panel has been constituted to get to the bottom of it all.         
	Headed by Pius Nkonzo Langa, a former chief justice of South Africa, the panel will also have a representative each from Deloittes and KPMG, another auditing major.         
	According to an agency report, Majola has given back the bonuses hed awarded himself. The move is unlikely to win him sympathy, though.         
	For a change, Suresh Kalmadi may actually be a little relieved. After all, administrators in other sport, too, are being nailed with a capital N.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Spinners hold key: Bevan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Spinners hold key: Bevan
            SUDIPTO GUPTA                                  
	Mohali: The similarities between Michael Bevan and Brad Hogg dont end in the fact that both belong to the rare breed of bowlers called chinamans. One will also not be wrong if he says that both had been an asset for Australia in the limited-overs format of the game.         
	So will they possess the same view about Australias chances in two-Test series against India? The answer is  yes.         
	The duo are currently in India as part of the commentary team covering the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.         
	When The Telegraph asked them what they thought about Ricky Ponting amp; Co.s fate in this series, both said that everything depends on how much success the Indian spinners attain.         
	Its a difficult question Actually a lot will depend on how the Indian spinners fare. Though we know that the Mohali track favours the speedsters, it may be different this time. Especially, the moisture that is there in the pitch may assist the spinners. So we have to see how much damage the Indian spinners can inflict, said the 40-year-old Bevan.         
	Hogg echoed his senior partner as he said: Spin is definitely going to play an important part. If the Indian spinners get turn it will be difficult for Australia.         
	Hogg was keen to know if Harbhajan Singh would take the field on Friday. It will be interesting to see if Harbhajan plays the first Test That may change a lot of things, added Hogg.         
	Who then would be the key man for Australia? According to Bevan, Doug Bollinger has the resources to trouble the Indians. Bollinger will be important for Pontings plans. He is a good bowler and can really deliver, said Bevan, who was once considered the best limited-overs batsman during his playing days.         
	However, when asked if Australia can win the Mohali Test, Hogg came up with an answer which was as gripping as his flipper. Im sure Australia would wrap up the match in three days, said Hogg, his booming grin well in place.         
	And make sure you dont criticise our team much, Hogg quipped before signing off.         
	Now thats what you call an unlimited reaction from two limited-overs specialists.

                                                                                                                       7                                        Warne wants us to play with courage, freedom
    - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE     -   Abhishek, The Bengal batsman in the Royals line-up, on his captain             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Shane Warne and Abhishek Jhunjhunwala                                       
	Calcutta: The city-born Abhishek Jhunjhunwala is one of the many to be bowled over by his inspirational captain, Shane Warne.         
	Warne, who led Australia in 11 ODIs (just one loss), has been captaining the Rajasthan Royals from the very beginning of the IPL and his smart moves made the biggest difference, against the Deccan Chargers, on Monday night.         
	In fact, Warnes leadership played a significant part in the Royals trophy-winning run in the IPLs first edition  2008.         
	Jhunjhunwala, 27, spoke to The Telegraph from Nagpur, on Tuesday afternoon, before the Royals departure for Jaipur.               
	The following are excerpts               
	On whats special about Warnes captaincy         
	A lot, really... The way Warne kept our spirits up after defeats in each of the first three matches was remarkable... In fact, our worst loss came in the game just before the one against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), but Warne kept encouraging us to play with courage and freedom... That we should express ourselves... We did, against KKR, and halted our run of defeats... Whatever the situation, he wants us to enjoy our cricket and to keep smiling...         
	[Jhunjhunwala was the MoM in that game, which the Royals won by 34 runs.]         
	The way Warne goes about his job         
	Warne is very open to ideas... He invites suggestions, both off and on the field... He makes it a point to get the most out of the local cricketers, so to say... For example, he and I had lengthy chats before the KKR match and I was made to brief our bowlers on the line to bowl to particular batsmen... After all, I know the Bengal lot in the KKR team very well... At times, Warne has got upset, in the dressing room... Hes got annoyed... Usually, however, hes calm and, even in losses, has counted the positives.         
	 First interaction with Warne         
	At Lords last July, during the Royals-Middlesex game, when I wasnt allowed to play by the BCCI... Because of the circumstances, our interaction then was quite limited... The past month has, of course, been great... A huge learning experience.         
	Top moves by Warne in IPL III...         
	Move No.1: Giving the first over to Yusuf Pathan in the match against KKR... Yusuf hadnt done well with the bat, but Warne wanted him to feel important and gave him such a big responsibility... The move worked... Other teams, too, have begun opening the attack with spinners... He started a trend.         
	Move No.2: Using the experienced Morne Morkel in the penultimate over and giving the 20th to Siddharth Trivedi last (Monday) night... Turned out to be a masterstroke... Almost every other captain wouldve given that last over to Morkel.         
	Move No.3: Moves, actually... This is a general observation... Right through this IPL, Warne has been brilliant in the first six overs... Hes shuffled the bowlers pack like nobody else. Tactically, more often than not, hes scored.         
	Defeating the Deccan Chargers from a losing position         
	(Laughs) We lived up to our motto  that we can win from any situation... Every time a wicket fell, Warne kept reminding us of that... We didnt give up and got rewarded in a thrilling finish.         
	The celebrations         
	Whether weve won or weve been defeated, we attend the IPL party after every game... All teams dont... Weve never given the impression of being poor losers... Besides that official engagement, we do have our own sessions, in the form of team dinners or something else. The Royals are like a family, with an excellent team spirit.         
	Royals mood going ahead         
	Oh, were very confident of making the semi-finals, which is the first goal for all teams... It wont be easy as many of the franchises are pretty much bunched together on the points table... Our next three matches are all at home, Jaipur, and weve never lost there... Its a great record to hold, lifts the confidence, too.         
	Role being played by Jeremy Snape         
	Being the psychologist, hes a key member of our support staff. Hes been helpful, telling us how to come out of tough situations. He helps out with strategy as well.         
	Biggest difference between T20 and the other forms         
	Theres far more time even in an ODI...In that format, a couple of maiden overs may not prove that costly, but in a T20 game, two dot balls could become so crucial... We batters have to maintain a strike rate in excess of 100, which isnt easy... The intensity level in T20 matches is so high.         
	Finally, gains by sharing the dressing room with Warne         
	Today, Im clearer in the mind... After frequently talking cricket with Warne, I know my game better now... Hes given me a role and made me understand the importance of executing that role... If I may add, Warnes tips havent been technical, for he feels Im technically sound... So, he has been focusing on the mental side, on how I should play in the big moments...

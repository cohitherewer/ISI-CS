The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bagan firm favourites

	Calcutta: When Mohun Bagan take the field at Salt Lake Stadium Thursday afternoon, the firm favourites will be aiming to win their seventh Calcutta Football League, Premier division match on the trot.         
	Having a spectacular run, after recording CFLs highest winning margin, 7-0 against George Telegraph last month, Bagan will hope to maintain their red hot form against Mohammedan Sporting Club, who are currently fourth in the league table.         
	Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto, who played a key role in Bagans last outing against Southern Samity, did not practice Wednesday morning and neither did striker Edeh Chidi.         
	The green and maroon brigade coach, Stanley Rozario, has three foreigners in hand for Thursdays battle.         
	 It will be interesting to see who partners with Subair Murithala Ali upfront against the Tope Fuja-coached team. If one goes by the trend, in the last two matches, Barreto had started with Nigerian Murithala, with Chidi coming in later.         
	Thus, if Rozario sticks to the same combination, then it will be difficult for Sporting to counter the Bagan attack.         
	Though Barreto and Chidi did not practice today (Wednesday), they are both match-fit, said Rozario after Wednesdays practice session. I will play with two foreigners in the match, he added.         
	For Sporting, though they have won four CFL matches in a row under their new Nigerian coach, it will be an uphill task for them to beat Bagan.         
	After a 0-5 drubbing at the hands of East Bengal, Sporting have won four on the trot but against teams, which were not up to Bagans standards.         
	For Sporting to garner full points Thursday, they will have to rely on veteran Dipendu Biswas to strike, as he has been doing so regularly. However, with age not on his side, Fuja may be tempted to bring him in the later stages of the match.         
	I have seen Bagans last two matches and it will be a tough task for us. But, securing full points will be our one and only objective, said Fuja before signing off.

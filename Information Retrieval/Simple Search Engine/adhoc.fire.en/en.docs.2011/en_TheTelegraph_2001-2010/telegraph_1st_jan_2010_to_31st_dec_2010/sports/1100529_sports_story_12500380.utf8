                                                                                                                       7                                      Im getting used to life with Diego, says Messi
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Argentina forward Messi said he and his teammates were getting used to being coached by Diego Maradona, someone they idolised as youngsters.         
	At first, it was strange to have him as our coach, he told a television channel. The truth is he was a little imposing.         
	But afterwards, we started getting used to him and hes been our coach for a while, so now its normal.         
	Also, hes really close to the players, hes one of the guys, so theres no problem.         
	Maradona has always been very nice to me. Even before he was our coach and I took my first steps as a professional.         
	Now that I have him as a manager, hes even closer and gives me a lot more confidence than he did before.         
	There is still a feeling in Argentina, however, that he does not reproduce that form at international level.         
	Messi tries not to pay too much attention to that.         
	People have an opinion and I respect it, he said. Im the first person who wants to do well with my national team and perform like I do with Barcelona.         
	I know that this is a really good opportunity for me and Im going to try to do it.         
	Messi has had another stellar season with Barcelona, winning another Spanish League under Pep Guardiola and playing at a consistently high level, which has seen him hailed as one of the greatest players in history.         
	He continued: They are different systems and different styles and everything.         
	At Barcelona, Guardiola decided to use me more in the middle and thats when I had more touches on the ball and played more around the front of the area. And well, Ive had the luck to be able to score more goals.         
	Messi also believes England are among the leading contenders to lift the World Cup. I think that right now, the strongest sides going into the World Cup are Spain, England and Brazil, he said.         
	They had a strong, easy qualifying and are very tough.         
	Messi was a little more coy about his own sides chances.         
	Hopefully, it will be my World Cup, Argentinas World Cup and that we hit the ground running and play up to peoples expectations and win the World Cup, he said.         
	Messi has to a lot to prove in this World Cup, not least of which is to show his critics that he can lead his country to the title.         
	Argentine great Mario Kempes had said the team cant rely solely on Messi if they want to win the Cup.         
	But it seems that coach Maradona, who has said that Messi will be the fulcrum around which the team revolves, knows better.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Thankful to Gary, says Harbhajan 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Thankful to Gary, says Harbhajan 
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Calcutta: Harbhajan Singh, the first No.8 in Tests to author two hundreds in a row, has thanked Team India coach Gary Kirsten for helping him create history.         
	Im indeed thankful to Gary... After my first hundred (115 in Motera), he said I must not be content with just one... Also, while that took 88 Tests, the second could follow much quicker... Gary enhanced my self-belief, Harbhajan told The Telegraph.         
	Speaking on Monday evening, from Hyderabad, Harbhajan elaborated: Usually, the tailenders hardly get to bat at nets and, even if they do get a reasonable hit, then its not against quality bowling...         
	Gary has changed that... He ensures everybody has a good session, that everybody faces enough balls... He has definitely made me feel comfortable... At nets, in the dressing room... In any case, I dont do masti with my cricket... The game is everything and it has given me everything.         
	Asked if hed been aware of the records set by him, Harbhajan laughed and replied: Records ban jate hain... One doesnt play for records... Of course, Im very happy... Very happy at helping the team...         
	Harbhajan, the first from India (Irfan Pathan is the only other one) to register a hattrick in Tests, admitted hed become pretty emotional in the morning.         
	Its all thanks to God... Thanks to Almighty... Ive always maintained that God is great... As with everything else that Ive achieved in life, this one, too, is for my late father (Sardar Sardev Singh), is how Indias most successful off-spinner put it.         
	Harbhajan, now 30, has completed a dozen years of international cricket. His hunger, though, hasnt lessened and hes aware that his No.1 job really is to prise out batsmen.         
	The runs, in effect, are a bonus.         
	Incidentally, Harbhajan made history on the day closest mate Sachin Tendulkar, the senior-most pro around, completed 21 years of doing India proud.         
	Footnote: Actually, Team Indias non-recognised batsmen have been making significant contributions right through this season. Abhimanyu Mithuns 41 at the SSC and Ishant Sharmas 31 in Mohali, for example.

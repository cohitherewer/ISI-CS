The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Will be tight, says Mike

	Brisbane: Australias top-scorer of the day, Mike Hussey, feels the first Ashes Test is there to be won by either team, after his unbeaten 81 got the hosts out of trouble on the second day. Hussey and Brad Haddin combined for an unbeaten sixth-wicket stand of 77 to put Australia on 220 for five at stumps, chasing Englands total of 260.         
	The game is 50-50 at the moment, Hussey said. Wed love to be two or three down and the same as them scorewise But the two teams are very tight.         
	Its going to tight throughout the Test match. We are very close and it could well come down to pivotal moments in the game One ball or one diving catch         
	Hussey insists he did not have any pre-conceived intentions to play more positively but acknowledged he felt more confident playing on a pitch that was more like his high-bouncing home ground in Perth, than the usual low seam-friendly conditions at the Gabba.         
	Nothings changed at all, I just tried to stick with what works for me, Hussey said.           (REUTERS)

	Lalit Modi has put up a brave front saying that truth will prevail and he is geared up for a battle.         
	Battle lines have been drawn. Agendas fixed. Timelines laid. Lets see who wins and who is guilty of what. Now truth will emerge. Wait watch, Modi tweeted late on Saturday, some hours after the BCCI special general meeting in Mumbai on Saturday.         
	Meanwhile, Modi has demanded that he be provided with a copy of all the decisions taken at the SGM, his legal counsel Mehmood Abdi said Sunday. A letter to this effect was sent to BCCI president Shashank Manohar and secretary N. Srinivasan late last night by e-mail and was also hand-delivered.         
	Shane Warne, who captained Rajasthan Royals in the first three IPL seasons, offered w-ords of encouragement to Modi. Hey Lalit whats latest, they still into you? Not fair that... Hope all works out mate... Its your vision the IPL, Warne said in his tweet.

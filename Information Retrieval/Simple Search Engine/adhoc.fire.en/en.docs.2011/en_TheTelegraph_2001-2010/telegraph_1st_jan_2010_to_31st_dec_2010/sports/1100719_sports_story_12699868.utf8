                                                                                                                       7                                        Want to lift 2011 Cup, says Afridi
                  Afridi                     
	London: Shahid Afridi vowed to return to England, saying the limited-overs series starting next month will be the launch pad for his ambitions to win the 2011 ODI World Cup.         
	The 30-year-old, who has announced his retirement from Test cricket, was ruled out of the second Test, against Australia, after he failed to recover from a side strain.         
	However, Afridi  who led Pakistan to the 2009 World Twenty20 title  is determined to return for the subsequent limited-overs series against England.         
	I took a decision which I felt was right and now, all my concentration is on the limited-overs series against England which will be our first step towards winning next years ODI World Cup, Afridi said.         
	I have won the World Twenty20, beaten England and India in Tests at home and have achieved some other milestones as well But before I leave the game, I want to win the ODI World Cup, he added.         
	Afridi also hopes that a months break will revive him for the two Twenty20 and five one-day Internationals against World Twenty20 champions England.         
	I will be fresh for the limited over series which will be very tough because England have been doing very well in both ODIs and T20s. So, if we could beat them it would be good for the progress of the team, said Afridi.

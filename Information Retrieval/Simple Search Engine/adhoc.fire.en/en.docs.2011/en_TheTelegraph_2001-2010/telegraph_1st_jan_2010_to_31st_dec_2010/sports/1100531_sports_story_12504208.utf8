The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lifeline likely for relegated teams 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lifeline likely for relegated teams 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Is the All India Football Federation (AIFF) planning to make it a 16-team I-League from next season after including the two relegated clubs from the edition that just got over? Although a decision is yet to be taken, there are indications that a section of the federation officials is vigorously campaigning to waive the relegation rule for the time being.         
	In the fourth edition of the I-League that ended Friday, Sporting Clube de Goa finished 13th on 27 points followed by top-flight debutants Lajong FC, who came last with 26 points to make up the two relegated teams. Yes, there is a plan to launch a 16-team league from September keeping the relegation on hold, confirmed a senior AIFF official. The entire, planning, however, is still at a preliminary stage.         
	The AIFF had earlier announced its plan of roping in two new franchise-based teams to make the I-League a 16-team affair. Under the new plan, Lajong and Sporting Clube would have to be accommodated since there is no immediate sign of any franchisees coming forward.         
	Moreover, we are afraid that some of the present I-League teams might not be able to fulfil the AFC licensing criteria. So, there will be enough vacancies for the new teams, the official informed.         
	The idea has only been mooted to save Lajong, alleged another AIFF official. A senior official from the club is very close to a couple of office-bearers in the federation. They are trying to change the rules to keep Lajong in the premier division.         
	Vasco president Vinod Parkott described the present move as nothing but an attempt to get teams in through the backdoor. In 2006, when Fransa disbanded their club, HAL, the third finishers in the second division were accommodated. Now that we have finished third in the second division, we should be given the place vacated by Mahindra. We have already written to the AIFF on the issue, Parkott said.         
	Federation treasurer, Hardev Jadeja, though, is open in his preference for Lajong. Thanks to Lajong, soccer has touched new heights in the northeast. From each I-League match at home, the club has earned Rs 1.5 million in gate receipts.

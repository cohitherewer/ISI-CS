The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Australians shocked 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Australians shocked 
          
	Bridgetown: Australia suffered a stunning one-run loss to outsiders Zimbabwe in their opening World Twenty20 warm-up match in St Lucia on Tuesday.         
	Zimbabwe made 173 for seven, featuring a dashing 76 from Elton Chigumbura, in their 20 overs before holding Australia to 172 for seven. Opener David Warner top-scored for Australia with 72 and Twenty20 captain Michael Clarke made 49 but, even though left-arm quick Mitchell Johnson had earlier taken four wickets for 23, Zimbabwe denied Australia victory.         
	Australia needed 13 off the final over but Clarke was dismissed off the penultimate delivery before Johnson, one of several Aussies to be run out, exited off a wide.         
	Brett Lees leg bye off the last ball was not enough for Australia. Earlier, Chigumburas runs came from just 35 balls with six sixes and five fours in an innings where Australia all-rounder Shane Watsons two overs went for an expensive 34 runs.         
	Clarkes side were without the rested duo of fast bowler Shaun Tait and vice-captain Cameron White. But the duo are set to return for Thursdays second and final warm-up game against the Windward Islands.         
	Australias opening match of the tournament proper is against defending champions Pakistan in St Lucia on Sunday.         
	In other warm-up matches, New Zealand proved too strong for minnows Ireland in a 40-run victory in Guyana. Kiwi opener Jesse Ryder made 64 and Martin Guptill 50 as New Zealand compiled a total of 187 for five in their 20 overs.         
	Ireland, in reply, struggled with captain William Porterfields 34, the top score in a total of 147 for nine. Nathan McCullum led New Zealands attack with three for 25.         
	The Black Caps are in action against Sri Lanka, last years losing finalists, and Ireland face hosts the West Indies in a double-bill that will open the tournament in Guyana on Friday.         
	Pakistan overwhelmed the Windward Islands by 68 runs in a warm-up match in St Lucia while, in Bridgetown, Bangladesh beat Barbados by 36 runs.         
	SUMMARISED SCORES         
	In Bridgetown: Bangladesh 166/5 in 20 (Imrul Kayes 57, Md Ashraful 35). Barbados 130/3 in 20 (Ryan Hinds 50 n.o.). Bangladesh won by 36 runs.

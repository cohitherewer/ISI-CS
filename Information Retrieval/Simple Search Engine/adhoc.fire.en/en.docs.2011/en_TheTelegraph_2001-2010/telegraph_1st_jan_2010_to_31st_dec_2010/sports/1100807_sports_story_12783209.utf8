The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sri Lankan tail turns match on its head
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sri Lankan tail turns match on its head
    - For team india, its time to deliver on the final day           LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Thilan Samaraweera and Ajantha Mendis in Colombo, on Friday                                 
	Colombo: With the tale of tails nearing its climax, the sting has begun to hurt Team India.         
	Requiring 257 to level the three-Test series, the visitors were perspiring on 53 for three, at stumps on Day IV.         
	Not that the remaining 204 runs cant be knocked off, but the P. Sara Oval wicket has begun to deteriorate and off-spinner Suraj Randiv, projected as Muttiah Muralidharans successor, has cast a spell.         
	Fridays opening session belonged to India, with Sri Lanka hurtling towards a huge defeat. The next two, though, went to the hosts, courtesy a memorable 118-run alliance between Thilan Samaraweera and (believe it or not) Ajantha Mendis.         
	Those runs were for the ninth-wicket, lifting Sri Lanka from 125 for eight to 243. Their second innings eventually ended at 267, leaving India with 18 overs till the close.         
	Sri Lanka had been 11 behind on the first innings.         
	All the three completed innings have seen at least one partnership of substance from the tail and, who knows, there may well be a repeat on the final afternoon.         
	Its all set up for a great finish... The Indians still have good batsmen, whereas weve got the bowlers to make the difference, Sri Lankas vice-captain (and senior-most pro) Mahela Jayawardene told The Telegraph.         
	Sachin Tendulkar and nightwatchman Ishant Sharma are going to resume. Clearly, a positive mindset will be the need of session No.1 and beyond.         
	The time to deliver has arrived.         
	Kumar Sangakkara opened with Lasith Malinga and Randiv and thats unlikely to change when the last few hours of the Micromax Cup get under way.         
	Randiv has snared all three wickets. There was no doubt over the first two dismissals  those of Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid  but Murali Vijay came off looking like someone grossly wronged.         
	Vijay was taken by Jayawardene at leg-slip, but umpire Simon Taufel chose to play it safe and referred the catch to third umpire Kumar Dharmasena. He confirmed it wasnt taken on the bounce.         
	For a moment, Taufel wanted to raise his index finger, but decided on a confirmation from the third umpire. Once that came, he gave his ruling, a well-placed source pointed out.         
	Speaking at the Taj Samudra, Jayawardene said: I never had any doubts at all... Id been confident that I caught the ball cleanly...         
	While the India dressing room appeared upset, Amit Mishra, who was presented before the media, admitted he didnt know whether the catch was clean or not.         
	One decision, however, cant be a reason for India to lose focus. Its an absolute test of resolve and an excellent opportunity to show the world that the No.1 ranking is actually deserved.         
	The series is over for Dravid, Sehwag and Vijay. While Sehwag stood out and Vijay had his moments, without making a huge impact, Dravid may look at the future a little differently. A mere 95 in five innings is poor, to put it mildly.         
	Also, at 37-plus, Dravid isnt getting younger.         
	Earlier, in the morning, smart deliveries and a couple of poor shots (from Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews) reduced Sri Lanka to 87 for seven before the rock-like Samaraweera and Malinga stitched together 38.         
	After that, it was time for Mendis to party and for Samaraweera to aim for his second hundred of the match.         
	From a mystery bowler, Mendis became a mystery batsman!         
	So clean was Mendis that some of his hits would have done justice to top-ranked batsmen. Pace, spin... Nothing was a bother and disbelief spread on the faces of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Co. Indeed, the captain came across as clueless.         
	It wasnt the first time that a tail had done the stalling job so superbly, but its not often that so much is at stake. The visitors kept waiting for the partnership to end, instead of going that extra yard to break it.         
	With Samaraweera and Mendis enjoying themselves, the hosts didnt lose a wicket between lunch and tea. In the morning, six had fallen.         
	The stand ended when Samaraweera got out trying to pull Abhimanyu Mithun. His 83 came in 218 minutes and off 139 balls (6x4). Mendis was the last to go, exiting via a drive, for a career-best 78 (174 minutes, 157 deliveries, 10x4, 1x6).         
	Mishra, whod been on a hattrick, finished with three wickets. The other two spinners did likewise.         
	Armyman Mendis, by the way, is now credited with the highest score by a No.10 against India. Thats some record.         
	Over, then, to the 25-year-old: When I got into the national team, I didnt concentrate too much on my batting. But, of late, Ive realised that I had to improve and Ive concentrated on doing so.         
	Looking ahead to the last day, Mendis commented: Theres a tendency for wickets to fall in the mornings... If we can pick up two-three, then well be able to finish it off by the mid-afternoon...         
	Says something about the mood in the Sri Lanka dressing room.         
	Not that the Dhonis are immersed in prayers only. If you ask me, theres no concern... Were confident of levelling the series... We can, insisted manager Ranjib Biswal.  
	DAY IV HIGHLIGHTS  
	 Pragyan Ojha returned match figures of seven for 204. The last time an Indian left-arm slow bowler claimed seven-plus wickets in a Test was when Murali Kartik claimed seven for 76 vs Australia in Mumbai, 2004-05.  
	 The 118-run partnership between Thilan Samaraweera and Ajantha Mendis set a few records:  
	 On 39, the Samaraweera-Mendis registered the best ninth-wicket partnership by any side at this ground. The previous best was 38 by Romesh Kaluwitharana and Muttiah Muralidharan vs India in 1993-94.   
	 On 74, Samaraweera-Mendis bettered the previous best ninth wicket stand by the Sri Lankans vs India. The previous best of 73. 
  m On 100, they registered only the third century stand for ninth wicket by a Lankan pair in Tests.   
	 On 106, the pair recorded the best-ever ninth-wicket partnership for Sri Lanka in Tests. The previous best was 105 by Chaminda Vaas and Nuwan Kulasekara vs England at Lord rsquo;s in 2006.  
	 It was the third instance of Samaraweera (137 not out amp; 83) scoring 200-plus runs in a match. Both previous instances came against Pakistan in tnhe first amp; second Test of the 2008-09 series.  
	 The 220 runs scored by Samaraweera in the match is the most by a Sri Lankan player on this ground. The previous highest was 206 by Aravinda de Silva (206) vs Bangladesh in 2002.  
	 On 28, Mendis registered his highest score in Test cricket. His previous highest was 27.  
	 On 38, Mendis recorded his highest score in first-class cricket.  
	 When Virender Sehwag scored a duck in the second innings it was the 16th instance of an Indian batsman scoring a century and a duck in the same Test. Sachin Tendulkar, Vijay Manjrekar and Sehwag have done so twice. Sehwag had scored 106 amp; 0 vs England at Trent Bridge in 2002.

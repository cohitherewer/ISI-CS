	Singapore: Jyoti Randhawa was among the seven Indian golfers who managed to complete their rounds, carding a two-under 69 before darkness led to suspension of play in the opening round of the $ 6m Barclays Singapore Thursday.         
	Randhawa picked up three birdies and an eagle against three bogeys at the Tanjong Course to be tied for the 56th spot with 108 golfers yet to finish their rounds after four hours were lost due to a lightning storm.         
	C.Muniyappa was the highest-placed Indian at tied 37th after being three-under at the 12th hole. SSP Chowrasia was two-under at the 11th hole, sharing the 56th position with Jyoti.

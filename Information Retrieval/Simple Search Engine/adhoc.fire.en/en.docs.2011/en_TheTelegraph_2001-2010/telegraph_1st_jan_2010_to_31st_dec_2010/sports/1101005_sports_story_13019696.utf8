	Calcutta: Chirag United beat WB Police 5-4 in a Premier Division match of the Calcutta Football League at the Barasat Stadium on Monday. The winners led 3-2 at the breather.         
	Joshimar Da Silva scored a hattrick for Chirag, while Denson Devadas and Mohammed Rafique netted the other goals.         
	For the policemen, Prasanta Sarkar struck a brace while Kishore Mallick and Himadri Chakraborty were the other scorers.         
	The match started after a 40-minute delay because of the late arrival of the match officials. This led to the match ending in near darkness. The referee ignored demands from WB Police players to call off the match due to of insufficient light.         
	Chirag started in a whirlwind fashion and were up 3-0 in the 32nd minute. WB Police pulled one back in the 36th and reduced the margin further in the first half injury time.         
	Chirags two quick goals in the second session, with Joshimar completing his hattrick almost sealed the match.         
	Perhaps a little complacency had crept into their ranks towards the closing stages and Prasanta made use of it to score his second goal.

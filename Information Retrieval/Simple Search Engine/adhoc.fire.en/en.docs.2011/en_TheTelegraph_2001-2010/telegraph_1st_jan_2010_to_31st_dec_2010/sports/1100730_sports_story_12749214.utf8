The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina: This one is for the family
                                                                                                                       7                                      Raina: This one is for the family
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                      
	Colombo: Suresh Raina, Indias 12th centurion on Test debut (ninth into three figures in the very first innings) and the only one to have a hundred in all three forms, has dedicated his feat to his family.         
	While the Rainas have reason to celebrate, Team India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coach Gary Kirsten may fret over what to do with Yuvraj Singh, the first-choice No.6 till his indisposition before the ongoing Test.         
	Raina, after all, grabbed his chance with both hands and (usually) a form-player cant be dumped. That, too, after such a quality hundred in a pressure situation.         
	On Thursday evening, Raina spoke to The Telegraph at the Taj Samudra.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Q How does it feel to be a centurion on Test debut?         
	A Achcha lag raha hai... I got an opportunity and I made it count... Im thankful to Sachin (Tendulkar)... Hes the worlds greatest batsman and, right through my innings, was at the other end... He kept encouraging me, kept asking me to enjoy my debut... Kept boosting my confidence by saying that Id already been a match-winner in limited overs cricket and must now look to do things in Tests.         
	Surely, you wouldnt even have dreamt of this?         
	(Laughs) No... Last night, though, Id begun to think about it... Not much, but a bit. At the same time, Id also been nervous, because the first session was very crucial.         
	So, what was your game plan?         
	I knew runs wouldnt come easy... I also knew I shouldnt let go scoring opportunities... Having ended the third day on 66, it was a question of playing sensibly... Of remaining calm and not playing a rash shot.         
	What were your first thoughts on getting to the hundred?         
	Uparwale ki yaad aiye... I thanked God... What more can a batsman ask for? Remembered my parents (Tirlok Chand, Pravesh) and thanked them, too... Also thought of my brothers and sister (Mukesh, Naresh, Dinesh, Renu)...         
	Are you, then, dedicating your achievement to the immediate family?         
	Absolutely... This one is for them... (After a pause) My parents wanted to see me bat with Sachin, in a Test match... Not only did I do that, I got a hundred in his company... My parents wont be able to describe their joy.         
	That youd played 98 ODIs before your Test debut must, in some way, have been helpful...         
	Definitely... I knew what international cricket was all about... That Ive played quite a bit of domestic cricket has also been of help.         
	Youre the first Indian to have a hundred in all three forms. Were you aware of this record?         
	No... I got to know from Tony Greig, when he was interviewing me for TV... Record hona achchi baat hai.         
	Do you feel youve done enough to have a regular slot in the middle-order?         
	Dekhiye, agle Test mein kya hota hai... Its not for me to say... Tight (situation) hai...         
	The pressure will definitely be more. Are you prepared to handle it?         
	Expectations will be more, but I wouldnt say more pressure... My approach  that of making the most of opportunities  wont change. It would be nice to get into the habit of scoring big... One likes to have a higher level of satisfaction and one likes being appreciated... The last couple of months have gone off very well... I mean, I got the India captaincy for the Zimbabwe tour, then this debut... Of course, Ill have to keep working hard. Mehnat karta rahoon ga.         
	Your ODI debut, in July 2005, was in the Greg Chappell era. He would consistently praise you... Today, did you think of him, too?         
	I didnt, but Im sure hell be happy to know of my performance.         
	As we speak, whats uppermost in your mind?         
	(Laughs) That Ill probably have to field the whole day tomorrow (Friday)!         
	It took you all quite some time to return to the hotel...         
	We were playing badminton at the indoor complex at the SSC... That delayed us.         
	Finally, youve actually joined Dada (Sourav Ganguly)s league. Your thoughts?         
	Yes, Id told you last evening about that wish... One of the sports channels regularly shows clips of Dadas hundred on Test debut at Lords (1996) and that has served as an inspiration... Within me, Id been hoping to have an impact-making debut. By the grace of God, I succeeded.

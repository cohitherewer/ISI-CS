The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Salute Murali, not run him down: Harbhajan Singh 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Salute Murali, not run him down: Harbhajan Singh 
    - Off-spinner with 355 Test wickets on the 800 man             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL              Harbhajan Singh                            
	Colombo: Harbhajan Singh, who has been a chela of sorts of Muttiah Muralidharan, spoke to The Telegraph (at the Taj Samudra) on Saturday evening.         
	Harbhajan, by the way, is the most experienced bowler in the Team India ranks. The 30-year-old made his debut in early 1998.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On Muralis belief that only he can break his record         
	(Grins) Dont think thats going to be possible... Im not even half way there (355 Test wickets to Muralis 800)... The record will remain with him... Of course, Muralis comments are a source of inspiration... Will definitely make me strive even harder... Achcha lag raha hai.         
	What made Murali special         
	The turn he got... Others, too, think and prepare like Murali, but nobody has been able to manage the same amount of turn.         
	Muralis mental strength...         
	Awesome... To be called twice and still fight back, calls for exceptional mental strength. In fact, Murali kept wanting to climb higher, not being satisfied with what had been achieved. An amazing cricketer.         
	Whether he ever felt that Murali had a suspect action         
	Look, nothing has been proved... Murali underwent tests after being called for the first time (in December 1995) and was cleared... Perhaps, it was all an illusion.         
	Murali making the most of the 2005 amendment in the laws         
	The amendment is for everybody... What has stopped others from getting 800 Test wickets? Or, even 400? Aur kisi ne kar ke kyon nahin dikhaya? Salute Muralis greatness, not run him down.                   Murali      Don rsquo;t think that rsquo;s going to be possible... I rsquo;m not even half way there... The record will remain with him... Of course, Murali rsquo;s comments are a source of inspiration... 
  Will definitely make me strive even harder... Achcha lag raha hai  
	On Murali rsquo;s belief that only he
  (Harbhajan) can break his record       
	Having looked up to Murali (and Anil Kumble)         
	Absolutely... Hes been a gem of a person, always ready with something to offer... I remember Murali telephoned me when my own action came under scrutiny... He had words of encouragement. I was so touched, for he didnt have to pick up the phone.         
	Muralis farewell Test...         
	I asked him for a shirt and he obliged... Murali autographed it and, so, it will remain special... Actually, I have a few of his shirts... Maine pehle bhi liya hai.         
	The world record-holders decision to retire from Test cricket         
	Its a personal one... Given the way Murali bowled in Galle, he couldve continued for another year and added 100 or so wickets... He has gone out when at the top.         
	Sri Lankas attack in the post-Murali era         
	Oh, will be weakened considerably... It will be interesting to watch and I expect the batsmen to dominate their attack.         
	Indias spinners going wicketless in Galle         
	Im not making excuses... I just didnt click... Having said that, the entire bowling unit needs to get it right... Its not that I wasnt determined... Main aisa waisa nahin khelta... But, yes, the reality is that I didnt get a single wicket (in 32.1 overs).         
	Finally, more pressure on him, being the senior-most around         
	Ive played with such pressure, definitely wont be for the first time... My day will come... Ill (soon) be back among the wickets.

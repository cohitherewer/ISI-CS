The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ricky to miss first ODI
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ricky to miss first ODI
                      
	Melbourne: Ricky Ponting said it was time to end Australias losing streak when the home side play Sri Lanka in the first of the ODIs in Melbourne, Wednesday.         
	The Australians are in a form slump ahead of the opening Brisbane Ashes Test against England on November 25, having lost their last five international games.         
	Sri Lanka thrashed Australia by seven wickets in the latest Twenty20 match in Perth on Sunday.         
	The time for talking was over for the Australians, Ponting said Tuesday.         
	Theres no sugar coating anything, we know we have some work to do, and we havent played one-day cricket for a little while, he said.         
	But the Australians will have to negotiate a much-needed win against Sri Lanka without Ponting. He will miss the first one-day International to attend his grandmothers funeral in his hometown of Launceston in Tasmania on the day of the match.         
	Michael Clarke will lead the Australian team in Pontings absence in Wednesdays one-dayer. (Agencies)

            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES            Michael Ballack on crutches in Munich, on Monday                           
	Germany captain Michael Ballack has been ruled out of the World Cup after sustaining an ankle injury in Chelseas FA Cup final victory over Portsmouth on Saturday.         
	Ballack was the victim of a heavy tackle by Portsmouths Kevin-Prince Boateng at Wembley, and while X-rays showed that no bones were broken, the extent of the damage is such that the German Football Federation has confirmed the midfielder will miss the World Cup.         
	National team captain Michael Ballack is out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. This is the result of an MRI on Monday morning in Munich, read a statement from the DFB.         
	A tear of the medial collateral ligament of the right ankle was found. The right ankle is immobilised in a plaster. He will have to wear a special shoe for two weeks. After the diagnosis of national team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt today (Monday), a complete healing of the injury is expected. Ballacks return to training is possible at the earliest in eight weeks.         
	 Its very disappointing, but I have to accept it, Ballack told German television, standing with crutches. Its football and you have to live with it. ... I am angry, clearly.         
	 The German media called it a shock. The injury probably robs Ballack of the final chance to win the World Cup title after reaching the 2002 final and the 2006 semi-finals.         
	The news came as a considerable blow to Germany coach Joachim Loew, who was critical of Boatengs tackle on Ballack. He had no chance of getting the ball and a foul like that can seriously injure a player, Loew said.         
	We are shocked, no question about it, and we are all very, very sad, he said at the teams training camp in Sicily. He is a very important player for us, a world class player who played a very important role in decisive games for us. There can be no question of resignation now. We are sure we can still play a good tournament.         
	Loew will now have to pick a new captain and find someone to fill the defensive midfield role played by Ballack.         
	Despite his long and distinguished service, Ballack has been unable to win a title with Germany. He played a total of 63 minutes in his first major tournament, the 2000 European Championship. Two years later in Japan and South Korea, his goals Germany reach the final. But he missed the final loss to Brazil after receiving a yellow card in the semi-finals.

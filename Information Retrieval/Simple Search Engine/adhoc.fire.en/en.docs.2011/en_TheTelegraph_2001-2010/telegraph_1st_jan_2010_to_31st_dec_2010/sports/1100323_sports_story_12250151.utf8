The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Want to be the best new team: Karun 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Want to be the best new team: Karun 
                  Karun Chandhok                     
	New Delhi: Welcome to the gang. Coming from the matchless Michael Schumacher, these generous words sweetened Karun Chandhoks F1 debut in Bahrain. But looking ahead, Indias newest Formula One driver reckons a jerky ride awaits him this season.         
	It was indeed a series of lucky coincidences that gave India its second Formula One driver and things fell in place one after another to facilitate Karuns graduation from GP2 to F1. His team Hispania, grappling with finance crunch, put together a car just ahead of the season-opener in Bahrain and was accommodated in the starting grid without any pre-season testing.         
	Accordingly, Karun finally followed in Narain Karthikeyans footsteps and became what he had dreamt all his life. And things could not get headier as he was welcomed by none other than seven-time world champion Schumacher.         
	I met him in the drivers parade and it was very nice of him to come to me and introduce himself. He said hello to me and then said welcome to the gang. I talked to him briefly, along with (reigning world champion) Jenson (Button), Karun said.         
	Schumacher himself is making a comeback this year with Mercedes and Karun felt this was just what the sport needed. His comeback is great for Formula One. It suddenly brought back whole lot of F1 viewers who had gone missing, the Chennai driver said.         
	Talking about personal goals and targets this year, the 26-year-old third generation driver from a well-known family of motorsport enthusiasts looked careworn.         
	I would like to establish myself as a credible, respected F1 driver. Its difficult to make an impression with a team which itself is not established but I have to make an impression in the paddock. I have to make an impression with the people who matter and who can open new doors for me, Karun said.         
	From the teams perspective, Karun said to become the best of the rookie outfits would be a creditable result. By the time we reach the middle of the season, the fight is to become the best of the new teams and to finish the season as the best new team. That would be a strong effort, he reckoned.

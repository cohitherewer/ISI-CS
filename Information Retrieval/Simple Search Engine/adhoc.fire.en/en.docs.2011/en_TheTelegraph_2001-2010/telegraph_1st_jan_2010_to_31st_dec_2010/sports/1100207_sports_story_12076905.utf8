            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Nagpur: For Rohit Sharma it was a classic case of being so near yet so far. Lucky enough to be included, as a cover for injured VVS Laxman, in the India squad for the first Test against South Africa, Rohit was set to make his debut on Saturday until a freak accident robbed him of his chance.         
	Rohit was rushed to a local nursing home for an MRI. He will be going to the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore on Sunday for rehab, Mahendra Singh Dhoni said.         
	According to sources, the MRI report hasnt revealed any tear. However, the doctors werent sure about the time he would require to recover.

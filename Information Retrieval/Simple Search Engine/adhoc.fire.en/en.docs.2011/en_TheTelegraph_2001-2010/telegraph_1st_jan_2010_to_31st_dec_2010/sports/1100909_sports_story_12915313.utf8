                                                                                                                       7                                      A tremendous moment for us, says Bopanna
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi on Tuesday became the first Indo-Pak combination to reach the semi-finals of a Grand Slam, at the US Open.         
	The 16th-seeded combination, who upset second seeds Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjic in the third round, packed off seasoned big guns Wesley Moodie of South Africa and Dick Norman of Belgium 7-5, 7-6 (2) in a pulsating quarter final clash.         
	Bopanna spoke to The Telegraph on Wednesday, on the pairs winning streak at the US Open.               
	Following are excerpts         
	Q Feelings on reaching the semi-finals of a Slam for the first time         
	A It hasnt sunk in yet to be quite honest. Its a tremendous moment for Aisam and I. We have worked really hard and the past year has been very rewarding. But we cant think about this for too long. We have a very important semi-final coming up, and we are two or three sets away from perhaps the biggest game of our lives.         
	Comparison of reaching the semis against wins over the Bryan brothers and Mahesh Bhupathi-Max Mirnyi         
	The Bryan brothers, Mahesh and Max are brilliant doubles players and fight till the very end. It takes a near perfect match to beat them. So wins against both the pairs are definitely one of the highlights in our careers. But making it to Grand Slam semis, knocking out the No.2 seeds on the way is just on another level. There is no way to describe the feeling of being here.         
	On their chances against Eduardo Schwank and Horacio Zeballos in the semis         
	They are a very competitive duo and a right-left pair, so it will be a bit tricky to handle them. But, in the quarters, both our opponents were over 6ft 7in tall so it was pretty hard to handle their serves. But we managed. We intend to do just the same against the Argentinean pair.         
	Chances of qualifying for the ATP World Tour finals...         
	We like to focus only on hitting the tennis ball. Making it to the year-end finals will be quite an experience but as of now we are only concentrating on winning the Slam. Points and ranking are something we will look into only after the US Open.         
	On pairing with Aisam         
	We first met way back in 1996 when Aisam came to India to play in the Junior ITFs. Weve been great friends since the year 2003 (the year I turned pro). The most memorable initial partnership was when we played the Mumbai ATP tournament where we reached the finals. We have an understanding that perhaps, reflects on the court. We dont look at each other as Indian or Pakistani.         
	On promoting peace         
	We never started playing together to make a political statement or promote any agenda. We got together because we enjoy the game, have a similar mind-set, and being such good friends off the court it just made sense to team up. Then, a non-profit organisation called Peace and Sport approached us to become Champions for Peace. We chose to wear T-shirts that read Stop War, Start Tennis and we now realise that our partnership can influence the public and people in power!         
	The idea of playing singles at Wagah border (Bopanna serving from Pakistan and Aisam from India)         
	This came about through Peace and Sport. Im sure it would take a lot of approvals and convincing on both sides of the border, but if were able to pull it off, Im sure it would send out a fabulous message to Indians, Pakistanis and the world at large!

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Kumar replaces Viru at the top
                                                                                                                       7                                      Kumar replaces Viru at the top
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara has displaced Team India vice-captain Virender Sehwag from the No.1 spot in the International Cricket Council (ICC)s Test rankings in its latest update Sunday.         
	Kumar earns the elevation to the top spot following a patient double century in the second Test at Colombo, leaving the Indian opener to rue his impetuosity in getting out on 99. The Lanka captain got an unbeaten 42 in the second innings while Sehwag, the new Test batting No.2, did not have to pad up a second time in the drawn match.         
	Sachin Tendulkar, Indias double centurion in the second Test, has been duly rewarded with a two-rung jump to No.4 for his 203. Other Indians in the batting top-20 are Gautam Gambhir (No.11), V.V.S. Laxman (No.15) and Rahul Dravid (No.19). Indias Test debutant and centurion Suresh Raina entered the list in the 60th place after his knock of 120.         
	The latest rankings also factors in the first Test between England and Pakistan in Nottingham where James Anderson took 11 wickets to condemn the visitors to a heavy 354-run loss. This was Andersons maiden 10-wicket haul and it sends him up four rungs to No.5, the highest he has ever been.         
	In the batting list, Englands Matt Prior has risen to 33rd following his unbeaten 102 in the second innings while Pakistan captain Salman Butt has dropped two places to 34th.         
	Also making a gain was England captain Andrew Strauss who just managed to break into the top 20 after captaining his side to victory.         
	Strausss teammate Paul Collingwood has leapt five places to be at No.22 while vice-captain Alastair Cook has slipped five places to 30th sitting one below India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.         
	A disappointing Test match for Pakistans Danish Kaneria has seen the spinner drop six places to No.21  the first time since 2003 that the leg-spinner has been outside of the top 20.         
	There was better news for Kanerias team-mate Mohammed Amir who has risen four places to 34th after completing the Test with figures of four for 76.

  - IPL 
  -   KKR, Chargers, Royal Challengers brace up for the big battle         OUR CORRESPONDENT            Shah Rukh Khan                                 
	Mumbai: Sourav Ganguly would have expected to do what Englishman Owais Shah did on Tuesday. The Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) skipper would have ideally liked to spend quality time in the middle during the practice game at the MIG ground against the local club. Instead it was Owais who struck a well made 64 as KKR won the match by 27 runs.         
	The former Indian captain had only faced a few deliveries before he was dimissed offering a simple catch.         
	With couple of days left for the tournament to start, Sourav will like to get is act together by the time the Knights take on Deccan Chargers in the opening encounter on Friday.         
	Owais though looked solid during his stay at the wicket. Although the MIG attack was not the best but runs before the tourney is sure to give him required confidence.         
	Rohan Gavaskar too got to spend valuable time smashing a quickfire 36 with the help of three sixes.         
	The discordant note was dismissals of Manoj Tiwary and Brad Hodge for naught and 13 respectively.         
	Among the KKR bowlers, Ashok Dinda was seen trying to dig it in short and in the process gave away a few runs. Ishant Sharma and Laxmi Ratan Shukla initially struggled but both later settled down to a good rhythm.         
	There seemed to be no worry for Ajantha Mendis, though.         
	The Sri Lankan spinner struck the perfect line immediately and the local batsmen had little clue of his deliveries.         
	Hodge was a disaster though with his slow stuff, banging the ball mid pitch and the ball reaching the batsmen after two bounce.         
	There was at least one strange decision on the part of the team management. Mohnish Parmar, the offie whose action is under review, is travelling with the squad.         
	But all that hardly mattered to the motley crowd, who were barred from entering the ground, as was the media.         
	For the local fans, their day was made when team owner and superstar Shah Rukh Khan arrived.         
	The actor, dressed in black T and matching trousers, made their day with a simple wave of his hand and a big thumbs-up.

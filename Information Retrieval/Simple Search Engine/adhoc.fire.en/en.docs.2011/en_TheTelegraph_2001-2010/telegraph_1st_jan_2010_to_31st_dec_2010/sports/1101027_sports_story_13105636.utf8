	Abu Dhabi: South Africa restricted Pakistan to 119 all out in their first Twenty20 International on Tuesday after captain Johan Botha and Lonwabo Tsotsobe took three wickets each at the Zayed Cricket Stadium.               
	South Africa won by six wickets after reaching the target in 18.2 overs. While Colin Ingram top scored with an unbeaten 46, JP Duminy made 41.               
	The Pakistan batsmen were never allowed to build any real partnerships and from 75 for three in the 10th over they lost four wickets for 16 runs  much to the disappointment of a nearly-10,000 strong partisan crowd.         
	Tsotsobe removed openers Shahzaib Hasan and Imran Farhat, while Botha had Mohammed Hafeez caught by Colin Ingram caught to leave Pakistan on 46 for three in the early stages.         
	Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi was greeted by a loud roar from his fans and was soon involved in a battle with Botha. (agencies)

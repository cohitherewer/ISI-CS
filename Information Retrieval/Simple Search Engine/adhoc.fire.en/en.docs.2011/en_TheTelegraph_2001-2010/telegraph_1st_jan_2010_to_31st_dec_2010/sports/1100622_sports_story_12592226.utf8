                                                                                                                       7                                      Some French players mull match boycott
                                  Anelka      
	Bloemfontein: France coach Raymond Domenech described his players on Monday as acting like imbeciles in protesting against Nicolas Anelkas expulsion by refusing to train only two days before the match that decides their World Cup future.         
	I tried to convince them that what they were doing was an aberration, an imbecility, a stupidity without name, Domenech said of Sundays strike.         
	France play South Africa on Tuesday in a Group A match they need to win to stand a chance of advancing. They also require a winner in the Mexico-Uruguay game to avoid a repeat of the 2008 European Championship, when they went out in the first round.         
	Patrice Evras role as captain could be over after only five games, with Domenech refusing to confirm him as his leader after the defender initiated the player walkout. I havent picked the team yet, we will see tomorrow, Domenech said, adding of the players that theyve expended a lot of energy. Its sad.         
	When Domenech was asked if some players had told him they do not want to play the game, he answered evasively. It is a possibility that some players may not want to play against the hosts in Bloemfontein, said Domenech.         
	We will have to take it into account when I compose the team with my staff, 58-year-old said.         
	Evra was furious at the French Football federations decision to send Anelka home late Saturday, amid claims from the players that the FFF denied Anelka a chance to give his side of the argument at a media conference.         
	Having initially said he understood his players frustration and that what Anelka said  although abusive  was something which happens within the dressing room, Domenech did a complete turnaround on Monday.         
	First of all, I would like to specify that the punishment that was handed out to Nicolas Anelka is justified, Domenech said. I support the federation in this matter. No one can permit themselves to act like that, either in the dressing room or elsewhere.         
	FFF secretary Henri Monteil cast doubt whether all the players wanted to strike, speculating that there were three or four leaders taking the rest along with them.         
	Some players went to see Domenech in their room. They were crying, saying they were sorry for what happened. They were young (players), Monteil told a newspaper. Anyway, the three or four leaders are players who are on the way out, who will never play in a World Cup again. Who are they? ... (William) Gallas, (Eric) Abidal, maybe (Thierry) Henry, who is friends with Anelka.         
	The day after his tirade against Domenech  which happened at halftime during Thursdays 2-0 defeat to Mexico  Anelka trained as normal with the squad. He was sent home the next evening by the FFF after details of the clash were splashed across the front page of a French sports daily, including the expletives Anelka allegedly used.         
	Domenech also defended his decision to read out a statement from the players in which they announced their refusal to take part in training. It had surprised many that Domenech agreed to speak on the players behalf, because it created ambiguity about whether he supported the strike or not.         
	Domenech said he spent more than 45 minutes trying to talk the players out of the strike, including when the players were on the team bus with the curtains closed. Other federation officials also tried, with one delegate even resigning over the incident, he said.         
	At a certain point, I said to myself: Stop. We have to put an end to this charade  because that is what this was, Domenech said. Something must be done. Everything was being broadcast live.         
	The French and all the people who were asking themselves what was happening had a right to know. So I took the paper and I read it. What I should have said at the end is that in no way do I support this document or this attitude.         
	Meanwhile, Zinedine Zidane is disappointed by the on-field performances at the World Cup and doesnt agree with the teams actions off of it, but he believes the former champions can win their last Group A game against South Africa.

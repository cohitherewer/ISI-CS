The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | England look to rise and shine
                                                                                                                       7                                      England look to rise and shine
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Cape Town: England face Algeria at the Green Point Stadium on Friday with bigger issues at stake than whether they can beat the north Africans to regain control of World Cup Group C.         
	If Fabio Capellos team have any ambitions of advancing beyond their usual quarter final terminus then beating Algeria, who lost 1-0 to Slovenia in their opener, must be a given.         
	After failing to overcome the US on Saturday, England know their hopes of reaching the last 16 hang by a thread unless they secure three points.         
	Against a side ranked 30th in the latest Fifa standings, it should not be a problem for Capellos side  and Rooney is adamant there is no need to fear Algeria.         
	The manager is obviously confident and Im a confident person too, he said.         
	I believe we will qualify from this group  I dont think there will be any problems about that.         
	But the performance on Friday is not something I am too worried about. The only thing I am concerned about is winning.         
	With any tournament it is how you finish and not how you start.         
	Italy won the World Cup in 1982 without winning any of their three group games and the Azzurri have already started this campaign with a draw, just like England.         
	However, Rooney does not foresee anything but an England victory against Algeria, and the mistakes of the US game will not be repeated.         
	Rooney said: I watched the US game again.         
	I saw where I could do better, where I should have been, how to improve my positions.         
	It was quite interesting to watch. Everyone can have a quiet game. We need nine out of the 11 players on song to win games.         
	There were moments when I did some good things against the US and moments when I would have liked to get on the ball more.         
	There were glimpses. But personally I know I can play better and hope to put that right.         
	Algeria, meanwhile, have issued a collective call to arms ahead of Fridays clash with England, insisting the result is not as certain as Rooney seems to think.         
	England are the team under pressure, said striker Ryad Boudebouz.         
	They are the ones who claimed that they came to win the World Cup.         
	It was a sentiment echoed by coach Rabah Saadane, who sees signs of a team under pressure.

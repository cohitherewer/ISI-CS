The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | It feels good: Zaheer
                                                                                                                       7                                      It feels good: Zaheer
            A CORRESPONDENT                                Zaheer Khan       
	India speedster Zaheer Khan single-handedly decimated the Bangladeshis in the second Test, in Dhaka, on Wednesday as India eased to a comfortable ten-wicket victory. Elated with his first ten-wicket haul (10/149) in a Test, Zaheer, at a post-match news conference, said that the injury lay-off helped himwork on his bowling and come back stronger.               
	The following are excerpts         
	On his first 10-wicket haul         
	It feels good. I am in a zone where I am relaxed and my body and mind are in sync.         
	The wicket         
	The nature of the wicket was quite slow yesterday (Tuesday). In the last 20 minutes on Tuesday the ball was reverse swinging. So, we thought that we could take wickets today (Wednesday) morning and we did.         
	Teams performance         
	In Chittagong (in the first Test) also it was a collective effort as a bowling unit. It was a difficult track but the Kookaburra ball always does something on the subcontinent pitches.         
	Comeback from injury         
	Many things in bowling come with experience. I think injuries helped me work on my bowling. I was fortunate that I could work on my bowling and make a comeback.         
	On Bangladeshs performance         
	I was surprised with the collapse. They could have applied themselves more. But these are early days and they will learn.         
	The South Africa series         
	I still need to work on my fitness. But to get back from injury and bowl well is satisfying. An important series (against South Africa) is coming up and I am looking forward to doing well.

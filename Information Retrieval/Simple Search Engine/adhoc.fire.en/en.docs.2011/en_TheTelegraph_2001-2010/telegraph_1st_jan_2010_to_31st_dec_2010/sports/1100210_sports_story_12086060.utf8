The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yusuf aims at bigger things
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yusuf aims at bigger things

	New Delhi: After leading West Zone to a historic Duleep Trophy title with a scintillating double century, all-rounder Yusuf Pathan is hoping that the Twenty20 specialist tag attached to his name would be wiped off.         
	Yusufs unbeaten 210, his maiden double hundred, helped West overhaul a mammoth 536-run target in the fourth innings, a feat never achieved before in world cricket, and the Baroda batsman termed the knock his best ever.         
	Definitely it is the best innings of my career so far, and I scored a hundred in the first innings as well. I had played a 187-run knock in first-class cricket before this and had taken 10 wickets. I hope this Twenty20 specialist tag goes out now, Yusuf said.         
	The elder Pathan is baffled how the tag got attached to his name when he has performed well enough in four-day games in domestic cricket.         
	I dont know why this Twenty20 tag is there with my name. We play four-day matches in first-class cricket. Although there are 50-50 and Twenty20 games also, Ranji and Duleep Trophy are long-format games, he said.         
	Yusuf, a prominent member of the inaugural Indian Premier League winners Rajasthan Royals, last played an ODI for India in September last year. The Baroda batsman conceded that being out of the national team hurts and making a comeback is difficult.         
	You feel bad when you get dropped. So I focus on my performance, its our job to impress selectors. There is stiff competition for every place in the team as there is a lot of talent around, he said.(PTI)

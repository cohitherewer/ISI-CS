The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Total was defendable: Sourav
                                                                                                                       7                                        Total was defendable: Sourav
            A STAFF REPORTER            Sourav Ganguly at the Eden, on Sunday                           
	Calcutta: After the high against the Deccan Chargers on Thursday, the Kolkata Knight Riders fell to the pits of disappointment on Sunday, suffering a humiliating eight-wicket defeat against the bottom-placed Kings XI Punjab.         
	Sourav Ganguly, the Knights helmsman, speaking at the post-match presentation ceremony, admitted that his bowlers failed to defend a defendable total and were never successful in applying pressure on the rivals.         
	Souravs counterpart Kumar Sangakkara, on the other hand, credited compatriot Mahela Jayawardenes risk-free brisk knock for their surprise victory.               
	The following are excerpts         
	Sangakkara: The hundred by Mahela clinched the match. Chris (Gayle) nearly took the game away from us. But in the dressing room, we said to ourselves that we just need a great start and follow it up with doing the basics right. We are a good side, better than we have played this season. Im happy that we now have the right kind of attitude It has certainly improved.         
	Mahela has been brilliant in the middle-order all through his career. But lately he has opened in some matches at the domestic level. He played some lovely shots today The good thing was it was devoid of undue risk and he stayed there long enough to finish the game. Actually, that has been the case so far in the IPL All who have got runs have got them by playing proper cricketing shots. From here, we just want to take each game as it comes. We want play to win and hope that we are able to keep up the attitude and motivation which we showed today.         
	Sourav: We didnt bowl well At no stage of the match did we manage to put them (the Kings XI) under any sort of pressure. The boundaries kept coming all through their innings. I dont think we were short of the ideal total. We batted well to reach 200. Kings XIs Ramesh Powar bowled some tight overs in between. I think the total was defendable. Usually, when we score above 180, we manage to defend it.         
	The wicket was good  for us when we batted and also for them. Its not the question of facing the tougher teams in the upcoming matches, but the important thing is how we play. We have beaten the top two sides from last year We need to win to go forward.

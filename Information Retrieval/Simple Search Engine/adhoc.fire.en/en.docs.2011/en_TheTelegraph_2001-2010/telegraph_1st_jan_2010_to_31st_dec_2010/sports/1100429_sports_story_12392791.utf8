            OUR CORRESPONDENT    
	Mumbai: The Mahindra United players, who only have an outside chance to win the ongoing I-League for the team, are uncertain about their future with the club, according to sources.         
	According to team sources, the players contract with the club, except that of Paresh Shivalkars, comes to an end this season and the club has not offered them new contracts so far.         
	Simply put, the likes of Steven Dias and Mohammed Rafi are up for grabs at the end of the season, unless the club make a volte-face and decide to renew their contracts. Some are of the opinion that this lackadaisical approach has led to the players being distracted, costing the club the title.         
	Other teams have been making approaches to the players. Somebody like Rafi is on top of their list. The teams are ready to offer them double the money to get their services, a source said.         
	The coach (David Booth), in an attempt to keep away the poachers, wanted to talk to the players about their contracts, but was stopped from doing so by the management, the source added.

	Calcutta: Defending champion, Sayantan Das, looks all set to retain the title in 22nd The Telegraph Chess Championship at the Gorky Sadan. The 13-year-old former world U-12 champion, from Scottish Church won both his games, albeit in contrasting fashion, to take his tally to nine points. His nearest rival, Diptayan Ghosh of South Point is a clear point behind on eight points. He meets Diptayan in the next and penultimate round and a draw will ensure the title for Sayantan.         
	The premier school championship is being presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chyawanprash and organised by Alekhine Chess Club.         
	Sayantan Das decimated Nishant Malhotra of Delhi in the ninth round in a Queens Pawn Opening. Sayantan, playing white, castled on the queenside and started an attack on the kingside by marching up his pawns. Nishant, erred in keeping his king in the centre and was subject to a decisive attack by his opponents pieces.         
	Earlier in the day, Sayantan survived an inferior position from the opening, against Chandrasish Majumdar of St Xaviers as the latter mishandled the middlegame, giving his opponent the full point. Diptayan Ghosh, bounced back into reckoning, by winning both his games comfortably against Nishant Kumar and Kaustav Kundu of South Point. He has the advantage of white pieces, in the next round against Sayantan and an interesting struggle is on cards, on Saturday.         
	Debankan Dhara of Vivekananda Mission School held the second seed, Prince Bajaj of DPS, Ghaziabad to a draw in a Bogo-Indian defence in 32 moves. Earlier, he had won against Ved Prakash of Bihar while Bajaj had shattered Saptorshi Gupta of Vivekananda Mission School in the eighth round.

	Ahmedabad: Yusuf Pathan and Michael Lumb made light work of the opposition bowlers with their power hitting as the Rajasthan Royals thrashed the Deccan Chargers by eight wickets to register their third consecutive victory in the third edition of the Indian Premier League here Friday.         
	Chasing a modest 149, Yusuf smashed the Chargers bowlers to all parts of the ground during his 34-ball unbeaten 73, while Lumb, opening the innings, inflicted early damage with a brisk 45 off 32 balls to power Rajasthan to 151 for two in 15.4 overs.         
	Yusufs big hitting skills were in full display on Friday as he hit as many as eight sixes and two fours while Lumbs innings was studded with seven boundaries. Yusuf was particularly severe on Pragyan Ojha as he hit the left-arm spinner for two fours and as three sixes.         
	Naman Ojha, Lumbs opening partner, scored 14 runs off 17 balls. With this win, the Royals have moved up to the third spot in the points table with three consecutive wins after a hat-trick of defeats, while the Deccan Chargers have dropped to the fourth position.         
	Earlier, Rohit Sharma top-scored with a 35-ball 49 while Herschelle Gibbs (25 off 14) and Andrew Symonds (22 of 14) gave him good company to guide the Chargers to a modest 148 for nine.         
	Shaun Tait (3/22) and Sumit Narwal (2/35) were the chief wreckers for the Rajasthan side, while captain Shane Warne rediscovered his old magic, giving away just 15 runs off his fours overs during which he picked up the crucial wicket of Gibbs.                     
	The Royals openers  Lumb and Naman  came all guns blazing as the left-right combination brought up the teams 50 in just five overs.         
	Johannesburg-born Englishman Lumb was the aggressive of the two as he hit off-colour RP Singh for four consecutive boundaries to notch up 20 runs off the fourth over.         
	Naman soon joined the party and struck Rohit for a four and a six before Pragyan broke the dangerous-looking 39-ball 55-run partnership.         
	Pragyan outwitted Naman with a flighted delivery and Gilchrist did the rest behind the stumps.But then came in Yusuf, who used his long handle to great effect and bulldozed the Chargers bowlers to celebrate his selection in the Indian squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in style.         
	Lumb, however, was unlucky not to have scored his first IPL half century as he fell to an unnecessary mix-up with Yusuf just five runs short of fifty. But that was all the Chargers could manage as their bowlers were at the mercy of a murderous Pathan, who drew curtains to the run chase with a six.         
	Earlier, Rohit guided the Chargers innings they lost half of their side with less than 100 on the board.         
	Opting to bat, the Chargers had a disastrous start to their innings as they lost their skipper Gilchrist early. Narwal, who replaced Munaf Patel, got the vital wicket in the fourth ball of the innings as Gilchrist went for a big hit over mid-off only to miscue it to Yusuf at cover.         
	Unperturbed by the loss, Gibbs went about his business from the word go as he dispatched off-spinner Abhishek Jhunjhunwala for two sixes to pile up 16 runs off the second over. VVS Laxman (10), who came into the match in place of Mohnish Mishra, could not justify his selection as he miscued a pull to Yusuf off Tait.         
	In-form Symonds was in ominous mood as he marked his arrival at the crease with three boundaries off Narwal.         
	But Gibbss innings, which was studded with two fours and as many sixes, was cut short by a genius Warne. The Rajasthan captain fooled Gibbs with a lovely flighted delivery and Naman Ojha did the rest behind the stumps.

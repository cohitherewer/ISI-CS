The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Dahiya: Big scores key for Saha
                                                                                                                       7                                      Dahiya: Big scores key for Saha
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: There is little doubt about that Wriddhiman Saha is one of the best among the current crop of wicketkeepers in the country.         
	However, it is the Bengal stumpers form with the willow which is the reason why he is lagging in the race for the second wicketkeepers slot in the national team.         
	The Knights assistant coach, Vijay Dahiya, said Saturday: It is important that a keeper consistently scores 500 runs. Wriddhiman had a great last season with the bat. He is on a learning curve and things will be sorted out very soon, Dahiya said after a KKR training session at the Eden on Thursday.

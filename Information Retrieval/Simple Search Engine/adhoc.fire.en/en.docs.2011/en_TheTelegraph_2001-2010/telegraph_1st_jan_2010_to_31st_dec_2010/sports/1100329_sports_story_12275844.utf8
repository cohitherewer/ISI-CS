The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Tired EB face Salgaocar test
                                                                                                                       7                                      Tired EB face Salgaocar test
                      
	Margao: After a winless streak off 11 matches, East Bengal will be desperate to get back to winning ways when they meet Salgaocar in a 18th round I-League encounter here on Monday. The home team suffered their first defeat under Karim Bencharifa in the last round as they went down 1-2 against Chirag United.         
	East Bengal havent won any of their four return leg matches. The title is beyond their reach now and if their dismal show doesnt end, they could get involved in the fight for survival.         
	When the last time Karim Bencharifa coached against East Bengal, it was the most memorable victory for Mohun Bagan as they beat Salgaocar 5-3. The Moroccan will be thus hoping to keep up his good show against the red-and-gold brigade.         
	Fatigue has been a big factor for the visiting team as they are playing three tournaments simultaneously  I-League, CFL Premier Division and AFC Cup. Their Belgian coach Phillippe de Ridder also cited the lack of support for Yisif Yakubu upfront being a factor. Veteran Bhaichung Bhutias absence with hamstring injury is also a concern.         
	Scoring goals has been a problem from the beginning and one cannot except Yakubu take the load always in the absence of Bhutia who is nursing an injury. I dont have enough replacements in my squad, stated De Ridder.         
	The Goan club on the otherhand are only one point above the relegation zone. It is a must-win game for them as Lajong FC are already breathing down their neck.         
	The Salgaocar teams defence will be strengthened by the return of Luciano Saborosa.         
	Their success will largely depend on how well the midfield and upfront combine. Striker Keita who has been woeful so far will have to strike a good understanding with Ekene Ikenwa who has been their livewire upfront.

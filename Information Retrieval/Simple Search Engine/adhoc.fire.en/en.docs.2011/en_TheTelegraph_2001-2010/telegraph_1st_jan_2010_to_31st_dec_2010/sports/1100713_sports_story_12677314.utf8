            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Johannesburg: As he put the whistle to his mouth for the final time on Sunday night, referee Howard Webb seemed to have thrown open the floodgates for Iker Casillas, the Spanish captain, who could not stop crying for joy at his countrys maiden World Cup victory.         
	With tears rolling down his eyes, Casillas stood alone in the penalty box for a few seconds before his teammates ran towards their skipper and star keeper, St Iker, as he is called back home by his fans, and lifted him on their shoulders.         
	A minute later, it was the arms of Sara Carbonero and Casillas was soon seen kissing his journalist girlfriend, who, to be sure, also interviewed him after the match.         
	No one in the Spanish squad is more deserving of the accolades than the Real Madrid custodian. Although Andreas Iniesta scored the only goal of the match with a rasping half volley, it was Casillas who made two incredible saves to keep Spain in the match before the Barcelona midfielder could do his star turn.         
	On both occasions, Casillas came out of his charge to foil Arjen Robben, considered the most dangerous among the Dutch attackers. No wonder, Casillas was given the Golden Glove award for the best goalkeeper of the 2010 World Cup.         
	Th captain sounded modest when asked how he had managed to stop Robben for a second time when the Dutchman looked certain to score.         
	I saw he (Robben) was coming towards me on his own. I waited and luckily I was able to stop the shot with my foot, Casillas said.         
	But it was a voice choking with emotion when Casillas spoke about the Spanish triumph.         
	I remember (Italy captain Fabio) Cannavaro told me that being world champions doesnt happen every day. The European championship was the most important moment of our life but today (Sunday) is much bigger than anything else, he said.         
	The finals biggest moment came in the 116th minute when substitute Cesc Fabregas played the ball for Iniesta who beat Maarten Stekelenburg in the Dutch goal with a carefully taken shot.         
	Even the normally pokerfaced Spanish manager Vicente del Bosque was seen jumping off his seat with sheer excitement. The entire Spanish bench rushed to the sidelines to congratulate their scoring hero who had by then been swamped by his teammates.         
	Iniesta dedicated his goal to Dani Jarque, the Espanyol defender, who passed away, last year, aged 26. After scoring the goal, Iniesta took off his shirt to reveal a T-shirt with the legend  Dani Jarque always with us.         
	I wanted to carry Dani Jarque with me and with my teammates. We wanted to feel his strength. We wanted to pay tribute to him in the world of football, and this was the best opportunity to do so, the midfielder said later.         
	This is for Dani Jarque, for my family, for all of the people. It is the result of hard work over a long time and some difficult moments.         
	Asked about Spain defending the title in 2014, Iniesta replied: Now is the time to enjoy this World Cup. Well see what happens four years down the line.

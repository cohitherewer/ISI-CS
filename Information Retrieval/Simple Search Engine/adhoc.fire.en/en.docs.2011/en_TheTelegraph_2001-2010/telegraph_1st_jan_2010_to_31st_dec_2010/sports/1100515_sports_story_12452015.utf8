The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Bond bids bye to Black Caps
                                                                                                                       7                                      Bond bids bye to Black Caps
                      
	Wellington: New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond Friday announced his retirement from all forms cricket, saying it was time for him to draw curtains on his international career.         
	The 34-year-old, who has been prone to injuries throughout his career, had already quit Test cricket in December last year after having represented the Black Caps in just 18 games.         
	I know the time is right for me to step down. I have given it everything when playing for the Black Caps, he said in a statement announcing his retirement after returning from an unsuccessful World Twenty20 campaign in the West Indies.         
	I will miss the camaraderie because it has been a privilege to play alongside such a great bunch of guys who are so committed to do their best for New Zealand.         
	Playing with pride for the Blackcaps over the years has meant so much to me. I have experienced huge emotional feelings when I have pulled on the silver fern. I am going to miss a lot of this but I know now is the time to bow out, he said.         
	The right-arm speedster, who hails from Canterbury, was one of the fastest bowlers in the world during a career that has been littered with injuries following his international debut in 2001 against Australia.         
	Bond ended his Test career with 87 wickets from 18 matches at an average of 22.09. In 82 one-day Internationals, he captured 147 wickets at an average of 20.88 while in 20 T20 matches, he took 25 wickets at 21.72.         
	In 2008, Bond, was ranked as the No.1 bowler in world cricket in ODIs and finished his international career ranked No. 5.         
	New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan said Bond has been a real match-winner for the Black Caps. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said Bonds passion, and hunger to succeed would be sorely missed by his teammates.

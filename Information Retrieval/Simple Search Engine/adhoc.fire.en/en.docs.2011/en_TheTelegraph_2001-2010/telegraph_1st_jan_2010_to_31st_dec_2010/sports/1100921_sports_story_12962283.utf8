	Chennai: The chairman of the national selection committee Krishnamachari Srikkanth, on Monday, said the criteria for selecting the team for the two-Test series against Australia were performance and fitness.         
	We dont have to give any particular reason (for dropping Yuvraj). I think, performance and fitness... everything is taken into account. That itself answers the question, Srikkanth said when asked the reason behind Yuvraj Singhs axing.         
	Srikkanth said new face Cheteshwar Pujara has powered his way into the national squad by virtue of his fine performance in domestic circuit,         
	Pujara has done very well in the domestic circuit in the last couple of seasons. He is a good player and also did well in the A series. He has muscled his way into the team by scoring tonnes of runs. You will have to give credit to his domestic performance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clarke is the best: Haddin
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clarke is the best: Haddin
                      
	Melbourne: Australia wicket-keeper Brad Haddin has defended their out-of-form skipper Michael Clarke, saying he was the teams best player.         
	Clarke has had a poor run with bat, scoring just 48 runs in the event in the West Indies, but has prospered as a captain, guiding Australia to five wins in five outings.         
	Australia play defending champions Pakistan in the second semi-final in St Lucia on Friday and Haddin believes it will be their captain who pulls the team out of a hole in the hour of crisis.         
	Michaels still our best player. Hes still a world-class batsman, Haddin told an Australian daily. Class is always class. The role he plays here cant be underestimated.         
	Michael is there to do the role thats pretty tough, running hard between the wickets. He comes out when were in trouble. You need explosive batsmen but you need players like Michael (in) different situations.         
	Clarkes tournament strike-rate of 70.58 places him well below the other five batsmen in Australias top six but Haddin said the skipper is desperately needed when Australias openers fail to fire. His captaincy has been first class. All the teams have explosive bats and world-class bowlers, but what hes brought to us is to make sure were doing our little things best, a presence on the field, taking all the catches, Haddin said. Weve made a conscious effort in making sure that happens and Michael is the reason for that.

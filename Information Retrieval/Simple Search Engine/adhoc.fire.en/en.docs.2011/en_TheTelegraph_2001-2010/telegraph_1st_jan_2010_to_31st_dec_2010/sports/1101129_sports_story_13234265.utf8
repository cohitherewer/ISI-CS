The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Haider threatens   to reveal culprits
                                                                                                                       7                                      Haider threatens   to reveal culprits
                            
	Karachi: In what could bring more trouble for Pakistan cricket, Zulqarnain Haider Sunday said that he will reveal the identity of the people who took bribes.         
	Soon after his announcement on the Facebook page, his family filed a police complaint as his wife got threatening calls from an unknown caller.         
	Haider had fled to London after allegedly receiving death threats from match-fixers when he was in Dubai for an ODI series against South Africa and retired from international cricket in a hush.         
	Haider is apparently miffed by negative remarks about him by Pakistans one-day captain Shahid Afridi, manager Intikhab Alam and the PCB legal advisor Tafazzul Rizvi.         
	He Sunday wrote on his Facebook page that all those who were talking negative about him should wait for five more days and he will expose them.         
	Zulqarnain had earlier, on his MSM page, declared that he would soon be in Islamabad. I will soon let the people know the background of some people and about those who take or had taken money, he wrote on the social-networking site.         
	His wife started getting the calls soon after the message was posted and spread through media. The caller speaking in Urdu warned her that if her husband uttered a word about anyone, the family would disappear, Aqeel, Haiders brother, said.         
	He said one call had come from a number traced to Greece while two others came from unknown locations.         
	My father has filed a police complaint because we are taking these calls very seriously and we are worried about our safety We have asked for police protection, he added. (PTI)

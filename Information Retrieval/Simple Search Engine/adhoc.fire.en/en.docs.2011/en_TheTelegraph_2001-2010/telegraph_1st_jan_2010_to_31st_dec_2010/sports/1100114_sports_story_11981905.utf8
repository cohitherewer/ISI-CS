            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Sri Lankas four-wicket victory over India in the tri-series final took them one place up to the sixth spot in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Championship table.         
	India remained second despite losing the match, but lost two ratings points since the start of the series, leaving a gap of nine points between themselves and leaders Australia, according to a release. Bangladesh, the third team of the tri-series, have lost one rating point.         
	Sri Lanka moved ahead of Pakistan by a fraction of a point, but the Pakistanis can regain lost ground during series against Australia, which starts on 22 January. Even if Australia lose all matches of that series, they would still retain the top spot.         
	India will play their next ODI on February 21, against South Africa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | MCC for day-night Tests
                                                                                                                       7                                      MCC for day-night Tests
                      
	London: Expressing serious concern over Test crickets dwindling profile, including its popularity in India, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has called for immediate introduction of day-night matches, besides asking the cricket boards to guard against players turning Twenty20 freelancers.         
	We should not delay in presenting day-night Test cricket as an option for those Test-playing countries that are struggling to attract an audience, John Stephenson, the MCC assistant secretary, said.         
	We say this form of the game is viable now. We proved it in Abu Dhabi with the four-day game under lights. It was the perfect experiment, and demonstrated this game should go ahead now. We dont need another 18 months of research. The world of cricket is ready. It should not wait; the time is now, he said in a statement after a two-day meeting of the MCC world cricket committee at Lords.         
	The committee, which has former India captain Rahul Dravid as one of the members, discussed a research paper which showed that only 11 per cent of cricket watched in India was Test matches compared to 33 per cent six years ago.         
	It said cricket boards will have to make the five-day format more attractive with greater rewards on offer to ward off the threat of players becoming T20 freelancers.         
	With T20 riches on offer, the committee feels national governing bodies should do all that they can to retain their best talent and ensure Test cricket is a financially rewarding career. There are freelance cricketers who see a profitable career in playing shorter forms of the game only; the committee wants to guard against an increase in their number.         
	The committee understands that market forces will always dictate what type of cricket spectators want to watch and that you cannot force people to watch Test cricket. Cricket authorities around the world need to make a more concerted effort to attract audiences to Test cricket: a World Test Championship, played by well-rewarded cricketers  on fair pitches  at a time of the day to suit the paying public, would provide the Test game with the boost it requires.         
	Dravid informed the committee that India will play an increased number of Tests in the coming months after efforts from BCCI and other cricket authorities.         
	Dravid presented his thoughts after three years of the Indian Premier League to the committee and how the IPL franchises have learned to maximise their brand, reach new markets and become profitable ventures, the statement said.         
	He was, however, concerned that parents of talented children were asking coaches to teach them Twenty20-specific skills only, as rewards of an IPL contract are immense. (PTI)

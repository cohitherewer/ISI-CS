The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Rohan is happy to prove a point
                                                                                                                       7                                      Rohan is happy to prove a point
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Somdev Dev Varman rejoiced in Indias win over Brazil and was happy that his choice of sizzling Chennai as the centre for the Davis Cup tie turned out to be right.         
	I think it was a good call. Hot and humid is god for both me and Bops (Rohan Bopanna). I dont think it hurt us, but actually helped. So, yes, I stand by my decision to play in Chennai with an 11.30 am start, Dev Varman said.         
	After India went down 0-2 down on the opening day and the manner in which the tie revolved more around Bopanna than Dev Varman, it seemed the team would have been better off playing on grass.         
	Grass would not have only suited Bopannas serve and volley game, but also would have negated the Brazilians baseline play.         
	But captain Shiv Prakash Misra backed Dev Varmans decision. First of all, in September it rains a lot in the North and we would have been able to prepare any grass courts, he said.         
	Secondly, the surface is the choice of the No.1 player. Once he makes the decision, we discuss it with the team and take it forward. But if we dont go with his decision, the team would not weld.         
	Bopanna said that his win against Ricardo Mello in the deciding rubber has proved his critics wrong.         
	People have said that there are demons in me. I showed today that I dont have any demons. If at all there was any demon out there, it was facing the opposite guy on the court, the 30-year-old remarked.         
	Leander Paes paid rich tributes to his two younger teammates. I tip my hat to these guys. People will say Somdev played one set and the other guy retired, but I know how hard it is in the first set, he said.         
	Somdev stayed with him and ground him out. It was hell of an effort. And Rohan, I dont have words to describe the way he played today.

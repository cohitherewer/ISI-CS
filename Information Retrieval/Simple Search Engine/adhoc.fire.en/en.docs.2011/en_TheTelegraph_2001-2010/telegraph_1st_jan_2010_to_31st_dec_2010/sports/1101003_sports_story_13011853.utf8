	Cuttack: Current form prevailed over past records, as East Bengal pipped arch-rivals Mohun Bagan 1-0 to retain the Federation Cup, at the floodlit Barabati Stadium, here on Saturday.         
	Midfielder Reisangmi Vashum starred in the triumph, booting home the all-important goal in the 54th minute.         
	Receiving a pass from Robin Singh, Vashum beat two defenders before bulging the opposition net with a right-footer.         
	Mohun Bagan were surely unlucky.         
	Despite dominating the match for most of the 90 minutes and creating more scoring opportunities, they ended on the losing side.         
	A couple of decisions by referee Dinesh Nair also cost them dear.         
	Mohun Bagan had their share of chances as two goals from Asim Biswas and Subair Murithala Ali were disallowed, for foul and offside, respectively.         
	Mohun Bagans agony did not end there.         
	In the 88th minute, their leading scorer Murithala was given marching orders for the second yellow card in the match.         
	East Bengal won the match because they capitalised on their opportunities better.         
	Their victory margin would have been 2-0 but for Tolgay Ozebe who missed a penalty in the 20th minute.         
	The penalty was awarded when the Australian recruit was fouled inside the box by R. Dhanarajan.         
	But Ozebe, the joint-leading scorer of the tournament with Murithala, made a mess of the chance by shooting wide.         
	In fact, Mohun Bagan began the match aggressively with their forward duo of Murithala and Jose Barreto combining well.         
	But, Trevor Morgan-coached East Bengal did well to hold the striking duo.         
	Murithala came close to scoring in the seventh minute after he was set up by Okwe Diamondstar but Sandip Nandi did well to hold on.         
	Mohun Bagan missed another chance when Snehashish Chakrabortys free-kick flew past the rival goal.         
	Murithala did equalise but his shot was ruled offside.         
	The red and gold brigade had to rely on their defenders as forwards Ozebe and Robin Singh were bereft of service.         
	East Bengal thus became the second team after Mohameddan Sporting to win back to back Federation Cup titles. The 2009-10 triumph came under a Belgian  Phillippe de Ridder  and this time a British. One hopes, Morgan doesnt treat the AFC Cup, which East Bengal will play by virtue of winning the Fed Cup, the way the Belgian treated.

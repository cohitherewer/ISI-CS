                                                                                                                       7                                      Somdev aims at top 100
                      
	New Delhi: Armed with the confidemnce that he has it in him to perform at the highest level, Indian tennis poster boy Somdev Dev Varman has set himself the immediate target of breaking into the top-100 in singles while remaining consistent throughout the new year.         
	Somdev sparkled early in 2009 with a spectacular performance at the Chennai Open but struggled in the subsequent ATP tournaments.         
	In 2009, I had flashes of really good play and then I also had a lot of slumps. I know now that I have the ability to play at quite a high level. Im going to focus on doing that on a more consistent basis, Somdev said as he begins the season at the Chennai Open, starting January 4.         
	I know thats what I need to improve my ranking and become a better player. Its the consistency day in and day out thats going to make the difference. I need to stay very focused and give it my best shot. I am definitely aiming at breaking the top-100 soon, he added.         
	Somdev exceeded expectations last year by notching up some big wins en route to his runners-up finish at the Chennai Open.         
	Asked if he feels any difference coming to Chennai this year, he said: Not really.         
	Ive been preparing the same way and Im still trying to give myself the best shot at succeeding. My coach and trainer are here (Chennai) and were really focussing on doing whats best for me to get ready for the first round, Somdev said.         
	Last year he had stunned top players like Carlos Moya and Ivo Karlovic and Somdev has issued a warning to all the participants declaring that he is ready for the show.         
	I am having a hit twice everyday with a couple of short workouts. Ill tone it down once we get closer to the tournament. Physically, Im feeling really good. Im focussed on playing the right way and getting better, he said.         
	Somdev has been given a wild card for both singles and doubles for the Chennai event. He will partner another rising star Sanam Singh and reckons that playing the doubles would help his singles performance.         
	My focus is still going to be on singles. Doubles does help out my singles game a lot, but its a question of whether or not I can get into a lot of the tournaments, he said. (PTI)

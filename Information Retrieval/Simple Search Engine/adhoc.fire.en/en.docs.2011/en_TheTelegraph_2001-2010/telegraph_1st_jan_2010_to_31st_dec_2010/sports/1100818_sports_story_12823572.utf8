The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | New AIFF norm for foreign players
                                                                                                                       7                                      New AIFF norm for foreign players
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Tuesday, decided to scrap the idea of Player of Indian Origin (PIO) playing in the I-League, all-India tournaments and local leagues this season, allowing the clubs to register four foreigners, including one of Asian origin.         
	All clubs will be allowed to register four (three foreigners plus one Asian quota player) for all tournaments including I-League (Division 1 and 2), Federation Cup, All-India tournaments and local leagues for this season only, stated a press release issued by the AIFF.         
	However, only three of the foreign players can be in the actual playing eleven, the football federation statement further said.         
	Last season, the AIFF allowed five foreigners, including one PIO and one of Asian origin, to be registered by each club.         
	Meanwhile, the senior national team now training in Portugal, will take on Uniao Desportiva da Serra in a practice match on Wednesday at Pope John Paul II stadium Fatima.         
	The Bob Houghton-coached side will play against Clube Desportivo de Mafra on Thursday.         
	The Indian team has played six practice matches so far in their two-month training stint in Portugal which began on July 1, winning four, drawing and losing one game each.         
	Japanese Izumi Arata was one of the first players who played club football as PIO. He first joined East Bengal then switched over to Mahindra United before representing Pune FC during the last I-League.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lionel on the prowl 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Lionel on the prowl 
    - Superb goalkeeping denies striker, but Argentina sound note of warning           JAYDEEP BASU                                                              The many moods of Diego Maradona, during Argentinas World Cup opener against Nigeria, in Johannesburg, on Saturday. This was  Maradonas first World Cup match as the national coach. (Reuters/AP)      
	Johannesburg: On Friday, Diego Maradona had predicted Lionel Messi could be the cherry on the cake in the current World Cup. Twenty-four hours later, the Argentine striker displayed how close to the truth his coach had been when he steered the two-time World champions to a solitary goal win over Nigeria in their Group B match at Ellis Park.         
	While it is true that all efforts by the Barcelona livewire to find the target went in vain, that has more to do with some spectacular goalkeeping by the Super Eagles Israel-based goalkeeper Vincent Enyeema rather than any profligacy on part of the 2009-10 La Liga topscorer.         
	But even without getting his name on the scoresheet, Messi made it amply clear why he was regarded the best player in the world. He also silenced the doubters who dont seem to tire with their only-good-for-club-football rant against 22-year-old sensation.         
	Yet, before the match, there had been so much talk about the damage Messi could do to them that Nigeria coach Lars Lagerback was forced to say that he had not prepared the team to stop a particular player. Had Enyeema not been in goal, Lagerback would surely have been left to rue his decision not to pay special attention to Messi.         
	The atmosphere at Ellis Park was simply electrifying and the presence of Maradona saw the excitement reach fever pitch. The Argentine coach, making a return to the World Cup after 16 years  his last appearance as a player was also against Nigeria  hugged the opponent players and waved at the spectators when he decided to do a lap of the stadium an hour before kick off.         
	Looking dapper in a well-cut suit, the legend received huge cheers from the crowd when he stepped on to the pitch clutching a gold rosary in one hand as he smote his chest with the other. He also waved at his daughter and grandson, who were spotted in the stands. After this, he held up a newspaper picture of himself for the benefit of photographers.         
	Finally, when Gabriel Heinze scored the only goal of the match in the sixth minute, the coach appeared beside himself with joy. Only two minutes before this, striker Gonzalo Higuain had shot wide from the top of the six-yard box and Maradona was seen looking at the heavens.         
	The goal from Heinze was a beauty; the only time the Nigerian goalkeeper was beaten in the match. It took a diving header from the former Manchester United defender after Juan Sebastian Veron sent in a perfect corner kick. Lagerback later said it was mistake on the part of his defence but Heinzes attempt was simply too good for anyone to stop it.         
	Yet, all said and done, the hero of the day was Messi and not his coach, who was greeted with a placard saying the hand of God is back by some local soccer fans.         
	In the end, Messi had done everything except scoring. But the way he is playing, it wont be long before he starts getting the ball into the net. Only a few days back, Messi said: My aim is to keep improving day by day. I want to keep on growing, I want to learn the things I dont know and keep working on things I do know so that I dont forget.                     Heinze scored the winner

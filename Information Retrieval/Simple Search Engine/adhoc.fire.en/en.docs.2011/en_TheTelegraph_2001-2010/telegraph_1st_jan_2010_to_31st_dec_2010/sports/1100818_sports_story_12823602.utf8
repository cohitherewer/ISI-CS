The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chappell in frame to be a selector 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chappell in frame to be a selector 
                      
	Melbourne: Over two decades after he resigned as an Australian Test selector due to the archaic structure of the then cricket administration, former India coach Greg Chappell is in the running to take over the job once again.         
	The 62-year-old former Australia captain will appear for an interview later this week for becoming a full-time selector and if chosen, his responsibilities would also include being a national talent scout.         
	Current selection panel chief Andrew Hilditch will remain chairman until at least the end of the World Cup next year, a newspaper reported.         
	Chappell is currently the head coach of the Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.         
	Chappell, who had a controversy-ridden tenure as India coach, had a tumultuous time as national selector in the Eighties.         
	In 1988, Chappell quit the panel due to the archaic structure and mentality of the then cricket administration.         
	Cricket Australia manager Michael Brown said having a full-time selector would make the system more professional.         
	The creation of the position is a wonderful step for the professionalism of Australian cricket, Brown said.         
	We expect this person to play a key role in managing senior Australian teams and being available to communicate with current players and those who have been identified as potential Australian players, he added.         
	Chappell, 62, was appointed at the Centre of Excellence in 2008, a year after he finished an eventful term as Indias coach.           (AGENCIES)

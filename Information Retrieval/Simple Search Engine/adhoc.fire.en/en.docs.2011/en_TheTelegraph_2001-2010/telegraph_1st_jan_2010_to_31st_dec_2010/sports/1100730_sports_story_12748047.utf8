The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I am not No. 2: Massa 
                                                                                                                       7                                      I am not No. 2: Massa 
                      
	Budapest: Felipe Massa denied on Thursday that he was Ferraris No. 2 driver and said he was out to win in Hungary this weekend.         
	The Brazilian was at the centre of a row over so-called team orders at last Sundays German Grand Prix when he moved over to let teammate Fernando Alonso win after receiving a radio message while leading the race.         
	Yes, I will fight for victory here, whatever the conditions, Massa told a news conference on his return to the Hungaroring Formula One circuit where last year he suffered life-threatening head injuries.         
	Asked if he would therefore react differently if he found himself in the same position as last weekend, he replied: I will win. The time I say that I am a No. 2 driver, I will not race any more.         
	Alonso is fifth overall in the world championship standings, 34 points behind McLarens Lewis Hamilton, while Massa is eighth and a further 38 back.         
	Massa said what had happened at Hockenheim made him even stronger as a person and he bristled at a suggestion from a Brazilian reporter that he had betrayed his country by obeying the orders.         
	I will do everything I can always for my country, he said. For me, my country is the most important thing. I have proved already many times in my life...what I am able to do for my country.         
	Massa said he had spoken to everyone within Ferrari about the situation post-Hockenheim.         
	I want the best for the team, he said. I am not here really just to race. I am here to win. Thats really my point. As long as I am in the condition to win, we need to go to the end, to fight for the victory.

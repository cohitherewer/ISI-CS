The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies put India in   their place
                                                                                                                       7                                        Aussies put India in   their place
    - Hosts lose 2-5 to Charlesworths boys in 2nd Pool B TIE           JAYDEEP BASU            The scorers: Rajpal Singh amp; Vikram Pillay                                               
	New Delhi: For India, it was a night of disaster in the Hero Honda hockey World Cup at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium on Tuesday.         
	The 15,000-strong wildly cheering crowd that thronged the stands hoping to witness yet another winning show from the blue shirts was left hugely disappointed as India were thrashed 2-5 by Australia in their second Pool B encounter. The Champions Trophy winners could have scored one more goal but skipper Jamie Dwyer missed a penalty stroke in the second half.         
	The Indians, who were on a high after their breathtaking 4-1 win over archrivals Pakistan, found the Australians too hot to handle and had no clue whatsoever about the rivals game plan. The Aussies were truly awesome and slammed in three goals in a span of 26 minutes to leave the Indians absolutely stunned. The victory puts the Australians back in contention for a last-four berth.         
	It was also a night of redemption for Australia coach Ric Charlesworth. Hounded out by the authorities during his brief stint as the technical advisor of Indian hockey, Charlesworth must have been extremely pleased with the performance of his team. Never for a moment did he stay at the bench and the legendary coach kept shouting instructions at the top of his voice throughout the 70-minute encounter.         
	India coach Jose Brasa was upset with the defeat. The match was won and lost in the first 10 minutes, he said. We committed too many silly mistakes. We should not have given away a penalty corner so easily.         
	The Spaniard said that the Indians were not able to cope with the pace of the Aussies. The Aussies play at a fast pace which they have developed over the last 20 years. Whatever we have developed is in the last seven months.         
	The Indians were hit by a tsunami-like wave even before they could find their feet. The opening moments of the encounter saw defender Liam de Young moving in with lightning speed to take a swipe at the Indian goal. Indian goalkeeper Adrian DSouza was beaten hands down but the ball ricocheted off the post. Young immediately pounced on it to hit the target.         
	With the crowd still shouting India, India, the hosts were soon down 0-2 by the eighth minute when Glenn Turner struck off a penalty corner. The fate of the match was virtually sealed in the 26th when Desmond Abbot ran down the pitch to beat DSouza.         
	In reality, the loss can be put down to the sheer difference in class. While the Australians were rock solid in defence and midfield and sharp as a razor in attack, the Indians were mostly a blunt lot in every department.         
	Yet the spectators lived in false hope and backed the home team till the end. They roared in delight when Vikram Pillay made it 1-3 a minute before the half time and stood up to cheer their team whenever the Indians made any move.         
	The second goal by India, in the 53rd minute, was a classic example of the Indian style of hockey and undoubtedly the best goal of the day. By that time, the Aussies had made it 5-1 with Luke Doerner and Turner scoring two more. Arjun Halappa took the ball to the right and dribbled past three defenders before passing the ball for skipper Rajpal Singh to finish the job.

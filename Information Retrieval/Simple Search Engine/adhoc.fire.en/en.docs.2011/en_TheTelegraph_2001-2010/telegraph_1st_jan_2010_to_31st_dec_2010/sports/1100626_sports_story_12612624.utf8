The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Luck of draw now works for the US

	Landon Donovans stoppage-time goal did more for the United States than stave off elimination from the World Cup and ignite celebrations across the nation. It also put the Americans on a potential path to the semi-finals free of a confrontation with soccers traditional powers.         
	Their cardiac 1-0 victory over Algeria on Wednesday gave the Americans first place in Group C, and because of that they are in an attractive spot in the tournaments bracket.         
	They will face Ghana in the Round of 16 on Saturday, and should they win, they will go on to face the winner of the Uruguay-South Korea match in the quarter finals.         
	While Ghana, Uruguay and South Korea are all difficult to beat  if anything, this World Cup has shown that any team, no matter how modest their reputation, can defeat any other  none of them are considered giants of the game.         
	Of course, neither are the United States. But the benefits they reap for winning their group are appreciable.         
	Had the Americans finished second in Group C, their path would have looked more difficult. Their opponent in the Round of 16 would have been Germany. And had the Americans somehow survived that match-up, they would probably have had to face Argentina in the quarter finals         
	Instead, that is the task now confronting England.         
	The Americans have not won two straight matches at a World Cup since 1930. But if they beat Ghana, and then win a third straight game over either Uruguay or South Korea, they will finally run up against a soccer superpower in the semi-finals, most likely Brazil.         
	Should that happen, the Americans will be happy, anyway, since few would have suspected they would get that far in the first place. But before the Americans can think about quarter final and semi-final matches they have to beat Ghana  the team that eliminated them in 2006.         
	In that tournament, the Americans needed a victory over Ghana in the final-group match to advance, but they were beaten, 2-1.         
	This years World Cup may be different. The overall quality of the officiating appears better than in 2006 (there are, of course, exceptions, such as the controversy generated by Koman Coulibaly, who disallowed an American goal against Slovenia), and there appears to be less diving and fakery.         
	Meanwhile, Ghana still have nine players who were on the team in 2006, including Appiah, goalkeeper Richard Kingson and striker Asamoah Gyan. They are missing their playmaking star, Michael Essien of Chelsea, however. Essien is out with a knee injury, and Ghanas attack is not as potent as it was with him in the lineup.         
	Gyan, who is only 24 and is nicknamed Baby Jet, has scored three of Ghanas six goals in the 2006 and 2010 World Cups. He has scored both of Ghanas goals this year, each on penalty kicks: in a 1-0 win over Serbia and a 1-1 draw with Australia. In 2006, he struck on a left-footed rocket shot just 68 seconds into a 2-0 victory over the Czech Republic.         
	Gyan plays for Rennes in the French Ligue 1 but has drawn the interest of West Ham in the English Premier League. The task of shutting him down Saturday falls to an American defence that has been reconstituted by coach Bob Bradley.         
	Despite trepidation from some American fans over Bornsteins past errors, he and the rest of the defence performed well, sending home another one of the tournaments six African teams.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Glazers in no mood to part with United
                                                                                                                       7                                      Glazers in no mood to part with United
            [+uc('Oliver Kay   THE TIMES, LONDON')+]                      
	The Glazer family intend to resist any attempt by the Red Knights to buy Manchester United this summer, having rejected a 1.5 billion offer for the club from a Middle Eastern investment group.         
	A member of the Old Trafford hierarchy disclosed details on Thursday of a number of bids that the Glazers have received for United over the past 18 months.         
	The largest of which was for 1.5billion last year  and stated that the family will not countenance the idea of selling to the self-styled Red Knights, the group of powerful businessmen and wealthy investors who have formed an alliance with a view to buying the club.         
	The timing of the disclosure will inevitably attract scepticism among the Red Knights and United fans, who will believe that the Glazers have leaked the information to strengthen their negotiating position before they receive an opening offer in the region of 1 billion in the coming weeks.         
	United, though, maintain that their maligned American owners are long-term investors who will not be persuaded to sell at any price, as shown by their desire to reject the 1.5 billion offer from the Middle East.         
	Although a Chinese consortium was known to be planning a bid last December, no Middle Eastern interest had been made public. United have, however, developed strong links in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, having visited both countries for mid-season training camps over the past 18 months. The Glazers are determined to send out a defiant message over their plans for the club and to disprove the notion that they would be willing sellers.         
	There is great concern among Uniteds fanbase about the clubs debts, which stood at 716.5 million at the most recent count, and at the damaging payment in kind loans that could total 588 million by the time they are due to be repaid in 2017.         
	Uniteds activity in the transfer market last summer  when they spent only a fraction of the world-record 80 million fee they received from Real Madrid for Cristiano Ronaldo  increased the widely held perception that the debt has affected Sir Alex Fergusons budget.

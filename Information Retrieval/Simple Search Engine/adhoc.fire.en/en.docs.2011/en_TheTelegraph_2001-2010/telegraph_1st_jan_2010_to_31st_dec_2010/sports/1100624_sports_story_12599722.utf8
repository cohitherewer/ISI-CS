The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Our dream priceless, says Lucio
                                                                                                                       7                                      Our dream priceless, says Lucio
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Randburg: Wearing the national colours and looking as composed in front of microphones as he does at the centre of the defence, Brazil skipper Lucio more than made up for having kept newspersons waiting in excess of 20 minutes as he patiently answered their questions for almost double that time.         
	The mood in the Brazil camp, as Lucio made it known, was guarded, despite the favourites winning back-to-back matches against tricky rivals like North Korea and the Ivory Coast.         
	The biggest worry for the South Americans was not Fridays lip-smacking battle against Portugal, but the health of coach Dungas father.         
	All of us are very disturbed now, the Inter Milan defender said at the luxurious Fairway Hotel, the Selecaos base in South Africa.         
	Dungas father is seriously ill in Brazil. The coach is very upset and so are we. All of us are keeping a close tab on his health. Let us pray for his speedy recovery, said the Brazil captain.         
	Brazil have appeared solid at the back and the captain insisted that the free-flowing stuff  both on and off the field  was a result of the excellent relationship between the players in the squad.         
	We are here like a family. All of us are good friends and enjoy a fine relationship with each other. That is our secret, he said.         
	Dungas strained relationship with Brazilian media is well documented but at least the players are not affected by that.         
	I know a lot of things appear in the media. But to us, Dunga is a great coach. All of us are enjoying the World Cup under his leadership, Lucio said.         
	The only time Lucio looked upset was when someone asked him what bonus the players would receive if the team were to win the World Cup for a record sixth time.         
	Our dream is priceless, please dont weigh it in money, the captain shot back. No money can reward us being world champions. That is something we will have all our lives, said the veteran defender, also a member of the Brazil team that won the World Cup in 2002.         
	What was of concern, though, was their lack of discipline in the closing stages of the match, a trait that is clearly reflected in the teams propensity of leaking goals at the end.

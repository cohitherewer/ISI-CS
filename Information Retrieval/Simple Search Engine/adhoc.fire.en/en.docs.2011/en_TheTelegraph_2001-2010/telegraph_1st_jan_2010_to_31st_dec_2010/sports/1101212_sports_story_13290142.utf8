The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pak impressed with truck drivers speed! 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pak impressed with truck drivers speed! 
                                  HAQ    
	Karachi: A Pakistani truck driver, who works in Abu Dhabi, has become the topic of discussion in the training camp, being held in Lahore, for the national cricket team, ahead of their tour of New Zealand.         
	Abdul Haq has found himself in the media limelight in a matter of days after he showed up at the Pakistan teams nets, in Abu Dhabi last month, during the series against South Africa.         
	So impressed were the coaches and manager of the team with his ability and pace that they had him included as a practice bowler for the preparatory camp for the New Zealand series.         
	It is like a dream to be bowling to the Pakistan players. I am learning a lot just being here and getting a lot of tips from Waqar Younis and Aaqib Javed, Haq said.         
	The lanky 27-year old from the tribal area of South Waziristan was forced to leave Pakistan and find work as a truck driver in Abu Dhabi last year due to economic requirements.         
	I had played some matches in domestic cricket grade-two but gave up hope and left for Abu Dhabi because I needed to earn money for myself and family, Haq said.         
	He said that he now aspired to play for Pakistan. The coaches have asked some departmental teams to look at me and sign me on. They have also told me to keep on practising regularly, he said.         
	Sources did not rule out the possibility of the national selectors naming Haq in the preliminary squad for the World Cup as Pakistan cricket has a history of selecting little-known players and pushing them into the limelight.         
	There is no doubt he has talent and potential, but at the same time he is pretty raw, Waqar said.         
	Not surprisingly, Haqs heroes are Imran Khan and Waqar himself.         
	I grew up watching them on television and to be bowling under his (Waqars) guidance is a big plus for me, Haq said. (PTI)

            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AGENCIES                      
	Paris: Defending champion Roger Federer overcame a sloppy first set and two rain breaks to reach the French Open third round on Wednesday with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-4 win over Colombias Alejandro Falla.         
	Top seed Federer will tackle either Belgiums Olivier Rochus or German qualifier Julian Reister, the world No. 165 who hadnt won a match on the main tour until the French Open, for a place in the last 16. This is how this game has been played for decades, Federer said. Were used to walking on and off the court and being flexible about these kind of things.         
	Federer lost serve just once against Falla, at 5-all in the opening set, but broke back and hit four winners in the tie-breaker. From there only rain could slow Federer  the match was stopped for 15 minutes in the second set and for an hour in the third.         
	The texture of the clay changes drastically when theres no sun, he said. Conditions slow down a lot. ... There are advantages and disadvantages, and youve got to use them if you can.         
	Federer, who completed a career Grand Slam when he won at Roland Garros last year, is seeking his 17th major title.         
	After three days of warm sunshine, conditions were damp and cool for the start of round two. There was a third delay of 90 minutes after Federer finished, and because of a schedule backlog, two matches were postponed until Thursday.         
	The defending womens champion, No. 6-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova, overcame four matches points in the second set and beat Andrea Petkovic of Germany 4-6, 7-5, 6-4. Petkovic committed unforced errors on all four points.         
	Third-seeded Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark downed Tathiana Garbin of Italy 6-3, 6-1 to match her best result at the French Open on Wednesday.         
	Wozniacki had 26 winners to just six unforced errors and needed only 68 minutes to reach the third round.         
	Wozniacki, who reached last years US Open final, had lost only three games in her first-round match.         
	The 19-year-old Wozniacki lost in the first round on her Roland Garros debut in 2007 before reaching the third round in each of the past two years.         
	Before the rain, No. 5-seeded Robin Soderling won 20 of the first 22 points and went on to beat unseeded American Taylor Dent 6-0, 6-1, 6-1. Soderling, who upset Rafael Nadal last year and then lost to Federer in the final, has lost seven games through two matches.         
	Other mens winners included No. 8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, No. 10 Marin Cilic and No. 11 Mikhail Youzhny.         
	Only one seeded player lost in either draw: Guillermo Garcia-Lopez of Spain. He was beaten by Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (5), 7-5.         
	Venus Williams used her big serve to beat Arantxa Parra Santonja of Spain 6-2, 6-4, improving to a 14-2 win-loss record on clay in 2010. Shes seeded second at Roland Garros behind younger sister Serena, who scouted from behind the baseline, sitting next to their father. The sisters could meet in the final.         
	In other womens play, No. 26 Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia rallied past Varvara Lepchenko of the United States 4-6, 6-2, 6-0. Cibulkova, a semi-finalist last year, faces Venus next. Ill continue to try to execute my game and not worry really a ton about what my opponent is doing, Venus said. Serves at up to 206 kph kept her in control of her match, and she was never broken.         
	Two-time semi-finalist Nadia Petrova, seeded 19th, beat Agnes Szavay of Hungary 6-1, 6-2. No. 14 Flavia Pennetta defeated Roberta Vinci 6-1, 6-1 in an all-Italian match.         
	For the days opening match on Centre Court, Venus again wore her lacy corset despite a brisk change in the weather, with mostly cloudy skies. At her post-match news conference, there were seven questions about her outfit.         
	Lace has never been done before in tennis, and Ive been wanting to do it for a long time, she said. The illusion of just having bare skin is definitely for me a lot more beautiful.         
	Venus sent her flounce flying when she served. She went to deuce six times in her first service game before holding, then pulled away to take the set.         
	In the second set, both players held until the seventh game. Venus drew Parra Santonja into a moonball rally, then sprinted forward to slam a winner. That gave Venus a 4-3 lead, and she served out the victory, her 28th in 32 matches this year.         
	In 13 previous French Open appearances, Venus reached the semi-finals only once  in 2002, when she lost to Serena in the final. But at 29 shes enjoying a career resurgence, and her record this year is the best on the womens Tour.         
	Soderling remained on course for a Roland Garros rematch against Federer in the quarter finals.         
	Im feeling good, Soderling said. I won two matches pretty easy in straight sets, and I didnt have to run for many hours on court so far, so I feel fresh.         
	Tsonga, Frances best title hope, defeated countryman Josselin Ouanna 6-0, 6-1, 6-4. Cilic swept Daniel Gimeno-Traver of Spain 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-2, and Youzhny rallied past Lukas Lacko of Slovakia 6-7, (8), 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.

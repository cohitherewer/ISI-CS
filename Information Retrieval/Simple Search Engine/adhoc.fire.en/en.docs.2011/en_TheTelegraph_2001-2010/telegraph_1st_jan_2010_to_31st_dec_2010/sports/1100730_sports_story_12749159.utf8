	Nottingham: A brilliant maiden Test hundred by Eoin Morgan put England in a strong position on a fascinating first day of the Test series against Pakistan.         
	Morgan proved his credentials as a Test player scoring an unbeaten 125 and rescuing his side from trouble at 118 for four.         
	Before this innings question marks surrounded his temperament for Test cricket but Morgan answered those with a solid display of defence and his usual attacking strokes.         
	Paul Collingwood offered vital support and had a Test century in sight after adding 213 for the fifth wicket with Morgan to set a England record at Trent Bridge.         
	Pakistan relied too much on the left-arm swing of Mohammad Aamer, the teenager did respond with three wickets, but apart from a few decent overs from Mohammad Asif, the rest of the bowling was poor.         
	Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal also dropped a simple catch off Andrew Strauss and missed an easy stumping that would have sent Collingwood on his way. It was comical stuff from the wicketkeeper and capped a tough day for the touring side.         
	Morgan struck 18 fours and brought up his century with a thumping straight six off Shoaib Malik.         
	He did need the support of the referral system (DRS) to survive, benefitting from one of five decisions made throughout the day.         
	He was given out lbw to Danish Kaneria on 78 but Hawkeye proved the ball was missing leg stump. Morgan shrugged off the chance and went on to reach his century off 151 balls.         
	Others did not find the going so easy. Alastair Cook endured a torrid time against Aamer in the first hour before eventually nicking a delivery to slip.         
	Andrew Strauss was batting well but lost his concentration as lunch loomed edging a lifting delivery from Aamer to Akmal, who had earlier dropped him on 15.         
	Kevin Pietersens poor run in Test cricket continued, it is now 15 matches since his last century, when he was bowled off an inside edge from Mohammad Asif.         
	Jonathan Trott had looked solid but padded up to a delivery that slanted back into him. He was given out lbw and the decision was upheld despite Trotts appeal. It was about the last thing to go right for Pakistan.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

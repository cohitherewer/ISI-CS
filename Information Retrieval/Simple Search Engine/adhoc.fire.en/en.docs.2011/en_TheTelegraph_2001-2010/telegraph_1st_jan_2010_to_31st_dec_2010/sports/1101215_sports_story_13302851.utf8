	Calcutta: Top seed and defending champion Sayantan Das of Scottish Church Collegiate School scored yet another facile victory as he outplayed Nishant Kumar of Rajendra Vidyalaya, Jharkhand, in the fifth round of the 22nd The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship at Gorky Sadan here on Tuesday. A clear leader is yet to emerge, as nine players are bunched at the top with five points apiece.         
	The tournament is organised by Alekhine Chess and presented by Himani Sona Chandi Chyawanprash.         
	Third seed Diptayan Ghosh of South Point bounced back after his unexpected draw Monday. He decimated Rahul Raj with consummate ease in a queens pawn opening, which later transposed into a French defence. Like schoolmate Mitrabha, Diptayan had less time on the clock as he arrived late Tuesday since he had a test in school.         
	Prince Bajaj of Delhi Public School, Ghaziabad, methodically exploited the pawn weaknesses of Dhriti Shankar by a piece sacrifice which opened up the position and left his opponents monarch bereft of support. Fifth seed Chandrasish Majumder of St Xaviers Collegiate School outwitted Delhi Public Schools (Dhanbad) Kumar Sanu in a Sicilian defence.         
	In yet another impressive performance, nine-year-old Mitrabha Guha of South Point (National U-9 champion) held ninth seed Adiya Chakraborty of Delhi Public School, Ruby Park. He now has 4.5 points to his credit.         
	Former Asian U-8 champion Khusi Dharewa of Ashok Hall, too, won her game against higher-rated, Suvankar Maity in a Sicilian defence.         
	Don Bosco Park Circus Aubhropratim Manna effectively changed flanks to exploit his superior space advantage to get the better of former Commonwealth U-10 champion Shoumi Mukherjee of Kendriya Vidyalaya in 40 moves.

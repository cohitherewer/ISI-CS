The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roger gears up for clay court season
                                                                                                                       7                                        Roger gears up for clay court season
                  Roger Federer                     
	Miami: Only hours after his upset loss at the Miami Open last week, Roger Federer was back at practice, hitting across the street on the Ritz Carltons courts.         
	Theyre clay.         
	The mens tour switches to clay this week, and Federer has already started preparing to defend the French Open title he won last year to complete a career Grand Slam. He no longer approaches with trepidation the surface that for so long tripped him up, and in the wake of a so-so showing last month on US hard courts, hes ready for a switch.         
	It helps to move on to a different surface, Federer said. Im looking forward to the clay court season.         
	Ranked No. 1, as he has been for most of the past six years, Federer won his 16th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. He withdrew from Dubai in February because of a lung infection, then lost in March at Indian Wells and Miami, both Masters 1000 events.         
	Marcos Baghdatis beat him in a third-set tiebreaker in the third round at Indian Wells after Federer held three match points. Thomas Berdych beat him in a third-set tiebreaker in the fourth round in Miami last week after Federer held one match point.         
	Maybe the sickness did take it out of me more than I thought, Federer said. I could have done much better.         
	Federers record in Masters 1000 tournaments  one level below the majors  has been mixed for several years. Since the beginning of 2007, he has won seven of the 13 Grand Slam events (54 percent) but only four of 28 Masters 1000 tournaments (14 percent).         
	That shows his priorities. Federer has entered clay-court events this spring in Rome, Estoril and Madrid, but everyone knows hes pointing primarily toward Paris, where the French Open begins May 24.         
	Despite unimpressive results over the past month, Federer is expected to be a title contender at Roland Garros. Nemesis Rafael Nadal will be the favourite, but he has slipped a notch while battling knee problems that sidelined him for more than two months last year.         
	Nadal lost in the semi-finals at Indian Wells and Miami, and it has been 11 months since his most recent title, in Rome. Hes without a title victory in his past 13 tournaments after losing to Andy Roddick last week.         
	Nonetheless, Nadal expressed satisfaction with his 16-4 record this year on hard courts. The four-time French Open champion said hes ready for a big season on the clay he loves, begin at Monte Carlo next week.         
	Im very happy how I am doing, Nadal said. I think I am ready to play my best.         
	Nadal remains Federers biggest threat on clay, while other contenders at the French Open will include Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic. Soderling last week reached the Miami semi-finals, and last year ended Nadals Roland Garros winning streak at 31 matches. Djokovic is a two-time semi-finalist at Roland Garros.         
	Unlikely to be a French Open title threat is Miami champion Andy Roddick, who leads the tour with 26 victories this year. Hes only 7-8 at Roland Garros, although last years run to the fourth round was his best yet.         
	We always say we play well for 20 per cent of the year, badly for 20 per cent of the year, and that middle 60 percent makes the difference, Roddick said.           (AGENCIES)

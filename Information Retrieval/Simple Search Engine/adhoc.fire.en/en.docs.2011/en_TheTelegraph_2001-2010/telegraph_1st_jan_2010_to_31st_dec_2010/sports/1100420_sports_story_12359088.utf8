                                                                                                                       7                                      Spinners have adjusted well to T20: Kartik
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Murali Kartik said on Monday that the spinners have adjusted well to the T20 format and that has been the secret behind their success.         
	The Man of the Match in the match between the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Mumbai Indians also said at a press conference that he would have liked to hold on to the two dropped catches that could have changed the Knight Riders fortunes in this edition.               
	The following are excerpts               
	Spinners success in T20         
	People thought spinners were canon-fodder But they went back (after the first season) and learnt the tricks of the trade. Theres no doubting the quality of spinners like Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha. The ball gripped a bit in South Africa last year, and they exploited the conditions there. This time the spinners have got used to the tricks of the trade of T20 The change of pace, variations They have also adjusted well to the conditions. Good bowlers learn fast         
	His performance         
	Personally, I would have liked to improve slightly more I havent been among the top wicket-takers but have been up there among the most economical. I also missed four of the matches because of my groin strain From the team point of view, theres no doubt weve under-performed for the third year in succession. We arent where we should have been.         
	If he wishes to change anything on the personal front         
	The dropped catches that cost us the matches The one of Mahela Jayawardene that proved crucial in the end Also, had I managed to hold on to Sachin Tendulkars return catch in Mumbai, things could have changed for the better.         
	Reasons behind KKRs disappointing performance         
	The match against the Kings XI Punjab comes to mind first, because we lost after making 200 We also shouldnt have lost against the Rajasthan Royals in Ahmedabad. This format is all about momentum, and if you dont manage to win the big moments, youve had it Basically, thats what happened to us         
	The positives         
	Weve got some outstanding youngsters Harpreet Singh, Mandeep Singh, Jaydev Unadkat, Iqbal Abdulla, Mohnish Parmar, Ashok Dinda Among other things, despite all that has happened in the three years, weve been a closely knit unit.         
	Sachins batting in this edition         
	I dont wish to talk much about God the less said the better. People think T20 is all about slogging but batsmen like him and Mahela have shown that proper cricketing shots can also achieve the desired results.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies won on merit vs Pak: ICC
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies won on merit vs Pak: ICC
                            
	Melbourne: The ICC has stopped investigating the Australia-Pakistan Sydney Test after finding no evidence of match-fixing, a Cricket Australia spokesman said.         
	The Test, which Pakistan lost from an advantageous position, was under the scanner as the then coaches Intikhab Alam and Aaqib Javed suspected match-fixing by their players, particularly stumper Kamran Akmal.         
	According to media reports, the outgoing ICCs Anti Corruption and Security Unit head Paul Condon, who was looking into the match-fixing claims, has given a clean chit to Pakistan.         
	Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland had sought information from the ICC when Condon revealed last week that they were investigating the Test.         
	The ICC has replied, saying it has seen no evidence of match-fixing and that there is no current investigation of match-fixing, CA spokesman Peter Young was quoted as saying.         
	Haroon Lorgat has assured James Sutherland that Australia won the match on its merits. Lord Condon found evidence of a demoralised team and warned that cricket authorities needed to be extra vigilant, Young added.         
	Pakistan on that ill-fated tour were whitewashed by Australia as they lost the Test and ODI series and also a Twenty20 International.         
	The disastrous outcome led to the Pakistan Cricket Board forming an inquiry committee to probe the national teams failure Down Under.         
	Appearing before the committee, Alam and Javed suspected match fixing. The committee recommended bans and fines on seven players, including Mohammed Yousuf and Younis Khan for alleged indiscipline.         
	The proceedings of the committee were recently leaked and created a stir as Alam and Javed suspected match-fixing apart from revealing the politics and infighting in the team.         
	Akmal has threatened to sue the team management over cheating allegations surrounding his performance in the Sydney Test.         
	The wicketkeeper dropped four catches and missed a run-out in Australias second innings.         
	I am fed up with these allegations. My family is disturbed. I go out and people hoot me and I am mentally disturbed, Akmal said recently.         
	I want to clear this unwarranted stigma with my name. I want an apology from these people.           (AGENCIES)

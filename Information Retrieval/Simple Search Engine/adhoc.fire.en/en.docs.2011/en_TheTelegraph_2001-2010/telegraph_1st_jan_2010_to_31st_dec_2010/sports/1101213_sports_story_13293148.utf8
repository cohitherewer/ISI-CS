The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Wasim hits out at BCCI
                                                                                                                       7                                      Wasim hits out at BCCI
                      
	New Delhi: India are playing too much cricket resulting in injuries to their pacers and that could hurt the teams chances in next years World Cup, feels former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram.         
	Akram said Indias South African tour just before the World Cup in February, has been ill-timed and will only exhaust the Indian players.         
	I have been keenly following Indian cricket for a while and I can say that they are playing too much cricket. Making a balanced cricketing calendar has been a problem with the BCCI for the last five-six years. India play far too many matches round the year and no wonder their fast bowlers are getting injured, said Akram.         
	I will beg to differ with Imran Khans views on Indias South Africa tour. Imran has said a tough tour of South Africa, ahead of the World Cup, will stand India in good stead. Not really.

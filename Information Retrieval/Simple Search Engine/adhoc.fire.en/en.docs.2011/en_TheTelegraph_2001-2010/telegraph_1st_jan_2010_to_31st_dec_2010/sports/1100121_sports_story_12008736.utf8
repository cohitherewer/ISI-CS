	This tournament will definitely add to the growing popularity of the game in the country, said Luthra.

	Former England captain and MCC president Tony Lewis said: I never thought that this kind of a tournament will be held. I hope that I have a great time in the next few days.         
	The Royals Trophy wont be a prize-money tournament and no cut will be applied.         
	 The golfers will represent their clubs and also there will be an inter-continental team competition.         
	Apart from hosts RCGC, the other Royal clubs who will take part, include Royal Musselburgh from Scotland. Royal Musselburgh holds the distinction of being one of the first golf clubs to be bestowed with the Royal Charter.

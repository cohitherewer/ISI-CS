The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | The attack was very scary: Button
                                                                                                                       7                                      The attack was very scary: Button
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Sao Paulo: Formula One world champion Jenson Button said the attempted attack by armed men on his car as he left the Brazilian Grand Prix was a pretty scary situation, and that he only escaped thanks to the undercover police officer who was driving his vehicle.         
	The driver was a legend, a great guy, he got us out of trouble, Button said as he arrived at the Interlagos track for Sundays race.         
	The driver swiftly drove Button and the other people in the car through traffic and away from danger, making sure nobody was hurt in Saturday nights incident.         
	We got between six cars to get past and got away, Button later said at a press conference. Looking behind there were two guys with hand guns and one guy with what looked like a machine gun.         
	It was a very scary situation, he said. Its not a very comfortable feeling, not great.         
	Buttons father, John, also was in the car along with physiotherapist Mike Collier and manager Richard Goddard.         
	McLaren said it had provided Button and teammate Lewis Hamilton with reinforced armoured vehicles driven by armed police drivers who were trained in avoidance techniques.         
	We were probably unlucky more than anything else, Button said, adding the assailants all looked quite young.         
	The British driver said he left the track at about 7 p.m. local time (around 2.30 a.m. IST) and the attack happened when they stopped at a traffic light about a kilometre (0.6 mile) from the track.         
	The driver obviously didnt feel comfortable and stopped about a car length back, Button said. We looked to the right and saw five or six guys walk out of this building at the edge of the road. They looked suspicious. Then they started running toward the car.         
	Button, who was sitting in the front seat of the armoured Mercedes with tinted windows, said the driver angled the car to speed past other vehicles and drive to safety.         
	He floored it, banging through other cars and eventually got through, Button said. He did quite a job, really did.         
	Goddard said: I noticed one of the guys had what looked like a big truncheon and then someone shouted One of them has got a gun, he said. And another one seemed to have a much bigger weapon. The guy pulled the gun out and someone else pulled an even bigger one out and they came running over towards the car. We told the driver Go, Go, Go.         
	Sao Paulo authorities said that they had not been notified of the attack.         
	Every year local police increase security around the track, which is located in the middle of the city in a mostly poor neighbourhood.         
	In 2007, a group of gun-wielding youths held up spectators in three cars leaving the circuit, and in 2006 members of the Toyota team also were attacked by armed youth as they left the track. No one was hurt.         
	Button said he believed Saturdays attack was random. It happens every year, but its the first time that it has happened to a driver, he said.         
	Its not a very nice feeling having to come to work in a bulletproof car with a policeman as the driver and two police cars, one in front and one in back, but thats the way it is.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Riaz rattles the hosts
                                                                                                                       7                                        Riaz rattles the hosts
                  Wahib Riaz celebrates after dismissing Eoin Morgan at the Oval, on Wednesday                     
	London: Wicket-keeper Matt Prior dug England out of deep trouble with an unbeaten 84 on the first day of the third Test, on Wednesday, as Pakistan reversed their terrible form of the first two Tests. Fast bowler Wahab Riaz made a stunning Test debut with five for 63 as England were bowled out for 233 before the visitors made a solid start in reply, reaching 48 for one at the close.         
	Prior added 119 for the eighth wicket with Stuart Broad (48), an England record against Pakistan, after his team had slumped to 94 for seven.         
	England lead 2-0 in the four-match series.         
	Riaz, a strongly built left-armer, proved an excellent replacement for the injured Umar Gul when he was handed the ball for the ninth over at the Pavilion End after England had won the toss and elected to bat.         
	He accounted for Andrew Strauss (15), Jonathan Trott (12), Kevin Pietersen (6), Eoin Morgan (17) and Broad, generating menacing bounce from a powerful action.         
	Mohammed Asif was once again consistently dangerous with his late movement through the air, taking three for 68. Asif started Englands steep decline by dismissing the woefully out-of-form Alastair Cook for six in his opening over before wrapping up the tail.         
	Cook has now scored just 106 runs in his last eight Test innings.         
	Strauss, on two, survived a leg before shout by Asif to a delivery which television replays indicated would have struck leg stump.           (REUTERS)

	Calcutta: In a battle between former champions, Australia and Pakistan clash in the ICC under-19 World Cup 2010 final at the Burt Sutcliffe Oval, Christchurch, on Saturday with both the sides aiming to become the first country to win the tournament three times.         
	Australia lifted the trophy in 1988 and in 2002 while Pakistan won back-to-back titles in 2004 and 2006. Australias victories came in their own backyard and in New Zealand while Pakistan were victorious when the events were staged in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.         
	The two sides have met six times in under-19 World Cups with Pakistan winning four contests. They won the league games in 1988 and 1998 by 32 and 27 runs respectively before winning by 163 runs in the semi-final in 2006 and by six wickets in the quarter final in 2008.         
	One of Australias two victories was in the inaugural final in 1988 when a Stuart Law-inspired team defeated Pakistan by five wickets in Adelaide.         
	Australias second and last victory over Pakistan in a World Cup was in 2000 in Sri Lanka where it won its group stage match by 27 runs.         
	In the tournament so far, Pakistan are the only unbeaten side, having won their matches against the West Indies (by 40 runs), Papua New Guinea (by six wickets), Bangladesh (by four wickets) in the group stage before overpowering defending champions India by two wickets in the quarter final and the West Indies in the semi-final by four wickets.         
	In contrast, Australia lost their group stage match against South Africa by two wickets in a high-scoring thriller in Queenstown but recorded comfortable victories against the US (by 108 runs), Ireland (by 209 runs), New Zealand (by 62 runs) before ending the challenge of Sri Lanka in the semi-final by two wickets.

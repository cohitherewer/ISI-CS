                                                                                                                       7                                      Ishfaq mulls going back
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Mohun Bagan captain Ishfaq Ahmed has been quite worried of late. Due to a tense situation in Kashmir, the star midfielder is concerned about the security of his ageing parents.         
	I am not being able to concentrate during training sessions. I am always thinking about my parents, who live in Srinagar, Ishfaq said.         
	The situation is pretty bad and I am always tense about their security. They are allowed to get out of the house for one hour only (6 am-7 am) to buy groceries.         
	There are times when I am unable to talk to them as the telephone lines are blocked, Ishfaq said on Thursday.         
	I am planning to talk to coach (Stanley Rozario) and the officials and tell them that I am not in the mental state to practice.         
	May be I will just go back and bring them here before our residential camp in Siliguri starts, Ishfaq stated.         
	Meanwhile, Sergei Tokov will join Chirag training from Saturday.

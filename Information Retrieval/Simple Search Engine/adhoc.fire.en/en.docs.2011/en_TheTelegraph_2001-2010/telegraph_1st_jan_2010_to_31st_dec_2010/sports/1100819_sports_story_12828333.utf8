The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Neymar should stay back: Pele
                                                                                                                       7                                      Neymar should stay back: Pele
                      
	Porto Alegre: Legendary Pele feels that young Brazil striker Neymar would make a mistake if he moved to Chelsea to play in the English Premier League.         
	Chelsea have reportedly been trying to sign Neymar, but Brazil legend Pele said on Wednesday that he thinks the 18-year-old Santos sensation is not prepared to play in England yet.         
	Pele said that Neymar would not easily adapt to the style of play in the English league and would be better off staying in Brazil for the time being.         
	Chelseas initial offer reached euro20 million ($26 million) according to reports, but Santos club authorities stated it will not sell Neymar unless the euro 35 million ($45 million) buyout clause is paid.         
	Brazil coach Mano Menezes and sports minister Orlando Silva are also said to be in favour of Neymar staying in his home country. Robinho who is with Manchester City, has not enjoyed his stay in England and spent most of last season on loan in Brazil.

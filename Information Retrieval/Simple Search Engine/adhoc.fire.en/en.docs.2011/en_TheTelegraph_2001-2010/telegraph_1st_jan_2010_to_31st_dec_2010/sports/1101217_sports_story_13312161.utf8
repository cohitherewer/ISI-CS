The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | I was nervous, admits Chris
                                                                                                                       7                                        I was nervous, admits Chris
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH            Chris Tremlett celebrates taking one of his three wickets, in Perth. (Reuters)                           
	Perth: Chris Tremlett dismissed his image as a gentle giant after marking his return to Test with a new-ball spell that set England up for a strong first day of the third Ashes Test at the Waca.         
	Tremlett delivered after Andrew Strauss had taken the decision to bowl first in Perth, removing Phillip Hughes with the 12th ball of the match and finishing with three for 63 as Australia succumbed for 268.         
	This is Tremletts first Test for more than two years but he slipped easily into the England attack in place of the injured Stuart Broad.         
	It was a big step in my career to hit my straps straightaway and contribute to an important game so Im very happy, he said.         
	When I woke up this morning I was very nervous but when I got into my stride and bowled the first over and got the wicket I felt at ease and tried to enjoy the experience.         
	It was a very exciting and enjoyable day. People can say what they want about me being a gentle giant but once I get the ball in my hand, I try my hardest and be aggressive with the ball.

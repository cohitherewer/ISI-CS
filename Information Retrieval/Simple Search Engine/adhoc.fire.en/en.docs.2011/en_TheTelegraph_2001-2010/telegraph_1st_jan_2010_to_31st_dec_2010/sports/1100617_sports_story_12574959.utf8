                                                                                                                       7                                      Decos heat of the moment
                      
	 Magaliesburg: Portugal midfielder Deco has issued a public statement denying any friction with coach Carlos Queiroz at the World Cup. Deco was critical of Queirozs tactics and substitutions after Portugals 0-0 draw with Ivory Coast on Tuesday, saying they were strange and not as good as they might have been. He says he expressed his opinions in the heat of the moment and had not intended to question Queirozs leadership.         
	Disc gone wrong         
	Irene: Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon has a new problem. He has a small herniated disc after suffering a sciatic nerve problem. The 32-year-old is definitely out of Sundays game against New Zealand, will almost certainly not play in the final group match with Slovakia on June 24 and could miss much more.         
	Minimum offence         
	Johannesburg: Two Dutch women were released on bail Wednesday after facing charges that they broke a law covering ambush marketing by wearing mini dresses promoting a brewery at a World Cup match. The women are being prosecuted under the Contravention of Merchandise Marks Act, which prevents companies benefiting from an event without paying for advertising.         
	Cry for Cahill         
	Johannesburg: Australia has lodged a plea for leniency with Fifa over Tim Cahills red card against Germany, in a bid to have him back for their third group game, against Serbia. Cahill receives an automatic one-match ban covering Saturdays game against Ghana, but Fifa can increase the penalty.         
	Mothers advice         
	Erasmia: Do what your mother always told you, Germany coaches have been telling players. All the players have to follow the type of advice your mother gave you. Blow dry your hair after the shower and always dress warm, assistant coach Hansi Flick said.         
	French plea rejected         
	Polokwane: Fifa has turned down a request from France to replace their injured goalkeeper Cedric Carrasso at the World Cup.

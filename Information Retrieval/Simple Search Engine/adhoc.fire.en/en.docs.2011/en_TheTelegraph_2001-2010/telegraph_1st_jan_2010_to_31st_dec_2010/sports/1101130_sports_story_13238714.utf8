	Calcutta/Brisbane: Australia called up two more quick bowlers to their squad for the second Ashes Test as they continue to search for the killer touch that again eluded them in the first Test at the Gabba on Monday.         
	We got ourselves in a good position in the game through our batting, said Ponting. Even this morning coming to the ground I felt only one team was good enough to win this game if we were good enough to take some early wickets.         
	We werent good enough this morning so it ended up unusually being a drawn game at the Gabba.         
	Australia responded by calling up Ryan Harris and Doug Bollinger to supplement their fast bowling corps of Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle and Ben Hilfenhaus for the Adelaide Test.         
	Bollinger, who is returning from a side strain, was left out of the team for the first Test in favour of Siddle. Harris, who is also on the comeback trail after knee surgery, was included in the original 17-man Australia squad for the Gabba Test.         
	The Squad: Ricky Ponting (captain), Michael Clarke (vice-captain), Doug Bollinger, Xavier Doherty, Brad Haddin, Ryan Harris, Ben Hilfenhaus, Mike Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Marcus North, Peter Siddle, Shane Watson.

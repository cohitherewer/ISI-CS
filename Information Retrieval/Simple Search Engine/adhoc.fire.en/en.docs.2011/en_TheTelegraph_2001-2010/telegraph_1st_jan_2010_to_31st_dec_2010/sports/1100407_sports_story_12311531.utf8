	Augusta: South Korean KJ Choi and American Matt Kuchar will have to contend with the Tiger Woods frenzy after being grouped with the world No.1 for the first two rounds of the US Masters on Thursday and on Friday.         
	Predictably, the comeback of Woods has overshadowed everything else in the build-up to the years first Major and he is scheduled to tee off with Choi and Kuchar at 11.12 p.m. IST in Thursdays opening round at Augusta, the penultimate group.         
	Woods and company will tee off in the second-to-last group on Thursday, guaranteeing that at least half of his opening round will be televised live in the United States.

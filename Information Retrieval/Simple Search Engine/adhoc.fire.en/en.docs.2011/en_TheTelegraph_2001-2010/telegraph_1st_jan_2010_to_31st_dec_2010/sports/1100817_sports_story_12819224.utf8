                                                                                                                       7                                        Ponting: Whitewash of England possible
  - Hauritz is first choice spinner for India tour       THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES            Ricky Ponting                                 
	Ricky Ponting has said it is absolutely possible that Australia could repeat their 5-0 Ashes whitewash against England Down Under this winter.         
	Ponting, who lost the Ashes for a second time as captain in the 2-1 series defeat in England last year, said the Australians had learnt from their mistakes and were a better side.         
	Australia have slipped to fourth, narrowly ahead of England, in the Test rankings after their 1-1 drawn Test series against sixth-ranked Pakistan in England last month.         
	But Ponting, who met Cricket Australia officials in Melbourne on Monday to map out preparations for the November-January Ashes series, is undaunted.         
	Its absolutely possible. Theres no reason why not, Ponting said when asked about a 5-0 Ashes sweep.         
	Its all in our hands. Its how well we play and how well we take charge of different situations.         
	Weve learnt from a lot of the mistakes that weve made.         
	Theres no doubt we made some mistakes in the last Ashes series in England that probably at the end of the day cost us the series.         
	We know now that were a more experienced and probably a better team now than we were then.         
	We put that together plus were playing in our conditions, we hope to win this series and win it well.         
	Ive got confidence in the squad of players that weve got that they are going to be good enough to win an Ashes series.         
	The opening Ashes Test begins at Brisbanes Gabba ground on November 25.         
	But before that the Aussies visit India on a Test and ODI tour and, a spinner being an indispensable weapon on subcontinental wickets, the Australia Test captain Monday picked Nathan Hauritz as his first choice spinner for the contests against India as well as the Ashes after that.         
	The 29-year-old off-spinner, who has taken 57 wickets at an average of 31.82 in 15 Tests, has only recently started practising after recuperating from a foot injury that he sustained during the ODI series in England in June.         
	Ive spoken a bit to Nathan over the last couple of weeks. He has started running again without a pain in his foot, which is a good sign. He started bowling again last week, Ponting told reporters here.         
	Ill be doing a lot of work with him over the next few weeks. Ill be facing a lot of him (at nets), considering weve got Graeme Swann and Harbhajan Singh to confront over the next few months.         
	Is he a lock-in? I think so. What hes done over the last 12 or 18 months as our No.1 spinner has been of the highest quality, he added.         
	With him back to full fitness I think hell get himself back into the side again, he said.

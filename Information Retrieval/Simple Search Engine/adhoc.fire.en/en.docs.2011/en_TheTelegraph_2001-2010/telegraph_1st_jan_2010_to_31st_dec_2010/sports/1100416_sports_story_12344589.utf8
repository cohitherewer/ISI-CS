	New Delhi: Top seed Saina Nehwal dished out yet another classic of authoritative badminton to reach the quarter finals at the Yonex-Sunrise Badminton Asia championships on Thursday.         
	Playing before a near-full house at the Siri Fort Sports Complex, the Hyderabad star produced a dazzling array of strokes to tame Julia Pei Xian Wong of Malaysia 21-14, 21-16 and set up a clash with another Malaysian, seventh seed Mew Choo Wong.         
	Sainas victory was expected; the pleasant surprise was provided by the gritty Aditi Mutatkar, who reached the womens singles quarter finals with her 23-21, 21-11 defeat of Chinese Taipeis Hsiao Huan Chen.         
	The biggest upset came in the mens section when top seed and former world and Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat was sent packing by Chinese Taipeis Hsuan Yi Hsueh in the pre-quarter finals.         
	Its a game. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose a nonchalant Hidayat said after going down 20-22, 16-21 to his unseeded rival.         
	Back to Aditi, the Pune girl who has just returned from injury but gave a very good account of herself on Thursday. This is my first quarter final entry in an ABC tournament and it has boosted my confidence. I have become stronger mentally, Aditi said. She now plays Chinese qualifier Xin Liu for a place in the semi-finals.         
	Saina, on the other hand, warned that things would not be easy in the quarters. Mew is a tough customer. We know each others game inside out But I am playing well and hope to win, she said. Given the manner in which Saina moved around the court against Julia, there is reason to believe her.         
	On Thursday, the Malaysian, who had overcome injury blues last month to make the Asian meet, could hardly withstand the pressure in the match against her Indian rival. With the crowd cheering Saina, Saina throughout the 27-minute encounter, the world No.6 proved too good for Wong in the first game.         
	There was no change in the script at the start the second but Saina temporarily lost her touch after racing to an 8-3 lead. She lost eight consecutive points but recovered in time to pocket the match.         
	The Indian star later blamed the drift in the court as the reason for her losing too many points. There was some drift in the stadium that was not easy to cope with. The shuttle was travelling faster on one side of the court. Even my opponent had problems. she complained.         
	My rival played well in patches. Overall, I was in control. Against Mew, I have to be extremely careful. We have beaten each other on a couple of occasions in various tournaments, Saina said.         
	Also advancing to the quarters in the mixed doubles were Jwala Gutta and V. Diju, who defeated Sheng Mu Lee and Yu Chin Chien 24-22, 21-15 in a seesaw battle that lasted close to an hour.

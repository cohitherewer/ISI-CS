The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | SRK tweet adds to the drama
                                                                                                                       7                                        SRK tweet adds to the drama
New IPL rules are a bit confusing, says KKR principal owner            A STAFF REPORTER            Shah Rukh Khan                           
	Calcutta: If the Kolkata Knight Riders chief coach Dav Whatmores comments, on Monday, set the alarm bells ringing for Sourav Gangulys fans, a day later, the teams principal owner Shah Rukh Khans tweet has actually made things hotter.         
	While Whatmore had indicated that he is still not sure about who all will be retained, if one reads Shah Rukhs views on the player retention, it is clear that the Bollywood superstar doesnt want icon cricketers to be retained.         
	In fact, the new player retention policy that will come into effect from the next edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) has left Shah Rukh a bit confused. Shah Rukh feels that it would have been fair for everyone if all the players are put up for auction in November.         
	New IPL rules a bit confusing. Two new teams added (good). All players should go into pool to make it fair for everyone. Simple amp; straight, Shah Rukh wrote on his Twitter account.                   Sourav Ganguly      
	With the inclusion of two new teams in the IPL  Sahara Pune Warriors and the Kochi team  the IPL governing council proposed a revised tournament structure. However, that has not gone down too well with some of the franchise owners, who are voicing their concerns publicly.         
	The new rules state that the 10 teams will be divided into two groups and there will be a total 74 matches, including three play-offs, in the next three editions of the IPL.         
	The eight franchises, who had played in the last chapter of the tournament, will be allowed to retain four players, including a foreigner. Besides the four players, the rest of the squad will be selected through open bidding.         
	It has also been made mandatory for the players retained to be amongst the registered players for the 2010 season. The fee of the players retained would be decided after mutual agreement between the stakeholders.         
	The salary cap of the franchisees has also been raised to $ 9million. But if any franchise retains all the four players, it will have $ 4.5million per year remaining to spend on the other players. The new rules have also limited the number of players per squad to be 30.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Zaheer aims to regain rhythm
                                                                                                                       7                                        Zaheer aims to regain rhythm
            A STAFF REPORTER            Zaheer                           
	Calcutta: Zaheer Khan, who missed the first two one-day Internationals (ODI), against New Zealand, due to a groin strain, was Thursday named in the squad for the remaining three ODIs versus the Black Caps.         
	Middle-order batsman Suresh Raina, however, was not selected for the matches as he will be accompanying the early party to South Africa. Though Raina, who is struggling with his form, was not scheduled to go to South Africa early, India coach Gary Kirsten had made a specific request to the Board so that the left-handed batsman gets more time to acclimatise.         
	Pacer Sreesanth has also been rested ahead of the tough series against the Proteas.         
	The selectors announced two separate teams for the third ODI, in Baroda, on Saturday and the fourth and fifth ties, in Bangalore and Chennai, on December 7 and 10 respectively.         
	With BCCI secretary and president-elect N. Srinivasan not present, the selection committee meeting was convened by joint-secretary Sanjay Jagdale.         
	Zaheer makes his way into the team in place of Sreesanth as he wants to regain rhythm before the South Africa series. Zaheer had also missed the third Test against New Zealand, in Nagpur, after sustaining a groin injury during the second Test, in Hyderabad, last month.         
	Left-arm pacer Ashish Nehra, who was a late induction in the team for the first two ODIs after Praveen Kumar was down with fever, has also managed to retain his place in the side for the next three matches along with Praveen.         
	However, Bengal wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha, who retained his place for Baroda match, will hand over the gloves to Parthiv Patel for the last two matches, while R Vinay Kumar will make way for Rohit Sharma.         
	While the selectors were happy with Wriddhimans keeping, it was felt that Parthiv should be given another chance because of his consistent performance in the domestic circuit.

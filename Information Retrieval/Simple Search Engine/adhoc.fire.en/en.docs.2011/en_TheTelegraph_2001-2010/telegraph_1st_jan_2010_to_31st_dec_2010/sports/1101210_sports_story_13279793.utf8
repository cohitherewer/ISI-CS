                                                                                                                       7                                        ITF offers trophy replica
                  Pete Sampras                     
	London: The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has offered Pete Sampras a replica trophy from his two Davis Cup wins following the theft of much of his tennis memorabilia.         
	Sampras, who won 14 Grand Slam titles, says most of his trophies and other memorabilia were stolen last month from a public storage facility in Los Angeles.         
	We were sorry to learn of the theft of so many of Pete Samprass trophies.         
	We know how special a Davis Cup victory is for a player. If he is unable to recover the loss of his two Davis Cup trophies, we would like to offer him a replica trophy in recognition of his outstanding record in the event, said ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti.         
	Sampras had won the Davis Cup, the ITFs elite team competition for men, with the US in 1992 and 1995 with victories over Switzerland and Russia, respectively.         
	Australian Open organisers also expressed their regret about the theft. Sampras won the first of his two Australian Open titles in 1994.         
	We have been in touch with the Sampras camp overnight just to see if there is anything we can do, tournament director Craig Tiley said earlier. We are keen to help out one of our great champions in whatever way we can. It is a very valuable trophy but its worth goes far beyond dollars and cents, Tiley said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Well have to win the toss: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                      Well have to win the toss: Dhoni
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                          
	Ahmedabad: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni is of the view that the toss, in the first Test, against New Zealand, will be important.         
	Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Dhoni also quelled doubts over Rahul Dravids form and how the team is eagerly waiting for the Little Master to get to his 50th Test hundred.             
	If the team is prepared to celebrate Sachins 50th Test hundred         
	We are always prepared for celebration whenever someone does well for us. (Cheteshwar) Pujara, Sachin (Tendulkar), Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid  all of them have been achieving something. Hopefully, hell achieve the milestone here.         
	On Rahul Dravids form         
	(Rahul) Dravid is a great player. He can always bounce back in situations like these. So, were not really worried too much about it.         
	If it is de-motivating for juniors like Cheteshwar Pujara and Murali Vijay to sit out after a good show against Australia          
	As far as Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara are concerned, theyve replaced Gautam Gambhir and VVS Laxman. You realise the fact that once these players are back they will be in the eleven and that those who replaced them will have to miss out.         
	On any fitness issues in the squad         
	No issues with regard to fitness. Everybody is fit. If something happened in the morning, I wouldnt know.         
	His reading of the New Zealand team         
	It would be the biggest mistake if you take any side lightly. Were not thinking of what they did against Bangladesh because we need to do well.         
	On the importance of the toss in Motera         
	Well have to win the toss. In the second innings, it isnt always easy to get runs  one odd delivery keeps low and youre out. I think it definitely adds to the confidence of the batting unit (if youve been successfully chasing fourth innings total).         
	His reading of the wicket         
	Hopefully, it (the wicket) will be a turner. Weve to see exactly how it behaves for the major part of the game.         
	Any major concern before next years World Cup         
	For me, the major concern is injury. In the last few series that we played, more often than not, weve missed key players, especially the bowlers who got injured and missed out.         
	His views on senior players joining cricket administration         
	Cricketers coming into the mainstream of administration is really good because theyre the ones whove seen everything.

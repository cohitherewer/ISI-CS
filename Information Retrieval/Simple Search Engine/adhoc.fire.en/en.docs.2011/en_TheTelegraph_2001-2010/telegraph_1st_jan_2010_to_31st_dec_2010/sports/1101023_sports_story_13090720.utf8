                                                                                                                       7                                      Tainted Asif backs out
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: In what amounts to an admission of guilt, Pakistan fast bowler Mohammed Asif, on Friday, decided to withdraw his challenge to the provisional suspension imposed on him in the wake of the spot-fixing allegations.         
	The International Cricket Council (ICC) had provisionally suspended Asif, Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer after a British tabloid accused the trio of spot-fixing in association with bookmakers during their tour of England.         
	The trio had earlier denied any wrong-doing and filed appeals against their bans with their cases due to be heard in Dubai on October 30-31. But in a rare U-turn, Asif decided to withdraw his challenge, the ICC said in a statement.         
	Now, arrangements are being made for the challenges being made by Salman Butt and Mohammed Aamer against their provisional suspensions to be heard in Dubai on October 30 and 31, the statement added.

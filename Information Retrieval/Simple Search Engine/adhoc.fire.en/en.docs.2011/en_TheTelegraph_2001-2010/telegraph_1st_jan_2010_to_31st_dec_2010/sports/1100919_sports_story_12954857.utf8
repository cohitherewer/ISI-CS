	Chennai: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi extended their winning streak in the Davis Cup doubles, but it would be of little joy to the Indian team in their World Group playoff tie against Brazil.         
	Paes and Bhupathi smothered the feeble challenge of Bruno Soares and Marcelo Melo, to record a 6-4, 7-6(5), 6-1 victory and reduce Brazils lead to 2-1, here, Saturday.         
	It was the duos 24th win on the trot in the mens team competition but the victory could not hide the fact that the hosts are still in danger of being relegated to the Zonal qualifiers, given the Brazilians domination in singles.         
	The onus would be on Somdev Dev Varman to level the scores by beating Thomaz Bellucci, the world No. 27, in the first reverse singles on Sunday.         
	Paes and Bhupathi hardly broke into a sweat in seeing off the challenge of Soares and Melo although the rubber lasted for two hours and 19 minutes.         
	Much of the interest in the match was restricted to the second set where the Brazilians had four set points, two each on Paes and Bhupathis serves.         
	But on all those occasions, the multiple Grand Slam champions raised their game a notch higher to wriggle out of the tight spot.The visitors also had a mini break in the tiebreak when Paes volley sailed long. But they struggled to hold on to the advantage and conceded the set when Melo netted Bhupathis return.         
	After that, it seemed the Indians were in a hurry to keep their appointment with Paes felicitation function, as they ran away with the third set.         
	The Indians were on song from the word go as they raced to a 4-0 lead. Although Bhupathi lost his serve, the first set was comfortably pocketed in 38 minutes.         
	Over the following hour, the impregnable partners managed to inject some drama into an otherwise dull proceeding. The returns that were until now solid began to err and suddenly the combination looked rusty. But that would be taking the credit away from Melo and Soares. The duo came up with some scintillating returns to drive a wedge into the opposition.         
	That was when Bhupathi, whose serve was repeatedly letting him down, displayed the steel inside him. He underscored his status as a top doubles player as he unleashed a couple of his trademark backhand returns.         
	Once the tiebreak was clinched, the Indians turned on the heat to break Melo twice and wrap up the set in 32 minutes.

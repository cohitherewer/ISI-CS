The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sloppy Indians blow it again

  - Raina amp; Co. lose to Zimbabwe by seven wkts             Brendon Taylor en route to his 74 in Harare,   on Thursday                                 
	Harare: Elton Chigumbura and his boys proved that their victory against India in the first match of the Micromax Cup was no fluke. On Thursday, the hosts comprehensively thrashed Suresh Raina amp; Co. by seven wickets to make a strong case for a place in the final with their second win in three matches.         
	Saying Zimbabwe won easily would be an understatement. Chasing a meagre target of 195, openers Hamilton Masakadza and Brendan Taylor hit classy half centuries as the hosts overhauled Indias score with 70 balls to spare, earning an important bonus point in the process. Zimbabwe completed their most memorable back-to-back victories against India in recent times when Tatenda Taibu pulled an off-colour Ashok Dinda to deep mid-wicket boundary.         
	If the Indian batsmen failed to get going on a pitch where the ball was coming slowly on to the bat, Masakadza (66, 86, 4x4, 2x6) and Taylor (74, 90, 6x4, 1x6) had no problems handling the Indian bowlers. They never took undue risks and yet scored at a brisk pace.         
	The left-arm spin duo of Ravindra Jadeja (two for 27) and Pragyan Ojha (one for 35) did bowl tightly but neither Dinda (none for 54) nor Umesh Yadav (none for 20) could complement them. The openers added 128 runs in 26.2 overs as they laid the foundation for victory.         
	Earlier, Jadejas 51 was the only face-saving performance in an otherwise spineless batting display as India could manage no more than 194 batting first on a wicket that was on the slower side.         
	India failed to recover from a slow start and lost wickets at regular intervals as they ended their innings below the 200-run mark at the Harare Sports Club.         
	Indian openers Dinesh Karthik (33 off 47) and Murali Vijay (21 off 56) found it difficult to get the ball off the square. The Zimbabwean bowlers were so disciplined that India had to wait till the 15th over for their 50.

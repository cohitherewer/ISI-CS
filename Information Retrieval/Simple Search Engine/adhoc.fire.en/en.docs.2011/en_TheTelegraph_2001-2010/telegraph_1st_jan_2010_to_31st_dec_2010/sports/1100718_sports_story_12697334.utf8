            A STAFF REPORTER            Meghalayas goalscorers Niwan Gatpoh (from left), Stephanfield Lanong and Malsawm Dawngliana after their 5-0 win against Jharkhand, at the Barasat Stadium, on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                           
	Calcutta: They can claim to be the exceptions. Because, where they come from, it is all about going gaga over football  a fact which comes as a fresh gust of air in this cricket crazy nation.         
	And the boys from Meghalaya  their average age is a youthful 23  made sure they left the ground as the undisputed heroes after a 5-0 demolition of Jharkhand in a Cluster I match of the Santosh Trophy, at the Barasat Stadium, on Saturday.         
	But the most remarkable thing about the winners was that they proved that there is more to Meghalayan soccer than Lajong FC. An obvious assumption about any Meghalay side will be that most of their players hail from the club that are the Federation Cup runners-up.         
	Coach Khlainpyrkhat Syiemiem was quick to stress the point. We have players from all around Meghalaya Its not just Lajong FC. We have just six players from the club and the rest have been selected from around the state, he said.         
	Coming to the match, Jharkhand were no match for the team from Northeast. That the margin was 5-0, and not 10-0, can be put down to the wastefulness of the Meghalaya forwards who were busier missing than scoring.         
	Right winger Niwan Gatpoh was the man of the day, netting a hattrick for, while Stephenfield Lanong and Malsawm Dawngliana added one each.         
	Up 2-0 by the half-time, Meghalaya came back stronger in the second half to add another three. Jharkhand managed to play around the ball but their finishing and lack of positioning let them down.         
	If the defence was found wanting, so was Jharkhand keeper Subhajit Basu, who was just not up to the standards. It seemed he was nervous on more than one occasion as he failed to grip the ball properly. Twice the Meghalayans made him pay by putting the ball into the net.         
	In the other matches of the day, Maharashtra had it easy against Andhra Pradesh with a 4-1 win, while Chandigarh and Tripura played out a 1-1 draw. Both were Cluster II matches.

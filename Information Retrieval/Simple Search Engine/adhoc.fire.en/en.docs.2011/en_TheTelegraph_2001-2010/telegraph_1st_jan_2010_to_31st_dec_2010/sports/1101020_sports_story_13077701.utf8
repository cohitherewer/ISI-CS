The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Warnes volte-face
                                                                                                                       7                                      Warnes volte-face
                      
	Melbourne: Spin legend Shane Warne finds it staggering that an observation by him was portrayed as an attack on Ricky Ponting whom he still considers the best man to lead the Australian cricket team.         
	I find it staggering, but not surprising, how much factually incorrect rubbish Ive read since I was quietly sitting on my couch last week talking out loud to the TV and answering my followers on twitter. I dont know why so many people feel the need to exaggerate and sensationalise one sentence. Please, just report the facts, Warne wrote on his website.         
	Warne had criticised Pontings field placements during the Bangalore Test loss to India, inviting a sharp reply from the Australian skipper which led to speculation that the two had fallen out.           (PTI)

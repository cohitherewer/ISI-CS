  - 2nd test

	Dhaka: Mahmudullah Riyads grit was not enough as India skittled out Bangladesh for a modest total and then got off to a solid start to take early control of the second and final Test here Sunday.         
	The opening day belonged to India as Ishant Sharma (4/66) and Zaheer Khan (3/62) decimated the Bangladesh top and middle order to reduce the hosts to 127 for seven.         
	Batting at No. 8, Mahmudullah, however, refused to throw in the towel and showed exemplary grit, even though he was stranded four runs away from his maiden Test century as his side folded for 233.         
	Mahmudullahs was a sterling 156-ball knock studded with 13 fours. The last two wickets produced 78 crucial runs that lent some respectability to the home sides total.         
	In reply, India eased to 69 without loss off the 13 overs they faced with Virender Sehwag (41 off 40 balls) and Gautam Gambhir (26 off 38 balls) scoring at a brisk rate while staying put at the stumps.         
	India would return Monday to first wipe out the 164 run deficit and then push for a big total to bat the hosts out of the match and complete a 2-0 rout in the series.         
	For the home side, Mahmudullah was the star of the day. Coming at the wicket when his side was at a precarious 106 for six, Mahmudullah, who scored 69 and 20 in the first Test in Chittagong, stitched two important partnerhips with the tailenders  58 with Shafiul Islam (9) for the ninth wicket and 20 for the last wicket with Rubel Hossain (4)  to frustrate the Indian bowlers for nearly three hours.         
	With his side in dire straits, Mahmudullah waited for the loose balls to punish the Indians with some delightful shots on either side of the wicket.         
	For India, Ishant and Zaheer shared seven wickets between them while left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha, who came in for Amit Mishra in the match, chipped in with two wickets. Harbhajan Singh, who returned to the side after missing the first Test due to a stiff neck, got one.         
	Bangladesh were tottering at 51 for five inside the first hour of play with most of their batsmen on self-destructive mode. However, the Indian bowlers were also impressive as they bowled a tight line and length under helpful conditions at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.         
	Captain Shakib-al Hasan (34), opener Tamim Iqbal (0) and Ashraful (39) were out to rank bad shots. Shakib chose to bat after winning the toss but his decision boomeranged as his side lost three quick wickets for 13 runs inside the fifth over and their top half returned to the hut inside the first hour.         
	The Bangladesh top-order lacked patience as most of them seemed to be in a hurry. However, opener Imrul Kayes (0) was a tad unlucky to be given out by New Zealand umpire Billy Bowden.         
	Ishants first ball apparently kissed Kayess bat before nestling into Mahendra Singh Dhonis gloves. But television replays suggested that the ball had brushed off the thigh pads.         
	Zaheer removed Tamim eight balls later for an eight-ball duck. Another wicket in the form of Zunaed Siddique (8) fell in Zaheers next over as the hosts found themselves in trouble.

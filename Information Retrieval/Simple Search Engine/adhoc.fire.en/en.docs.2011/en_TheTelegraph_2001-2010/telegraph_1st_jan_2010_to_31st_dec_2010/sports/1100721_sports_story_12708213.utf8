The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Ponting for DRS
                                                                                                                       7                                      Ponting for DRS
                      
	Melbourne: The Board of Control for Cricket in India might have opposed the idea but Australian captain Ricky Ponting wants the ICC to ensure implementation of the Decision Review System (DRS) in every Test match.         
	The DRS, which allows teams to challenge on-field umpires decision, has been a contentious issue ever since its introduction as some cricket boards are not keen on sharing the cost of installing the technology required for its implementation.         
	The financially powerful BCCI has, however, refused to give any reason for opposing the system.         
	Australia are currently playing a Test series against Pakistan in England without DRS as the cash-strapped PCB has refused to share the cost.         
	The Aussies are likely to play against India in October without DRS again but will have the system in place when they take on England in the Ashes series. And Ponting said such inconsistency should be avoided and urged the ICC to step in.         
	Look I got my point across at the referees meeting before this series. I just think probably even the ICC could have stepped in on this occasion, Ponting was quoted in media reports.         
	It is a financial thing at the end of the day, that is the reason we are not using it. So I thought the ICC could have come in and done something about it but it has not eventuated and that is just the way it is. So we just have to get on with it, he added.

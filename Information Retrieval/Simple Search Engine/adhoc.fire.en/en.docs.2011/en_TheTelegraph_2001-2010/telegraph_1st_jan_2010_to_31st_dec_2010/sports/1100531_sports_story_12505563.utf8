The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Arbitrator comes in for criticism
                                                                                                                       7                                        Arbitrator comes in for criticism
                  Younis Khan at the PCB headquarters, in Lahore                     
	Islamabad: A leading Pakistan parliamentarian alleged on Sunday that the arbitrator hearing appeals by Younis Khan and Rana Naved-ul Hasan against their suspensions was delaying their hearings in order to keep them out of next months Asia Cup.         
	Younis was suspended indefinitely for infighting with former captain Mohammed Yousuf on a tour of Australia early this year, while Naved was banned for a year and fined Rs 2 million for his poor performance on that tour.         
	Younis appeal had been put back until June 5, but selectors are likely to finalise the 15-member squad for the Asia Cup before that. Naveds next hearing will be on June 19  five days after the Asia Cup begins in Sri Lanka.         
	Iqbal Mohammed Ali, head of parliaments sports committee, felt the delays were deliberate.         
	I believe the only reason in delaying the appeals of these two players is that the PCB does not want to include their names in the Asia Cup squad, Ali said.         
	Seven players received a combination of suspensions and fines after the Australian tour. On Saturday, arbitrator Irfan Qadir quashed the one-year ban on Shoaib Malik and cut his fine in half.         
	He (arbitrator) should have had given decisions on all the six appeals yesterday, but he just lifted ban from Shoaib Malik and reduced the fine, Ali said. (Agencies)

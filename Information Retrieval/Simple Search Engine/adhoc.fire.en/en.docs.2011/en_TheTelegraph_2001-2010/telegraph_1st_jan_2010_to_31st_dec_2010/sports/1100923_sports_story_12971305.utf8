The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Johnson: A challenge playing against India
                                                                                                                       7                                      Johnson: A challenge playing against India
                      
	Chandigarh: Australian pacer Mitchell Johnson feels that playing India on their soil is always a huge challenge irrespective of whether the hosts are at the top or bottom of the International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings.         
	I dont think about rankings too much. Coming and playing here (in India) itself is a challenge. Players like (Sachin) Tendulkar, (Rahul) Dravid and (Virender) Sehwag lend depth to Indias batting department while their bowling attack, which has Harbhajan Singh, is also great, Johnson told reporters here.         
	Asked if India, being the hosts and the No. 1 Test team in the world, would hold any psychological advantage over the visitors in the two-Test series, Johnson said, Its a huge challenge and the rankings dont matter.         
	The first Test will begin in Mohali, from October 1.         
	With quite a few young pacers like Peter George, James Pattinson and Mitchell Starc in the Australian team, Johnson said, he would love to take up the leadership role and help the young quickies by giving them useful tips during training sessions.         
	This is something I enjoy and I have spoken to the coaches also, he said, adding the young bowling attack will learn a lot during the current tour.         
	Seen as a build-up to the Ashes and next years world cup in the Indian subcontinent, the tour holds significance for the Australians, but Johnson exuded optimism and said that his team wanted to win the series.         
	The Indian conditions, with low bounce, the heat and the humidity, are challenging for a fast bowler but I can vouch that the team want to win the two Tests, Johnson said.         
	Asked about the increasing number of injuries players suffer these days due to a jam packed cricket calendar, Johnson said, Players are playing in all forms (Tests, one-day Internationals and Twenty20s). Teams have got to make sure that they rest their players in certain periods of time.         
	He expressed satisfaction with the security arrangements here. I feel safe and we are happy with the arrangements, Johnson said.         
	The visitors, led by captain Ricky Ponting, had a light warm up session at the Sector 16 stadium where they are scheduled to play a three-day warm-up match against a Gautam Gambhir-led Board Presidents XI from September 25.         
	The players had to restrict themselves to the gymnasium as heavy overnight rain had left the outfield wet. (PTI)

	Guangzhou: Sandeep Singh converted two short corners as India beat Pakistan 3-2 in the Asian Games mens field hockey competition Saturday for their fourth major victory against their arch-rivals this year.         
	The win also ensured India a place in the semi-finals with nine points from three wins in Group B.         
	Pakistan still have a good chance to qualify for the semis with a last group match against lowly-ranked Bangladesh.         
	Pakistans Dutch coach Michel van den Heuvel kept on passing instructions loudly to his players from the stands, but the Indian defense held their nerves and conceded just one short corner.         
	It was a high tempo game but we are not yet out of the event and are still contenders for gold, Pakistan manager Khawaja Junaid said. They got three chances and converted all of them, but we missed a few sitters.         
	Pakistan twice came from behind through field goals from their star forwards Rehan Butt (4th minute) and Shakeel Abbasi (43rd minute) to level 2-2 before Sandeep Singh struck in 48th minute.         
	India hung on to their lead in the last 22 minutes and even got a chance to score one more in the dying staged but Sandeep Singh missed a short corner.         
	I had studied their goalkeeper (Salman Akbar) before the match and knew exactly what to do off penalty corners, he said of his three powerful drag flicks.         
	Dharamvir Singhs field goal in the 16th minute had given India a 2-1 lead at half-time as Pakistan forwards could not penetrate through the Indian defense.         
	Pakistan got a chance to level via a 58th minute penalty corner but Indias goalkeeper Bharat Kumar neatly deflected away the hard push of Sohail Abbas.         
	Pakistan had recalled world record holder Abbas for the Asian Games, hoping the star penalty corner striker could help regain the gold 20 years after their last Asiad triumph at Beijing in 1990. The winner of the Guangzhou games tournament will also get an automatic qualification for the London Olympics in 2012.         
	This year India has defeated Pakistan 4-1 in the World Cup and 7-4 at Commonwealth Games  both at New Delhi  while also recording a 4-2 win at Azlan Shah tournament.         
	This is not a series, what we need to do is to play like we did today against all the other opponents in the remaining matches, Indian captain Rajpal Singh said.         
	Pakistan captain Zeeshan Ashraf said his team wasnt demoralised despite the fourth straight loss to India. We did some mistakes and took only one short corner in the entire game and unluckily for us Sohails push was well read by the Indian goalkeeper, he said. India did well on all the three scoring opportunities.         
	Earlier, Japan defeated Hong Kong 6-1 in another Group B match. (agencies)

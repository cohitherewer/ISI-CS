The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Yet another mark beckons Boucher
                                                                                                                       7                                        Yet another mark beckons Boucher
  - SA Wicket-keeper is nine short of 500 dismissals in Tests       LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Mark Boucher during a practice session, in Nagpur, on Friday. (AFP)                                 
	Nagpur: Where milestones go, keeper Mark Boucher is on the threshold of something absolutely phenomenal  hes a mere nine dismissals short of 500 in Tests.         
	South Africas senior pro, though, was modest about his achievements when The Telegraph spoke to him on Friday afternoon.         
	I do know Im approaching a landmark, but Ive been playing for a number of years (13)... If you play for that long, then such things come your way, the world record-holder said.         
	Asked if he was excited, Boucher replied: I guess so... Theres some excitement, yes... Hope I get there in this (two-match) series...         
	Boucher, by the way, is no mug with the bat  he has over 5,000 runs in Tests alone, at a very fine average of 30-plus.         
	In ODIs, the 33-year-old Boucher has 414 dismissals and over 4,500 runs. Awesome, really.         
	Just reward, perhaps, for somebody who believes that perfect practice makes perfect, not routine practice sessions or practising for the sake of doing so.         
	Adam Gilchrist had a huge impact on Australia; Bouchers has been as significant, for South Africa.

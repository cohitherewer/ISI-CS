            STAR RACER      
	Calcutta: The Bharath Singh-trained Spitz recorded an upset victory in the 1,200m Aleksei Cup, Wednesdays main event. Ridden judiciously by apprentice Shezad Khan, the 8-1 shot allowed Burst Of Speed to call the shots till below the distance post before making his winning bid. Bharath went on to finish the day with a priced treble. The Finalist Plate was an easy pick for a solidly fancied Ajayajeet, a Richard Alford-trained horse, who led from the start to win the way he liked.RESULTS

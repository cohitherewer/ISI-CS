            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	Chennai: Ramanathan Krishnan is not exactly happy with the way professional tennis is being played nowadays.         
	The focus is entirely on points, nothing else matters, said the legendary tennis player who led India to a historic triumph over Brazil in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup, in 1966, in Calcutta.         
	Talking to newspersons after the felicitation, by the All India Tennis Association (AITA), of the members of the 1966 Davis Cup team on the sidelines of the Chennai Open , Krishnan said things were different during his time.         
	Those days, Wimbledon organisers used to invite at least two players from India every year to play there, Krishnan said. Now, its all about points.         
	The problem is that if you are not in the top-100 in rankings, you would rarely get a chance to play against the top players. Somdev (Dev Varman) will have to be in the top-100 to earn a chance to play against a someone like Federer, he said.         
	In our days, we used to earn some points for playing well in the Davis Cup. That used to help us in playing bigger tournaments all over the world. Now, everything is dependent on ATP points.         
	Another star of the 1966 team, Jaidip Mukerjea, said that more international tournaments should be organised in India.

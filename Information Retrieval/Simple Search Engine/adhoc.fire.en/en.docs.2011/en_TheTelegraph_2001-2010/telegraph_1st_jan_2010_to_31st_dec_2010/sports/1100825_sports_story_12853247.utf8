            A STAFF REPORTER            Saurav Ghosal                           
	Calcutta: Saurav Ghosal, who will lead Indias squash challenge at the October 3-14 Commonwealth Games, feels India have a very good chance of winning medals in the womens and mixed doubles events.         
	We have a good chance to win medals in the womens and mixed doubles, Saurav told The Telegraph from Hong Kong, on Tuesday.         
	Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal are doing extremely well and I see no reason why they cant win a medal. We also have fair chance in the mixed. We have a strong contingent, the Calcutta-born 24-year-old said.         
	The mens doubles will be tougher. There are some very good players and it will be difficult for us, the world No. 26 said.         
	The highest-ranked Indian in the Professional Squash Association (PSA) world rankings, Saurav felt that expectation would be high as the Games are being hosted on home soil. Hopefully we will live up to the expectation.         
	Saurav said there were no special preparation for the Commonwealth Games. Because every year, during the off season, we train hard and try to improve as much as possible. It is the same routine this year too, said the Arjuna Awardee.         
	Singles will be difficult. I have to work very hard to win matches as almost all the top 10 players will be coming to Delhi. Ill probably be seeded within ninth to 16th. Im hoping the draw will be kind and well be able to make an impact, said Saurav.         
	The womens draw too will be difficult, but am sure Joshna and Dipika will do their best, added the 2006 Asian Games bronze medallist.         
	Saurav, who is currently playing a PSA Super Series event in Hong Kong, will next be participating in the British Grand Prix in Manchester.         
	Saurav said Ritwik Bhattacharyas exclusion from the squad, named on Monday, was unfortunate.         
	He wanted to play only the doubles. But hadnt been playing much. Injuries also did not help his cause. Its very unfortunate he wont be in Delhi. But Gaurav (Nandrajog), too, is doing very well and I am sure he will repay the faith shown in him, he signed off.         
	The squads         
	Men: Saurav Ghosal (singles/ doubles), Siddharth Suchde (singles/ doubles), Harinder Pal Singh Sandhu (singles/ doubles), Sandeep Jangra (singles/ doubles), Gaurav Nandrajog (doubles).         
	Women: Joshna Chinappa (singles/ doubles), Dipika Pallikal (singles/ doubles), Anaka Alankamony (singles/ doubles), Anwesha Reddy (singles), Surbhi Misra (doubles).

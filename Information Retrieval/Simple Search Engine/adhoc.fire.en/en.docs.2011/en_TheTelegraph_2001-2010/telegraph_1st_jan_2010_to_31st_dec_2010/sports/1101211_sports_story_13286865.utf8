	London: Fresh from reaching the knockout stages Englands four Champions League group qualifiers have equally high-profile domestic duties this weekend as Manchester United host Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur take on Chelsea.         
	For the first half of Arsene Wengers reign at Arsenal the teams clashes with United often went a long way to deciding the destination of the Premier League but the emergence of Chelsea as a major power knocked the Gunners down the pecking order.         
	They last won the title in 2004 and have not cracked the top two since 2005, but they go into Monday nights game at Old Trafford proudly back on top of the league and bidding for their first win there for four years.         
	Their key man in recent weeks has been Samir Nasri, who scored both goals in last weeks 2-1 win over Fulham and another in the 3-1 win over Partizan Belgrade, which sealed Arsenals progress to the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday.         
	The twinkle-toed France midfielder has been playing as a touchline-hugging virtual third forward this season and Wenger is delighted with his contribution.         
	United are a point behind Arsenal with a game in hand and though they have struggled on the road this year with six draws they have been superb at home where they have won seven and drawn one of their eight games.         
	Liverpool will again be without injured captain Steven Gerrard for Saturdays trip to a Newcastle United side, who begin life under new manager Alan Pardew. He replaced Chris Hughton this week.         
	It could have the effect that clubs want  it could be a shot in the arm to the (Newcastle) players, Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson told the club website.         
	Hodgson said Gerrard, who is recovering from a hamstring injury, could return to action against Fulham next week. Manchester City defender Kolo Toure may return for Saturdays trip to bottom-club West Ham United, after going off in the win over Bolton Wanderers last weekend. Obviously if there is even the slightest doubt, I will maybe rest it for a few more days, but as things stand, its not looking too bad, he said.         
	Seasiders Blackpool have resorted to training on the beach this week to prepare for the match at Stoke City because their usual pitch is frozen.         
	We have managed to go on the beach, said manager Ian Holloway, whose teams match at home to Manchester United last weekend was postponed because of a frozen pitch. Id rather just get on the grass.         
	Chelsea have slipped to third after picking up just five points from their last six games and things are not about to get any easier as they follow Sundays tough trip to Spurs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Hauritz omitted 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Hauritz omitted 
            A STAFF REPORTER            Hauritz                           
	Calcutta: Off-spinner Nathan Hauritz was the major omission when the Australian squad was reduced from 17 to 13 players Saturday, for next weeks opening Ashes Test against England in Brisbane, according to a media release.         
	Hauritz made way for younger spinners  left-arm wrist-spinner Xavier Doherty and leg-spinner Steven Smith.         
	From our initial squad of 17, we have omitted four players after the most recent round of Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield matches and the ongoing Australia A game in Hobart. Nathan Hauritz is one of these players omitted and he can consider himself unlucky as his Australian record has been very good over the past 12 months, said National Selection Panel (NSP) chairman Andrew Hilditch.         
	Hauritz has played 17 Tests and taken 63 wickets at an average of almost 35. If Doherty, 27, is chosen to play in next Thursdays match it will be his Test debut, while Smith, 21, has played in two Tests.         
	Callum Ferguson, Usman Khawaja and Ryan Harris are the other three to miss out of the final squad, added Hilditch.         
	THE SQUAD: Ricky Ponting (Capt), Michael Clarke, Doug Bollinger, Xavier Doherty, Brad Haddin, Mike Hussey, Ben Hilfenhaus, Mitchell Johnson, Simon Katich, Marcus North, Peter Siddle, Steven Smith, Shane Watson

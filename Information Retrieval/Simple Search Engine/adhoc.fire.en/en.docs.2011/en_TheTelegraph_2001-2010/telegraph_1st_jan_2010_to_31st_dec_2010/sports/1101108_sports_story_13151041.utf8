	Karachi: Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has been stopped from leaving for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a Test series against South Africa because of the spot-fixing charges he faced during his county stint with Essex.         
	In a late night development, Kaneria was stopped by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) from going to Dubai to join the national team for the two Test matches against South Africa starting November 12.         
	Kaneria was scheduled to leave with Mohammed Sami from Karachi as were Mohammed Yousuf, Taufiq Umar and Azhar Ali from Lahore in the early hours of Sunday.         
	But as he was preparing to leave for the airport, Kaneria was told by the PCB to remain in Karachi till further orders.         
	Zakir Khan, the director of cricket operations in the board, Sunday said the board had not given clearance to Kaneria for the Test series. He refused to say anything more on the issue. A similar response came from chief selector Mohsin Khan who said he couldnt select any player in the team who was not cleared by the board.         
	A well-placed source in the board said that in fact it was the ICC that had told the PCB not to play Kaneria at this time in the coming series. Apparently the ICC is still not satisfied with the Kanerias conduct because of the criminal investigation that was conducted against him this year by the Essex police, the source said.(PTI)

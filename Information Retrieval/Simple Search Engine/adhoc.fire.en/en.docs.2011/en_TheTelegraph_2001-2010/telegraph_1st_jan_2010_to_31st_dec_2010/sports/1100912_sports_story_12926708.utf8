                                                                                                                       7                                      Bhullar still in the fray
                      
	Singapore: Gaganjeet Bhullar remained in the hunt for a strong finish although he slipped a couple of rungs to tied fourth after returning a modest two-under 70 in the third and penultimate round of the $400,000 Handa Singapore Classic here Saturday.         
	Bhullar, a two-time Asian Tour champion, has a total of 14-under 202 and is six strokes behind leader Peter Karmis (70) of South Africa.         
	SSP Chowrasia was the next best-placed Indian tied 12th after 71 in the third round took his overall score to 12-under 204. Himmat Rai (69) was tied 36th with a total of nine-under 207, while a stroke adrift was Anirban Lahiri (73) at the tied 45th spot.         
	C Muniyappa signed a disappointing card of 74 to share the 56th position with a total of six-under 210. Vikrant Chopra (72) lay further down at tied 64th with four-under 212. (PTI)

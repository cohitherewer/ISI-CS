                                                                                                                       7                                        No sign of Lalus son
            A STAFF REPORTER            Tejashwi Prasad Yadav                           
	Calcutta: The first day of the four-day zonal camp for rectification of suspect action of bowlers, that started at the Pankaj Gupta Indoor Facility at Eden Gardens, had one notable absentee  Tejashwi Prasad, son of former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav.         
	Tejashwi is among the 28 East Zone bowlers who were reported for suspect action in the last domestic season during which made he his first-class and List A debut for Jharkhand.         
	Tejashwis name was among the first group of 12 bowlers who were supposed to undergo rectification on Monday and Tuesday. He didnt report for the camp on Monday along with three other bowlers.         
	We dont have any information whether he will be joining the camp for the last three days, a senior CAB official said on Monday.         
	What happens to those players who skip the rectification camp couldnt be immediately ascertained as NCA bowling coach Bharath Arun was unavailable for comment. When The Telegraph contacted former Bihar cricketer K.V.P. Rao to inquire about the absentees, he presented a dead bat.         
	According to BCCI rules, we are not supposed to speak to the media, was all Rao said.         
	Tejashwi has played one first class, two one-day and four Twenty20 matches for Jharkhand. His action came under the scanner during his List A debut against Orissa.         
	The two umpires, Satrajit Lahiri and P. Chatterjee, found the bowlers action suspect and it was reported to the match referee.         
	The Bengal duo of Arijit Banerjee and Sambit Roy, however, did report for the camp.         
	After the two-day rectification, they will work under the supervision of Bengal U-22 coach Tapan Jyoti Banerjee in the off-season to iron out the flaws in their bowling. Arijit is a medium pacer who plays for Aryan while Sambit is an off-spinner representing Kumartuli in club cricket.         
	List of Bowlers with Suspect Action         
	From Bengal: Sambit Roy, Arijit Banerjee; From Orissa: Alok Pradhan, Ritu Singh, Priyanka Sahu, B. Madhumita, Sayeed Zakki, Sanjib Barik; From Jharkhand: Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, Babul, Ibney Hassan Khan, Mannu Kumar; From Tripura: Tushar Saha, Deb Bhakta Jamatia, Abhijit Roy, Mani Shankar, Arijit Chakraborty; From Assam: Kangan Prasad Das, Bikram Chhetri, Jothi Madhi, Prashant Sanwal, Mandeep Kaur, Suchitra Singh, Prem Pradhan, Diptesh Saha; From Sikkim: Kumar Chhetri; From Nagaland: Ankit Kumar; From Meghalaya: Bijon Dey

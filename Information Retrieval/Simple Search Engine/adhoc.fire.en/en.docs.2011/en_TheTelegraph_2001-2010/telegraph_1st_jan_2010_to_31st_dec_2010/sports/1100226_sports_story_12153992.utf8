The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Viru advised to rest back
                                                                                                                       7                                        Viru advised to rest back
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI            Sehwag                           
	Gwalior: Injuries continue to hit Team India.         
	The latest to join the long list of those with fitness issues are Virender Sehwag, Praveen Kumar and Abhishek Nayar.         
	All three were in the squad for the first two ODIs against South Africa; all have been excluded from the 14 for the last match, on Saturday.         
	It couldnt be confirmed, but one well-placed source of The Telegraph indicated that Sehwag, the vice-captain, had been advised to rest for 15 days, which would allow his back problem to go away.         
	Fortunately, the series has been won and, so, theres no desperation to have Sehwag in the 11.         
	As for medium-pacer Kumar, he pulled his right hamstring during Wednesdays historic ODI here and will need around 10 days to recover.         
	Strangely, all-rounder Nayar got selected for the first two matches even though he was carrying an injury.         
	Nayar, one learns, has a bone swelling on his right wrist. That he didnt take a break (from domestic cricket) to get it treated has only aggravated the injury.         
	A scan is expected to be done on Friday, after which the exact nature of the problem is going to be known.

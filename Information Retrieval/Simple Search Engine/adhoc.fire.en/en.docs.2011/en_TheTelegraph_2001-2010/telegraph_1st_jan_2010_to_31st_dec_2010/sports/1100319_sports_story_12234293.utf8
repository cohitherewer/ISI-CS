The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Chargers start favourites
                                                                                                                       7                                      Chargers start favourites
                      
	Cuttack: After back-to-back defeats, the Kings XI Punjab will be eyeing a redemption while defending champions Deccan Chargers hope to continue with the winning momentum when they meet in an Indian Premier League (IPL) match here Friday.         
	The Punjab side have opened their IPL campaign on a disappointing note, losing to the Delhi Daredevils and then the Royal Challengers Bangalore, mainly due to their depleted bowling attack which is certainly giving captain Kumar Sangakkara sleepless nights.         
	On the other hand, despite a shocking 11-run defeat to last years laggards Kolkata Knight Riders in their opening tie, the Adam Gilchrist-led side have managed to beat the Chennai Super Kings by 31 runs in the next encounter.         
	Bowling is the worrying factor for the Punjab side, who lost both the matches despite putting up good totals on the board.         
	They are clearly missing the service of Australian pace spearhead Brett Lee as Punjabs new-ball pair of Sreesanth and left-arm Irfan Pathan have so far failed to make an impact.         
	Meanwhile, things have started falling in place for the Hyderabad-based side with all the backbone of their batting order  Gilchrist, Herchelle Gibbs and Andrew Symonds  in good touch.

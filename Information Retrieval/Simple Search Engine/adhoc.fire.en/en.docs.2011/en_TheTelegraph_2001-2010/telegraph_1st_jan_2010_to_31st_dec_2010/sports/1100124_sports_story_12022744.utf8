	New Delhi: The hockey World Cup, to be held in the capital from February 28, appears to be in jeopardy after a Rajasthan High Court order on Saturday forced Hockey India (HI) to defer the February 7 elections.         
	Last year, the FIH president Leandro Negre had made it clear that HI would need to complete its elections and have in place a stable set-up well before the World Cup.         
	HI has missed the deadline in the past but FIH was generous in allowing them extra time. Were HI to miss the bus again, there is a possibility that FIH might seriously consider shifting the event out of India.         
	In the latest episode, HI failed to clear the affiliation mess in Rajasthan where a dissident group moved the High Court, which issued a stay order on the affiliation process Saturday and gave four weeks time to the respondents.

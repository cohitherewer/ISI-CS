The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Michael Clarke looking ahead
                                                                                                                       7                                        Michael Clarke looking ahead
  - In T20, nothing surprises: Lloyd
            LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI              Michael Clarke                      
	New York:American Airlines flight 1384 from Bridgetown on Monday was teeming with passengers having some connection with cricket. Officials, the media, fans...         
	The Boeing 757 also carried cricketers past and present  West Indies legend Clive Lloyd, Australias T20 captain Michael Clarke and quick Shaun Tait.         
	Disembarking at JFK after a nearly five-hour flight (passengers in economy had to pay even for pillows and blankets!), Clarke told The Telegraph: Its done with (the disappointment of losing the final to England), fact is we played very well in the World Twenty20. One is looking ahead now.         
	Australia, indeed, did play quality cricket to make their first title-round in three editions. England, however, were awesome on Sunday and won by seven wickets.         
	A team right on the button would be the best way to describe the Paul Collingwood-captained England.         
	Clarke is taking a days break and will head for Sydney, via Los Angeles, on Tuesday night. He is expected to be off cricket for three weeks, before preparations begin to face Pakistan in England.         
	According to Lloyd, who heads the International Cricket Councils cricket committee, Englands aggressive approach made the difference in the final.         
	Speaking exclusively, Lloyd said: Pakistan (in the semi-final) almost showed that Australia could be beaten. Like Pakistan, Englands batsmen attacked and got rewarded.         
	Asked if the result surprised him, Lloyd replied: No, in T20, nothing surprises and dont forget England played well. This is their first win on the biggest stage, but they did make quite a few finals before this one.         
	Lloyd was referring to the 1979, 1987, 1992 World Cups and the 2004 Champions Trophy.         
	In 1979 and 2004, England lost to the West Indies. As for 1987 and 1992, they were defeated by Australia and Pakistan, respectively.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | De Ridder disputes Qadsia winner
                                                                                                                       7                                        De Ridder disputes Qadsia winner
            A STAFF REPORTER            De Ridder                           
	Calcutta: East Bengal coach Phillippe de Ridder felt that Al Qadsia of Kuwait didnt show enough sportsmanship, while scoring the match winner at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday.         
	When Al Qadsias Almotowaa Bader scored the winner, East Bengal left back Saumik Dey was on the ground with a bleeding nose.         
	Everywhere, fair play is advocated. When a player is injured, you generally stop play. Thats called fair play. But certainly, our opponents didnt seem to be interested in fair play. I have told the club management to look into the matter and see if we can lodge an official protest with the AFC, an upset De Riddder said at the media conference.         
	The Belgian cited fatigue as the reason for the loss but said he was proud of his teams performance. I am happy with the way the boys played. In fact, we could have won the match, De Ridder said.         
	Al Qadsias goalkeeping coach Ahmed Dashti, however, did not find anything wrong with the winner.         
	We should look at the video. When their player (Saumik) fell down, another player had the ball. Why didnt he clear the ball? Bader was right in snatching the ball and scoring the goal. There is no question of not abiding by the Fair Play rules, Dashti said.         
	Even Chinese match commisioner Lin Weiguo saw nothing wrong in Qadsias third goal. Its a completely legitimate goal. No problem with it, Lin said.

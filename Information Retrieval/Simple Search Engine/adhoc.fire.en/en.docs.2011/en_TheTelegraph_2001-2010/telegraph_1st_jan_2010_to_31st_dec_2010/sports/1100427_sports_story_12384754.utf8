The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Lyon need a spirited show
                                                                                                                       7                                        Lyon need a spirited show
Bayern Munich have to do without suspended Franck Ribery                  Bayern Munichs Arjen Robben in Lyon, on Monday. (AFP)                     
	Lyon: The spirit which saw off Real Madrid earlier in the competition will be revived if Olympique Lyon are to fell Bayern Munich on Tuesday and book their place in a first Champions League final.         
	Trailing 1-0 after the first leg in which the Germans had to play most of the game with 10 men after Franck Riberys sending off, Lyon striker Lisandro Lopez and coach Claude Puel said the Ligue 1 side need to up the ante.         
	The team must change their attitude, their mentality. We played too defensively. We must have a more positive mind-set. We need to change tactics if we are to progress, Lisandro told reporters.         
	The Argentine said Lyon should be inspired by their performance at the Bernabeu in the first knockout round when a 1-1 draw gave them the edge against Real Madrid after a 1-0 win in the first leg.         
	Weve made it once, we can do it again. That day, we all wanted to go through.         
	Puel said Lyon were likely to be a better team now that they have their backs against the wall. I prefer this (kind of situation) because we play better when we have to go and get a result, he said.         
	Puel, however, has some defensive woes before the clash at their Stade Gerland, with centre back Cris doubtful with hip and knee pains, Mathieu Bodmer ruled out injured and Jeremy Toulalan suspended after picking up a red card in Munich. Centre Jean-Alain Boumsong has resumed training following a calf injury and should at least be in the squad.         
	Following their scrappy 1-1 league draw against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday, Bayern must up their tempo and they will have to do that without playmaker Ribery, suspended following his red card in the first leg.         
	Ribery will be joined on the sidelines by Croat Danijel Pranjic, who is also suspended. Ukrainian Anatoliy Tymoshchuk could not make it to France due to sickness.         
	As Bayern chase an unprecedented treble for a German team with domestic honours also in their sights, they are also concerned about a potential weakness in their central defence.         
	Martin Demichelis and Daniel van Buyten picked up injuries in the game against Gladbach and are racing against the clock to be fit for the match.         
	I could not step on my leg after the hit, Van Buyten said after taking a knock on the thigh and limping off. It is even worse now and I do not know if I will have enough time to recover by Tuesday.         
	Demichelis was taken off at halftime with a thigh muscle injury.         
	But Bayern sports director Christian Nerlinger sounded confident both would be fit in time, saying: As things stand now I assume both will be available for the match against Lyon.         
	Captain Mark van Bommel will add steel to the midfield with the Dutchman returning to Champions League action after sitting out a suspension in the first leg. We have often conceded goals in away games this season but thats not a problem because even if we concede six goals tomorrow (Tuesday) and we score five, were through, the Bayern captain said.         
	Coach Louis van Gaal said he was confident his team would overcome their injury woes thanks to their German mentality, which helped them knock Fiorentina and Manchester United out on away goals in previous rounds.         
	Our willpower is just incredible, we have always managed to stay alive this season even during games when we were trailing, he said. When I was a coach in the Netherlands and my team had to play against a German one, I used to tell my players that they had to be ready to play until the very end of the game. Our team is made up of German players and of foreign players who have been playing in Germany for quite a long time and are now immersed in this special German mentality. Ive come here with 17 players and I can only field 11 so if I miss the three others, Ill still have 14 available players.

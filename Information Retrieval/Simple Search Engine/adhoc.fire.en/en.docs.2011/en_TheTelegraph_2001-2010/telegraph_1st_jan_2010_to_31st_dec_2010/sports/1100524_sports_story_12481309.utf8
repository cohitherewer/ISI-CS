The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Clay is not Murrays surface yet: Becker
                                                                                                                       7                                      Clay is not Murrays surface yet: Becker
            Mark Hodgkinson                      
	Paris: On Andy Murrays profile page on the website for the mens tour, it suggests that his favourite surface is clay, and if thats a joke rather than a mistake, its in poor taste, after the draw he has got for Roland Garros.         
	If Murray had been paired with Richard Gasquet in the first round on the Wimbledon grass, or to open against the Frenchman on the hard courts of the Australian Open or US Open, there would not be such a debate about whether he will progress.         
	Even though Murray made the quarter finals in Paris last season, he is still regarded as vulnerable on the terracotta courts. Clay just isnt his surface yet, Boris Becker told this newspaper.         
	It is Murrays misfortune that he will run into Gasquet when the former world No. 7 and Wimbledon semi-finalist is hitting the ball so sweetly again. Just a week after he won a second-tier Challenger title in Bordeaux, Gasquet won his first tour-level title for three years when he took a third-set tiebreak against Spains Fernando Verdasco for a 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 victory in Nice on Saturday.         
	Gasquet missed the 2008 French Open because of injury, and he was barred from playing last year after testing positive for cocaine at a tournament in Miami earlier in the season.         
	An independent drugs tribunal and the Court of Arbitration for Sport have since accepted his story that the cocaine entered his system when he kissed a girl called Pamela at a club in south Florida. It will be Murrays first match with Gasquet since the Scot came from two sets down to beat him in the fourth round at Wimbledon two years ago.         
	Green or blue courts are better for Murray than the orange-red ones of Paris. It is his Beckers opinion that Murray, the world No. 4, cannot yet be considered a contender for the Coupe des Mousquetaires.         
	Even though Murray has made improvements during the clay-court season  he had no confidence in his game when he lost his opening match in Monte Carlo, but he won a match in Rome, and he was a quarter finalist in Madrid  he is still some way off being a challenger on the surface.         
	I think that even though he can win some matches in Paris, hes not going to be the French Open champion. I would be very surprised if Murray wins in Paris, he said.         
	Murrays draw didnt help, as if he defeats Gasquet, he could have to beat Juan Ignacio Chela, then Marcos Baghdatis, then Tomas Berdych, then Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, then Roger Federer, and then Rafael Nadal if he is to become Britains first French Open champion since Fred Perry in 1935. If that happens, then clay truly would become his surface of choice.         
	Becker, a former world No. 1, argued that Murray must at least win a few rounds in Paris if he is to give himself the best preparations for a successful English grass-court season.         
	He has to turn the motor back on, and realise that Wimbledon starts for him at the French Open. If he can win some matches in Paris, thats going to help in London, said Becker.         
	This year, he has been struggling on hard courts, his best surface, as well as on clay courts. He just needs to start winning more matches. He cannot, all of a sudden, just switch it on, as Federer can.

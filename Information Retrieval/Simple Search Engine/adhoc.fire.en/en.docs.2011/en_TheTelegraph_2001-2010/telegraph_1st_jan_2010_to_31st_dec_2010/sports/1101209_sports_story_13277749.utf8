                                                                                                                       7                                        Sreesanth is optimistic 
                  Sreesanth                     
	Mumbai: Memories of a sparkling tour exactly four years ago still fresh in his mind, India medium pacer Sreesanth is again travelling to South Africa with the belief that Mahendra Singh Dhonis men have it in them to win a Test series there.         
	People always ask me what is the difference between the old and the new Sreesanth. Its just the same... But I guess, Im more matured and focussed now, which is obvious. You get matured with age, Sreesanth said.         
	The hard and bouncy pitches of South Africa might have been Indias nemesis, but Sreesanth strongly believes that this time there would be a turnaround.         
	There is nothing difficult there. If its difficult, its possible as well (to win a series there). We love challenges and are really looking forward to the series. Its about taking one ball, one day at a time, he said.         
	As a 23-year-old, in his sixth Test appearance four years ago, he had produced his best bowling effort to pack off South Africa for a paltry 84 at the Wanderers, leading India to a famous win. The visitors, however, lost the remaining two Tests and returned home defeated.         
	His Wanderers performance  5/40 in an innings and 8/99 in the match  till day remains his best-ever bowling effort. Thanks to that spell of fast bowling, India managed their first win in South Africa after 12 attempts.         
	Recalling the teams last tour of South Africa, the Kerala bowler said: In the last series, I was about 23... I was full of energy as every youngster is.         
	Every member of the side is a great motivator. Im really lucky to be part of the side. There is something to learn from every one.           (AGENCIES)

                                                                                                                       7                                      Bhambri storms into final
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Yuki Bhambri lived up to his reputation by overcoming second seed Damir Dzumhur of Bosnia and Herzegovina to reach the boys singles final at the Youth Olympic Games, in Singapore, on Thursday.         
	Yuki, a former world No.1 junior who is seeded sixth here, defeated Dzumhur 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 in the semi-finals, at the Kallang Tennis Centre.         
	The 18-year-old Delhi lad, who entered the last-four clash having not dropped a set, will play unseeded Juan Sebastian Gomez of Colombia in the final on Saturday.         
	Representing the country at the Olympics is every athletes dream and this is the junior form of the Olympics. So its great to be in the final, Yuki told The Telegraph from Singapore.         
	It has been a tough season for Yuki with injuries denying him a shot at the coveted Wimbledon crown.         
	A medal here is not going to be a compensation. Nothing can be compared to Wimbledon, Yuki said. What I can take away from this event is an Olympic medal and getting my name into record books.         
	He won the Australian Open junior championship last year but skipped Wimbledon. Then played back-to-back $10,000 ITF Futures event in Delhi. Given a chance, Yuki said he would play at Wimbledon instead of the professional event.         
	The 57 tall teenager, who suffered an ankle injury three months ago, said he still hasnt returned to his best form, in terms of fitness. I am feeling a lot better. The fitness is coming back but I can still improve physically, he said.         
	Meanwhile, shuttler H S Prannoy had to be content with a silver, after losing in the summit clash on Thursday.         
	He lost 15-21 16-21 to Pisit Poodchalat of Thailand in a 40-minute contest.

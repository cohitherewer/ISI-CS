The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | NZC not to sack Vettori
                                                                                                                       7                                      NZC not to sack Vettori
                      
	Wellington: The Test and ODI thrashing at the hands of India has prompted New Zealand Cricket to start a review of the teams performance but the body has ruled out sacking captain Daniel Vettori.         
	NZC chief executive Justin Vaughan said the 0-5 ODI loss after a 0-1 Test defeat to India within weeks of an embarrassing one-day whitewash against Bangladesh has led to concerns about the teams progress just a couple of months before the World Cup.         
	But Vaughan dismissed suggestions that the inspirational Vettori, who has been leading the team since 2007 and even doubled up as coach for a brief period, would lose captaincy because of the twin debacles.         
	I wouldnt think so, Vaughan told a New Zealand daily. We need to go through a proper review and talk about what options there are to help the side improve, but Id be hard pressed to believe the captaincy would be one of those issues, he said.         
	Vaughan is planning discussions with team manager Dave Currie, Vettori, batting coach and selector Mark Greatbatch and performance director Roger Mortimer.         
	One of the options being considered is to offer a bigger role to former India coach John Wright, who is currently looking after the NZCs High Performance program. (PTI)

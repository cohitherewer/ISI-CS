                                                                                                                       7                                      Looking good for Robben, Drogba
            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH AMP; AGENCIES                      
	Injured Holland winger Arjen Robben is on his way to South Africa to join the squad after receiving treatment on his injury.         
	Coach Bert van Marwijk told reporters that Robbens recovery is going well but was evasive when asked whether the Bayern Munich player will be fit for Mondays Group E opener against Denmark.         
	Meanwhile, Didier Drogba joined his Ivory Coast teammates for practice Friday but remains in doubt for the teams opening World Cup match against Portugal because of his broken arm.         
	The captain wore a protective cast and kept his right arm still as he worked on his ball skills and fitness. Drogba was hurt in a friendly against Japan last Friday and had surgery a day later.         
	We cant risk any contact at this point, coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said at the teams headquarters in Vanderbijlpark. He feels better and better.         
	The Italians though were more optimistic after positive news on midfielder Andrea Pirlos injury following another medical test on his injured left calf.

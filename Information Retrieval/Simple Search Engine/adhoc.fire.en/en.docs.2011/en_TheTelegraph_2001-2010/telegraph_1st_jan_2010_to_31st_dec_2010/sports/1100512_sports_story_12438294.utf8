The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Churchill face a tall order
                                                                                                                       7                                      Churchill face a tall order
                      
	New Delhi: Churchill Brothers, after hitting rock bottom in the 1-7 humiliation at the hands of Kuwait SC, face a tall order in Al Qadsia, another Kuwaiti powerhouse, when the two lock horns for their single-leg AFC Cup pre-quarter final match in Kuwait City on Wednesday.         
	Captain and star striker Odafe Okolie will be available for the match at the Mohamed Al Hamed Stadium after missing the tie versus Kuwait SC with a double yellow.         
	Al Qadsia are on a high after successfully defending their Kuwait Premier League title and go into Wednesdays match with an unbeaten record in the group stages.         
	However, Churchill coach Carlos Alberto Perreira said the pre-quarter final match would see a different Churchill side take the field.         
	The Kuwait SC match was a good lesson for us and we studied the mistakes we made. The game against Al Qadsia will be an entirely different match, said Perreira. (PTI)

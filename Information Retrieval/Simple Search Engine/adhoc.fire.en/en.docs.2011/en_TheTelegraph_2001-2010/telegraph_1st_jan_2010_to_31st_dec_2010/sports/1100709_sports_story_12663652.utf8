The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | For Ross, Murali is still a chucker
                                                                                                                       7                                        For Ross, Murali is still a chucker
    - I dont care as long as Im clean, says off-spinner                 Muttiah Muralidharan with wife Madhimalar, in Colombo,   on Thursday. (AP)                                 
	London: Sri Lankan off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan does not deserve to retire from Test cricket as the most distinguished wicket-taker of all time, feels former Australian umpire Ross Emerson, who had no-balled him seven times during a Gabba one-day International years back.         
	I havent changed my views in 15 years  he doesnt deserve the record, said Emerson, who was barred from international cricket after no-balling Muralidharan in a one-day game against England in Adelaide in January 1999.         
	Emerson, who made his ODI umpiring debut in a Sri Lanka-West Indies match in Brisbane in 1996, had no-balled Muralidharan seven times and continued to do so even when he switched to bowling legbreaks.         
	You couldnt compare his record to Shane Warnes  no one ever doubted the legality of Warnes action. Murali was a great competitor and a great bowler but a lot of the time he just didnt bowl within the limits of the law, Emerson was quoted as saying by an English daily.         
	Muralidharan, the worlds leading wicket-taker in both formats of the game (792 Tests and 515 ODI wickets), has decided to retire from Test cricket following the first Test against India in Galle, beginning July 18.         
	Muralidharans action first came under the scanner when another Australian umpire Darrell Hair called him for throwing during Sri Lankas tour Down Under in 1995-96.         
	Hair still stands by his decision.         
	I have no angst over him holding the record but the fact that the rules had to be changed to handle bowlers like that vindicated my actions and the actions of other umpires who called him, Hair said.         
	Once they changed the rules and made it legal for bowlers to bend their arm to 15 per cent they gave an advantage to a couple of bowlers [Muralidharan included] who could get something extra from that rule.         
	I would rather see the rule as it was where you couldnt bend your arm at all. That would mean everyone was the same, Hair said.         
	The 38-year-old, who made his debut in 1992 against Australia, had the world cricket debating about his unorthodox bowling action.         
	Three years after his debut, Muralidharan was called for throwing during the 1995-96 Australia tour by Hair and ICC soon recommended a bio-mechanical analysis, which concluded that his action created the optical illusion of throwing.         
	But still he was charged with suspected action again in the 1998-99 Australia tour by Emerson and was sent for further tests in Perth and England before being cleared once again.         
	He faced the same charges in 2004 but the Sri Lankan kept on taking wickets and overtook West Indies Courtney Walshs 519-wicket mark to become the highest wicket-taker in Test history.         
	Meanwhile, Muralidharan himself said on Thursday that he was not bothered with the scrutiny he faced in his career.         
	No I dont regret. There are so many people for me, and so many people not for me, he said.         
	People have opinions, they can carry their opinions. I dont care as long as I am clean... And my supporters think I am clean.

	Calcutta: Former Delhi DareDevils skipper Virender Sehwag feels it is not necessary for an Indian player to lead an IPL team in order to communicate better with his own players.         
	Its unimportant whether an Indian or a foreigner leads the side. Whats more important is whos leading the side. Whether that person is able to bring out the best in his players or not. Look at Shane Warne. How well he has been leading the Rajasthan Royals. The most important aspect of playing in the T20 format is being able to play freely and without any pressure. That brings the best out in you, said Sehwag on the sidelines of a promotional for Emami on Wednesday.         
	As to Sri Lanka batsman Tillekaratne Dilshan not being selected for some matches (now he has been diagnosed with a stone in the gall bladder), Sehwag defended the team managements decision of playing David Warner and Paul Collingwood instead. Both are fantastic players and it is difficult to drop them at this moment. Only four foreign players can play, so at times you have to keep some of your best players in reserves, he added.         
	When leg-spinner Amit Mishra was asked about his feelings at being overlooked for the World T20, he said: My job is to perform wherever I play. Selection is not in my hands. I am happy that currently I am the highest wicket-taker in the IPL. I would like to carry on with this kind of performance. The key to success in all formats is the power of adapting to various situations. I am trying to learn the subtle nuances of the leg-break from legends like Shane Warne and Anil Kumble.

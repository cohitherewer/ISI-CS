	New Delhi: Amid the football frenzy in the country because of the World Cup, 28 national players would leave the country on Wednesday for the Portuguese capital of Lisbon for a two-month training-cum-competition tour as part of Indias preparation for the Asian Cup in Doha next January.         
	The players train at the facilities of either Sporting Lisbon or Benfica under coach Bob Houghton. They will play five or six friendlies with second division sides in the Iberian country.

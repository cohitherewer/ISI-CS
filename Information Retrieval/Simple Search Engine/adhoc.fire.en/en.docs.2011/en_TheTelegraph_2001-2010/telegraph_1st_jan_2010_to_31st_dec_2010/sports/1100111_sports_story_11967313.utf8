The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Roddick wins Brisbane final
                                                                                                                       7                                      Roddick wins Brisbane final
                      
	Sydney: Andy Roddick survived a fightback from defending champion Radek Stepanek to win the Brisbane International final on Sunday.         
	Roddick was forced to dig deep after throwing away a substantial second set lead before finally beating the Czech 7-6, 7-6 at the Pat Rafter Arena. Everything looked to be going smoothly for Roddick, playing his first tournament since a knee injury cut short his 2009 season last September.         
	He won the opening set in a tiebreak after all games had gone with serve and opened up a commanding 5-1 lead in the second before he suddenly got the wobbles.         
	He twice failed to serve out the match as Stepanek forced a second tiebreak then faltered again as he neared the finish line. Roddick made a great start and built a 6-1 lead to have five match points, but he blew it before winning 9-7.         
	It was weird. I dont think I have squandered a lead where I have been putting in first serves and making approach shots, Roddick said.         
	And in the breakers it was the same deal. I kept making first serves so that was helping me hold on to the last shred of sanity I had. (Reuters)

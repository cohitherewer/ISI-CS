                  Ryan McLaren in action, on Thursday                     
	North Sound (Antigua): A career-best spell from Ryan McLaren bowled South Africa to a 13-run victory in the first of two Twenty20 Internationals against the West Indies here.         
	McLaren captured five for 19 from 3.5 overs Wednesday to earn the Man-of-the-Match award, as West Indies, chasing 137 for victory from their 20 overs, were dismissed for 123 with one ball to spare at the Vivian Richards Cricket Ground.         
	The 27-year-old McLaren finished with the second-best figures in a Twenty20 International behind Pakistans Umar Gul, who collected five for six from three overs against New Zealand at The Oval in London in last years World Twenty20.         
	Both the West Indies and South Africa came into Wednesdays match having failed to make it through to the knockout stages of this years World Twenty20, which England won in Barbados.         
	Its a good way to start off the tour having practised indoors and not outdoors for the last few weeks, said McLaren.         
	But its only the first day, and theres plenty more cricket to come, so hopefully, I can better this performance.         
	We all know the nature of T20 cricket  the bowler is always up against it. You can take five wickets one day, and the next day, take a thumping, but I enjoyed it.         
	South Africa captain Graeme Smith added: It was not an easy day for the batters, and you had to graft pretty hard.         
	Playing shots was not easy, and there was a strong wind, so there were a lot of things you had to take into consideration.         
	It was obviously nice to start with a win. This was the most important thing for us.           (AFP)

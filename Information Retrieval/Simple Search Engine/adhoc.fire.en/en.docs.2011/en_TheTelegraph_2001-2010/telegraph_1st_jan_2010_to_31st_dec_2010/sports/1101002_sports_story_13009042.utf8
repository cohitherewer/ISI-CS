The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Somdev gets the top billing
                                                                                                                       7                                      Somdev gets the top billing
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Somdev Dev Varman was given the top billing in the mens singles in the Commonwealth Games, while Sania Mirza was seeded second in the womens section, in the draw held at the RK Khanna Tennis Complex, on Friday.         
	Expectedly, the famed pair of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi had no challengers for the top billing in mens doubles.         
	With a host of top stars like former world No.1 Llyeton Hewitt, world No.4 Andy Murray and world No. 18 Marcos Baghdatis deciding to stay away, the Indians tennis players seem to have a strong chance of winning medals across all categories .         
	Jaideep Mukerjea, one of the three Indian coaches for the Games, said he is confident of the hosts finishing with at least three to four medals. We have a very good chance of winning three or four medals. The home conditions are in our favour. Both Somdev and Rohan are in good touch and so are Leander and Mahesh, Mukherjea said.         
	Somdev, ranked 100, should have an easy outing in first round, where he takes on unranked Devin Mullings of Bahamas. Rohan Bopanna, ranked 473, takes on another unranked player Robert Buyinza of Uganda. Bopanna, however, can run into world No.130 and second seed Peter Luczak of Australia in the second round. Luczak plays Dmitri King Darian of Barbados in his first round.         
	Australias Matt Ebden is seeded third and he meets Patrick Dunstan Ogier of Great Britain.         
	In womens singles, second seed Sania Mirza, who has got a bye in the first round, would not only carry medal hopes but would also give herself a chance to revive her ailing career. Sania, ranked 131, will take on the winner between Maleeha Solih Aminath of Maldives and Britanny Teei of Cook Islands in the second round.

	Adelaide: After West Indies had been world champions for about 15 years, the wheel turned to Australia in 1994-5. It remains to be seen whether this England team will evolve into the world Test champions, but if they do, it is possible the first two days of this Adelaide match will be identified by future historians as the moment when the wheel turned irrevocably in their favour.         
	Inspired Australian cricket might have kept England down to a modest lead on the first innings, but Alastair Cook eliminated such a possibility. It was a Cook who started White Australia and it might well be a Cook who brings the era of their cricket dominance to an indisputable end.         
	His bat is as wide as a door said Australias wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, after staring at the back of it while Cook scored 67 and 235 not out at Brisbane, followed by another century, his 15th in all Test matches.         
	Cook personally remedied the one weak point in Englands performance on this tour to date: their shortage of first innings runs. Only in Hobart, against Australia A, had they reached 300; and another shortfall here could have led to unpleasant consequences for England batting fourth on a wearing pitch. Half a kilometre from the Oval, across the Torrens, the Ghan sets out from Adelaide station and takes two days to reach Darwin; England planned their journey to be of similar length.         
	But instead of a quiet opening hour, settling into their seats, England saw their first carriage derailed after leaving the station. Andrew Strauss pushed his first ball of the day for a quick single, and left his second, which he might have thought would swing away, only it didnt. Nor did it bounce above stump-height, as he might have expected the new ball to do, but took his off bail instead.         
	For Strauss it has been an uneven series: 0, 110 and one, and his century was only a couple of inches from being a first-baller. But it is fair to say the stresses on an England captain in Australia are more intense and prolonged than in any single sporting contest.         
	But soon England were back on track and making rapid progress.         
	The best feature of Trotts batting in this series has been his growing assertiveness. There has been no introversion; perhaps a few choice Australian words bring Trott out of himself. In any event, by playing his strokes, Trott has allowed Cook to go at his sweet pace.         
	Before clearing the suburbs though and reaching open country there were two more scares for England. Besides a wicket falling in the first over of the day, the parallels almost extended to a re-enactment of the run-out at the start of Australias innings, with Trott at the receiving end this time.         
	Fielding coaches should tell their charges the best chance for a run-out often comes when a big appeal goes up for LBW. The fight-or-flight mechanism impels many batsmen to run to the other end, come what may. Trott was sent back by Cook, correctly; and he was saved because Xavier Doherty did not set himself for the throw as Trott himself had done in the games first over, and missed by about a metre.         
	The other scare was when Trott, trying to assert, edged a drive to gully where it went through Mike Husseys hands, to his mortification.         
	When Haddin later dropped Trott, hooking down the legside on 76, it was Australias eighth consecutive drop since they had last held a catch, in the first innings at Brisbane.         
	Lunchtime, when England were 90 for one, offered a comparison between the teams. Englands reserves pursued excellence in their World Cup preparations with the catching bleep test: running 20 yards then taking a sharp catch, to and fro, and ever faster, until they were ready to drop  to drop themselves, that is, but not the ball.         
	Cook had been defensive in the morning, reaching 35 by lunch: a square-drive, as scorching as the sun, was his one self-indulgence. He took three boundaries from the first over after lunch, by Bollinger, and with such ease that Ponting was prompted to start a bouncer war, from the Cathedral end. As Trollope tells us, a cathedral can be the source of venom, but the bouncers would have been more effective if fired from both ends.         
	Dohertys left-arm spin from the Torrens end was not venomous. Trott handled the short stuff well, if not quite as unflappably as Cook, but fell soon afterwards when he mistimed a clip to midwicket: his strength had for once proved a weakness. And because the Australians had held on to a catch at the ninth attempt, it meant they had taken two wickets in a day, a major improvement on their rate of penetration at the Gabba.         
	But it has been the Australian batting which has failed here rather than their bowling, which would not have looked so ineffective if the home side had posted 450 when batting first, as the pitch demanded. Ryan Harris was vigorous throughout, waspishly sharp, and Peter Siddle strove, even if Bollinger faded as the day wore on.         
	England picked up more speed once Pietersen had played himself in and began to accelerate. The heat picked up too.           THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

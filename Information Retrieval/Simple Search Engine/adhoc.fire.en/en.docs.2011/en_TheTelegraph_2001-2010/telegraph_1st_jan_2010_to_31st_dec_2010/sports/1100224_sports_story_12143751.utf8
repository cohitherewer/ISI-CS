The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CAB plans new system
                                                                                                                       7                                      CAB plans new system
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Worried by the standard of umpiring, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is to revamp the recruitment of umpires from next season with preference to former players aspiring to become match officials.         
	We are planning to invite former players who have played first division cricket for a considerable period. There is a plan that the cut-off for qualification will be lesser than that for non-cricketers, CAB joint secretary Arun Mitra said.         
	This is in the wake of the umpiring blunders committed by Subhranil Pakrashi and Supriyo Sarkar in the first division league match between Calcutta Customs and Kumartuli last Sunday where one called dead-ball and the other no-ball for the same delivery. Later, the duo also signed two different scoresheets with different results.         
	Mitra said that the duo would be summoned again for questioning.         
	The two umpires will be called again next week. If we find their answers unsatisfactory they will be severely punished, Mitra told reporters Tuesday.         
	Mitra also admitted that the quicker the decisions regarding the controversial matches were taken, the better it was for the associations image.         
	Also on Tuesday, the West Bengal Police and Aryan authorities submitted their respective scoresheets for the record 514 run chase by the former, which is also under the scanner.         
	Myself along with assistant secretary Naresh Ojha and tournament committee chairman Prabir Chakraborty will be examining the scoresheets. If we need any help, we will call up expert scorers and umpires who will also scrutinise the sheets, Mitra said.         
	However, there is a growing feeling in the CAB that the clubs, if proved guilty of match-fixing, will at best escape with a light financial penalty. The CAB bosses arent thinking along the lines of a ban as that may have legal implications.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Injuries hurt us: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Injuries hurt us: Dhoni
  - Team india captain heaps praise on wrecker-in-chief steyn              OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              Dhoni on Tuesday      
	Nagpur: India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni looked composed at the post-match news conference on Tuesday. After suffering a huge defeat, he admitted that they were completely outplayed by the South Africans.               
	The following are excerpts         
	The turning point of the match         
	Dale Steyns first few overs in our first innings, when we lost three crucial wickets, made the difference. It was always very difficult to come back after that. Also, when the ball was changed, they luckily got one which started to reverse a lot. However, credit goes to the South Africans, especially Steyn, for putting up a brilliant performance.         
	On Dale Steyn         
	It was certainly the best exhibition of conventional swing bowling that I have witnessed in the last couple of years. Normally, in these conditions, one doesnt get that much swing.         
	Whether it was difficult to judge Steyns deliveries         
	It used to be difficult to decide to leave or play a Glenn McGrath delivery on the off stump. Same was the case with Steyn. He was moving it both ways and it was difficult for a batsman to decide whether to play or leave. Gautam Gambhir played and perished in the first innings while in the second, he was out leaving the ball.         
	Where did India go wrong?         
	We definitely missed some important players due to injuries. That pushed us to the back foot. Injuries can cause a bit of panic in the dressing room. But this was the best possible XI that we could have selected. It was also a test of our bench strength. So I wont complain Ill only say that we were completely outplayed.         
	Playing Paul Harris         
	He is a kind of bowler who can bowl 30 overs a day. So, at some point of time, we had to play him and blocking all through was not an option.         
	Harbhajan Singhs form         
	Im not worried about him. He is a great bowler as is evident from his statistics. He is a big match player and makes comebacks in big games.         
	Bowlers performance as a whole         
	First, it was difficult for them to get anything out of this track on the first day. Then the reverse swing didnt happen for us at all. I hope we get some reverse swing in Calcutta.         
	On the bowling combination         
	If four bowlers cant do it for you, even five cant. We normally play with a 2-2 combination. Even they have four specialist bowlers. The difference is that they a genuine all-rounder in Jacques Kallis while we have to depend on parttimers.         
	The debutants         
	They did quite well. Wriddhiman (Saha) got out to a brilliant delivery in the first innings. Badrinath was composed in his first match. In fact, it was a great opportunity for them because you dont get into the Indian middle-order too often.         
	Virender Sehwags dismissal in the second innings         
	Thats the way he plays. He is a match winner and his aggression pressurises the opposition. He has the liberty to continue that way.

	Bangkok: The Indian duo of Jeev Milkha Singh and Gaganjeet Bhullar halved their foursome with the Swede-Dane pair of Peter Hanson and Soren Kjeldsen as defending champion Asia took an early lead over Europe in the Royal Trophy golf tournament here Friday.         
	Asias title defence got off to a resounding start at the Amatra with the Japanese duo of Ryo Ishikawa and Koumei Oda edging out European captain Colin Montgomerie and his partner Pablo Martin (Europe) 3 amp;2.         
	In the second foursome, Jeev and Bhullar could not get the better of their opponent but they ensured the lead stayed.         
	Jeev has been in good form of late. The good times started when he finished the 2008 European Tour season ranked 12th on the Order of Merit.         
	Europe, however, caught up with Asia when the Robert Karlsson-Alexander Noren got the better of the Chinese duo of Charlie Wi and Liang Wenchong 4 amp;2.         
	The Thai duo of Prayad Marksaeng and Thongchai Jaidee wrested the initiative back in the final foursome of the day when they beat the Simon Dyson-Henrik Stenson pair 3 amp;1 to put Asia 2.5-1.5 ahead.         
	Jeev and Bhullar had a decent start but they could not hold on to it.         
	The Indian pair struck the first blow with a birdie on the second but squandered that advantage when they bogeyed the fifth hole.         
	They found themselves trailing when Hansons approach to the seventh set up a birdie but Bhullar immediately topped that with an even better iron shot at the eighth to within three feet of the flag.         
	The see-saw nature of the contest continued as the European pair conjured up a winning birdie at the 10th to go one up again, only to make a mess of the long 11th, conceding their opponents birdie putt when the best they could manage was a six.         
	Another six at the par-four 12th meant they lost a hole to a bogey. Fortunes continued to fluctuate as Asias bogey at the 17th brought the match level again, and Jeev had to hole a tricky five footer for a half at the last.         
	Later Bhullar conceded being tense as Jeev putted to earn half points.         
	What a putt that was Jeev holed on the last to earn the half. But that is what world class players do  pull something out when the pressure it at its most intense, Bhullar said of his senior compatriot.         
	The youngster said both the side fought tooth and nail and it was a fair outcome.         
	Both teams played great golf at times and struggled on other occasions, and I suppose a half was probably a fair result. It was hard-fought but enjoyable, and it is good to get something out of my first match at this level, he said.         
	We didnt play the 17th very well, but I was certain Jeev would hole that last putt, even though he missed a slippery one from about the same distance on the previous hole.         
	I said to myself: There is no way Jeev will let that happen twice. And happily, I was right, added Bhullar.         
	The Royal Trophy features four ball matches Saturday and singles on Sunday.

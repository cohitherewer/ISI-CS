The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Scope to improve our fielding, says Clarke
                                                                                                                       7                                      Scope to improve our fielding, says Clarke
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                                  Yuvraj Singh on way to his 58, in Visakhapatnam, on Wednesday        
	Visakhapatnam: Michael Clarke is disappointed at having failed to defend a target of 290, but is banking on the positives from the second one-day match.         
	I thought 289 was a pretty good score I knew the wicket would become easier in the second session once dew sets in. Thats the difference between the two teams. India scored well and were deserving winners I dont wish to offer any excuses, the Australian captain said on Wednesday.         
	Im disappointed with the result. Mike Hussey batted well and so did Craig White and John Hastings. We didnt get the desired result but we want to take the positives out of this game into the final match in Goa, Clarke said.         
	The Aussie pointed out the teams fielding as one of the areas to be worked on. We all could have done better to win the game. We can all improve. The fielding can improve... hopefully, we will put up a better show next time, he said.         
	But did he expect to reach 289 after being reduced to 16 for two? It was quite difficult early. We knew if we had wickets in hand, we could score runs. Unfortunately, it was not enough, he said.         
	Clarke is hoping Whites role down the order will come in handy during the World Cup next year. He hits clean and hard if he keeps playing in this fashion that will be good, he said.

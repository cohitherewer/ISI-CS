The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barca take on in-form Valencia
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barca take on in-form Valencia
                      
	Madrid: Cash-strapped Valencia have defied all expectations to hit the top in La Liga and are well placed to take advantage of Barcelonas poor home form when they visit the Nou Camp on Saturday.         
	Valencias precarious financial position forced them into a fire sale of their assets at the end of last season, and David Villas transfer to Barca for 40 million euros was tipped as the first step in a painful period of re-adjustment for the club.         
	Villa, who equalled Rauls scoring record for Spain in Scotland on Tuesday with his 44th goal, exited along with David Silva, Nikola Zigic and Carlos Marchena, but two months into the campaign and a new-look Valencia have silenced the doom-mongers to lead the standings with 16 points from six games.         
	Misfiring champions Barcelona are three points back in fourth.         
	Valencias astute, low-cost moves in the transfer market have paid off and forwards Roberto Soldado and Aritz Aduriz have quickly found their range, while Spain winger Juan Mata has been given greater freedom to roam.         
	Coach Unai Emery has played down their strong start, but there are early signs that a third team might be able to challenge Real Madrid and Barcelonas hegemony in Spain this season.         
	They are doing well. They are a great club and even if two or three players leave, teams like this never suffer, Villa told the Barca website.         
	Villa returned from international duty with a sore knee but has been passed fit to play on Saturday. His team mate Xavi remains a doubt as he continues to recover from the strained tendons.

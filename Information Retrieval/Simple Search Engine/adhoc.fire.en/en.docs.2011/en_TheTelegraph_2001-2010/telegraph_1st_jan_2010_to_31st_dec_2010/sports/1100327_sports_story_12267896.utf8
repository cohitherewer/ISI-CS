The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | In-form Dempo face tricky JCT
                                                                                                                       7                                      In-form Dempo face tricky JCT
                      
	Margao: On a high after their impressive win against Churchill Brothers, Dempo will be looking to keep the momentum going when they clash with JCT in a 18th round match of I-League at Nehru Stadium here on Saturday.         
	Dempo started their second phase with a narrow win over Mumbai FC but thereafter suffered twin defeats which put brake on their title race.         
	But they came back strongly in the Goan derby when they beat Churchill Brothers comprehensively to remain firmly at the pole position with 32 points, two points clear of second placed Mahindra United.         
	Dempo coach Armando Colaco said it was their best performance in the league. We played entertaining football and never felt the absence of our key players.         
	Youngsters Joaquim Abranches, Marcus Peixoto and Nicolau Borges gave their best in absence of senior players Sunil Chetri, Sameer Naik and Clifford Miranda.         
	If the boys keep on playing like this, there is no one to catch us at the top, Armando said.         
	Defender Anwar Ali is back in the side from injury but they will miss Valeriano Rebello due to double booking.         
	Sameer Naik and Clifford Miranda are fit but I will not field them in the starting line-up as I dont want to disturb the combination.         
	We need to remain in focus and play to our potential to collect full points, Colaco said.         
	JCT have the reputation of playing well against strong teams. After the win against Mumbai FC they are now seventh with 22 points. (PTI)

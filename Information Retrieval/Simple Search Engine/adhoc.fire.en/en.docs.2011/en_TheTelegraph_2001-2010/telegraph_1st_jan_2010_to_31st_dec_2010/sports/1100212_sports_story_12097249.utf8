The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Harendra: Learn from Sachin 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Harendra: Learn from Sachin 
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                  Sachin Tendulkar      
	New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar could put an end to the captaincy controversy that has rocked Indian hockey team.         
	National coach Harendra Singh, now an assistant to chief coach Jose Brasa for the World Cup, said on Thursday that senior players in the team should learn from Tendulkar, who has no problem playing under anybody despite being the best batsman in the world.         
	Indian cricket hasnt seen a better player than Tendulkar. Yet he is always comfortable to play under any captain. If he can play under (MS) Dhoni, then why not our hockey players do the same, said Harendra, virtually admitting there were rifts in the Indian team over the captaincy issue.         
	The job of the coaching staff is to coach, not to select the captain, said Harendra. So I cannot comment on the captaincy problem. But I have told the boys that in case there is a problem, they should talk to Hockey India (HI) officials, he added.         
	I had talks with all the players, including Rajpal and Prabhjot. I cited the example of Dhanraj Pillay, who played four Olympics but was never given the honour to lead the team. Did he run away? No, he was very much there and gave his 100 per cent, said Harendra.         
	The Indian team were having closed door practice sessions at the Major Dhyanchand Sports Complex for the past 10 days but Harendra said he was always willing to interact with the media.         
	We are not in hiding. It wasnt my decision to practice in seclusion, so I should not comment, he said.         
	Rather, I would appeal to the authority to make arrangements so that the boys and the coaching staff get an opportunity to talk to the media at least thrice in a week, he said.         
	The coach said his team was ready to take on anyone in the World Cup. The physical fitness of this team, I can say with conviction, is extremely good.         
	It has three top quality drag flickers, who are capable of delivering the goods. Believe me, there is no problem in the team and we should be able to reach the semi-finals, said Harendra.         
	I had said it before and I am saying it again, 2010 is going to be the make-or-break year for Indian hockey. If we manage a podium finish, we would be carried on shoulders.         
	If we lose, brickbats are waiting for us. I know that and the boys also know that very well, said the former international.

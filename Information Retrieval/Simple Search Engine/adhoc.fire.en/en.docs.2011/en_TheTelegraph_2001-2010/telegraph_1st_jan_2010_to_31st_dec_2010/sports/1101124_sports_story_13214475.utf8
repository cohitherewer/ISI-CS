The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Raina needs a break: Dhoni
                                                                                                                       7                                        Raina needs a break: Dhoni
  - What is needed to play in India, is not applicable in South Africa, says Team India captain       OUR CORRESPONDENT             Ishant Sharma celebrates after dismissing the last New Zealand batsman, Chris Martin, on Tuesday. (AFP)                                 
	Nagpur: Mahendra Singh Dhoni thinks Suresh Raina needs a break to return among runs. The Team India captain told at a press conference Tuesday that they had even contemplated resting him for the final Test against New Zealand.               
	The following are excerpts               
	If he expected the game to end so early         
	No, I thought it would be a bit late. We all knew that it was a turning track. There was something for the spinners. Since it was the fourth day, it meant that after a while even the fast bowlers would get the reverse swing going. What was important was to start well in the morning. That was one of the reasons why we declared late. We wanted the hard ball for the 10 overs in the evening It really worked for us and the bowlers bowled really well.         
	Whether there was any special planning this morning         
	It is important to take wickets early in the morning as it creates a sense of panic in the dressing-room You can then put more pressure on the opposition with your spinners. But you can say, it was one of those days, where everything fell into place.         
	His views on Dravid and Ishant Sharmas performance         
	Well, of course, you want your bowlers to bowl well. Rahul, batting at No.3, gives us the stability with Viru and Gauti opening the innings. Viru, you know, plays aggressive cricket and gives us the momentum. And after that, it is the responsibility of Rahul and Sachin coming at No. 3 and 4 to give that stability based on which the lower-order can also contribute. It was great to see Rahul score. Of course, Ishant He got injured and was out. We thought of continuing with Sreesanth in the first two games. Then Zaheer got injured, and he got his chance. He would have felt a bit of pressure about what will happen once Zaheer comes back. He bowled well and in the right spots, which is important.         
	On Suresh Rainas poor form         
	He really needs a break because he has played as many series as I have... Plus, he played one more series in Zimbabwe. International cricket drains you... More than the physical, it is the mental part. Unfortunately, many of the senior players are missing for the coming ODI series, and he will have to continue. But, you know, he is at a point where he really needs a break from cricket. That 10-15 days break will definitely help him to get back into the groove.         
	His thoughts on replacing Raina in the first Test against SA         
	Well, if he doesnt get a break in the ODI series, then we will have to. Because one of the options was to rest him in the last Test, so that he can play the ODIs. But as we thought that he would most likely be getting a break in the ODIs, we played him in the Test. Unfortunately, he is not getting a break in the ODIs. So, it is little tough on him. He is a part of the squad for the first two games, and, hopefully, the team does well and he gets an opportunity to rest for the last three ODIs.         
	The reasons behind not resting Raina         
	I really dont know what to say... I requested the Board for rest and luckily got it. It will help me to freshen up before the South Africa series. Physically, Raina is not struggling. And being the leading fielder in the side, you have to keep yourself active throughout the day.         
	On Indias performance in the Test series         
	I think we played 60 per cent of our potential, whatever the reasons We have the potential to play much better.         
	Whether the early start, from the second day onwards, helped the fast bowlers         
	Dont think so. Because there was not much for the fast bowlers You had to bowl consistently and keep it in the right areas and be fresh for the second and the third spells, which were important. Once the new ball gets old, that reverse swing was crucial, and you had to be fresh for that.         
	If he was happy with the Nagpur wicket         
	We just wanted a wicket where there was something for the spinners. On a wicket where the fast bowlers can also get reverse swing. So, you can say, this was more of an Indian track. This is the kind of wicket you expect in the subcontinent. But, at times, the wickets do end up being flat.         
	On New Zealands batting         
	Most of the New Zealand batsmen did well in the series. When you come to India, being not from the subcontinent, what you fear is the turn and bounce that the spinners will get. It was not really there in the first two Tests. This was the only wicket, where there was something for the spinners. It wasnt that fearsome track that we used to get earlier... But what really stood out was their fielding.         
	His thoughts on leaving for SA early         
	It will definitely be good because the conditions in South Africa are very different compared to the subcontinent. So, its always good to spend some time there, especially for batsmen, as the bounce is really different. What is needed to play in India, is not applicable in South Africa.         
	The key to be successful in SA         
	I think adapting to the conditions will be very crucial. Not to think too much ahead will be important... Utilising the break that we are getting now will be crucial.         
	If the winning streak puts extra pressure         
	It is already a part of history. As I always say, I dont think too much ahead. What is important for me is the present.         
	His take on the UDRS         
	I still have the same views and I stick to it. If the umpires keep on continuing with the same kind of mistakes that go on Maybe, it doesnt have that much of an impact on wickets, which are doing something for the bowlers. But on flat tracks, where there is nothing for the fast bowlers and spinners, you know, it becomes difficult to get batsmen out. If more than two or three mistakes happen in one innings, then you end up bowling 40 or 50 overs more than what you should have. It is certainly a point of discussion We should decide whether to take something, which is not proven to be 100 per cent accurate...

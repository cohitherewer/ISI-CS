	Calcutta: A dazzling all-round performance by Katherine Brunt powered England to an exciting three-run victory in the second one-day International against India at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore Sunday.         
	Katherine slammed a racy 21 down the order to take England to 183 for seven first, and then returned with a five-wicket haul to shoot out the hosts just three runs off the target.         
	Electing to bat first, the World Cup and Twenty20 champions were faced with the ignominy of losing their second successive game when Katherine Brunt arrived at the square, the score card reading a miserly 155 for seven in the 48th over.         
	Katherine struck four boundaries while raising 28 quick-fire runs in the company of the spunky Isa Guha (7 not out) to take the visitors to a respectable 183 for eight.         
	Katherine then returned to harass the Indian batsmen with the new ball, scalping Anagha Deshpande, Anjum Chopra, Priyanka Roy and Rumeli Dhar in a trice. She later accounted for Preeti Dimris wicket.         
	Katherines outstanding show with the ball over-shadowed the four-wicket haul (4/30) of India left arm tweaker Gouhar Sultana.         
	India were staggering on the ropes at 16 for four before Mithali Raj, who tops the ICC batting rankings, and Amita Sharma thwarted the English attack with a resolute 122 stand for the fifth-wicket.         
	Mithali, who made 62 in the first ODI on Friday, remained unbeaten with 91. Amitha made 40 before she was castled by the nippy Isa Guha.         
	Skipper Jhulan Goswami (19) offered support to Mithali, raising 45 runs for the sixth wicket before Jenny Gunn had her stumped.         
	Meanwhile, Heather Knight will be joining the team, an ECB release said. Knight will be replacing wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor who sustained a hip injury during the first ODI.

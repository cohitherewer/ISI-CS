            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: Former India captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi feels that its time that we have proactive, eloquent and constructive BCCI for the benefit of the game.         
	The ICC is the voice of cricket but BCCI is the invoice, Pataudi said, while delivering a lecture at the inaugural RSD World Cricket Summit, organised on the 75th birth anniversary of late Raj Singh Dungarpur.         
	Pataudi was commenting on the corruption that has been the bane of international cricket for quite some time. He also feels that the lack of stringent laws on gambling in India is a problem that needs to be addressed.         
	The BCCI has a lot of central cabinet ministers and also leaders of opposition parties in their ranks. So they should lobby for more stringent rules against gambling as 70 per cent of money and 80 per cent of the viewership comes from India.         
	If Pataudi feels that match-fixing is a big menace, his one-time teammate, Bishan Singh Bedi, feels that chucking is an equally big problem that is ruining international cricket.         
	If you ask me whether Muttiah Muralidharan has taken 800 wickets, I would call them 800 run-outs! I am not ready to believe that you can bowl a doosra without chucking, Bedi, who had criticised Muralidharan earlier too, lashed out.         
	On one hand, you have a magician like Shane Warne and on the other side you have a Muralidharan It puts things in shambles, he added.         
	But Indias World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev feels that blaming someone for chucking is of no use. Blame the authorities that have allowed players to chuck. If you allow someone to do something wrong, the fault is with the authorities, said Kapil.

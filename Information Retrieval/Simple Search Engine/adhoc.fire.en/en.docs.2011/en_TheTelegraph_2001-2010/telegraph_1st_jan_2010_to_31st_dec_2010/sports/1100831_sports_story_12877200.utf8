The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Now Veena caught in fixing slur
                                                                                                                       7                                      Now Veena caught in fixing slur
                      
	London: An Indian photographer Dheeraj Dixit Monday alleged that it was popular Pakistan actress and former girlfriend of Mohammed Asif, Veena Malik, who had approached him with a claim that she managed seven Pakistan cricketers.         
	I could strike a deal for fixing matches with their help. She did not name the players but told me that if you want we can make a big deal.         
	That time, 2-3 matches with Australia had taken place and more were in the offing, Dixit said.         
	During that time, she told me if I had any big businessman from India who wanted to earn a lot of money in a night, then I can introduce him to her, Dixit told Indian television channels.         
	Veena, in her interview to a Pakistani television channel, alleged Dixit was a bookie whom Asif had paid for spot-fixing during matches.         
	Dixit, however, denied the charge and said Veena had called him when he was in Dhaka, January this year.         
	She told me Pakistan were already on that tour and all the matches were fixed there, Dixit claimed in an interview.         
	 He claimed he never met Veena and cant even identify her if she comes in front of me.           (PTI)

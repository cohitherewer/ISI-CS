                                                                                                                       7                                      Bombay HC dismisses Modi petition
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: The Bombay High Court, on Wednesday, dismissed Lalit Modis petition seeking the dissolution of the BCCI disciplinary committee, which is inquiring into allegations of misappropriation of funds in the IPL against him, but refrained from expressing a final opinion on the issue.         
	Chief Justice Mohit Shah and Justice D Y Chandrachud, while dismissing the petition, said that the apprehension of bias Modi had claimed against Arun Jaitley and Chirayu Amin, on the three-member Committee, was not real.         
	However, they said that Modi could raise the issue of bias while challenging the final decision of the committee and the BCCI.         
	Modi, suspended as IPL chairman as well as all other positions until completion of the inquiry, had approached the court after the committee rejected his demand for the recusal of Arun Jaitley and Chirayu Amin.         
	There has to be some material on record to prove allegations of bias ... the test in such cases is to see if there is a real danger of bias and not an apprehension of bias, the judges said.         
	The bench rejected the arguments of Ram Jethmalani, counsel for Modi, for the basis of bias and said that there was no need for the court to intervene at this stage.         
	Jethmalani, had argued over the last two days that the two committee members were part of the IPL Governing Council that approved the filing of charges as well as the decision to initiate the inquiry against Modi and as such should not be on the panel to hear the case.         
	Modi had also claimed that since he had revealed Amins interest in buying a stake in a winning bid for the Pune franchise, the latter had reasons to be prejudiced.         
	The court ruled that Amin did not commit any Illegality in trying to buy a stake and with the consortium concerned losing the bid, there arose no conflict of interest.         
	The judges also reasoned that Amin and Jaitley did not stand disqualified just because they were part of the BCCI general body that decided to scrap the media rights contract with WSG.         
	Modi had lost earlier appeal prior to the commencement of the inquiry as well, when he sought a complete quashing of the disciplinary probe by the BCCI.         
	Then, the court had dismissed the appeal and asked Modi to approach the committee itself with his recusal demand. It had also said that he could challenge the final verdict of the committee after the completion of the inquiry.         
	The committee subsequently rejected his appeal on August 11.         
	Meanwhile, the BCCI said its stand on the issue of bias was vindicated.         
	We are happy that the court did not give any relief to Modi. The committee will proceed, the witnesses are already on the list and the meeting would go ahead (in New Delhi), BCCI Chief Administrative Officer Ratnakar Shetty said after the hearing.         
	BCCI has always adopted a stand that we are not vindictive, we want a proper inquiry and a charge sheet was given to him (Modi). The (court) had dismissed his earlier petition also, he added.         
	Mehmood Abdi, Modis counsel, alleged that the BCCI was in a hurry to wrap up the inquiry. Whats the hurry? Its humanly impossible to reach there (New Delhi). How can you examine all witnesses in three-four hours? What was the need to bring all of them together? This is unprecedented haste, speaks volumes for itself, Abdi said.

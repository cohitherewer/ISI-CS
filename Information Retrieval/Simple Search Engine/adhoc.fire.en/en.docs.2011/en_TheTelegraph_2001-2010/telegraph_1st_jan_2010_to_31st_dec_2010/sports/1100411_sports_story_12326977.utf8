                                                                                                                       7                                      DareDevils look to avoid slip-up
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      
	New Delhi: Hosts Delhi DareDevils, whose four-match winning streak was broken by the Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens the other day, would definitely be a more wary lot at the Kotla on Sunday when they take on the Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League (IPL).         
	With 12 points from 10 matches  six victories and four defeats  the DareDevils are now two wins away from an assured place in the semi-finals and the team would hardly like to find their campaign derailed against a team who, with only six points, have been languishing at the bottom.         
	We want to win the next two matches and relax. We want to qualify for the semi-finals sooner rather than later. IPL is tough and we dont want to be in a crunch situation where every team will be scrambling for a semi-final spot, said DareDevils coach Greg Shipperd after the teams practice session.         
	Asked whether Ashish Nehra would play against the side from Punjab, Shipperd said the bowler was very close to full match fitness. He is very impressive at the nets but we will have a close look at him again before taking a final decision. We want to win in front our home crowds, he added.         
	The Kings XI, however, have the ability to play party-poopers as made evident in the matches against the Knight Riders and table toppers Mumbai Indians. On both occasions, the Kings XI were worthy winners who proved quite capable of turning the tables on the best teams in the competition.

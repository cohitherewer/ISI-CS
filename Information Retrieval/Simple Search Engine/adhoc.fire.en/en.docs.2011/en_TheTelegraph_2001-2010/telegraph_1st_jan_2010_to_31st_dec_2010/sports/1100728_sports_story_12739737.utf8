	Kumar Sangakkara scored 219 and Mahela Jayawardene struck 174 as Sri Lanka declared their first innings at 642/4 on the second day of the second Test, Tuesday.         
	Though the declaration came immediately after Jayawardenes dismissal, India began a determined reply with Virender Sehwag hitting an unbeaten 64 as the visitors reached 95 without loss in 18 overs. Following is the scorecard:

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Matches raise eyebrows
                                                                                                                       7                                      Matches raise eyebrows
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Controversies surrounding the Cricket Association of Bengal league matches refuse to die down. On Sunday, there were two matches that came under the scanner for various reasons.         
	At the police ground, West Bengal Police, who were languishing at the bottom half of group A chased down a mammoth 514-run target set by Aryan. Not only did the policemen win, but they chased the target losing only three wickets in 79.5 overs with Ashim Das scoring 226 and Kingshuk Das scoring 138. The win ensured West Bengal Police, who were staring at relegation play-offs, will now be playing in the Championship play-off round with 20 points from eight matches.         
	However, the run-chase has come under the scanner and, with Aryan already through with 22 points, popular belief in the Maidan circle is that the match may have been fixed.         
	Such has been the level of suspicion, that the CABs tournament committee chairman Prabir Chakraborty will seek the umpires report as well as the two scorebooks (during league matches, the two rival teams maintain their own scorebooks respectively) to check out the matter. The two umpires were Ananda Das and Sandip Chakraborty         
	West Bengal Police had won only one match in their past seven outings and never for once scored in the region of five hundred.         
	However, West Bengal Police coach Arun Sarkar and senior Aryan batsman Satyen Bhattacharya both vehemently denied the accusations.         
	Two Aryan bowlers  Akashdeep Chakraborty and Abhijit Banerjee  gave 80 and 90 runs respectively. Prabir Mukherjee, a spinner, gave away 166 runs in 29 overs.         
	The matter has been brought to the CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiyas notice by senior CAB officials. I will seek the details about it when I go to the CAB tomorrow (Monday), Dalmiya said.         
	At the Customs ground, the Kumartuli-Customs tie ended in a dispute. Chasing Customs score of 189, Kumartuli were 181 for nine when their No. 11 batsman Mrinmoy Mukherjee was adjudged run-out by leg umpire Subhranil Pakrashi. But the other umpire, Supriya Sarkar, had ruled it dead ball. When the two umpires requested Customs to restart the match, overruling the earlier decision, Customs were reluctant to do so.         
	The umpires signed both the scoresheets (one belonging to Kumartuli and other to Customs). But in a awkward development, while the Customs scoresheet said they have won by eight runs, the Kumartuli scoresheet stated that the match was incomplete.         
	Summarised Scores         
	 Aryan 514/7. WB Police 515/3 (Ashim Das 226, Kingshuk Das 138). WB Police won by 7 wkts.         
	 Bhowanipore 354/6. Dalhousie 210/7 (Sk. Noor Islam 3/58). Match drawn.         
	 George Telegraph 320/6. Belgachia Utd 297/9 (Abhishek Ghosh 102). Match drawn.

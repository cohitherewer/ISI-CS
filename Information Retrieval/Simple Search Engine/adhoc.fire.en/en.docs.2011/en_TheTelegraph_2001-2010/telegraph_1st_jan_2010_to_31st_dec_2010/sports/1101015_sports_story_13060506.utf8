The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Toughest match of   my career: Saina
                                                                                                                       7                                      Toughest match of   my career: Saina
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                            
	New Delhi: The first game and match point down, at 19-21, 20-21, the only thing Saina Nehwal kept telling herself was give it your best. And, when she won the next point to equalise the score at 21-21, all she could think of was the fact that she had to win the game.         
	There was intense pressure. I had to come out of it. For the first time in my career, I was match point down. It was a test for me, to see how I could come out of such a situation. This final was the toughest match of my career till date, said Commonwealth Games gold medallist Saina.         
	The world No.3 beat Malaysias Mew Choo Wong 19-21, 23-21, 21-13 to win the 101st CWG medal for India, on Thursday. The womens singles medal was also the final one in the offing, on the final day of the event.         
	Before Sainas win, the womens doubles duo of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Poppanna, had beaten top seeds Shinta Muria Sari and Lei Yao 21-6, 21-19 in their final.         
	Last week, in the mixed team final, Saina had defeated the world No.19 in straight games. Today, Wong was returning everything. She didnt let a single point get away because she had come determined to win the gold. I had no specific strategy to counter her, but I played a lot of drop shots and had to be on my toes continuously, said Saina grinning.         
	Wong made Saina work very hard to earn her gold medal. And this gold made all the difference to Indias final tally. Saina earned India their 38th gold to be one ahead of England, and finish the Games at No.2, behind Australia.         
	After Jwala and Ashwini won gold, I could not let India down. We knew that the final count would depend on our medals tally, so we had to give it our all, said Saina.         
	In between the games, my coaches kept my confidence level high. They never gave up on me, especially Gopi sir (Pullela Gopichand), she added.         
	The first thing you notice about Saina is how humble and hard working she is. I dedicate this medal to my country first, the spectators and most importantly, my parents and coaches. Everything I am is because of my parents (Harvir Singh and Usha Rani), said the proud Indian. My mother had warned me to be alert against Wong! She had also told me not to get intimidated by the large crowd. My father is at home, watching television as he gets too nervous during my matches!

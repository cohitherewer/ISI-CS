	He has worked with the South African team and is currently Indias bowling coach. He was also available during the IPL and that made it an ideal situation for us, added Mathur.         
	I have heard lots about the DareDevils and I have also seen some of them at close quarters while working with the Indian team. It will be a great experience to work during the IPL and I look forward to the experience, said Simons, whose fellow South Africans  AB De Villiers and Wayne Parnell are already members of the DareDevils.         
	Simons, 47, was appointed bowling consultant of the Indian team for the Test series against Bangladesh and the Test and ODI series against South Africa.         
	Simons, a medium-pace bowler and a handy lower-order batsman, played for Western Province and came into the South African team in 1994 at the age of 32. An all-rounder, he bowled fast-medium besides being a powerful middle-order batsman.         
	In just over a year from 1994, he played 23 ODIs and took 33 wickets.         
	After retirement, he became the Western Provinces coach and in September 2002, he was appointed national coach.

	Calcutta/Lahore: Mohammed Asifs former girlfriend, actress-model Veena Malik, has handed over proof of his alleged links with Indian bookies to an official of the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit.         
	Hasan Raza, who is a top official of the ICCs Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) for South Asia, met Malik at her residence here after she alleged that Asif was involved in match-fixing and she had ample proof of this.         
	I handed over Asifs voice recordings with the bookie and some other related information to the ICC official, Malik told a TV channel.         
	From head to toe, Pakistani players and officials are involved in match-fixing. I had gone with Asif to Bangkok before Pakistans tour of Australia. Asif told me he was offered $40,000 by an Indian bookie to under-perform in Australia but he demanded $ 200,000.         
	When The Telegraph called the number on which Veena had been available on Wednesday night, a man named Sohail Rashid who claimed to be her manager said: It is true that Veena met ICC officials today and handed over some crucial evidence. However, we are not at liberty to say the nature of the discussions that took place.

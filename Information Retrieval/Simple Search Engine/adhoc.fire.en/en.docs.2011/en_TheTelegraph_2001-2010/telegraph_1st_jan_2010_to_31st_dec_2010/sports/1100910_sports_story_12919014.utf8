The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Extension of KKR job: Dav Whatmore
                                                                                                                       7                                      Extension of KKR job: Dav Whatmore
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: If you have been an active top level coach for two decades, its difficult to sit back in an air-conditioned chamber doing nothing. For Dav Whatmore, getting into the thick of things is more important, which is the reason he chose to work with Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) for the development of junior cricket.         
	Its a long monsoon in Mumbai. All you do is to sit in the KKR office the whole day doing nothing. As a coach, you would like to have mud on your hands and sweat it out in the middle. Therefore, when this offer came up, I was happy to work with CAB for the development of junior cricket. Obviously, I will have to attend KKR meetings when the need be, but I will try and devote as much time possible, Whatmore, told reporters during a press conference at Eden Gardens.         
	He added: I see this assignment as an extension of the job I am doing for the KKR. At KKR, our endeavour is to ensure that CAB has a solid back-up of good first-class players who will do well at the highest level. Its not just about playing in the IPL. If you are a good first-class player, then only you will turn into a solid T20 player and not the other way round. Ninty nine per cent of the domestic players who have done well are solid first-class players. I dont hope to change much from what has been done over the years. But obviously, we can always do better from whats there at present.         
	The former director will also play an integral part in chalking a module for the upcoming state cricket academy at Kalyani.         
	Quizzed about the standard of Bengal juniors as compared to the youngsters from other states, Whatmore said: I would say pretty much the same. As you move up the ranks, its your ability to adapt to different situations, being level headed, are some of the aspects that make the difference. The association may provide you with facilities and infrastructure but the responsibility to perform lies with the players.         
	On the same topic, Whatmore was asked about what former India colts player Sreevats Goswami should do to regularly play in the longer format as a keeperbatsman. Its a difficult situation to be in (as Wriddhiman Saha is the first choice keeper). Its important to know where you are playing your cricket, Whatmore concluded.

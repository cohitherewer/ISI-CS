	The stadium is located in the centre of Johannesburg and has hosted many epic sporting events including the 2009 Confederations Cup final between Brazil and the United States. The ground was given a significant facelift before the Confederations Cup finals and now seats 62,000 fans. Ellis Park was first built in 1928 as a rugby union stadium. It was demolished and rebuilt in 1982, again exclusively for rugby. The ground will always occupy a special place in the hearts of the countrys sporting fans after the South African rugby team shocked New Zealand to lift the 1995 Rugby World Cup.

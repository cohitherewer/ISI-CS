The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Barreto boosts Mohun Bagan
                                                                                                                       7                                      Barreto boosts Mohun Bagan
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Predicting Jose Barretos role in Mohun Bagans matches has become as simple as foretelling Mawsynrams weather.         
	Day in and day out, Barreto has made it a habit of being the bridge between Bagan and victory.         
	No matter the opposition or the occasion, if Bagan win, more often than not, its because of the Brazilians individual brilliance.         
	Monday was no different as Barretos brace played the key role in the green and maroon brigades 3-0 victory against Southern Samity in a CFL Premier Division tie.         
	His strike partner, Murithala Ali, was probably one of the busiest players on the pitch, though most of his efforts were as dull as a traffic jam.         
	That he scored Bagans third goal was thanks to teammate Snehasish Chakrabortys well taken shot and Southern goalkeeper Amit Singha Roys butterfingers.         
	Murithala tapped in unchallenged in the third minute of added time in the second half.         
	Earlier, Barretos 10-yard sprint in the 10th minute gave Bagan their first goal.         
	Latching on to a loose ball, he outpaced the rival defender and slotted it coolly past an advancing goalkeeper.         
	Bagans second, too, came after the regulation time when Barreto took advantage of a goalmouth melee to push it in.         
	However, coach Stanley Rozario would have to oil his machinery well if he harbours high hopes in the I-League.         
	Bagans defence and midfield requires serious improvement.         
	Teams         
	Mohun Bagan: Shilton Paul, Biswajit Saha, Karan Atwal, Sagram Mandi, Nagimuddin Mullick, Gouranga Dutta (Edeh Chidi, 67), Jayanta Sen, Souvik Chakraborty (Snehasish Chakraborty, 73), David Laibiakzara (Surabuddin Mullick, 79), Murithala Ali, Jose Barreto

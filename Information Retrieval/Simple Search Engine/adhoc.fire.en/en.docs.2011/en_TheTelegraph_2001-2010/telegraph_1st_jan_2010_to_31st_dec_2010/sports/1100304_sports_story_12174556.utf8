            A STAFF REPORTER            Sachin Tendulkar                           
	Calcutta: They have played international cricket together for a decade. Now former India captain Sourav Ganguly is the latest to join the bandwagon of celebrities who feel batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar should be conferred with the prestigious Bharat Ratna award.         
	Sachin is a jewel. He deserves Bharat Ratna. No doubt about it, Sourav stated, asked whether Sachin should be conferred with the highest civilian honour of the country.         
	Incidentally, Sania Mirza, who was in the city on Tuesday, also said Sachin deserves the honour.         
	It must be mentioned in this regard that state sports minister Kanti Ganguly has personally requested Sourav to speak to Sachin and co-ordinate a felicitation organised by the state government.

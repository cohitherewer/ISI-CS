	Johannesburg: Fast bowler Morne Morkel took three wickets in seven balls Sunday to lead South Africa to victory over England by an innings and 74 runs and level the series at 1-1 in the fourth and final Test.         
	Morkel removed Ian Bell, Matt Prior and Stuart Broad in the first session on the fourth day at the Wanderers to run through the middle order as the Proteas dismissed England for 169 to retain the Basil DOliveira Trophy from the 2008 series win.         
	Morkel finished with four for 59 and had seven wickets in the match like Dale Steyn, who claimed five for 51 in the first innings as England were bowled out for 180.         
	Morne has risen to the occasion, Steyn said. Without Makhaya Ntini here, he has stepped up to the plate and delivered.         
	Paul Collingwood was the only England batsman to shine in the Test, making 71 Sunday to add to his 47 in the first innings. He totalled 344 runs in the series, the third best in the series behind South Africas Graeme Smith (427) and Hashim Amla (363).         
	England had held on for draws in the first Test in Pretoria and the third match in Cape Town with last-wicket stands, winning the second Test in Durban by an innings.         
	South Africa captain Smith, who scored 105 on Friday, praised the fortitude of the visitors.         
	Credit to England and their captain Andrew Strauss for their resilient performances and for the way they played in Durban, Smith said. (Agencies)

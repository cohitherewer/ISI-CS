	Milan: The Champions League kicks off this week with powerhouses such as favourites Barcelona along with defending champions Inter Milan and former champions Manchester United yet to hit their stride, leaving the door open for nasty surprises in games they would ordinarily win.         
	Barca host Panathinaikos in their Group D opener on Tuesday after being stunned in 0-2 defeat at home by promoted Hercules in their second La Liga outing of the campaign on Saturday.         
	The Nou Camp will still be recovering from the shock with the fans hoping Lionel Messi and Spain World Cup winners David Villa and Andres Iniesta wont play as badly as they played against the minnows.         
	AC Milan, whose late signings of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Robinho led excited fans to suddenly start snapping up Champions League season tickets, suffered similar woe at the weekend as they prepare to welcome Auxerre in Group G on Wednesday.         
	The seven-time champions lost 2-0 at promoted Cesena, a team with financial problems who are back in Serie A for the first time since 1991. Debutant Ibrahimovic missed a penalty.         
	Milans new coach Massimiliano Allegri, a former Cagliari boss with no experience of European soccer, hoped the defeat would bring his millionaires down a peg or two after news Serie A players also plan a strike in a fortnight over contracts.         
	City rivals Inter fared only a little better, struggling to beat Udinese 2-1 with Diego Milito again looking a shadow of the striker who was key to their treble success last term.         
	New coach Rafael Benitez has looked extremely pensive in his first few outings in the Inter dugout, especially after an appeal for new players went unheard in the boardroom.         
	They start their defence with a Group A trip to Dutch champions Twente Enschede on Tuesday with doubts over the fitness of key defender Maicon.         
	Jose Mourinho, the architect of Inters success last season, starts his bid to become the first coach to win the European Cup with three different teams when his Real Madrid side welcome Ajax Amsterdam in group G on Wednesday.         
	Real too have looked lacklustre in their early season games although Cristiano Ronaldo returned from injury in Saturdays 1-0 win over Osasuna.         
	Manchester United face Rangers at home in Tuesdays Group C opener.         
	Meanwhile, Sir Alex Ferguson has backed Wayne Rooney to hit top form immediately on his return to the United side.         
	The United manager is confident that the troubled strikers performance will be unaffected by the turbulence in his private life when he lines up against the Scottish champions at Old Trafford.

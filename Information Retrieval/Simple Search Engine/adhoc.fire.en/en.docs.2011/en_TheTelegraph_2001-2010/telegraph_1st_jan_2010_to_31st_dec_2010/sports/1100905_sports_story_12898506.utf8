The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Best chance to clean up   game: Dravid
                                                                                                                       7                                      Best chance to clean up   game: Dravid
                            
	New Delhi: Former India captain Rahul Dravid has called for a thorough and comprehensive investigation into the spot-fixing scam and said the current scandal is cricket biggest chance to clean itself.         
	Terming the International Cricket Councils (ICC) move to suspend three Pakistani cricketers  Salman Butt, Mohammed Asif and Mohammed Aamer  for their alleged role in spot-fixing during the Lords Test as a positive step, Dravid said the inquiry against the trio should be taken to its logical conclusion.         
	The last thing we need is for the events of this week to be swept under the carpet. No guilt must be attached until the investigations are complete, and everyone deserves a fair chance to defend themselves. But the process must be thorough and comprehensive, Dravid said.         
	Dravid, who wants ICCs investigation to be completed before the matter is moved on to a proper inquiry carried out by investigators with the law of the land behind them, said: It (scandal) has been a horrible scar on cricket, cricketers and fans.         
	The most necessary outcome would be swift and strong punishment to anyone found guilty.         
	In the past people once judged guilty turned up after a few months just because time had passed. It was as if everyone had forgotten what days like these feel like for the majority of honest players in the game, the right-hander was quoted as saying by a website.         
	While recommending a full-fledged inquiry with severe penalties to those proved guilty, the former India captain said he does not like the security measures which are in place at the moment.         
	No one wants to be under watch all the time. I hate that there are cops and security on our floor in every hotel the team lives in, but that is what the game requires, Dravid said.         
	About ICCs Anti-Corruption Code, he said: Its not just about the right rules being laid down but also ensuring that people who break those rules pay the penalties and face the consequences.         
	Dravids long time teammate and Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Anil Kumble feels that right steps will be taken to avoid such episodes during the Champions League T20 in South Africa.         
	Every tournament, every international match that happens is under a perceived threat, he said. I dont think we need to be worried about these things but we cant close our eyes. ACSU is there to deal with it.         
	On a different note, Kumble, said the speed at which teams adapt to the pitches in South Africa will be crucial to their success in a short tournament like the Champions League Twenty20.         
	He also said it was too late to bring in Kevin Pietersen, who has no international commitments during the Champions League after being dropped from Englands limited-overs squads.         
	It is the first tournament for a lot of teams, Kumble said after an interaction with more than 50 Bangalore fans on the eve of the teams departure.         
	In South Africa, it is the beginning of the season and it is the first game of the season for some of the players in RCB as well. The biggest challenge is how quickly you acclimatise to the conditions and the need to start well in the tournament.

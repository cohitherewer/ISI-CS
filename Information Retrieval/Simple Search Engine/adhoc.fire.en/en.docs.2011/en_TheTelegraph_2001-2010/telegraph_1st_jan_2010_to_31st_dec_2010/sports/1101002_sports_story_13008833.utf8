The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | City lads ready to vroom in Chennai
                                                                                                                       7                                      City lads ready to vroom in Chennai
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: Falcon Racing, an initiative of the students of MCKV Institute of Engineering in Liluah, is designing a car that will participate in the Supra SAE India, the Indian leg of the Formula student racing competition held worldwide. The Indian leg will be held in Chennai, in July, next year.         
	In this event, each team will design a prototype based on laid down rules and regulations. The racing kit, approved by FIA for the driver during the race, will be borrowed from Armaan Ebrahim.         
	This Formula racing team from the city, comprising undergraduate engineering students, is made of 25 members and two interns. The team has already designed a test car, out of junk, which was on display at the City Centre, recently.         
	The team has successfully participated in Formula SAE design challenge, a virtual event, held in Coimbatore last year.         
	Their initial plan was to participate in Formula Student Germany 2009 competition, but insufficient funds had put paid to their hopes.         
	The technical aspects are being looked into by Manoj Shaw.         
	At first, we decided to use a standard Royal Enfield 500cc engine for our car. We modified it to 612cc with new internal racing parts imported from the UK. Around Rs 2.5 lakh had already been spent, when the organisers of Supra SAE India asked the teams to use only Maruti 800 cc engines, which has come as a drawback for the team, said a spokesman.

	Johannesburg: After facing legal action from Cricket South Africa, opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs may now face the wrath of fellow players for his sensational revelations in his controversial autobiography To The Point.         
	Tony Irish, chief executive of the South African Cricket Players Association, told a local daily that Gibbs could get into further trouble for his allegations against fellow cricketers. I have already spoken to Majola and there is a process which must now run its course, Irish said.         
	Herschelle is still a contracted player and that is why it is also important to look at what he says in his interviews about the book, he added.         
	The CSA Wednesday announced that it had sought legal advice .         
	Meanwhile, Gibbs has no regrets about the bunch of animals remark directed towards the Pakistani fans during a Test at Centurion in 2007 but said by no means he was a racist.

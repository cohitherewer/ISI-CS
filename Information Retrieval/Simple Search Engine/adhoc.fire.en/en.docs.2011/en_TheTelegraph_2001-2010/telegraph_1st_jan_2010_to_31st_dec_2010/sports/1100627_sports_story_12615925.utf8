The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Gyan takes Ghana to quarters
                                                                                                                       7                                      Gyan takes Ghana to quarters
                      
	Rustenburg: Asamoah Gyan scored at the start of extra time to give Ghana a 2-1 win over the US in their World Cup second-round match on Saturday to take his team into the quarter finals. They now take on Uruguay.         
	Gyan hooked a left-foot shot into the roof of the net in the 93rd minute. Gyan had latched onto Andre Ayews deep ball and maintained his balance as he beat American defenders Carlos Bocanegra and Jay DeMerit before shooting.         
	Ghana and the United States were level at 1-1 after regulation time.         
	Landon Donovan scored from the penalty spot for the US after Kevin-Prince Boateng put Ghana ahead in the 5th minute with a low shot from the edge of the area after being allowed to race through unchallenged from the halfway line.         
	Donovan sidefooted into the net in the 62nd minute after Clint Dempsey was fouled in the penalty area by Jonathan Mensah.         
	US goalkeeper Tim Howard was beaten at the near post by Boatengs low shot. Robbie Findley squandered a chance to level in the 35th, with a tame shot blocked by goalkeeper Richard Kingsons outstretched left leg.

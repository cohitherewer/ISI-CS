The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Two-match series not enough, says Bedi
                                                                                                                       7                                        Two-match series not enough, says Bedi
                  Bishan Singh Bedi                     
	New Delhi: Former captain Bishan Singh Bedi on Tuesday questioned the efficacy of a two-Test series between India and South Africa and said Mahendra Singh Dhonis men should have played at least one more match in the rubber.         
	I think a two-match series is not enough to test the mettle of the teams. There should have been three or five matches in the forthcoming series between India and South Africa, Bedi said.         
	Since both the teams are at par and the series is expected to produce some cut-throat contests, the number of matches should have been more. After all, it will not be the real test of the teams, added Bedi.         
	Bedi, however, was not ready to bill anyone as favourites in the series.         
	If one team is currently No. 1 in Test ranking, then the other one is the former No. 1 and is certainly striving to wrest the tag from India. Both teams have enough firepower to give other trouble. So we should not consider anyone as favourites, he said.         
	Expectations will create pressure on the team. Dhonis men should not take the pressure and go all out against the Proteas, Bedi added.         
	A 2-0 win will ensure that the Proteas replace India on top of the ICC Test rankings, while 1-0 outcome will see both teams level on 123 points.         
	Yes, Rahul (Dravid) and Yuvraj (Singh) are not in the squad, but we should not think about them who are absent. In am sure, there are others in the team who can compensate for them, the left-arm spinner said.         
	Asked if he was happy with the current Indian spin attack, Bedi said: It is not important whether I am happy or not. I feel spinners like (Amit) Mishra and (Piyush) Chawla should consider themselves lucky to play for India and should give everything for the country.

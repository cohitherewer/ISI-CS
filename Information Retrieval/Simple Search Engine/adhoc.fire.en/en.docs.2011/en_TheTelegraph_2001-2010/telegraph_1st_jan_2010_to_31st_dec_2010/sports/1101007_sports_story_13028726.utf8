The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Aussies bowled over by Laxman 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Aussies bowled over by Laxman 
            A STAFF REPORTER                      
	Calcutta: A day after Australia suffered a shocking one-wicket loss at the hands of India, the media Down Under were unanimous that it was their old nemesis VVS Laxman who made all the difference on the final day of the first Test at Mohali.               
	The following are excerpts from the leading Australian dailies on Wednesday:         
	Courier Mail: Australia lost their once-famed killer punch in England last year and the fact that it is yet to return is a desperately worrying sign ahead of the revenge Ashes battle this summer. Lets get one thing straight  losing to India on the sub-continent is no disgrace. Plenty of great Australian teams have returned home from those dry dustbeds with their tails between their legs. But the manner of the defeat tells a much bigger story. It continues the theme from the Ashes last year when Australia could not convert the dominance of having six of the top seven run scorers in the series and the three top wicket-takers.         
	Sydney Morning Herald: Ultimately the battle between scrapper and stylist, gritty and graceful, artisan and artist ended in favour of a vastly relieved home side. Regardless, it was a triumph for Test cricket. The thrill-a-minute versions of the game were put in their place by this slow-burning contest.         
	Laxman was the key figure on the final day. All things seem possible whilst he remains at the crease. Australians and tension bring out the best in him. Romps in the park make him appear humdrum. Here he produced an astonishing array of strokes, pulls played without footwork, caresses through cover, flicks off his hip and all the while he kept his head. Ricky Pontings side tried its utmost but was denied as much by its own limitations as by the wheel of fortune or the brilliance of its opponent.         
	The Australian: Four overthrows and the impregnably brilliant VVS Laxman have combined to deny Australia victory. Laxman, who was batting with a runner because of a bad back, farmed the strike as Ricky Ponting offered singles early in the over and attempted to restrict them late. Mix-ups threatened and both sides were at fever point as they knew a single mistake could cost the game. As it probably did.         
	The Daily Telegraph: Bollinger was unable to bowl after lunch because of an abdominal strain and questions must also be asked about his shoddy, two-day preparation because of his commitments with the Chennai Super Kings in the Champions League Twenty20 event. With India 32 runs short of victory, Ponting turned to the part-time spin of Marcus North rather than use No.1 slow bowler Nathan Hauritz. North bowled tidily, squeezing dry a few runs, but Australia desperately needed a wicket.         
	Herald Sun: When Mitchell Johnson caught Ojha in front for what appeared a clear lbw with India needing six to win, his appeal was refused by umpire Billy Bowden...Laxmans startling performance, after batting at No.10 in the first innings, maintained his extraordinary record against the Australians, who have been on the receiving end of six of his 16 Test centuries.

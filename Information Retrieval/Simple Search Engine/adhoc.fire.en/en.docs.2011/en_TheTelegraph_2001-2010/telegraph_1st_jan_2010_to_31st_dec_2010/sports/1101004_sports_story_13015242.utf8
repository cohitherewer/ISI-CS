	London: Blackpool had an afternoon to remember, with a shock 2-1 win at Liverpool, on Sunday, which left Roy Hodgsons misfiring side, in the bottom three of the Premier League.         
	Chelseas Didier Drogba proved Arsenals nemesis again, when he scored the opening goal in the champions 2-0 win over their London rivals.         
	In the days early kick-off Manchester City beat Newcastle United 2-1 to leapfrog both Manchester United and Arsenal and move into second place.         
	Chelsea, who have beaten Arsenal in their last four league matches, top the table with 18 points from seven games, followed by City on 14, Manchester United on 13 and Arsenal on 11.         
	Drogba took his tally to 13 goals in 13 appearances against Arsenal with a shot that went in off the post five minutes before the break after Arsenal had dominated much of the opening half.         
	Alex sealed the win with a blistering free kick late in the game.         
	Blackpool stunned Liverpool at Anfield with a 29th-minute penalty from Charlie Adam and a second goal at the end of the first half from Luke Varney.         
	Sotirios Kyrgiakos pulled one back for Liverpool after 53 minutes but the home side, who lost striker Fernando Torres with an injury after nine minutes, could do nothing to save the match.         
	Manchester City beat Newcastle with a first-half penalty from Carlos Tevez and a 75th-minute winner from Adam Johnson. Jonas Gutierrez had equalised for Newcastle who lost Hatem Ben Arfa with a suspected broken leg after four minutes.         
	Liverpool stayed in the relegation zone, with only six points, piling the pressure on manager Roy Hodgson. His team has not won in five matches, including a penalty-shootout defeat to fourth-tier Northampton in the League Cup and a dire goalless draw at Utrecht in the Europa League, on Thursday.         
	Their great result is our nightmare result. It is a very bad day and there is nothing I can say, Hodgson said. At the moment things look bleak and really bad and it is difficult for me to put a bright face upon it. There are 31 games left but when you are in the relegation zone you are in a relegation battle.         
	Arsenal dominated possession for large spells but failed to find a cutting edge as Chelsea clinched a sixth victory in seven league matches, its only defeat coming at City last weekend. quot;We had chance after chance and just never put the ball in the net, quot; Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said.         
	Drogba enjoys playing against Arsenal and the Ivory Coast striker made the visitors pay for their early profligacy in front of goal by meeting Ashley Coles cross from the left with a flicked finish that went in off the post.         
	Marouane Chamakh and Laurent Koscielny were guilty of wasting clear chances in the first half and striker Chamakh headed wide in the second half as Arsenal piled forward in search of the equalizer.         
	Alex, who hobbled off injured in stoppage time, settled the result with a powerful free kick that swerved past Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and into the top corner in the 85th. Adam Johnson came off the bench to score the winner for City in a match marred by a suspected leg break for Newcastle winger Hatem Ben Arfa.         
	Johnson drove home an angled shot in the 75th minute to lift City to 14 points and above neighbor Manchester United in the standings.

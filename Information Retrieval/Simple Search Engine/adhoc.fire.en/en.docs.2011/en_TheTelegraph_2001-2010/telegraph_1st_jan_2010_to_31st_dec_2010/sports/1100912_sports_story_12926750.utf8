The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Brazilians are upbeat 
                                                                                                                       7                                      Brazilians are upbeat 
                      
	Chennai: Brazil have been missing chances of returning to World Group of Davis Cup since 2003 but they are determined to break the jinx this time when lock horns with India in the World Play-off tie commencing from September 17 here.         
	We are ready to break the jinx of having missed out on the chances since 2003. We have this classic situation about hard court performance.         
	This time we have very good players. Our strategy is to get five points from this tie, Brazil captain Joao Zwetsch told reporters here.         
	Speaking after a two-hour practice session at the venue here, he said: We know exactly what we could expect here and face the challenges. We will fight hard to win over India.         
	On first day two singles matches are the key for us as singles are very important. If we could play the doubles with a 2-0 lead, it would be a different situation and I will be more relaxed and it is important for our players also. We are looking to fight for gaining every point, which we know well, Zwetsch said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Pune FC edge past Mumbai
                                                                                                                       7                                      Pune FC edge past Mumbai
            OUR CORRESPONDENT                      
	Mumbai: Mumbai FC paid the penalty, literally, with the team flattering to deceive as they went down 1-2 to Pune FC in a 19th round I-League clash on Saturday.         
	Brazilian Edmar Figueira came up with two headers after Subrata Paul saved a 53rd minute spot kick by Noel Wilson.         
	Khalid Jamils side, missing key striker Abhishek Yadav and defender Anas Edathodika, silenced the visiting teams boisterous fans within two minutes of Pauls brilliant save when Darren Caldeira outsmarted the custodian with a header off a set piece.         
	But Pune FCs reply came within three minutes with Figueira heading past rival goalkeeper Lihaz Koya.         
	The home teams game began to unravel thereafter and Figueira found himself unmarked in the 72nd minute to score another header, this time down Koyas left, from a typical cross by India player S. Venkatesh.         
	Pune FC moved up to fifth on the table with 26 points while Mumbai FC remain No.13 with 20 points.         
	Meanwhile, in Goa, Junior Obagbemiro struck twice as Sporting Clube de Goa defeated Salgaocar 3-1 on Saturday.

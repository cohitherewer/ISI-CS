The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | CA not worried by India connection

	Calcutta: Four Australian cricketers have, at different times over the past 16 months or so, been approached by an Indian suspected to have links with bookies. Cricket Australia (CA), however, hasnt given special instructions to the squad currently touring India.         
	Brett Lee, Shane Watson and Mitchell Johnson were approached during the 2009 Ashes, in England, while Brad Haddin was the target in the middle of this years World T20, in the West Indies.         
	Lee, Watson, Johnson and Haddin went public about the approaches, by the unidentified Indian, days after the recent spot-fixing expose by the News of the World.         
	Of the four, Watson and Johnson are in the tour party, which is captained by Ricky Ponting. As for the Indian, the suspicion is that his principals operate out of India.         
	Cause for some alarm, at least, but CA is confident of the measures in existence.         
	No special instructions have been given to our cricketers... We have a protocol in place and everybody is aware of what has to be done (should there be an unwarranted approach)... We didnt think it necessary to go beyond what exists internally, CA spokesman Peter Young told The Telegraph.         
	Young added: That four of our cricketers promptly reported the approaches proves that the structure within is just fine... If I may add, it would be a waste of time for bookies or their men to approach an Australian cricketer... Surely, they must be knowing that by now...         
	The cricketers informed long-serving manager Steve Bernard. The latter, in turn, kept the International Cricket Council (ICC)s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit in the loop.         
	Interestingly, James Sutherland, the CA chief executive, has already called for a worldwide probe into corruption in cricket, but one which is independent of the ICC.         
	His call has met with silence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Mexico coach talks tough
                                                                                                                       7                                      Mexico coach talks tough
                      
	Johannesburg: Javier Aguirres Mexico are dreaming of puncturing South Africas giant party when they take on the hosts in the opening match of the World Cup on Friday.         
	My team has come here to play football, not make friends and do some sightseeing, Aguirre told a heaving press room on Thursday in the confines of the enormous Soccer City stadium.         
	I dont think the team with more friends in the stadium will win the match, he said, speaking of the amazing show of patriotic support all over South Africa that has left Johannesburgs streets awash with noise and colour.         
	Ive also played one at home so I know exactly what it feels like. I think its going to be a beautiful party and were happy to be here. We want to play well and win the match, added the 51-year-old, who played in the 1986 tournament and was sent off in the quarter-final defeat on penalties to Germany.         
	Mexico have a poor record whenever they have featured in an opening game but Aguirre thinks his troops will fare better this time around.         
	Of course theres a lot of emotion playing the opening game but once you overcome all the butterflies in your stomach Im sure Mexico will play very well.         
	Our philosophy is to always make good use of the ball, forward Carlos Vela said. With that in mind, I think that (coach) Javier Aguirre has called up the right kind of players: ones who are quick and comfortable on the ball.

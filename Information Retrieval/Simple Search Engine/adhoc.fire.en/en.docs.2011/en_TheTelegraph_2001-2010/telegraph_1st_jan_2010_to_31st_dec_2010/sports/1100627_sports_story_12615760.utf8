	Pretoria: A brilliant David Villa scored one superb goal and laid on another as Spain beat 10-man Chile in a match that petered out into a pact of non-aggression to send both sides into the World Cup second round on Friday, as reported in Saturdays Late City edition.         
	Spain, having weathered early pressure from the Chileans, took the lead in the Group H decider when Villa curled a sublime ball into the empty net from 40 metres out on the left after goalkeeper Claudio Bravo had raced from his box to clear from Fernando Torres.         
	Villa, who took his tally to 41 in 61 internationals, laid on the second when he took a pass to the left from Andres Iniesta and pulled the ball back into the middle where the midfielder shot low past central defender Waldo Ponce and Bravo.

	New York: World No. 1 and top seed Rafael Nadal will launch his U.S. Open campaign against Russias Teymuraz Gabashvili after the singles draw for the last Grand Slam of the year was made at Flushing Meadows on Thursday.         
	Five-time champion and second seed Roger Federer was drawn to face Argentinas Brian Dabul ahead of a tricky path to a seventh straight final.         
	The Swiss master could meet former champion Lleyton Hewitt in the third round, Swedens Robin Soderling in the quarter-finals and Serbias Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals.         
	Djokovic, the 2007 US Open runner-up and 2008 Australian Open champion, faces his countryman Viktor Troicki first up.         
	Britains Andy Murray, a runner-up in New York two years ago and in Australia earlier this season, is in the same half of the draw as Nadal. Murrays first opponent is Slovakias Lukas Lacko.         
	Denmarks Caroline Wozniacki, who was promoted to top seed in the womens draw after world number one Serena Williams withdrew because of injury, will begin her bid for a first Grand Slam title against American wildcard Chelsey Gullickson.         
	Wozniacki, who was runner-up in New York last year, faces a tantalising fourth-round showdown with Russias former champion Maria Sharapova while Serbias Jelena Jankovic looms as a possible semi-final opponent in the top half of the draw.         
	Jankovics first round match is against Romanias Simona Halep.         
	Last years womens champion, Belgian Kim Clijsters, will start her title defence against Hungarian Greta Arn.         
	The second seed could meet Australias French Open finalist Samantha Stosur in the quarter finals and possibly Venus Williams, a two-time US Open champion, in the semi-finals after the American was drawn to play Italian Roberta Vinci first up.

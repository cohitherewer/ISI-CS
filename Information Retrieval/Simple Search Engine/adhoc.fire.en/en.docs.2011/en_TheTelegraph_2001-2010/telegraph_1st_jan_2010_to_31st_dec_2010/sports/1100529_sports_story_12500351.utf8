	Roseau: AB de Villiers struck 70 off 80 balls Friday but the West Indies bowlers produced a disciplined performance to limit South Africa to 224 all out in 47.2 overs in their third one-day cricket international.         
	Kieron Pollard claimed 3-27 while fellow medium pacer Dwayne Bravo (2-40) and left-arm spinner Sulieman Benn (2-43) also stood out.         
	After winning the toss South Africa got another enterprising start from openers Graeme Smith and Hashim Amla, who added 53 inside the first ten overs.         
	The in-form Amla stroked five fours in a total of 34 from 28 balls before he edged a cut at Benn. Smith was the first scalp for Bravo, leg before after compiling 29 off 41 deliveries. Benn added the prized scalp of Jacques Kallis (31), who slashed a cut to backward point at 113-3.         
	De Villiers and Alviro Petersen shared a stand of 40 for the fourth wicket before Petersen fell to spark a sharp decline. Petersen (16), trying to dab to third man, dragged on to his stumps at 153-4.         
	Johan Botha, forced to retire hurt by Ravi Rampaul after a ball squeezed through the grille of his helmet from a bouncer, scored 18 off 25 balls toward the end.           (AGENCIES)

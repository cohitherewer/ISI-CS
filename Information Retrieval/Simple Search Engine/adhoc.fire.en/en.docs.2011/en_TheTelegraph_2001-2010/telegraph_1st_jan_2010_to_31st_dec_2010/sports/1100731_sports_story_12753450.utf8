The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Sports | Sachin out-thinks rival captains, says Arjuna 
                                                                                                                       7                                        Sachin out-thinks rival captains, says Arjuna 
    - Im not surprised by Rainas success             LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI      A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL            Arjuna Ranatunga                                 
	Colombo: Arjuna Ranatunga, the 1996 World Cup-winning captain and a former chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket, spoke to The Telegraph at his office, some distance away from the centre of the city, on Friday afternoon.         
	A third-term Member of Parliament, albeit from a new constituency this time, Ranatunga talked about the top three run-getters for India in the drawn second Test, Sri Lankas attack and the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) wicket, which couldve straightaway hosted another five-day game.               
	The following are excerpts           
	On Sachin Tendulkar (203)  
	I cant recall the first time that I played against Sachin, but I do remember telling myself that the boy would have a long career and be a threat to every opposition... His commitment has been remarkable and its so nice that he values Test cricket so highly... Hes been taking a break from ODIs, but doesnt miss Tests... Sachins USP is his ability to (a) quickly learn from mistakes and (b) out-think rival captains. Thats the hallmark of a truly great player... He outsmarted me a few times... Because hes so sound technically, he has it in him to play Test cricket for as long as he wants. Im not sure about the ODIs and he may retire from that form after the (2011) World Cup. On a personal note, Id say hes as humble and simple as he was some 20 years ago. I have nothing but admiration for him.         
	On Suresh Raina (120 on debut)         
	Im not surprised that he got such a fine hundred on his Test debut... Not surprised by his success... In fact, a few years ago, Id written that Gautam Gambhir and Raina would be Indias players of the future... Im a little disappointed with Gambhir, but Raina has translated his hunger into something very special... His commitment is good and you can see that even at nets... Clearly, he looks set for big things.         
	On Virender Sehwag (99)         
	Whats there to say? Sehwag lives and dies by the sword... Tillekaratne Dilshan is like him... Theres no point asking either of them to tighten their defence. They wont play forward defensive strokes.         
	On Sri Lankas bowling         
	Weak, with no Murali (Muttiah Muralidharan) and (Lasith) Malinga... Its a matter of concern... Defensive fields just dont help and Im surprised that Sanga (captain Kumar Sangakkara) started with fielders in deep positions, despite having 642 on the board.         
	Finally, on the SSC wicket         
	(Shakes his head) Its pointless having such wickets... In my time, at the same ground, we were able to bowl out the opposition twice... Thats not happening now... Surfaces should be such to help the home team win... For that, 20 wickets have to be taken, but that wont happen if the bowlers are asked to deliver on surfaces such as the one used at the SSC... If everything is so batsman friendly, then why would youngsters become bowlers? We could actually face a serious issue. Theres no need to protect batsmen... And, why would bowlers sweat it out for days on end (in a Test) if they have the option of easy money from the IPL? Certain things need to be addressed quickly.
